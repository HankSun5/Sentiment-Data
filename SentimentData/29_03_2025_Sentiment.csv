According to reports from the Khaleej Times , the CBDC will feature high security, tokenization, and smart contract integration, enabling instant settlements and multi-party transactions.

Additionally, the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has developed an integrated Digital Dirham platform and wallet, enabling retail, wholesale, and cross-border transactions. Stablecoin Adoption in the UAE The UAE’s journey toward a digital currency began in June 2024 with the rollout of a stablecoin regulatory framework , establishing licensing guidelines for Dirham-backed stablecoins . This triggered several major initiatives, including a push from Tether to issue an AED-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. On February 24, Circle received official authorization from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to recognize and operate stablecoins, USDC and EURC, within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). However, as a sovereign-backed digital currency, the Digital Dirham stands to provide a higher level of security, regulatory oversight, and monetary authority than privately issued tokens. CBUAE governor Khaled Mohamed Balama claims the initiative will “substantially enhance financial stability, inclusion, resilience, and combatting financial crime” Long term, Blamam anticipates that Digital Dirham will “enable the development of innovative digital products, services, and new business models while reducing cost and increasing access to international markets.” A CBDC stands to see considerable adoption in the UAE, ranking first among the world’s “most crypto-obsessed countries” in 2025 , with a crypto ownership rate of 25.3%. Global Push for CBDCs The UAE is currently in the testing phase of its Digital Dirham, joining 43 other countries running pilot programs for their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Most notably, the European Central Bank is conducting a multi-year trial of the Digital Euro . Countries’ progress towards CBDCs. Source: CBDC Tracker . The UK is on track to establish its own regulatory framework for stablecoins by 2026, as outlined in a crypto roadmap published by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Most recently, US lawmakers proposed the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act on March 26 to advance stablecoin regulation.

Representatives of the London-based algorithmic market maker requested a meeting with the SEC Crypto Task Force on March 12, and got it on March 28. The request came through a letter from Morrison Cohen LLP’s crypto partner Jason Gottlieb to the task force chair Hester Peirce. The SEC did not specify who was in attendance from Wintermute’s side, but the request said that co-founders Evgeny Gaevoy and Marina Gurevich would be available in Washington on the day the meeting was held. The letter had a clearcut agenda England-based Wintermute’s letter referenced Peirce’s request for information (RFI) titled “There Must Be Some Way Out of Here” with irony, saying that many non-U.S. companies are looking for a way in. Wintermute observed: “To date, Wintermute has avoided opening an office in the United States, primarily out of fear of the previous administration’s arbitrary and capricious enforcement regime, but also because the rules and regulations for liquidity provision in the United States were incredibly unclear, leaving good actors outside the U.S. reticent to enter the U.S. markets.” Gaevoy disclosed plans in a Bloomberg interview in February for Wintermute would open a U.S. office. The SEC acknowledged that Wintermute’s questions were discussed in the meeting between them, but it did not disclose the results of those discussions. The letter suggested a ten-point agenda for the meeting that addressed four of Peirce’s questions in her RFI, jurisdictional issues, market-making best practices and “How the Commission can advance these best practices within the scope of its statutory remit.” The SEC is changing So, the sides presumably spoke about determining the security status of crypto assets, trading and market structure challenges to providing liquidity to tokenized securities, order execution obligations and monitoring crypto markets using open-source data. Furthermore, the letter wanted the sides to address why the definition of dealer in the 1934 Exchange Act does not apply to liquidity providers in crypto and whether the SEC has the authority to challenge market manipulation. The firm watched the SEC suit against Cumberland DRW closely, the letter said. That firm was sued for allegedly selling unregistered securities. The definition of a dealer was one of the points the SEC used in that case. The suit was filed in October and dismissed on March 4. Cumberland claimed that it had been in talks with the SEC for five years when the suit was filed. Peirce’s RFI/statement “There Must Be Some Way Out of Here” was released on Feb. 25 and posed 48 questions across ten topics. “Greater crypto clarity requires the public’s input,” Peirce wrote. The task force itself was announced on Jan. 21 to help the commission with registration, regulation, disclosure and similar issues. “To date, the SEC has relied primarily on enforcement actions to regulate crypto retroactively and reactively,” the agency admitted in the announcement of the new task force. Acting chair of the SEC Mark Uyeda has promised to change the SEC’s methods, after the industry claimed for years that it was being treated unfairly and arbitrarily by the agency.

42556063,https://cryptonews.com/?p=345950,1743202784,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/42556063.jpeg,Telegram Embraces Pi Network – Can It Reverse the Downtrend?,https://cryptonews.com/news/telegram-embraces-pi-network-can-it-reverse-the-downtrend/,"Pi has gone up by nearly 1% and it is currently defying the market’s overall downturn after the token was integrated with the official crypto wallet of the instant messaging platform Telegram. This could be a pivotal moment for this blockchain project as PI will now be easily accessible to Telegram’s 1 billion monthly active users (MAUs). The Pi community expects that, once the market regains its strength, this announcement could help reverse the downtrend that PI has experienced since its mainnet became publicly accessible in February this year. However, top crypto exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Coinbase have refused to list the token as Pi has failed to pass their requirements for layer-one blockchains. Since the public mainnet went live, the market value of the project has dropped by two-thirds from its peak of around $18 billion. However, Pi is still the 24th largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $5.6 billion. PI Stalls as Telegram Support News Fails to Excite the Market The hourly chart shows that Pi sellers took a breather yesterday and managed to push the price above its upper trend line. However, the market quickly rejected that move once it hit the $0.90 level and it has already dropped by nearly 8% from that level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits below the signal line, indicating that bears still have the upper hand despite a recent uptick in Pi’s price. Additionally, the price has formed a lower high at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, suggesting the recent rally may be losing steam and that another drop could be on the horizon. However, the MACD tells a different story—negative momentum has been steadily fading, hinting that a potential shift in sentiment may be underway. Given these conflicting indicators, traders will need to wait for a clearer signal before confirming whether Pi’s price will continue higher or resume its downtrend. The key resistance to watch remains at $0.87; a decisive break above this level would suggest a continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, a drop below $0.81 would confirm a bearish reversal and could open the door for a retest of $0.70 in the near term. While Pi’s post-launch price action has been underwhelming, early traction from MIND of Pepe (MIND) during its presale suggests strong upside potential for the AI agent coin once it hits exchanges. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Raises $7.7M to Launch its Powerful AI Agent Just a month and a half after its presale event kicked off, MIND of Pepe (MIND) has managed to raise more than $7.7 million for its AI agent. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme, this AI agent will take over social media platforms like X by storm. MIND of Pepe is designed to engage in meaningful conversations with high-profile X accounts to discuss topics associated with meme coins and the crypto market. Throughout these interactions. MIND of Pepe will collect insightful information that it will pass on to token holders so they can better navigate these challenging market conditions and profit from the most appealing opportunities in the meme coin space. To invest in $MIND, simply head to the MIND of Pepe website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

Starting as a presale less than a year ago, it has quickly become a leading decentralized Layer 1 project. With $208 million secured in under 10 months without venture capital support, BlockDAG’s swift ascent is grounded not only in excitement but also in reliability, consistent outcomes, and a flawlessly executed roadmap. With the mainnet launch approaching and a community approaching one million, BlockDAG is delivering on its commitments and setting new standards for what early supporters of cryptocurrency initiatives can anticipate. The Presale That Caught Everyone’s Eye BlockDAG’s presale was more than just funding—it was a revolution. The project gained early traction by shunning venture capital influence and unclear promises, presenting a clear and achievable vision instead. At a time when many crypto projects promise more than they deliver, BlockDAG has changed the narrative. This approach drew an enthusiastic response, enabling a swift raise of $208 million. This funding was not just money—it represented a global endorsement of BlockDAG’s vision for a scalable, secure, and decentralized future. As CEO Antony Turner stated, “This funding is not just money—it’s the driving force behind innovation, growth, and the next wave of blockchain technology.” Indeed, these resources have been pivotal in developing a solid infrastructure, including core protocol development, team expansion, and forming major partnerships with entities like Inter Milan and UFC. Each step demonstrates BlockDAG’s commitment to enduring, impactful change in the blockchain domain. Groundbreaking Technology in Action BlockDAG stands out not merely for its fundraising or its buzz but for its groundbreaking technology. From its inception, the team has adopted a hybrid architecture that combines the rapidity and scalability of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the robust security and decentralization features of Proof-of-Work (PoW). CTO Jeremy Harkness highlighted, “Our hybrid consensus mechanism merges the best of both domains… we are essentially rewriting the playbook.” This fusion facilitates concurrent transaction processing, significantly lowering fees and easing network congestion while ensuring top-tier security. Moreover, BlockDAG has focused on making its technology accessible to all. The introduction of the X1 Miner App and the TG Tap Miner Game has welcomed over a million newcomers to the ecosystem, including many who had never before engaged with cryptocurrency. Mining has shifted from a niche activity for technological insiders to an accessible tap-and-earn model available via Telegram and mobile devices. This approach to user engagement through gaming has transformed the scene—over 400,000 users engage with TG Tap Miner daily, and upwards of 750,000 utilize the X1 App for mining. BlockDAG demonstrates that involvement in the crypto world isn’t limited to developers or traditional miners. The advancements continue beyond mere applications and technological features. The Beta Testnet V1 has been launched, delivering enhanced performance, improved explorers, and even tools that allow users to create tokens and NFTs without coding skills. This isn’t just a demonstration; it’s an interactive platform where users can experiment with genuine features before the mainnet launch, complete with weekly incentives. Additionally, the initial batches of BlockDAG’s ASIC hardware miners—the X30 and X100 —are being distributed to early users, with expectations to deploy nearly 10,000 units before the mainnet’s official release. This represents real progress, not just promises. Precision and Trust Shape the Future As BlockDAG approaches its mainnet debut later this year, the excitement is palpable. The initial launch will support at least 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), with plans to expand capacity to 15,000 TPS post-launch. From the outset, it will offer DeFi applications including staking, lending, swaps, and cross-chain bridges, complemented by governance tools that enhance community involvement. Yet, this is merely the start. The vision for BlockDAG extends beyond the initial launch. Efforts are underway to cultivate a robust developer community through initiatives like grants, worldwide hackathons, and a forthcoming bug bounty program. The BlockDAG Academy is equipping a new generation of Web3 developers, offering courses that cover everything from basic principles to complex smart contract programming. Aiming to support over 1,000 decentralized applications by 2026 in diverse fields such as finance, gaming, identity, and healthcare, BlockDAG is committed to sustained growth. Security is also a critical focus. The blockchain has been rigorously audited by both Certik and Halborn, and its architecture incorporates Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and DAG-based parallel processing to guarantee robustness and continuous service. As Chief Security Officer Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj puts it, “Security is not just a feature—it is the foundation of our entire platform.” From Vision to Reality in a Single Year BlockDAG’s evolution from an under-the-radar presale to a soon-to-launch mainnet leader showcases the power of reliable execution. In an industry often mired in empty promises and speculation, BlockDAG has chosen a path of integrity—consistently developing, delivering, and expanding. Featuring a novel hybrid DAG + PoW architecture, comprehensive adoption tools, and educational initiatives, it’s evident that BlockDAG is not just riding the crypto trend. It is actively forging the future of decentralized systems. With the mainnet release imminent, BlockDAG has already demonstrated that it’s not merely dreaming of what’s next—it’s actively constructing it.

This surging confidence signals a seismic shift in the XRP landscape, amplifying anticipation within digital asset markets. XRP ETF Speculation Heats Up As Regulatory Landscape Evolves The crypto market is buzzing with anticipation as Polymarket bettors have assigned an 85% probability to approving an XRP ETF in 2025. If these market predictions hold, this could mark a transformative moment for XRP , opening the floodgates for institutional capital and reshaping its role in the broader financial ecosystem. The Polymarket bettors’ growing confidence in an XRP ETF approval follows the success of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have significantly boosted liquidity and institutional participation in the crypto space. As regulatory clarity around digital assets improves, many analysts believe that altcoins like XRP could be next in line for ETF approval. Given its unique positioning as a bridge currency for cross-border payments and Ripple’s ongoing engagement with financial institutions, an XRP ETF could bring unprecedented exposure to the asset. A key factor driving Polymarket bettors’ speculation is the evolving regulatory landscape. Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC provided a clearer framework for XRP’s classification, reducing uncertainty around its legal status. If the SEC continues to approve ETFs beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , XRP is a strong contender, given its utility, liquidity, and market demand. An XRP ETF approval would have far-reaching implications for the token’s price and adoption. Institutional investors who have previously hesitated due to regulatory concerns may enter the market, increasing liquidity and potentially driving up prices. Moreover, a regulated XRP ETF would simplify access for mainstream investors, reinforcing its legitimacy as a digital asset.

XRP ETF Speculation Gains Momentum As Investors Eye WallitIQ (WLTQ) For High-Yield Opportunities Polymarket bettors continue to drive attention toward the XRP ETF narrative, fueling expectations for a 2025 approval. As regulatory winds shift, XRP finds itself at the epicenter of ETF speculation, with Polymarket bettors reinforcing bullish sentiment. The prospect of an XRP ETF remains a focal point for institutional players, signaling a potential market inflection.

As the story notes, Pepe has experienced some notable peaks in the past. Its entire market value was $1.6 billion in 2023. It reached an even greater $11 billion in December 2024. These whales may be feeling more confident as a result of their previous performance. More People Are Holding Pepe The number of people holding the meme coin has also gone up recently. Reports indicate that 542 new Pepe holders appeared in March 2025. While the number of people holding Pepe for a long time has decreased, the fact that new investors are coming in, combined with the whales’ buying activity, suggests there might be some renewed interest in the coin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Set For 10x Surge? Elon Musk’s Anime X Post Sparks Hype Some believe that this whale buying frenzy may be signaling that the price of Pepe may rise once more. They recall the way the price skyrocketed earlier, driven by internet hype. The only question is if this is just a temporary rise in price, or if Pepe may again experience a big spike like last time. It’s worth remembering that cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins such as Pepe, can be extremely volatile. What the big investors do may at times provide a clue as to where the market is heading, but it isn’t a promise. People need to exercise caution and carry out their own research before doing anything about buying or selling.

BlockDAG is changing that. With the introduction of the X1 Miner App and powerful ASIC miners like the X30 and X100, BlockDAG (BDAG) is democratizing profitable mining, making it fun and accessible for the average person. Whether you’re mining on your smartphone or using a user-friendly ASIC device at home, BlockDAG’s strategy is paving the way for widespread adoption in the cryptocurrency sphere. Welcome to the future of mining—effortless, social, and incredibly rewarding. Mobile Mining Made Easy with the X1 App At the core of BlockDAG’s mining revolution is the highly acclaimed X1 Miner App , which has attracted over 750,000 users globally. This app enables any smartphone to become a mining hub without consuming excessive battery or necessitating costly equipment. Featuring a gamified experience, daily rewards for engagement, and a straightforward interface, the X1 App eliminates the complexities that have traditionally barred ordinary people from mining. Antony Turner, the CEO of BlockDAG, highlighted the app’s impact during Keynote 3: “To date, we have over 750,000 users mining, earning, and engaging with us.” These figures are testament to the app’s success. By making mining a simple tap-and-earn activity accessible right from your pocket, BlockDAG has simplified the entry into the mining domain. More than just user-friendly—it’s about making financial engagement in blockchain technology available to those who were previously excluded. Whether you are a student, a stay-at-home parent, or just starting to explore, mining with BlockDAG is now as straightforward as using a fitness app or playing a game on your phone. TG Tap Miner on Telegram Transforms Mining into Social Gaming BlockDAG has revolutionized mining by blending it with social networking via TG Tap Miner , a play-to-earn game on Telegram that has quickly become a sensation. With over 400,000 registrations and 100,000 active players daily, TG Tap Miner combines fun with genuine rewards, turning mining into a shared and engaging pursuit. Instead of a lone, technical activity, BlockDAG has made mining a collective experience. Gamers mine virtual assets, complete tasks, and earn real BDAG coins, all within one of the most popular messaging apps. This approach shifts away from the traditional view of mining as an isolated operation with loud machines in secluded spaces. Now, it’s about fun, sharing, and integration into daily digital activities. BlockDAG is not merely adding a gaming layer to mining; it is transforming perceptions by melding enjoyment with economic opportunities, inviting newcomers without the need for deep technical knowledge or significant financial outlay. Unveiling the X30 & X100 ASIC Miners: High-Efficiency Mining Made Simple While focusing on mobile-driven growth, BlockDAG also caters to the dedicated users with the X30 and X100 ASIC miners. Designed specifically for BlockDAG’s hybrid consensus mechanism that merges a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with Proof-of-Work (PoW), these devices deliver top-tier performance suited to BlockDAG’s scalable system, supporting simultaneous block validations while maintaining network safety and decentralization. Antony Turner, during Keynote 3, revealed that nearly 10,000 ASIC miners are set to be distributed prior to the mainnet launch: “We have begun shipping our initial batch of miners to early adopters… By the time our mainnet is operational, we will have delivered around 10,000 ASIC miners to our community.” These units are built for energy efficiency and simplicity, allowing anyone to begin mining quickly after unboxing. This approach prioritizes accessibility, redefining the miner’s role in 2025. The X30 and X100 are not just equipment—they are gateways to a burgeoning ecosystem where all users can engage with and benefit from blockchain technology. Together with the mobile tools, these ASIC miners position BlockDAG as the only network providing a comprehensive mining experience for both casual users and dedicated enthusiasts. The New Era of Inclusive Mining with BlockDAG BlockDAG is demonstrating that crypto mining doesn’t need to be exclusive, costly, or complex. With the X1 Miner App and TG Tap Miner game lowering entry barriers for casual users, and the X30/X100 ASIC machines enabling high-performance mining at home, BlockDAG is establishing a diverse ecosystem accessible to all. By merging modern technology with user-friendliness, BlockDAG isn’t just participating in blockchain’s evolution—it’s leading it. As the mainnet launch nears and user adoption grows, it’s evident that BlockDAG is pushing mining into the mainstream, making the future of blockchain more inclusive than ever.

But this time, it’s not just about internet laughs and viral tweets—today’s leading meme coins are offering actual use cases, long-term plans, and economic models that reward holding. The game has changed, and the next wave of meme tokens is playing to win. One project that’s blazing ahead is Dragoin ($DDGN) . As others are still warming up, Dragoin is making serious progress through its structured presale, active community, and upcoming decentralization. If you’re on the hunt for the best long-term meme coin to buy in Q2 2025 , this one demands your attention. Alongside it, Cheems and MEMEX are also gaining traction, each with a different strategy for growth. Dragoin Is Gearing Up for a Major Q2 Breakout Dragoin isn’t following the typical meme coin script. It’s rewriting it. Built on Ethereum, Dragoin brings something rare to the space: a live, interactive game hosted directly on Telegram. Players hatch, train, and battle dragons—and earn $DDGN tokens while doing it. This isn’t just another hold-and-hope coin. It gets users involved from day one. And then there’s the presale: split across 25 phases, each with a small price bump, encouraging early buying while maintaining a steady pace. Half of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens are locked into this presale—and whatever doesn’t sell in each round gets permanently burned. This burn mechanic is huge. It reduces supply as demand grows, especially with the global game launch planned for Q2. While other meme coins flood the market with tokens, Dragoin is tightening the flow and building a loyal base—two forces that could drive long-term gains. Once the presale wraps up, Dragoin goes full community mode. The team will renounce control of the smart contract, leaving the project fully decentralized. That’s a big deal in a space where many tokens still operate with central oversight. With staking, referrals, airdrops, and big exchange listings lined up for Q2 and Q3, Dragoin has all the elements for a major run. It’s got the memes, the mechanics, and the market energy. This isn’t just hype—it’s built to fly. Cheems Tries a Comeback With Fresh Features Cheems has been around for a while—and it’s still got bite. The beloved “doge with a lisp” meme is now pivoting in a more purposeful direction. In Q2, Cheems is rolling out staking rewards and charitable partnerships aimed at giving it a more serious edge. What’s keeping it alive is the fan base. Through contests, community events, and creator tie-ins, Cheems still rallies its supporters. But the big question is whether nostalgia can carry it through this more competitive cycle. With investors demanding more than just memes, Cheems needs to show it can innovate. For now, it may offer quick upside—but its long-term power will depend on what comes next. MEMEX Offers an “All-in-One” Meme Investment MEMEX is doing something different—combining multiple meme coins into one token. Think of it as a meme coin index fund. For those who want exposure to the meme market without tracking every trend, MEMEX offers a simplified route. Its dynamic rebalancing and algorithmic tracking take the guesswork out of investing. You don’t have to jump from token to token—MEMEX does that for you. While it might not have the viral punch of Dragoin or the fan love of Cheems, it gives investors a balanced, lower-risk way to ride the meme wave. MEMEX is ideal for those who want in on the action but don’t want to bet everything on a single coin. Meme Coins With Real Utility Are Set to Dominate Q2 Q2 is shaping up to favor meme coins that actually do something. As the crypto market welcomes fresh liquidity and an influx of new users, tokens with built-in use cases, community control, and strong roadmaps are taking center stage. Dragoin checks every box. It’s got a presale that fuels excitement, a burn model that cuts supply, and a game that drives demand. It’s not asking you to just hold—it’s asking you to play, earn, and grow with it. Cheems is fighting to evolve, and MEMEX brings safety through diversification. But when it comes to the best long-term meme coin to buy in Q2 2025 , Dragoin is the frontrunner. The stages are filling fast, the game is coming soon, and the buzz is only growing louder. Get ready—Dragoin could be the meme coin breakout of the year.

The transaction was announced on Friday, and Elon posted on X that the two companies’ futures are now “intertwined.” The value of xAI in the deal was set at $80 billion, and both companies are now under the same structure. The move combines the infrastructure, user data, compute power, and software teams behind each business. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,” Elon wrote on Friday. “X is the digital town square where more than 600M active users go to find the real-time source of ground truth and, in the last two years, has been transformed into one of the most efficient companies in the world, positioning it to deliver scalable future growth.” Musk connects X and xAI to expand control The merger brings together two private companies that were already overlapping. Elon said the combination would “unlock immense potential” by joining xAI’s advanced AI capability with X’s massive reach. The two were already linked through Grok, the chatbot developed by xAI that’s available inside X. Elon bought Twitter for $44 billion at the end of 2022, after months of legal threats, court battles, and chaotic filings. He cut staff aggressively, scrapped content moderation systems, killed ad partnerships, and renamed the company X. He later brought in Linda Yaccarino, formerly an ad exec, as CEO. On Friday, Linda posted, “The future could not be brighter.” xAI was launched less than two years ago with a goal to “understand the true nature of the universe.” But the company’s real function has been trying to compete with OpenAI, the company Elon helped co-found in 2015. He left OpenAI after disagreements over its direction, and since then, has taken aim at CEO Sam Altman both online and in court. Grok, Colossus, and government power moves Since its launch, xAI has focused on large language models and generative AI tools. It has been positioning itself as a rival to OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and other companies with billion-dollar AI divisions. Grok, the chatbot Elon launched inside X, was developed by xAI and built using real-time access to X’s user data. Last year, xAI was valued at around $50 billion during a funding round. In early 2025, Bloomberg reported that the company was trying to raise money at a $75 billion valuation. For comparison, OpenAI was near closing a raise that would push its value to $260 billion, and rival Anthropic was just valued at $61.5 billion. While running Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and X, Elon has also taken up a new job in Washington with D.O.G.E after donating $270 million to Donald Trump and Republican campaigns during the 2024 election. This isn’t the first time Elon has merged two of his own companies. In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity, a solar company founded by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive, in a $2.6 billion deal. At the time, Elon was chairman of the board at both companies. Shareholders sued, accusing him of using Tesla’s money to save a failing company he was personally tied to. The case dragged on for years, with accusations that the SolarCity deal violated fiduciary duty and benefited Elon more than Tesla shareholders. But a Delaware court ruled in favor of Elon and let the deal go through without requiring him to pay anything back to Tesla. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Public forums and expert reviews may reshape enforcement methods. Lawmakers push for clearer guidelines on stablecoins and digital assets. Internal debates reveal evolving priorities in oversight. Global tax ideas could alter market behavior. U.S. crypto regulation developments accelerated this week as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scheduled new public roundtables and Congress introduced a stablecoin bill to address mounting calls for regulatory clarity. This edition of Weekly Crypto Regulation News Roundup also covers Ripple’s settlement with the SEC, a split vote on a high-profile enforcement case involving Elon Musk, and a proposal in the UK to tax crypto transactions. Here’s a breakdown of this week’s key developments. SEC to Host Four Additional Crypto Roundtables In a move toward increased public engagement, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force announced plans to host four additional public roundtables in Washington, D.C., this spring. U.S. lawmakers have introduced the STABLE Act, seeking to formalize stablecoin regulation with clearer transparency and oversight rules. Companion bills like the GENIUS Act also advance. #StablecoinRegulation #USCrypto https://t.co/W9S9aN51T5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 27, 2025 The initiative seeks to collect industry input on digital asset regulation and promote more transparent dialogue between regulators and crypto stakeholders. The decision follows criticism that the SEC has leaned too heavily on enforcement actions without providing clear compliance guidance. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda, who formed the Crypto Task Force in January, stated that the agency intends to “draw clear regulatory lines, provide realistic paths to registration, craft sensible disclosure frameworks, and deploy enforcement resources judiciously.” The scheduled roundtables indicate the SEC could be shifting toward a more collaborative approach to crypto oversight, a notable change from its previous enforcement-first posture. SEC Launches Crypto 2.0 Task Force for Enhanced Oversight Alongside its public outreach, the SEC also introduced a new enforcement initiative: Crypto 2.0. SEC’s Crypto 2.0 Task Force targets on-chain and off-chain transactions, aiming to enforce compliance and protect investors in the digital asset space. #CryptoRegulation #SEC https://t.co/0aH1lqLZc1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 24, 2025 This effort includes the formation of a Presidential Task Force on Cryptocurrency, which seeks to increase oversight of both on-chain and off-chain digital asset transactions. A central focus is to apply the same trade reporting standards used in traditional securities to crypto activity, particularly off-chain trades. To support this, the SEC is building a Digital Asset Reporting and Tracking System (DART) to monitor crypto transactions across various platforms. By improving transparency in digital asset ownership and boosting compliance, the agency appears to be strengthening its position on regulating the sector. While the SEC sharpened its focus on digital asset enforcement, Congress also moved forward on the legislative front. Stablecoin Rules Advance as Congress Introduces STABLE Act On March 26, Representatives Bryan Steil and French Hill brought forward the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act. U.S. lawmakers have introduced the STABLE Act, seeking to formalize stablecoin regulation with clearer transparency and oversight rules. Companion bills like the GENIUS Act also advance. #StablecoinRegulation #USCrypto https://t.co/W9S9aN51T5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 27, 2025 The bill would create a clear regulatory framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, requiring issuers to follow strict financial rules, maintain transparent records, and uphold consumer protections. This push comes amid heightened scrutiny over the systemic risks of unregulated stablecoins. With stablecoins playing a role in payments and remittances, lawmakers are emphasizing the need for oversight to reduce financial instability. The bipartisan support behind the STABLE Act suggests it could become a foundation for broader digital asset legislation. Ripple Settlement and SEC Division Mark Key Enforcement Shifts In related crypto regulation news, Ripple reached a settlement with the SEC , ending a years-long legal dispute. @Ripple settles with the @SECGov , agreeing to pay a $50M penalty and dropping its cross-appeal, marking the near conclusion of a long-standing lawsuit. #SEC #Crypto #Ripple https://t.co/txqDDCnn0G — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 25, 2025 The company agreed to pay a $50 million penalty and will withdraw its cross-appeal in the ongoing XRP lawsuit. Originally facing a $125 million penalty, Ripple’s reduced fine marks a more favorable outcome. The SEC also intends to lift an injunction blocking Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors, signaling that the case may soon conclude. Meanwhile, in a separate high-profile matter, Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda was reportedly the only commissioner to vote against suing Elon Musk over delayed disclosures related to stock purchases in X. Acting Chair of the SEC, Mark Uyeda, allegedly was the only commissioner who voted against suing Elon Musk earlier this month. #MarkUyeda #ElonMusk https://t.co/FynEouEeRv — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 24, 2025 According to a Reuters report, the SEC’s five-member commission held a closed-door vote, with four commissioners supporting legal action. Uyeda’s dissent highlights internal divisions within the agency and may reflect a broader shift toward a more measured enforcement strategy—especially as Uyeda continues reshaping the SEC’s crypto oversight policies. UK Considers Stamp Duty on Crypto Transactions Outside the U.S., regulatory discussions also continued in the United Kingdom. Lisa Gordon, Chair of UK investment bank Cavendish, suggested that a stamp duty be applied to cryptocurrency transactions. Gordon, who has held non-executive roles at major financial institutions, warned that the increase in crypto investments among British citizens raised concerns. She argued that taxing crypto trades could help direct retail investment toward shares and other traditional assets. The suggestion comes as the UK government continues shaping its crypto regulatory framework and could influence future digital asset tax policy. With global regulators taking new steps, the coming months will shape how digital asset policies develop.

He is also open to negotiations that could potentially reduce the new taxes planned for next week, yet he does not expect deals before April 2. Trump told reporters , “I’m certainly open to that, if we can do something, we can get something for it,” Still, he warned that any agreement would happen “probably after” the tariffs take effect, adding that the United States has “been taken advantage of for 40 years, maybe more.” Trump plans to unveil his reciprocal tariff program on Wednesday. He says it will include strong measures to match other countries’ trade barriers and boost U.S. manufacturing. S Specific details remain unclear, with conflicting statements on whether the new tariffs will replace or add to existing taxes on targeted goods. This week, he announced a 25 percent duty on automobiles on top of any country-specific levies. The president suggested that pharmaceutical imports would be next. “It’ll be a certain number that will be enough to get the drugs and the pharmaceutical companies to bring in their product into our country. We never want to have to rely on other countries for that, like we did in Covid,” Trump said. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On-chain data shows a decrease in Bitcoin demand, with short-term holders experiencing losses while long-term holders take profits. GameStop follows Strategy's lead by adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves. BTC/USD is in a bearish trend, with key support levels around 82133, 80000, and 78197 and resistance levels at 88000, 90000, and 91804. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices had been enjoying a relatively calm week with modest gains before a selloff today that is threatening support at the 85000 handle. The recent optimism in the market has quickly disappeared as selling picks up again. Shaken by renewed market swings and economic uncertainty, many are selling their investments, which could extend the current market downturn. Is another period of tariff induced volatility ahead? Tuesday's K33 Research report, ""Ahead of the Curve,"" noted that the market is currently calm but could become more volatile as it reacts to new tariff announcements. The report says this calm might last until April 2, when the U.S. President Donald Trump is set to announce major reciprocal tariffs. This announcement could become a big market event, sparking activity in both crypto and traditional markets, similar to the big moves seen after Canadian and Mexican tariff news earlier this year. If Trump softens his approach, markets might go up. If he stays unclear, both buyers and sellers could face volatility. If he takes a tough stance, markets could drop sharply, like they have after past tariff announcements. BTC/USD vs Tariff Headlines Source: K33 Research “In a back-and-forth situation, the market could look like it did in February and early March, when tariffs were the main focus. The US economy is still strong but is expected to slow down because of tariffs — a risk that most economists have already factored in,” says an analyst from K33. On Wednesday, President Trump announced a 25% tariff on car imports starting April 3, along with the long-awaited tariffs on the US’ biggest trade partners. “If these countries retaliate, it could bring more uncertainty to an already unstable global trade situation,” says an analyst from QCP Capital. It will be interesting to gauge the reaction of crypto markets to tariffs imposed on April 2. One wonders whether the market will react in a similar vein as in the past. Other factors such as demand and supply might play a role as well. Glassnode - The week on-chain - Demand side wanes Demand is still fairly low right now, with Bitcoin's price moving up and down within a new trading range around $85k. One way to measure demand is by looking at the amount of profit and loss investors are locking in. This helps us understand the selling activity happening in spot markets. We can understand this through two main ideas: Capital Inflows: This happens when new money enters the market, with a buyer paying more for a coin than what the seller originally paid (creating a realized profit). Capital Destruction: This happens when someone sells at a loss (realized loss), and a new buyer gets the coin for less than its original price. This metric shows the difference between the price a seller is willing to accept and the price a buyer is willing to pay. Currently, the total realized profit and loss has dropped significantly since the $109k peak, falling from $3.4B to $508M (-85%). This is similar to levels seen during the 2024 accumulation phase when Bitcoin was between $50k and $70k (which is a good sign), indicating similar demand. Most of the losses are coming from Short-Term Holders, who are newer buyers and more likely to have bought at higher prices. The recent unpredictable and volatile market has been tough for these new investors. On the other hand, most of the profits are being taken by Long-Term Holders, who have been in the market longer and are still in a profitable position. Source: Glassnode Short-Term Holders are currently facing significant unrealized losses (paper losses), some of the largest in this cycle. However, these losses are still within the higher range of what’s been seen in most past bull markets. This means that while investors are feeling noticeable financial pressure, it’s not unusual or unexpected for a bull market trend. GameStop follows Strategy, Sayler approves This week, GameStop (GME), a US video game retailer, announced on Tuesday that it has updated its investment policy to include Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves. The following day, the company shared plans to raise $1.3 billion by offering senior convertible notes with 0% interest to private investors. GameStop is following the lead of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) or Strategy as they are now called, which recently bought 6,911 BTC for $584.1 million. Strategy now holds 506,137 BTC, purchased for $33.7 billion at an average price of $66,608 per Bitcoin, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. This move is part of a growing trend of companies adopting Bitcoin, encouraged by US President Donald Trump’s recent executive order to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve using government-held tokens. As of February 1, GameStop has $4.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. ETF flows Bitcoin ETF flows have remained steady since mid-March with spot Bitcoin ETFs having seen consistent inflows. Over the past two weeks inflows have reached nearly 1 billion dollars. This also comes as Gold ETF flows have recently surpassed Bitcoin ETF flows. To read more about this, read: Gold Price Outlook: ETF Flows, Central Bank Buying, and XAU/USD Price Targets . Is this the start of a broader market shift and risks continue to rise in global markets and money managers look to reduce risk exposure? Technical analysis - BTC/USD Bitcoin USD (BTC/USD) from a technical standpoint on the daily timeframe remains in a bearish trend. A daily candle close above the 90000 handle will be needed for a change in structure and this remains some distance away at present. As things stand, Bitcoin has slipped below the 200-day MA and the 85000 handle, if the daily candle closes below both it could signal further downside. Looking at the bigger picture and the longer the price remains within the range of 78000-90000 when a breakout finally occurs it could be an aggressive one. The fundamentals may still support further upside but the uncertainties presented by the geopolitical situation and tariff impact may continue to keep BTC/USD on the back foot.

Enter Qubetics (TICS), a fast-rising project positioned to disrupt how the internet works with decentralized virtual private network (dVPN) capabilities. At the heart of this movement is the ongoing Qubetics presale , which has been quietly gaining massive traction. Priced now at just $0.1300, with earlier phases already gone, the countdown is on. With every new stage comes a 10% price hike, and each stage only lasts seven days. This isn’t hype — it’s how markets work when demand rises and access tightens. Qubetics doesn’t just fit the mold of the Top Crypto Assets , it’s on track to redefine it. Qubetics dVPN Presale: Don’t Miss What You Missed Before Qubetics had a moment — and you probably missed it. In its earliest whitelist phase, the project offered zero-upfront investment opportunities. Those who signed up early received exclusive notifications and access to the presale at just $0.01. That phase is long gone, as are the early sub-$0.05 rounds. And yet, the door hasn’t closed. The project is now in its 27th presale stage with a price of $0.1300. Each round brings a 10% jump. But here’s the kicker — compared to future value projections, it’s still a bargain. For example, a $2,000 purchase of $TICS at $0.1300 nets about 15,384 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s $15,384 — a 669% return. At $5, it becomes $76,920, and at $10, an astounding $153,840. With projections up to $15 per token, that could become $230,760. This is why Qubetics is being flagged as the best crypto presale right now. But what makes Qubetics special isn’t just numbers. It’s the tech. The core feature setting it apart is the decentralized VPN (dVPN) network. In an age of rising data surveillance and government restrictions, privacy is no longer optional — it’s survival. Qubetics’ dVPN lets users across the globe bypass censorship, browse securely, and share bandwidth — all while earning rewards. Imagine a freelance journalist in a high-censorship region using Qubetics to access open-source content and communicate with peers safely. Or a remote team in a restricted country using Qubetics dVPN to ensure their project tools stay accessible, without compromise. For regular users, it’s the chance to control online privacy while monetizing unused internet bandwidth. For businesses, it’s a way to operate across borders securely. And for developers, the QubeQode IDE simplifies building on-chain apps with dVPN integration. The project is more than a presale — it’s a movement for secure, decentralized internet usage. The Qubetics mainnet is slated to launch in Q2 2025, adding a ticking clock to the opportunity. With over $15.5 million raised, 504 million tokens sold, and more than 23,900 token holders, this isn’t early anymore — but it’s not too late. Qubetics isn’t just one of the Top Crypto Assets , it’s the one that might erase the regret of every past crypto miss. Injective: The Missed ICO That Still Haunts Injective Protocol was one of those projects that slipped through the fingers of many who didn’t take the early signal seriously. When it first launched its ICO in late 2020, most were skeptical. The idea of a fully decentralized finance (DeFi) layer with cross-chain trading capabilities was ambitious — and maybe even ahead of its time. But Injective wasn’t just big talk. It delivered. Those who got in early watched as the protocol expanded rapidly. Backed by heavyweight names and offering zero gas fees, lightning-fast speeds, and a unique order book model, Injective quickly carved out its niche in the DeFi space. Projects started building on it. Data showed trading volumes rising. Use cases kept evolving, and price charts followed. And then came the regret. The kind that hits when it’s already too late. Many who dismissed Injective’s potential are still watching from the sidelines as the project continues to push forward. The ship didn’t just sail — it left the dock, hit top speed, and hasn’t looked back. Yet despite the growth, it serves as a reminder that the best time to move on a project is when it still looks early and undervalued. That’s why new names like Qubetics are turning heads — they’re not just promising, they’re still accessible. Injective taught a hard lesson. Don’t wait for a token to moon before recognizing its utility. That moment comes and goes in a blink. Instead, spotting projects with scalable, real-world solutions and early-stage pricing — like Qubetics — is the strategy seasoned participants now pursue. The Injective ICO is over. But the Qubetics presale is still open. Conclusion: Make the Move Before It’s Another “Could Have” Missing Injective was painful for many, but the lesson wasn’t wasted. Today, Qubetics offers that elusive second chance. The project is real, the use case is urgent, and the window is still open. The Qubetics presale, now in stage 27, is an early adopter’s opportunity that combines accessible pricing with powerful upside. With the mainnet just months away, and the decentralized VPN narrative heating up globally, hesitation might just cost more than before. Among the top crypto assets to watch in 2025, Qubetics has not only earned its place — it’s claiming it with authority. The numbers speak for themselves, and the application speaks for the future of internet freedom. Those still waiting are likely the same ones who missed Binance, missed Injective, and are on track to miss this. Don’t let this be another regret. Time is ticking. Join this crypto presale before the price jumps again — because the next phase is never as cheap as this one.

However, Bitcoin’s price is trading down from its peak price above $109,000, raising concerns about whether the firm should pursue more buys. While price fluctuations are common, Strategy’s average acquisition price has jumped to $66,000, and the firm still relies on equities and convertible notes to make purchases. Some analysts even hinted that the firm could just be one moderate token price fall away from trouble. Thompson argues that Strategy may not have to sell Bitcoin to add more collateral Strategy raised billions through equity sales and convertible debt to buy most of its BTC holdings. However, in its most recent purchases, the company opted to raise funds through preferred stock, a type of equity offering investors dividends. However, the company’s growing debt and aggressive token purchases have some analysts wondering about its fate. Contrary to some, Quincy Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, argued that it’s very unlikely for Stategy to find itself in a situation where it has to sell its BTC holdings to give lenders more collateral in case of a drastic price drop. He explained that the firm would likely refinance debt for convertible notes instead of paying them off immediately, and in the case of preferred stock, they don’t have to repay any part of it. Since the firm has not listed its Bitcoin holdings for its loans, it’s less likely to end up like failed crypto firms and projects such as Genesis and Three Arrows Capital. Nevertheless, Strategy still needs to be careful that it does not issue more equity than the market can handle. Thompson argued similarly, saying that if the firm cannot pay dividends with its cash flow, it could be forced to issue more shares, which would ultimately affect the stock price. He added, “But it’s no different than what he’s doing already. Every time the retail bids it up, he wrecks the stock price by issuing more shares. In the future, he will have to do that, and the flows might not go into Bitcoin. They might go to repay these debtors, and it will hurt the share price.” Thompson says Strategy may need to issue more shares to settle the due interests The Bitcoin-focused company also needs to pay 8% dividends on STRK, 10% dividends on STRF, and a 0.4% interest rate on its convertible bonds. Meanwhile, the firm’s software business is bringing in few returns, so the company could struggle to pay off the dividends. According to Thompson, Strategy should continue issuing MSTR stock to pay all the pending interest. He even claimed the stock could trade at a discount to avoid having to issue more shares. However, he did warn that if the discount would grow to 20% or 30%, shareholders would most likely ask for the discount closure. He even suggested that to increase shareholder value, the number one option would be to sell Bitcoin and buy stock. He also touched on the company’s issues with its ETFs, saying they have been “obliterated”. Surprisingly, these ETFs are still in high demand despite the stock’s losses. Moreover, the popularity of ETFs has only helped aggravate constant buying pressure for MSTR. Though widely amazed by ETFs’ potential and importance, Thompson believes they are unreliable when making 10-year predictions of the asset’s price. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The relocation follows unsanctioned media actions and evolving legal filings. Changes may affect his interaction with legal teams and appeal tactics. Authorities appear to use the case to reassess custody oversight practices. Disgraced FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried has been moved out of New York federal prison after spending nearly two years behind bars in the Big Apple, federal prison records show. SBF Transferred Out Of NYC According to prison records , Bankman-Fried has been transported from Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, OK. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that guards awoke Bankman-Fried at 3 a.m. on Wednesday before he was transferred to the holding facility. While no specific reason was given for Bankman-Fried’s transfer, the one-time “king of crypto” had been sent to solitary confinement earlier this month from an unauthorized interview with Tucker Carlson. Sam Bankman-Fried just did an interview behind bars at MDC Brooklyn where he shared a unit with P Diddy. pic.twitter.com/FWfJ9QAxh2 — Tiffany Fong (@TiffanyFong_) March 6, 2025 The FTX founder has been in prison since August 2023 when Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his bail after he leaked excerpts of his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison’s diary to the New York Times, citing potential witness tampering. The former Alameda Research CEO, who was in an on-again off-again relationship with Bankman-Fried until early 2022, was largely considered the prosecution’s star witness against the crypto kingpin. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all charges in November of 2023 for orchestrating the massive crypto scheme that saw investors drained of over $8 billion. SBF Associates Face The Music Bankman-Fried was ultimately sentenced to 25 years behind bars and subsequently ordered to pay an over $11 billion fine. “He knew it was wrong,” Kaplan said during Bankman-Fried’s sentencing in March 2024. “He knew it was criminal. He regrets making a bad bet against the likelihood of getting caught – and he’s not going to admit a thing.” Meanwhile, Ellison was sentenced to two years in federal prison for her role in the crypto exchange’s collapse . FTX co-founder Gary Wang and the exchange’s director of engineering Nishad Singh both were sentenced to time served by Kaplan, effectively avoiding jail time altogether. All three cooperated with the federal government in hopes of getting a lesser sentence and testified against their one-time boss. It is unclear where Bankman-Fried is being transferred, though it looks like his future facility will be much closer to his hometown of Stanford, CA.

If you’re holding Maple Finance’s MPL token on Coinbase, you need to pay close attention. Coinbase Exchange has just dropped a bombshell announcement via X (formerly Twitter): they will not be supporting the migration of MPL to the new SYRUP token. This means if you want to keep your assets safe and sound, you’ve got a crucial task on your to-do list before April 30th. Why is Coinbase Not Supporting the MPL to SYRUP Migration? Coinbase’s decision might leave some users scratching their heads. While they haven’t explicitly detailed the reasons behind this move, it’s not uncommon for exchanges to selectively support token migrations based on various factors. These can include technical complexities, regulatory considerations, or simply strategic business decisions. For MPL holders who prefer the convenience of centralized exchanges, this news definitely throws a wrench in the works. According to Coinbase’s official announcement on X, the message is clear and concise: “Coinbase Exchange will not support the Maple Finance (MPL) to SYRUP token migration. MPL holders must convert their MPL to SYRUP by April 30, 2024, via Maple’s official portal or a self-custodial wallet (e.g. Coinbase Wallet). Failure to migrate may result in asset loss.” Let’s break down what this urgent announcement really means for you, especially if you’re holding MPL on Coinbase. Understanding the MPL to SYRUP Migration: What’s the Buzz? So, what exactly is this MPL to SYRUP migration all about? Maple Finance, a decentralized corporate credit marketplace, is upgrading its token from MPL to SYRUP. This isn’t just a cosmetic change; it’s a significant upgrade aimed at enhancing the utility and functionality of the token within the Maple ecosystem. Token migrations are a fairly common occurrence in the crypto world, often undertaken to improve tokenomics, security, or to introduce new features. Think of it like upgrading your software to a newer, more efficient version. In this case, SYRUP is designed to be a more potent and versatile token compared to MPL. Maple Finance likely believes this upgrade will benefit their community in the long run by fostering a stronger and more dynamic ecosystem. Here’s a simplified look at why such migrations happen: Enhanced Functionality: New tokens can introduce improved features, governance mechanisms, or utility within the platform. Tokenomics Upgrade: Migrations can be used to adjust token supply, distribution models, or incentive structures for better economic alignment. Technological Advancements: Sometimes, a migration is necessary to leverage newer blockchain technologies or address limitations in the older token structure. Maple Finance’s Mandate: Migrate or Risk Crypto Asset Loss Now, let’s get to the crucial part: crypto asset loss . Coinbase’s announcement explicitly warns about the potential for asset loss if MPL holders fail to migrate. This isn’t just a scare tactic; it’s a real risk. After the April 30th deadline, the MPL token will likely become obsolete within the Maple Finance ecosystem. Maple Finance has provided clear instructions for users to migrate their MPL tokens. You have two primary pathways: Maple’s Official Portal: This is the direct route recommended by Maple Finance. You’ll need to connect your wallet to their portal and follow the migration steps. This is generally the most straightforward method if you are comfortable using DeFi platforms. Self-Custodial Wallet (e.g., Coinbase Wallet): Even though Coinbase Exchange isn’t supporting the migration directly, Coinbase Wallet (a separate self-custodial wallet) can be used. This option gives you full control over your private keys and allows you to interact with decentralized applications like Maple’s migration portal. Other self-custodial wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc., would also work. Key Dates and Actions: Action Deadline Method Migrate MPL to SYRUP April 30, 2024 Maple’s Official Portal or Self-Custodial Wallet Coinbase Exchange Support for MPL to SYRUP None Not Supported Potential Consequence of Inaction After April 30, 2024 Asset Loss (MPL tokens may become unusable) Step-by-Step Guide: Navigating Your Token Migration Feeling a bit overwhelmed? Don’t worry, migrating your tokens isn’t rocket science. Here’s a simplified step-by-step guide to help you through the process: Identify Your MPL Holdings: First, confirm where your MPL tokens are held. If they are on Coinbase Exchange, you’ll need to withdraw them to a self-custodial wallet like Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask. Choose Your Migration Method: Decide whether you’ll use Maple’s official portal or connect via a self-custodial wallet. For most users, Maple’s portal is likely the easiest route. Visit Maple Finance’s Migration Portal: Go to the official migration portal provided by Maple Finance. Always double-check the URL to ensure you are on the legitimate site and avoid phishing scams. Connect Your Wallet: Connect the wallet holding your MPL tokens to the migration portal. Follow the instructions to authorize the connection. Initiate the Migration: Within the portal, you should find clear instructions on how to swap your MPL for SYRUP. Typically, this involves approving a transaction and confirming the swap. Verify the Migration: After the transaction is confirmed, check your wallet to ensure you have received the SYRUP tokens and that your MPL balance has been reduced accordingly. Don’t Delay: Time is Running Out for MPL Holders! The clock is ticking! With the April 30th deadline looming, MPL holders on Coinbase need to act swiftly. Procrastination could lead to the unfortunate scenario of asset loss , and nobody wants that. Take a few minutes today to understand the migration process and plan your next steps. While Coinbase’s decision might seem inconvenient, remember that navigating the crypto space often requires users to be proactive and adaptable. Token migrations are part of the evolving nature of blockchain projects, and staying informed is key to safeguarding your investments. Key Takeaways for Navigating Token Migrations in Crypto This situation with token migration highlights some important lessons for all crypto users: Stay Informed: Regularly check official announcements from exchanges and project teams regarding your holdings. Social media platforms like X, project websites, and official blogs are crucial sources of information. Understand Token Migration Risks: Be aware that token migrations are sometimes necessary but always come with deadlines. Failing to act can indeed result in losing access to your assets. Embrace Self-Custody: While centralized exchanges offer convenience, self-custodial wallets provide greater control and flexibility, especially when dealing with token migrations or interacting with DeFi platforms. Act Promptly: When a token migration is announced, don’t delay. Understand the process, set reminders, and complete the migration well before the deadline to avoid any last-minute hassles or potential issues. In Conclusion: Secure Your Assets – Migrate MPL to SYRUP Now! The message is loud and clear: if you hold MPL tokens and want to transition to SYRUP, you need to take action before April 30th. Coinbase Exchange won’t be handling the migration for you, so it’s up to you to use Maple’s official portal or a self-custodial wallet to complete the swap. Don’t let the deadline pass you by and risk losing your assets. Take control, migrate your MPL to SYRUP, and continue your journey in the ever-evolving world of crypto with confidence!

42553777,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144421,1743205251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Shift? Paul Atkins Poised to Rewrite SEC Crypto Regulation Rulebook,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/atkins-rewrite-sec-crypto-rules/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation! What if the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. was about to undergo a seismic shift? That’s the prediction from none other than former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) internet enforcement chief, John Reed Stark. He suggests that if Paul Atkins is confirmed as the next SEC chair , we could witness a complete overhaul of the agency’s crypto regulation playbook. Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts, because change might be on the horizon! Is a New Era of Crypto Regulation Dawning with Paul Atkins? According to a report by DL News, Stark anticipates that Atkins, should he take the helm as SEC chair , will likely dismantle the policies that crypto firms have been navigating under the leadership of the previous chair, Gary Gensler . This isn’t just a minor tweak; Stark suggests we could be looking at a complete reversal of course. Imagine a regulatory environment that looks drastically different from what we’ve become accustomed to – that’s the potential scale of change being discussed. But what exactly does this “overhaul” entail? Let’s break down what Stark is predicting: Policy Reversal: Atkins is expected to undo the regulatory approach adopted by Gary Gensler , which many in the crypto industry felt was overly aggressive and enforcement-heavy. This could mean a move away from regulation by enforcement and towards clearer, more proactive guidelines. Unprecedented Reforms: Stark boldly predicts that Atkins might introduce up to 12 completely new reforms within his first 100 days in office. That’s a whirlwind of potential activity, suggesting a rapid and decisive approach to reshaping crypto regulation . Fairness and Transparency: Despite being critical of Atkins’ perceived pro-crypto stance, Stark acknowledges him as an “honorable individual” who would prioritize fairness and transparency in his leadership. This is a crucial point, suggesting that even with significant changes, the process will be conducted with integrity. What Could These 12 Reforms in 100 Days Look Like? While Stark hasn’t detailed the exact 12 reforms, we can speculate on the areas where Atkins might focus his attention based on common criticisms of the current crypto regulation framework and the general sentiment within the crypto industry: Potential Reform Area Possible Changes Industry Impact Security vs. Utility Token Classifications Establish clearer guidelines and potentially a safe harbor for utility tokens to avoid them being automatically classified as securities. Could foster innovation and reduce legal uncertainty for token projects. Regulation of Crypto Exchanges Develop a more tailored regulatory framework specifically for crypto exchanges, potentially differentiating between centralized and decentralized platforms. Could lead to more exchanges operating within the U.S. and increased market access. Clarity on DeFi Regulation Provide guidance on how existing securities laws apply (or don’t apply) to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Could unlock DeFi innovation and bring more projects into regulatory compliance. Digital Asset Custody Rules Re-evaluate and potentially simplify custody rules to make it easier for institutions to hold and manage digital assets. Could encourage greater institutional investment in crypto. Enforcement Priorities Shift focus from broad enforcement actions to providing clearer guidance and working collaboratively with crypto firms to achieve compliance. Could improve the relationship between regulators and the crypto industry and reduce fear of over-regulation. These are just hypothetical examples, of course. The actual reforms could be different, but the core idea is that Atkins might aim to create a more business-friendly and innovation-supportive regulatory environment for crypto firms compared to the approach under Gary Gensler . Gary Gensler ‘s Legacy vs. Atkins’ Potential Approach The contrast between Gary Gensler and Paul Atkins is quite stark (pun intended!). Gensler’s tenure at the SEC was marked by a perceived crackdown on the crypto industry, with numerous enforcement actions and a strong stance that many cryptocurrencies are securities. This approach, while aimed at investor protection, was criticized by some in the industry for stifling innovation and creating regulatory uncertainty. On the other hand, Atkins is viewed as potentially more industry-friendly. His background and past statements suggest a belief in a less interventionist approach, favoring clearer rules and guidance over aggressive enforcement from the outset. This difference in philosophy could lead to a significant change in the way the SEC interacts with crypto firms . What are the Potential Benefits of an Atkins-Led SEC for Crypto? If Stark’s predictions come to fruition and Atkins does indeed rewrite the crypto regulation rulebook, what could be the potential upsides for the cryptocurrency space? Increased Clarity and Reduced Uncertainty: Clearer regulations would provide crypto firms with a more solid foundation to operate, innovate, and grow within the U.S. market. This clarity could attract more investment and development. Boost to Innovation: A less restrictive and more supportive regulatory environment could unleash a wave of innovation in the crypto and blockchain space. Companies might feel more comfortable launching new projects and services in the U.S. Improved Industry-Regulator Relations: A shift towards collaboration and guidance could foster a more positive and productive relationship between the SEC and the crypto industry, moving away from the adversarial tone that sometimes characterized the Gensler era. Attracting Global Crypto Businesses: A more favorable regulatory climate in the U.S. could attract crypto firms from around the world, positioning the country as a hub for digital asset innovation. Are There Any Potential Downsides or Challenges? While the prospect of a more crypto-friendly SEC chair might sound appealing to many in the industry, it’s important to consider potential challenges or concerns: Investor Protection Concerns: A perceived loosening of regulations could raise concerns about investor protection. It’s crucial that any new framework still safeguards investors from fraud and scams, which are unfortunately prevalent in the crypto space. Regulatory Arbitrage: If the U.S. becomes significantly more lenient than other jurisdictions, it could lead to regulatory arbitrage, where crypto firms flock to the U.S. to avoid stricter rules elsewhere. This could create international regulatory challenges. Potential for Market Volatility: Major regulatory shifts can sometimes lead to market volatility as the industry adjusts to the new landscape. Smooth and well-communicated transitions are essential. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The key challenge for Atkins, if confirmed, will be to strike the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring adequate investor protection and market integrity. This is a delicate act. Actionable Insights: Staying Ahead of the Curve For anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space – whether you’re an investor, a developer, or running a crypto firm – staying informed about these potential regulatory changes is crucial. Here are some actionable steps: Follow Regulatory Developments: Keep a close eye on news and announcements from the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Track the progress of Atkins’ potential nomination and confirmation. Engage with Industry Associations: Organizations like the Blockchain Association and Coin Center often provide updates and analysis on regulatory matters. Seek Legal Counsel: If you’re operating a crypto firm , consult with legal experts to understand how potential regulatory changes might impact your business and ensure compliance. Prepare for Change: Regardless of the specifics of any new regulations, be prepared for potential shifts in the regulatory landscape and adapt your strategies accordingly. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point for Crypto Regulation? The possibility of Paul Atkins becoming the next SEC chair and potentially rewriting the crypto regulation rulebook is a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry. While John Reed Stark’s predictions are just that – predictions – they highlight the potential for a major shift in the SEC’s approach. Whether this shift will be a revolutionary step forward for crypto innovation or present new challenges remains to be seen.

Now, this deep-pocketed investor has made a significant move, transferring a whopping 1,700 ETH, valued at $3.18 million, to the popular Binance exchange. This sudden activity after years of hibernation raises a lot of questions. What’s behind this massive crypto whale movement ? Could it signal a shift in market dynamics, or is it simply one whale making waves? Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating on-chain event. Ethereum ICO Whale Movement: A Deep Dive into the Transaction The crypto world is always watching for signs of significant shifts, and the recent Ethereum ICO whale movement certainly qualifies. According to data from the blockchain analytics firm Nansen, highlighted by Onchain Lens on X (formerly Twitter), this particular wallet has been inactive for seven years. Imagine holding onto a digital asset for that long without making a single move! The wallet’s origins are particularly noteworthy – it received its initial ETH stash directly from the Genesis block, essentially day one of the Ethereum network. This connection to the very beginning of Ethereum adds another layer of intrigue to the whale’s actions. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key details: Whale Status: Ethereum ICO Participant (Early Investor) Asset Moved: 1,700 ETH Value of Transfer: $3.18 million (approximately) Destination: Binance Exchange Inactivity Period: Seven Years Wallet Origin: Ethereum Genesis Block Remaining Holdings: 3,300 ETH in cold storage (66% of total original holdings) Why ETH to Binance After Seven Years? Decoding the Whale’s Motives The big question on everyone’s mind is: why now? Why move such a significant amount of ETH to Binance after all this time? While we can only speculate, there are several potential reasons behind this ETH to Binance transfer: Profit Taking: After seven years, the value of ETH has appreciated enormously since the ICO. This could be a strategic move to take profits, especially given market fluctuations. Portfolio Diversification: The whale might be looking to diversify their crypto portfolio by selling ETH and investing in other assets available on Binance. Trading Opportunities: Binance offers a wide range of trading pairs and financial products. The whale might be moving ETH to the exchange to engage in active trading or explore DeFi opportunities. Liquidation for Fiat: While less likely given the crypto-native nature of an ICO participant, there’s a possibility the whale intends to convert the ETH to fiat currency for real-world expenses or investments. Strategic Rebalancing: Maintaining a specific portfolio balance is crucial for large holders. This transfer could be part of a larger strategy to rebalance their crypto holdings. It’s important to remember that this is just one transaction from a wallet that still holds a substantial amount of ETH. The fact that 66% of the original holdings remain in cold storage suggests a long-term belief in Ethereum’s potential. Impact on Ethereum Price and Market Sentiment Any significant crypto whale movement can potentially influence market sentiment and even Ethereum price . While a $3.18 million transfer is considerable, it’s crucial to put it into perspective within the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Here’s how such a move can impact the market: Potential Impact Description Short-Term Price Volatility Large sell orders originating from the whale’s transferred ETH could create temporary downward pressure on Ethereum price , especially if executed quickly on Binance. Market Sentiment Shift News of a long-dormant whale becoming active can create uncertainty in the market. Some investors might interpret it as a lack of long-term confidence, potentially triggering minor sell-offs. Increased Trading Volume The whale’s activity and the ensuing market reaction can lead to increased trading volume for ETH on Binance and other exchanges. Limited Long-Term Impact Given the overall size and liquidity of the Ethereum market, a single whale’s $3.18 million transfer is unlikely to cause a sustained, major shift in Ethereum price or long-term market trends. However, the psychological impact of such events should not be underestimated. Traders and investors often react to whale movements as potential indicators of market direction, even if the actual fundamental impact is limited. Crypto Long-Term Holders: The Sleeping Giants of the Market This Ethereum ICO whale story highlights the significant role of crypto long-term holders in the market. These are individuals and entities who acquired cryptocurrencies early on and have held onto them through market cycles, often for years. Their holdings represent a substantial portion of the total cryptocurrency supply, and their actions can have considerable implications. Key characteristics of crypto long-term holders: Strong Belief in Crypto’s Potential: They often possess a deep conviction in the long-term value proposition of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Hodling Mentality: They are known for their “hodling” strategy – holding onto their assets despite market volatility, rather than actively trading. Significant Market Influence: Due to the size of their holdings, their buying or selling activity can create ripples in the market. Potential Source of Liquidity: As long-term holders become active, they can inject liquidity into the market, especially if they choose to sell or trade their assets. Historical Market Insights: Their actions offer valuable insights into the behavior of early crypto adopters and how market dynamics have evolved over time. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? The awakening of this Ethereum ICO whale is a compelling reminder of the early days of crypto and the massive wealth accumulation that occurred during the initial boom. As these early investors, the crypto long-term holders , start to move their assets, it introduces a new layer of complexity and potential volatility to the market. Will this be a one-off event, or could it signal a broader trend of dormant whales becoming active? Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on blockchain analytics platforms to track whale movements and understand potential market signals. Stay Informed About Market Sentiment: Pay attention to news and social media discussions surrounding whale activity to gauge market reactions. Consider Long-Term Trends: While whale movements can cause short-term fluctuations, focus on the fundamental long-term trends driving the crypto market. Manage Risk Wisely: Be prepared for potential volatility and manage your risk accordingly, especially when large transactions occur. Remember Crypto’s History: Events like this remind us of the cyclical nature of crypto markets and the importance of understanding market history. Conclusion: The Whale’s Wake and Crypto’s Unpredictable Seas The sudden activity of this Ethereum ICO whale is a captivating story within the ever-evolving narrative of cryptocurrency. It’s a potent reminder that the crypto market is not just about algorithms and code; it’s also about the human element – the early believers, the long-term holders, and the often unpredictable actions of significant players. As we watch the ripples from this $3.18 million ETH transfer spread through the crypto seas, one thing is clear: the world of digital assets remains as dynamic, intriguing, and full of surprises as ever. Keep your eyes on the blockchain, because in crypto, the sleeping giants can awaken at any moment, changing the landscape with a single move.

A thorough examination forecasts returns of around 1,000% based on a $1,000 investment in FloppyPepe (FPPE) alongside Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), while Solana and Ethereum are likely to get a boost in the tail end of 2025. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, FloppyPepe aims to achieve unprecedented feats with AI, making overseas competing rivals the underlying reason for this analysis’s bullish prediction. Ethereum (ETH): Gradual Growth, No Sprinting Expected The current rate of ETH is around $2,075, trading at a $4,868 market cap as of March 25, 2025. While ETH displays gradual increments, it would still need more optimistic 6k-12k predictions on the market . At the same time, ETH also showed signs of overcoming the free-restraining spark competition and slow DeFi exposure. With a $3,333.33 target, ETH needs 1.6x without too much struggle. Solana (SOL): FloppyPepe’s Whimsical Leverage Attracts More Attention But Is Still A Strong Contender In The Market Solana is currently at $139. It has shown recent gains as well—gaining an all-time high of $294 in January 2025 shows its volatility. Price predictions include the range of $142 to a bullish $520-$690. Trading corrections alongside validator reward concerns brings risk towards Solana’s growing market share in smart contracts. The need for these risks to be diminished is crucial for estimated predictions. Its growing market share in smart contracts and potential ETF approval are definitely positives. FloppyPepe’s potential makes Sol’s need for $3,333.33 and a 2.1x increase pale in comparison. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Artificial Intelligence Behind 10x Returns FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents the most significant opportunity for exponential growth, especially with its presale price of $0.0000002. All eyes are already on the project due to its AI-powered meme tools, deflationary tokenomics, and community focus. Predictions say FloppyPepe can allow up to a 930% surge or reach the astonishing predicted 100x return. The low entry price offers significant potential, which sets FloppyPepe apart from traditional meme coins. Risks are of course encountered but rewards are said to be unmatched. For these claims, FloppyPepe needs a 10,000x increase to aim towards the target of $3,333.33, which directly contradicts the project’s innovative appeal but strong community support. The 10x Reality Check: FloppyPepe’s Potential to Redefine Returns For an investment of $333.33 to yield a return of $10,000, it necessitates a hefty growth to $3,333.33. ETH: 1.6x increase required. SOL: 2.1x increase required. FPPE: 10,000x growth required. FloppyPepe stands out among ETH and SOL in terms of potential; alongside offering growth, it serves as the key to achieving the 10x goal. FloppyPepe: A High-Risk, High-Reward Opportunity In case these additional risks do not extract a toll, this portfolio is set to FloppyPepe’s scorching success. While ETH and SOL are considered the safer options, FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents itself as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity due to its AI innovation and robust community support. With presale Pepe coin , investors need to tread carefully due to the volume of risk that comes hand in hand with it. Contrary to that, FloppyPepe’s quirky take, while being backed by a strong community, renders it an appealing option for those wishing for unique return strategies. While careful reasoning with risk and placing bets on the right angle is vital, it is equally essential to highlight that the power FloppyPepe brings to crypto return ceiling is remarkable.

Binance Launchpool, which lets users stake coins to farm new assets, says its 66th project will be GUN, the official token of the GUNZ blockchain, which was built by developer Gunzilla Games. The chain currently powers Gunzilla’s Extraction Royale game “Off The Grid” and its infiltration game “Technocore.” Gunzilla says in the project’s whitepaper that the chain was “purpose-built for AAA web3 gaming.” “Originally created to support a community-driven economy for Gunzilla’s flagship title, Off The Grid (OTG), GUNZ has evolved into a full-featured platform offering blockchain-native infrastructure essential for modern game development.” Between March 28th and 31st, Binance users can lock their BNB , the crypto exchange platform’s native asset, as well as the stablecoins First Digital USD ( FDUSD ) and USDC , to receive GUN airdrops. The top global crypto exchange then plans to list the asset on March 31st. Binance will attach a seed tag to GUN, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. Binance requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens.

This next phase was confirmed in Keynote 3, where the team shared a clear message. The launch isn’t being rushed—it’s part of a focused plan. When the network goes live later this year, it will introduce better performance and usability than most Layer 1 chains offer at launch. CEO Antony Turner shared that this moment marks the shift from idea to working network. According to him, everything from the early presale to the growing global community has led up to this. “This is not just a milestone,” Turner said. “This is the moment BlockDAG becomes a complete, working ecosystem.” BlockDAG’s Big Leap: Mainnet Set to Revolutionize Crypto in 2025 While some projects delay key releases, BlockDAG has been steady with its updates. Now, the biggest moment is locked in—mainnet goes live in 2025. But it’s not just about launching. It’s about getting it right. The team is focused on building real infrastructure, hitting real performance levels, and creating tools that people will actually use. “We’re improving speed, reliability, and safety while giving developers early support to build a strong dApp network,” Turner said. Every piece of the system—explorer, tools, oracles, and indexing—is being developed to make sure the network is ready from day one. Starts at 2,000 TPS—and That’s Just the Beginning From the very start, BlockDAG will handle 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). That number alone puts it far ahead of many chains that launched before it. But the bigger goal is 15,000 TPS within the first two years. This is possible thanks to a hybrid setup that uses both Proof-of-Work and a DAG-based method for processing. Instead of waiting for each block, the system allows multiple transactions to be confirmed at the same time. That means faster service, more volume, and stronger support for apps. As Jeremy Harkness explained during Keynote 3: “This is not your regular blockchain setup—we’re changing the basic structure of how things work.” Launching with DeFi, EVM Tools, and Real Use Many projects launch with very few tools and grow slowly. BlockDAG is taking a different path. It will include several major features right from the start: Built-in DeFi features like swaps, stablecoins, and lending EVM compatibility for Ethereum-based dApps Token creators that don’t require any coding Full account abstraction for easier wallet control and recovery All of this is native to the chain, so there’s no need for third-party fixes or workarounds. Users can start building and transacting from day one. Turner shared that the focus is on usefulness: “Our goal is to launch with tools people can use, not just talk about.” Miners Are Already Shipping The network’s strength will come from thousands of miners that are already being sent out. BlockDAG has started shipping its X30 and X100 devices to early buyers. “We’ve officially begun sending out the first batch of miners,” Turner confirmed. Before the mainnet even launches, nearly 10,000 mining units will be running around the world. These miners are tuned for BlockDAG’s hybrid system. They’re energy-efficient and can be used in homes or larger setups. Unlike sharp halving events, BlockDAG’s reward system reduces gradually. That means more predictable returns for miners and token holders. Strong Security and Community-Led Growth Security has been one of the project’s main goals. It has completed audits by Halborn and Certik, and its token vesting contract has passed all checks. The team also uses multi-party treasury tools to manage funds safely. Community members will also help shape the future of the network. A decentralized decision system is being built to let users propose ideas, vote, and guide the project’s future direction. “Our holders will help decide how we move forward,” the team shared. This launch isn’t just technical—it’s about growing with input from the people using the network. What’s Coming Next? Mainnet is only the start. After launch, BlockDAG’s roadmap includes: Supporting over 1,000 dApps by 2026 Expanding into areas like gaming, identity, and artificial intelligence Boosting TPS even further with new research Running global events, hackathons, and educational programs As Harkness put it: “We’re not just meeting a deadline—we’re laying the groundwork for something much bigger.” And Turner ended the keynote with a hint at what’s next: “Keep an eye out for our next announcement—wait, did I say Keynote? I meant LaunchNote!” Final Words BlockDAG is on track to deliver one of the most complete Layer 1 releases in crypto. With 2,000 TPS planned at launch, a goal of 15,000 TPS, DeFi tools, EVM support, and miners already being deployed, this isn’t just another blockchain project. It’s the real beginning. And with the “Launchnote” around the corner, this is the moment it all starts.

Still, a major challenge remains: scalability. Older blockchains often face trade-offs between speed, decentralization, and safety. Processing delays, costly gas fees during traffic spikes, and low throughput continue to frustrate developers and users searching for better solutions. That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) steps in—a new Layer 1 project that merges Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with the security of Proof-of-Work (PoW). This isn’t just a simple upgrade—it rethinks the entire structure of how decentralized networks can run. Parallel Processing Unlocks Better Performance What powers BlockDAG’s big leap is its DAG foundation. Instead of using a slow, linear chain where each block waits its turn, this setup confirms many blocks at once. Think of traffic moving in multiple lanes instead of a single-file jam. This new approach greatly increases how much data the system can handle and cuts delays. During Keynote 3, CTO Jeremy Harkness summed it up well: “Imagine if transactions didn’t have to wait in a long queue, one after another. With our parallel processing, multiple blocks are confirmed simultaneously.” It’s already more than theory—Beta Testnet V1 now runs twice as fast as the earlier version, and the mainnet aims to reach 2,000 transactions per second, later scaling to 15,000. The impact of this tech goes beyond numbers. Faster confirmations improve dApps, especially in fields like finance, gaming, and live communication. Cheaper fees come from better handling of high-volume activity. Because DAG can scale side-by-side, BlockDAG plans to host over 1,000 dApps by 2026. Security Still Comes First with PoW While DAG gives BlockDAG the speed, it doesn’t forget about safety. PoW stays part of its system by design. Many projects moved away from PoW to save energy, but BlockDAG shows that you don’t have to pick between power and protection. The PoW part makes users prove they’ve done real work to add blocks, which guards against data tampering. Jeremy Harkness explained, “The Proof-of-Work element ensures our data remains immutable, while the DAG structure scales our capacity exponentially.” Extra safety measures are in place too. Certik and Halborn are doing full audits. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) keeps treasury and user funds protected. BlockDAG also runs the GhostDAG protocol, which cuts down on discarded blocks and helps prevent attacks on the network. Put together, these elements create not just a faster system, but one that’s secure enough to support finance, games, ID platforms, and more. Tools for Builders and Real Use Cases BlockDAG’s setup isn’t just a tech improvement—it’s a push for wide use. The dual-engine model of DAG + PoW powers everything in the BlockDAG network, from its mobile mining tools to its dApp services. Already, over 750,000 users mine through the X1 App, and more than 100,000 play Tap Miner on Telegram every day. These figures show real traction, built on simple, fun tools that make getting into crypto easy. Builders also get solid tools to create with. Features like the coin and NFT Wizard help users make assets with no coding. There are testnet rewards and upcoming hackathons offering six-figure prizes—fueling a space for serious projects to grow. As Maurice Herlihy shared, “Our program goes beyond simply showing you which buttons to press—it provides you with the essential principles and insights needed to safely and confidently harness BlockDAG’s transformative potential.” Whether someone is launching a finance tool or building social-based governance apps, BlockDAG makes sure it can be done fast, cheap, and safely. Why BlockDAG is The Future of the Blockchain Industry BlockDAG isn’t just another project hoping to get noticed—it’s a full rethink of what decentralized systems should look like today. The combo of DAG’s speed and PoW’s strength solves the old three-way problem of scale, speed, and safety. It can do more at once, cut costs, and keep data secure—all while building a strong user and builder base. As the 2025 mainnet launch draws closer, BlockDAG is on track to lead the next wave of decentralized apps. Instead of following trends, it’s laying the path ahead.

The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has just dropped a significant update, potentially opening doors for banks to dive deeper into the realm of digital assets. This vital guidance from the FDIC could mark a turning point in how traditional financial institutions interact with cryptocurrencies. Are you ready to explore what this means for the future of finance and crypto adoption? Decoding the FDIC Crypto Guidance: What Does it Mean for Banks Crypto Activities? In a recent announcement that has sent ripples through both the banking and cryptocurrency sectors, the FDIC has clarified its stance on banks engaging in crypto-related activities. According to a statement published on their official website, institutions regulated by the FDIC now have a clearer pathway to participate in the burgeoning crypto space. The key takeaway? Banks can now engage in permitted cryptocurrency activities without needing to seek prior approval from the FDIC. This is a significant shift from previous uncertainties and could signal a more welcoming regulatory environment for crypto within traditional finance. Here’s a breakdown of what this new FDIC Crypto Guidance entails: Clarity on Permissible Activities: The guidance provides a framework for banks to understand what types of crypto activities are considered permissible. While the specifics of these “permitted activities” will likely be further defined in subsequent communications and individual bank evaluations, this initial guidance offers a crucial starting point. No Prior Approval Needed (For Permitted Activities): Perhaps the most impactful aspect is the statement that banks do not need to seek prior approval from the FDIC for engaging in these permitted activities. This streamlines the process and reduces bureaucratic hurdles that may have previously deterred banks from exploring crypto. Focus on Safety and Soundness: It’s important to note that while the FDIC is providing a green light for banks crypto activities , they are still emphasizing the importance of safety and soundness. Banks will still be expected to operate in a manner that protects depositors and the financial system. This suggests a balanced approach – encouraging innovation while maintaining regulatory oversight. Why is Abolishing Customer Reputation Risk a Win for Crypto Regulation and Innovation? In a move that many in the crypto industry are celebrating, the FDIC also recently abolished the customer reputation risk assessment criteria for banks. This criterion had been a point of contention and criticism, often viewed as a tool that could be used to stifle the growth and development of the cryptocurrency industry. Let’s understand why removing this criterion is significant for crypto regulation and innovation: Eliminating Subjectivity: The “customer reputation risk” criterion was inherently subjective and vaguely defined. This lack of clarity could lead to inconsistent application and potentially discriminatory practices against businesses or sectors perceived as “risky,” including the cryptocurrency industry. Leveling the Playing Field: By removing this criterion, the FDIC is arguably leveling the playing field for crypto businesses seeking banking services. It reduces the potential for banks to deny services based on perceived reputational risks associated with the crypto industry, rather than focusing on objective risk assessments. Encouraging Innovation: The abolition of this criterion can be seen as a signal that regulators are becoming more receptive to innovation within the financial sector. It suggests a move away from potentially biased or outdated perceptions of the crypto industry and towards a more pragmatic and objective approach to risk assessment.

This initial rally was fuelled by bullish catalysts, including the announcement by Trump-backed WLFI to launch a stablecoin on Ethereum and BNB Chain , as well as the successful deployment of the Pectra upgrade. Ethereum Price Action | ETHUSD However, the landscape shifted dramatically following President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs, which sparked widespread losses across financial markets. Ethereum was among the hardest hit, with its price plunging 6% to trade as low as $1,870 on Friday. As of press time, ETH price had recovered slightly to $1,895. The accompanying rise in trading volumes suggests that Ethereum could face additional selling pressure in the coming sessions. Ethereum Bulls Suffer Largest Losses Amid $450M Market Liquidations Ethereum’s spot market performance positioned it as the hardest-hit asset, leading total liquidations in the past 24 hours. Data from the derivatives markets indicates that many over-leveraged bullish traders were caught off guard. According to Coinglass , total crypto liquidations reached $449.89 million, with Ethereum alone accounting for $136.21 million—the highest among all cryptocurrencies. This underscores the heightened volatility and risk associated with leveraged trading in the current market environment.

Institutions must report crypto activity, preserving monitoring without pre-approval. The update reflects regulatory practice aligning traditional banking with digital trends. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued new guidance this week that cleared the way for supervised banks in the United States to engage in crypto-related activities without seeking prior approval, signaling a shift in its regulatory stance. Outlined in Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025) , the policy rescinded a 2022 requirement that banks notify the FDIC before starting any crypto-related operations. The change is part of a broader reexamination of how federal agencies treat digital assets in the banking sector. FDIC Updates Crypto Oversight: Notification Still Required, Approval Dropped FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said the new guidance marked a departure from the more restrictive policies implemented over the past three years. “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards,” Hill stated. Under the revised policy , FDIC-supervised banks are now allowed to pursue crypto-related services, provided they manage associated risks and comply with existing regulations on safety and soundness. BREAKING: The FDIC says institutions & banks can engage in crypto activities without prior approval BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/DbcrDXqqeB — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) March 28, 2025 While prior approval is no longer necessary, banks must still notify the FDIC if they are already involved in or intend to pursue crypto activities. The agency will then review the submitted information and may provide feedback or further supervision. Still, the agency remains cautious. The FDIC stated that while it recognizes ongoing developments in financial services, crypto-related activities continue to pose risks — including those tied to market volatility, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering compliance. The agency also confirmed it will continue collaborating with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets and other banking regulators to refine its oversight of digital asset activities across the financial system. Wider Regulatory Context and Coordination This change comes amid growing calls for federal banking regulators to provide clearer guidance on crypto integration. The FDIC said it would work with other federal agencies to revise outdated interagency statements related to digital assets and banking. Although the new stance reduces regulatory friction, oversight remains in place. Banks must still demonstrate that they can conduct crypto-related operations safely while protecting customers and complying with legal standards. FDIC Reconsiders Crypto Restrictions Following Industry Pushback For years, U.S. banks that experimented with crypto services encountered regulatory obstacles. Some reportedly received informal warnings instructing them to pause activities such as digital asset custody and tokenized deposits. Industry figures referred to these efforts as part of “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” — an alleged campaign to restrict lawful crypto services through opaque enforcement rather than public rulemaking. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill cited over 20 instances where banks were discouraged from offering crypto services without any formal regulatory process. Hill called for a reevaluation of how rules like the Bank Secrecy Act are applied, warning against their misuse to deny lawful banking access. In response to both internal reviews and external pressure, the FDIC now appears to be taking a more open position. Recent discussions suggest growing interest in blockchain-based infrastructure and tokenized deposits. The agency has also removed “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision — a change that follows the Senate Banking Committee’s passage of the Fair Access to Banking Act (FIRM Act). The move aligns with a similar decision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and may signal a more consistent approach across federal banking agencies. Crypto commentators, including David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, welcomed the decision. Big win for crypto: @FDICgov is following @USOCC 's lead in removing “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision. “Reputational risk” may sound good in theory, but it was defined as “the potential that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices,… https://t.co/IAtw5JnykS — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 25, 2025 Advocates say it may help establish a more transparent regulatory environment for banks engaged in lawful digital asset services. With this shift from the FDIC, banks now face fewer procedural obstacles when entering the crypto space — though regulatory compliance and sound risk management remain mandatory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How could banks refine risk controls in crypto operations under this new approach? Banks adopt integrated risk management by merging traditional controls with new digital safeguards. Frequent system audits, stress evaluations, and data analysis routines help maintain secure crypto frameworks. How might banks protect customers amid evolving crypto oversight? Institutions combine digital safety steps with usual methods to secure transactions. Regular internal reviews and data checks work to lower risks, keeping operations compliant with established practices. What future adjustments could shape digital banking trends? Regulators might adjust crypto rules prompting banks to upgrade digital systems and risk controls. This shift pushes banks to enhance their digital practices while ensuring secure, compliant operations.

OpenAI just dropped a bombshell in the world of AI image generation. ChatGPT, your go-to chatbot, has leveled up its visual game with a brand-new image generator. Remember those charming Studio Ghibli-esque images flooding your feeds? That’s just the tip of the iceberg. But beyond the artistic flair, the real story lies in OpenAI’s surprising decision to loosen its grip on content moderation . Let’s dive deep into what this means for the future of AI and digital content. Why is OpenAI Relaxing ChatGPT’s Image Safeguards? For a long time, ChatGPT played it safe, refusing prompts that ventured into controversial territory. Public figures? Hateful symbols? Certain racial features? Forbidden! But this week, the script flipped. OpenAI announced a significant shift, moving away from blanket bans to a more nuanced approach. According to Joanne Jang, OpenAI’s model behavior lead, it’s all about “embracing humility” and adapting as they learn. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental change in how OpenAI views its role in controlling AI-generated content. Here’s a breakdown of the key policy updates: Public Figures Welcome: No more AI image generator vetoes for Donald Trump, Elon Musk, or your favorite (or not-so-favorite) celebrity. OpenAI is stepping back from deciding who’s image-worthy. Hateful Symbols in Context: Swastikas and similar symbols are now permissible for educational or neutral purposes, as long as they don’t promote extremism. Context is king! Nuance in ‘Offensive’ Content: Requests about physical characteristics (like “make eyes more Asian”) are no longer automatically rejected. ChatGPT aims for precision, not blanket refusals. The Impact of Uncensoring ChatGPT’s AI Image Generator This policy evolution has significant implications, both positive and potentially risky. Let’s explore: Potential Benefits: Increased User Freedom: Users gain more control over content creation, fostering creativity and diverse perspectives. Enhanced Realism and Utility: For tasks like historical visualization or educational materials, depicting real-world figures and symbols becomes crucial. Pushing AI Boundaries: By tackling sensitive topics, OpenAI is actively learning and refining its models in complex ethical landscapes. Potential Challenges: Misinformation and Deepfakes: Looser restrictions could open doors for malicious use, including creating deceptive images of public figures. Offensive Content Proliferation: While contextual, allowing hateful symbols risks normalizing or trivializing them, especially if context is misinterpreted. Ethical Minefield: Navigating the line between free expression and harmful content is incredibly complex and requires constant vigilance. ChatGPT’s New Image Capabilities: Beyond Content Policy It’s not just about content moderation; the underlying generative AI technology in ChatGPT’s image generator has received a serious upgrade. Early users are raving about: Studio Ghibli Magic: The viral sensation is real! ChatGPT excels at creating images in specific artistic styles. Improved Image Editing: Refining and tweaking generated images is now smoother and more effective. Text Rendering Prowess: Getting AI to accurately render text in images has been a hurdle, but ChatGPT shows significant progress. Spatial Reasoning: The AI demonstrates a better understanding of spatial relationships within images, leading to more coherent and realistic compositions. However, it’s not a complete free-for-all. ChatGPT still maintains safeguards, particularly around child safety, and continues to restrict mimicking living individual artists’ styles. This raises ongoing questions about AI copyright and fair use, especially concerning training datasets. Remember the debate about using copyrighted works to train AI? It’s far from settled. Navigating the AI Content Moderation Minefield OpenAI’s move comes amidst a broader “culture war” around content moderation in AI. Google’s Gemini faced backlash for biased image generation, and political scrutiny is intensifying. Republican Congressman Jim Jordan even questioned tech giants about potential censorship collusion. OpenAI insists its changes are about user empowerment and technological maturity, not politics. But timing is everything. With potential regulatory shifts under a new administration, relaxing guardrails now could be strategically advantageous. Major platforms like Meta and X are also leaning towards less restrictive content policies. The industry seems to be collectively recalibrating its approach to online content. While viral Studio Ghibli memes are fun, the long-term impact of these policy shifts on AI ethics and societal implications remains to be seen. Can ChatGPT walk the tightrope between free expression and responsible AI? Only time will tell. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for AI Content OpenAI’s decision to peel back ChatGPT’s safeguards is a bold, perhaps even risky, move. It signals a significant shift in the AI landscape, prioritizing user freedom and pushing the boundaries of what AI can create. While the immediate effects are captivating – think stunning AI art and viral trends – the deeper implications for content moderation, ethical AI development, and the potential for misuse are crucial conversations we need to have. This is a pivotal moment, and the path OpenAI forges will undoubtedly influence the future of AI and its role in our digital world.

A Golden Pocket is a key Fibonacci retracement area that is often used to identify potential support and resistance levels. It represents a complete trend reversal for a cryptocurrency and a possibility of an aggressive uptrend. The TradingView analyst has revealed that XRP’s current Golden Pocket aligns with an imbalance zone, an area of unfilled liquidity where prices typically revisit before resuming movement. In the chart, XRP’s Golden Pocket sits between the 0.618 – 0.65 Fibonacci retracement level — a well-known area where the price usually finds strong support before continuing the trend. Historically, XRP has reacted twice from this key level, indicating that buyers have been actively defending this area. TehThomas has predicted that as long as the XRP price can hold above the key Fibonacci retracement level, which also acts as a critical resistance, the cryptocurrency’s bullish structure will remain unchanged. Additionally, XRP could be primed for a massive rally toward the 0.618 Fibonacci extension level, which corresponds with the upper boundary of the Ascending Channel. If this bullish momentum continues, it means that the analyst expects the XRP price to see a rally to a target between the $2.8 to – $2.9 range. This represents a 29% price increase from XRP’s current price of $2.2. Short-Term Resistance Could Trigger Decline TehThomas’s bullish outlook for the XRP price, the TradingView analyst noted that the 1-hour time frame presents short-term resistance, which could lead to a significant pullback before the next leg up. XRP recently faced a rejection at the imbalance zone, indicating that sellers are increasing activity at this level. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Loses Over $3 Billion In 3 Months Amid Market Turmoil Previously, when the price struggled to break the imbalance zone, it highlighted a lack of liquidity to sustain a continued uptrend. A repeat of this could result in a retracement toward the Golden Pocket in the 4-hour timeframe. Notably, a confirmed breakout from the 1-hour imbalance timeframe could reinforce XRP’s bullish momentum, supporting its projected move toward upper levels of the Ascending Channel. However, a failure could shift this bullish structure, leading to a deeper correction toward lower support levels.

Are we witnessing a shift in power? Renowned research and brokerage firm Bernstein has ignited a fascinating debate, suggesting that Robinhood crypto , the platform known for democratizing finance, is strategically positioned for more robust growth than crypto giant Coinbase. This bold prediction hinges on Robinhood’s superior product pipeline and a crypto strategy that analysts believe is built for scalability and wider appeal. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing analysis and explore what it means for the future of crypto investing. Why Bernstein is Betting Big on Robinhood Crypto Bernstein analysts have painted a compelling picture, likening Robinhood to “Schwab elite banking, but for everyone.” This powerful analogy speaks volumes about Robinhood’s potential. But what exactly fuels this bullish outlook on Robinhood crypto ? Scalable Revenue Lines: Bernstein emphasizes Robinhood’s diverse and scalable revenue streams. Unlike Coinbase, which heavily relies on trading fees, Robinhood has cultivated multiple avenues for growth. This diversification provides a buffer against market volatility and positions them for long-term sustainability. Bullish Crypto Strategy: The analysts are particularly impressed with Robinhood’s proactive and forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency. They see Robinhood’s crypto strategy as more adaptable and growth-oriented compared to Coinbase’s. Accessibility and User Experience: Robinhood has always prioritized user-friendliness and accessibility. This “for everyone” ethos resonates deeply with a broad audience, potentially attracting a larger pool of crypto investors, especially as crypto adoption continues to expand beyond early adopters. Potential Beneficiary of Pro-Crypto Policies: The report highlights a crucial external factor: the potential impact of a pro-crypto political landscape, particularly under a hypothetical U.S. President Trump administration. Traditional fintech platforms like Robinhood are poised to be significant beneficiaries of policies that foster crypto innovation and adoption. Coinbase Competition: Is Margin Pressure a Real Threat? While Bernstein is optimistic about Robinhood, their analysis presents a contrasting view of Coinbase. The report suggests that Coinbase faces a more challenging landscape, particularly regarding Coinbase competition and margin pressure. Why the concern? Investor Uncertainty: Bernstein notes that Coinbase is “harder to understand” for investors. This perceived complexity might stem from its more specialized focus on crypto trading and its reliance on transaction fees, which can be volatile and subject to market fluctuations. Rising Competition: The crypto exchange market is becoming increasingly crowded. New players are emerging, and traditional financial institutions are entering the space, intensifying the Coinbase competition . This heightened competition could squeeze margins and impact profitability. Margin Pressure Concerns: With increased competition comes pressure on fees and margins. If Coinbase needs to lower its fees to remain competitive, it could impact its revenue and profitability, leading to margin pressure. It’s important to note that Bernstein’s analysis isn’t necessarily negative on Coinbase’s long-term prospects, but rather highlights potential headwinds and suggests that Robinhood is currently better positioned for accelerated growth within the current market dynamics. The Trump Card: How Pro-Crypto Policies Could Reshape the Landscape The political climate plays a significant role in the cryptocurrency industry. DL News reported that Bernstein’s bullish outlook on Robinhood is partly tied to the potential for a more favorable regulatory environment under a pro-crypto stance, particularly associated with former U.S. President Trump. How could this impact the fintech crypto space? Benefiting Traditional Fintechs: Pro-crypto policies could pave the way for traditional fintech companies like Robinhood to further integrate and expand their crypto offerings. This could include clearer regulatory guidelines, reduced compliance burdens, and increased institutional adoption of crypto assets. Mainstream Adoption Catalyst: A supportive regulatory environment can boost mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. As governments become more accepting and create clearer frameworks, it can instill confidence in both retail and institutional investors, driving growth for the entire crypto ecosystem. Innovation and Growth: Reduced regulatory uncertainty can foster innovation within the fintech crypto sector. Companies will be more inclined to invest in new crypto products and services, knowing the regulatory landscape is becoming more predictable and supportive. Navigating the Crypto Investment Landscape: Key Takeaways The Bernstein analysis offers valuable insights for anyone involved in or observing the cryptocurrency market. What are the actionable takeaways from this report, especially regarding crypto investment strategies? Key Insight Actionable Implication Robinhood’s diversified revenue and user-friendly approach are seen as strengths. Consider Robinhood’s potential for long-term growth in the crypto space. Investors might find it appealing for broader market exposure beyond just crypto trading. Coinbase faces increasing competition and potential margin pressure. Monitor Coinbase’s strategies to navigate competition and maintain profitability. Investors should be aware of potential volatility due to market pressures. Pro-crypto policies could benefit traditional fintechs. Keep an eye on regulatory developments and political shifts that could impact the crypto and fintech sectors. Favorable policies could be a significant growth catalyst. The Future of Crypto Exchanges: A Glimpse into Tomorrow Bernstein’s perspective provides a fascinating lens through which to view the future of cryptocurrency exchanges. The analysis suggests a potential paradigm shift where platforms with broader appeal, diversified revenue streams, and proactive crypto strategies, like Robinhood, could emerge as dominant players. While Coinbase remains a significant force, the increasing crypto investment landscape and competitive pressures require constant adaptation and innovation. Ultimately, the crypto exchange arena is dynamic and constantly evolving. The insights from Bernstein’s analysis are a crucial piece of the puzzle, highlighting the strategic advantages and challenges facing key players like Robinhood and Coinbase. As the crypto market matures and regulatory landscapes evolve, the battle for market share and investor attention will undoubtedly intensify, making it a space to watch closely.

42556480,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144461,1743209402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,CoreWeave’s Risky Nasdaq Debut: A Critical Moment for the AI Cloud Sector,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coreweave-nasdaq-debut-analysis/,"The buzz around Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been deafening, and companies riding this wave are under intense scrutiny. Today marked a significant moment as CoreWeave, a prominent GPU cloud provider deeply intertwined with the cryptocurrency mining world through its partnership with Core Scientific, commenced trading on the Nasdaq. Under the ticker “CRWV,” the company stepped into the public market spotlight, but the initial reception wasn’t exactly the triumphant fanfare many anticipated. Let’s delve into the details of this CoreWeave Nasdaq Debut and what it signifies for the broader tech landscape. CoreWeave Nasdaq Debut: Hype vs. Reality? According to reports from CoinDesk, CRWV stock began its Nasdaq journey at $39 per share. This opening price was already a notch below the anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of $40. The stock didn’t rally upwards from there; instead, it experienced a further dip, settling around the $37 mark shortly after trading commenced. This lukewarm reception is noteworthy, especially considering the pre-IPO hype surrounding CoreWeave. CoreWeave’s IPO was a substantial $1.5 billion affair, attracting significant attention, particularly because of a notable investor – NVIDIA. The semiconductor giant, an early backer of CoreWeave, injected a hefty $250 million into this IPO. NVIDIA’s involvement added considerable weight and credibility to CoreWeave’s market entry. Yet, despite this powerful endorsement, the initial trading performance suggests that the market’s enthusiasm might be tempered by underlying concerns. Decoding CRWV Stock Performance: What’s Behind the Initial Dip? Bloomberg technology columnist Dave Lee offered some insightful perspectives on why CRWV stock might not have soared as expected right out of the gate. He suggests several factors that could be weighing on investor sentiment: Massive Debt Burden: CoreWeave reportedly carries a significant amount of debt. High debt levels can make investors nervous, especially in a fluctuating economic climate. It raises questions about the company’s financial flexibility and its ability to manage repayments, potentially impacting profitability. Client Concentration Risks: Dependence on a small number of large clients is another point of concern. If CoreWeave relies heavily on just a few major customers for the bulk of its revenue, the loss of even one key client could severely impact its financial health. This lack of revenue diversification creates vulnerability. Revenue Diversity Challenges: Expanding on the previous point, Lee highlights the potential lack of revenue diversity. A company with a broad range of revenue streams is generally considered more stable and resilient. If CoreWeave’s revenue is concentrated in a narrow sector or service offering, it might be perceived as riskier. These points, while diagnostic, are crucial for understanding the market’s initial reaction to the CoreWeave Nasdaq Debut . Investors are likely scrutinizing these fundamental aspects of the company’s business model as they assess its long-term viability and growth potential. GPU Cloud Provider in the Spotlight: More Than Just Crypto While CoreWeave has ties to the cryptocurrency world, particularly through its partnership with Core Scientific, it’s essential to recognize its primary identity as a GPU cloud provider . In today’s tech landscape, this is a powerful position to be in. Here’s why GPU cloud providers are becoming increasingly vital: The AI Revolution Driver: GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are the workhorses of the AI revolution. They are exceptionally efficient at handling the complex computations required for machine learning, deep learning, and other AI applications. As AI adoption explodes across industries, the demand for GPU cloud services is surging. Beyond Gaming and Graphics: While GPUs were initially developed for gaming and graphics-intensive tasks, their capabilities extend far beyond. They are now indispensable for scientific research, data analytics, video editing, and, of course, cryptocurrency mining (though CoreWeave’s primary focus seems to be shifting towards AI). Scalability and Flexibility: Cloud-based GPU services offer unparalleled scalability and flexibility. Businesses can access vast amounts of GPU computing power on demand, without the massive upfront investment and maintenance costs associated with owning and managing their own hardware. This is particularly attractive for startups and companies with fluctuating computing needs. CoreWeave, as a specialized GPU cloud provider , is strategically positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for AI computing infrastructure. However, the challenges highlighted by Dave Lee suggest that navigating this rapidly evolving market will require careful financial management and strategic diversification. NVIDIA Investment and AI Industry Implications: A Wind Vane for the Future? NVIDIA investment in CoreWeave’s IPO is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strong signal of confidence in the company’s potential and the broader AI industry . NVIDIA is at the heart of the AI revolution, manufacturing the very GPUs that power these cloud services. Their backing carries significant weight and suggests a long-term strategic alignment. Dave Lee’s assertion that CoreWeave will serve as a “wind vane for the entire AI industry ” is particularly compelling. Here’s why CoreWeave’s journey on the public market is so closely watched: AI Cloud Market Health Indicator: CoreWeave’s stock performance and overall business trajectory will provide valuable insights into the health and maturity of the AI cloud market. Its successes and struggles will reflect broader trends and challenges within this sector. Investor Appetite for AI Pure-Plays: The market’s reception to CoreWeave will gauge investor appetite for pure-play AI infrastructure companies. Are investors ready to bet big on companies solely focused on providing the computing power for AI, or are they more cautious? Validation of the GPU Cloud Model: CoreWeave’s performance will, to some extent, validate or challenge the viability and scalability of the GPU cloud service model. Its ability to overcome challenges like debt and client concentration will be closely scrutinized by competitors and new entrants in the space. Navigating the AI Industry Challenges: A Risky Bet or Calculated Move? The AI industry is undeniably brimming with potential, but it’s also a landscape fraught with challenges. CoreWeave’s CoreWeave Nasdaq Debut comes at a time when the broader economic environment is uncertain, and investor sentiment can be volatile. The company’s success is not guaranteed, and the initial stock performance underscores the inherent risks. However, risk often goes hand-in-hand with high reward. If CoreWeave can effectively manage its debt, diversify its client base and revenue streams, and capitalize on the ever-increasing demand for AI computing power, it has the potential to become a major player in the cloud computing landscape. The NVIDIA investment and the sheer momentum behind the AI revolution are significant tailwinds in its favor. Ultimately, CoreWeave’s journey on the Nasdaq will be a fascinating case study. It’s a test of investor confidence in the AI cloud sector, a measure of the viability of specialized GPU cloud providers, and a real-time experiment in navigating the complexities of a rapidly evolving technological frontier. Keep a close watch on CRWV stock – it’s likely to be a bellwether for the AI industry for months and years to come.

One of the Most Trusted Buy Signals in Bitcoin Just Flashed,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-this-btcs-bottom-one-of-the-most-trusted-buy-signals-in-bitcoin-just-flashed/,"Bitcoin’s price has drawn renewed attention following the activation of a historically reliable on-chain signal—the Hash Ribbon indicator. Currently trading around $84,500 after a 3.9% drop over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin (BTC) is under pressure from broader macro uncertainty. However, the Hash Ribbon , which measures miner stress and recovery using 30-day and 60-day hash rate moving averages, has now flashed its eighth major buy signal in BTC’s history. $BTC Hash Ribbon indicator has appear a buy signal.

Tony Severino, a Chartered Market Technician, flagged bearish divergences between price action and momentum indicators. “BTC is making higher highs while the RSI posts lower highs. That’s not bullish—it’s a red flag,” he noted. BTC remains below the 50-period EMA near $86,000, reinforcing short-term bearish structure. The RSI sits around 36, rebounding from oversold levels, but lacks momentum. Unless BTC breaks above $86,800, recovery remains uncertain. Macroeconomic Headwinds Add Caution Even with the bullish on-chain signal, macro forces loom large. Strong U.S. economic data—Q4 GDP revised to 3.4% and jobless claims declining—supports a hawkish Fed stance, dampening appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions are flaring again with Trump’s proposed 25% auto tariffs, set for April 2. While gold surged to an all-time high of $3,059 on the news, BTC hasn’t mirrored the safe-haven rally. This divergence has left some questioning Bitcoin’s role as digital gold. Jamie Coutts of Real Vision noted, “Hash Ribbons are a solid signal, but broader conditions aren’t aligning like previous cycles.” With Wall Street returning post-holiday and ETF flows stabilizing, short-term direction may depend on how BTC reacts to upcoming inflation data. Gold hits $3,059 ATH while BTC lags behind Trump’s tariffs add to global economic anxiety ETF inflows flatline amid mixed crypto sentiment Bitcoin Consolidates Near $84.5K Amid Cooling Bearish Pressure BTC is stabilizing near $84,500 after a sharp drop, finding short-term support at $83,000. The RSI is rebounding from oversold levels, hinting at fading bearish momentum. However, BTC remains below the 50-EMA at $86,000, keeping the near-term bias bearish. Upside target : Break above $86,800 could trigger a rally toward $88,800 Downside risk : Drop below $83,000 may expose $81,200 Market tone : Cautious, with $34B daily volume and 2.86% drop BTC is consolidating in a narrowing range, with macro catalysts likely to dictate the next move.

Peter Brandt Predicts $65,635 Bearish Target",https://coingape.com/markets/why-is-bitcoin-price-down-today-peter-brandt-predicts-65635-bearish-target/,"Bitcoin price plunged below $85,000 on Friday, hitting $84,200 at its lowest point as market-wide selling pressure triggered massive liquidations. Bitcoin Price Tumbles Below $85,000, Sparking $116 Million Long Liquidation Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the critical $85,000 support level on Friday, hitting a low of $84,200 as selling pressure intensified. At press time, BTC remains under pressure, reflecting broader market weakness and increasing liquidation risks. Bitcoin price analysis | BTCUSD, March 29 | Source: CoinMarketCap The sharp BTC price decline contributed to a total of $400 million in crypto liquidations, with $116 million in Bitcoin long positions wiped out. More so, on Thursday, wallets linked to the U.S. government transferred 97 BTC and 884 ETH, sparking speculations that a sell-off could follow. However, the transaction appears to align with the federal government’s efforts to consolidate its crypto holdings following Trump’s executive order issued on March 6. As outlined in the fact sheet , the order mandates federal agencies to report their cryptocurrency holdings within 30 days to the Secretary of the Treasury. This suggests that the $10.3 million in BTC and ETH transfers may be part of a broader asset consolidation initiative, rather than an immediate liquidation event. Peter Brandt Predicts $65,635 Bearish Target Veteran trader Peter Brandt has issued a stark bearish warning for Bitcoin, citing a bear wedge breakdown with a potential downside target of $65,635. His technical analysis, shared on X, highlights a completed bearish pattern following a double top formation. “Don’t shoot the messenger. Just reporting on what the chart says until it says something different. Bear wedge completed with 2X target from the double top at 65,635,” Peter Brandt, March 28, 2025 Brandt’s chart illustrates Bitcoin’s rejection at $92,070, followed by a series of lower highs and a tightening wedge pattern. Bitcoin price prediction | Source: X.com/PeterBrandt The breakdown below $85,285 confirms the bearish trajectory, reinforcing concerns of a deeper correction. If BTC continues on this path, a retest of $75,000 could come before reaching the projected downside of $65,635. As selling pressure mounts, traders remain cautious about Bitcoin’s next moves. Whether bulls can reclaim key levels or if further downside awaits will largely depend on macroeconomic developments and investor sentiment in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) at $2.45 is gaining momentum, fueled by legal victories and increasing use in cross-border payments. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) successfully thrives as an operation during this period. MUTM tokens proceed through their fourth presale stage at the current price of $0.025. Since its launch The project has accumulated $5.7 million from 7400+ holders. Moving forward with MUTM purchases today will bring a minimum profit of 3 times the value when Mutuum Finance launches at $0.06 and represents potential 50 times returns if the token reaches $3 during 2025. Mutuum Finance: Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance positions itself as an appealing investment option that draws strong support from investors. Mutuum Finance offers a new definition for decentralized finance by developing a next-generation dual-lending method consisting of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology. Smart contracts through the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model manage lending pools by accepting USDT stablecoins and issuing loans with ETH asset security. Users achieve complete ownership of confidential loan arrangements through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) since this model does not require intermediaries. The dual system achieves maximum security combined with adaptive operations while delivering profits through current APY rates reaching up to 10% for liquidity providers. Built for Security, Stability & Growth Mutuum Finance dedicates itself to security combined with transparency by conducting thorough third-party audits while deploying open-source smart contracts to establish trust. Platform stability improvements will come from launching a stablecoin backed by USD in addition to implementing fee-supported token buyback operations which will uphold price stability for the long term. Through the feature of staking rewards stakeholders receive incentives to maintain their liquidity which bolsters overall confidence within the ecosystem. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 7400 investors. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity The Phase 3 presale opens an exceptional opportunity for people to buy MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.025. MUTM token prices will increase gradually from $0.025 to $0.06 through 11 price stages of the sale period allowing investors to attain 140% return before trading begins. The market experts believe MUTM tokens will reach the $3 milestone following its launch thus becoming one of the foremost DeFi tokens in 2025. During phase 5 investors can acquire MUTM tokens at $0.03 price level which delivers up to 95% instant profit to those who purchased in the initial stage and the current capital level has crossed $5.7 million. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives Mutuum Finance intends to boost adoption by running a $100,000 giveaway that will award 10 participants with $10,000 MUTM tokens each. A referral system provides more benefits to users who successfully connect new investors to the platform which speeds up the community growth rate and user interaction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains strong investor demand through its ongoing presale which produced $5.7 million from more than 7400 token holders. During Phase 4 investors purchase MUTM tokens at $0.025 but Phase 5 will cost $0.03 before the token launches for $0.06 which brings a 140% ROI. That analysis indicates sustained market expansion until 2025 when MUTM will reach minimum price targets exceeding $3. MUTM’s dual lending model that merges P2C and P2P systems brings enhanced security and efficiency and decentralization power to boost its DeFi competition in the market. The crypto project benefits from early adoption through a $100,000 capital giveaway which is paired with referral rewards so the growing community increases market demand.

The transfer of ownership of X to xAI on March 28 means that the class-action lawsuit against Musk — accusing him of defrauding former Twitter shareholders by delaying the disclosure of his initial investment in the social media platform — has become “a whole lot spicer,” Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran said in a March 28 X post. Acquisition may open up xAI to more ‘exposure’ On the same day that Musk said “xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” a US judge reportedly rejected Musk’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit. Cochran said it has “opened up his AI entity to exposure here too, and it’s a much bigger pie.” Source: Grok Musk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, factoring in $12 billion in debt from the $45 billion valuation. He originally bought X, formerly Twitter, for around $44 billion in April 2022 . “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,” Musk said. Source: Bryan Rosenblatt “This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” he said, adding: “This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.” However, Cochran claimed that “Musk used his pumped up xAI stock to pay multiple times over value for X, but still take an $11B loss on the transaction.” He said that Musk is “screwing over xAI investors, and X investors” and was executed to sell user data to xAI. Related: Elon Musk’s ‘government efficiency’ team turns its sights to SEC — Report xAI is best known for its AI chatbot “Grok” which is built into the X platform. When Musk released it in November 2023, he claimed it could outperform OpenAI’s first iteration of ChatGPT in several academic tests . Source: Raoul Pal Musk explained at the time that the motivation behind building Grok is to create AI tools equipped to assist humanity by empowering research and innovation. While Cochran said that Grok being valued at $80 billion is an “insanely dumb valuation,” crypto developer “Keef” disagrees.

As per a letter sent to several key regulatory officials, the senators asked what regulatory agencies plan to do about these concerns as lawmakers seek to move forward with stablecoin legislation. WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin sparks controversy The stablecoin, USD1, is backed by WLFI, which President Trump and his family hold major stakes in. The Trump family involvement creates a potential conflict of interest that could pose serious risks to the nation’s financial system.’ The letter was signed by five Democratic lawmakers in the US Senate The write-up was addressed to Michelle Bowman, the chair of the Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation committee, and Rodney Hood, the acting Comptroller of the Currency. The lawmakers specifically inquired how the agencies plan to regulate WLFI and its newly launched USD1 stablecoin. The letter came as members of Congress are considering legislation to regulate stablecoins through the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act. If signed into law, the bill would essentially allow the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Reserve to oversee stablecoin regulation, including for issuers like WLFI and its USD1 coin. The senators argue that the rollout of a stablecoin overseen by a sitting president poses exceptional risks. “President Trump’s involvement in this venture, as he strips financial regulators of their independence and Congress simultaneously considers stablecoin legislation, presents an extraordinary conflict of interest that could create unprecedented risks to our financial system,” the letter states. Lawmakers warn of Trump’s financial ties influencing stablecoin regulation The senators are concerned about potential conflicts between Trump’s financial interests and the regulatory decisions that will be made by agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The financial ties raise the question, the letter states, of whether financial regulators will make decisions influenced by whether the Trump family — which owns 60% of WLFI’s equity — will benefit. Furthermore, Trump’s executive order in February 2024 has been noted to make the fears worse. The order put federal agencies — including the OCC — on notice to regularly consult the White House on their priorities, potentially handing the president excessive leeway over financial regulation. Such an arrangement, the senators say, also aggravates the existing conflict of interest surrounding the stablecoin. The USD1 stablecoin offered by WLFI saw its launch in late March 2025 and is viewed as a direct competition in the fast-growing digital currency space. Launched on major blockchain platforms, including Ethereum and BNB Chain, details about the company alongside its project have been largely mysterious, fostering additional scepticism among critics. WLFI’s $550M token sales and Trump family ties spark regulatory and ethical concerns Since its launch in September 2024, WLFI has completed two public token sales, raising a total of $550 million. The project has attracted interest for its political connections, with Donald Trump Jr. pitching the stablecoin at the DC Blockchain Summit in March 2025 and playing a role in the push for the coin. The Trump family owns a majority stake in the company. The senators say they are concerned about the potential risks stablecoins pose to the financial system. Still, they also ask for stronger regulatory action in the face of an increasingly widening debate in Congress over the regulation of stablecoins. If instituted, the GENIUS Act would put the OCC and the Federal Reserve at the nexus of regulating stablecoin companies like WLFI to ensure they are held to sophisticated financial standards. President Trump’s February 2024 executive order directing federal agencies to consult with White House officials regularly is facing heightened scrutiny in light of the launch of USD1. This order, which gives the president influence over financial regulators like the OCC and the Federal Reserve, is seen by critics as increasing the potential for conflicts of interest, especially as Trump’s family has major stakes in WLFI. Meanwhile, Congress is advancing the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins), which is another attempt to regulate the risk posed by stablecoins as lawmakers throughout Congress move to address their unregulated aspects. The legislation aims to provide a consistent regulatory framework for stablecoins, granting the OCC and the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate the digital asset ecosystem. If passed, the legislation would impose strict regulatory standards on stablecoin issuers such as WLFI, increasing transparency and accountability in the sector.

The current breakdown has triggered a new worry among investors for a coin that had the prospect of reclaiming its spot among the top 10 largest digital currencies. The LINK price has fallen to $14.1, down 9.12% in the past 24 hours. This latest selloff has also raised the question of where the LINK floor is triggered. Bitcoin Price and Bollinger Bands Insight The Chainlink drawdown is steep and depends on the Bitcoin price selloff triggered by today’s US Core PCE figures . LINK has recorded more selloffs than most altcoins in the top 20 based on a percent decline over 24 hours. LINK has fared much better on longer timeframes, as the token is still up by 1% in the past 7 days. The token’s Year-to-Date (YTD) growth is 34.76%, making analysts wonder if more selloff is inbound. LINK/USDT Price Chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The LINK/USDT 4H Chart offers insight into the Chainlink price outlook. The current price is trading at the lower Bollinger Bands, $14.04. The deviation from the upper bands is a sign of intense volatility, which may or may not go well for the token. Over the past 30 days, the LINK price has not dropped below $13, which is now classified as the next support level to watch. LINK and Dependence on the General Market The broader market is divided on what is next for Chainlink. The Oracle service provider remains one of various institutional clients’ most used blockchain protocols. This means that the adoption of its services depends on the market or external factors. Besides this, the price action of Bitcoin and other altcoins is also a major determinant of its potential rebound. At the time of writing, the price of BTC has dropped to a new weekly low of $83,872.69, down by 3.77% in 24 hours. With the bearish outlook, Peter Brandt said Bitcoin price crashing to $70,000 is not impossible. With Chainlink’s dependence on Bitcoin, the altcoin may maintain its current outlook until the top coin prints a new rally. Major LINK Price Catalyst to Watch Per an earlier CoinGape report, Chainlink inked a deal with the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). This LINK partnership with ADGM will support the development of compliant frameworks for tokenized assets, expand blockchain adoption, and promote regulatory dialogue within the UAE and globally. In an earlier LINK price analysis , projections were made that this partnership may push the token’s price to a high of $44. For now, the protocol’s price action signals caution overall.

The billionaire in an X post that the total value of his xAI company is now $80 billion, and the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) is valued at $33 billion. He noted that the value of X is $45 billion when including $12 billion of debt. Musk also mentioned that the purchase of X by xAI was done through an all-stock transaction. XAI Holdings, the newly formed company, is valued at over $100 billion, excluding debt. Morgan Stanley served as the sole banker for the deal, representing both sides. Elon Musk shared that the futures of XAI and X are now closely linked. By combining xAI’s cutting-edge AI technology with X’s vast audience and resources, he believes that this move will unlock huge potential for both companies. A Stock Swap Since Musk owns both X and xAI, the deal is likely a stock swap, with X investors getting xAI shares. Both the companies have mutual investors including venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity, Vy Capital, and Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Co. Linda Yaccarino, who Musk hired as CEO of X, wrote in a post after Friday’s announcement, “The future could not be brighter.” “The move appears sensible, considering the current trend of increased investments in AI, data centres, and computing,” said analyst Paolo Pescatore, founder of PP Foresight. Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, founded in 2023, recently secured $6 billion in funding, bringing its valuation to $40 billion. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, cutting costs and pushing for less content moderation. This led to a significant drop in advertising revenue. Meanwhile, Musk’s xAI startup, which competes with OpenAI, has been promoting its chatbot, Grok, using data from X users. Musk Leading Tech and Government Reform Alongside leading Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and overseeing X, Elon Musk has spent a lot of time in Washington, D.C., becoming a key figure in Donald Trump’s second administration. After donating nearly $300 million to Trump and other Republican causes for the 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he’s focused on cutting government jobs, reducing spending, and rolling back regulations. This position gives Musk the power to make changes that could benefit his business empire. With Trump back in office and Musk now in the executive branch, X has become the go-to platform for staying updated on the Trump administration.

The move comes as the Trump administration continues pushing USD1, a token issued by his family-owned company World Liberty Financial, into the heart of the U.S. economy. The letter was signed by Elizabeth Warren, Ranking Member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; Ron Wyden, Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee; Chris Van Hollen, Jack Reed, and Cory Booker, all of whom warned that Trump’s dual role as both regulator and private crypto issuer could blow a hole through every existing financial safeguard. They demanded that the Fed and OCC explain how they plan to prevent Trump from using his office to manipulate financial policy and protect his personal business interests. Democrats question Fed and OCC over Trump family’s USD1 The lawmakers said the launch of USD1 places Trump in a position to interfere with financial regulators just as Congress is reviewing the GENIUS Act, a bill that would give the Fed and OCC broad powers over stablecoin oversight. While the bill claims to strengthen crypto enforcement, the version now under review includes no limits on the President’s ability to override regulatory actions that could hurt the profitability of his own token. The senators warned that Trump could step in to block any OCC decision on USD1, demand they avoid setting strong rules for stablecoins, or even stop them from investigating World Liberty Financial altogether. They added that in a crisis, Trump could direct the Fed to launch a liquidity program specifically to prop up stablecoins like USD1—or worse, give special access to WLF by pushing the central bank to grant it a master account, something that would allow direct ties to the Federal Reserve system. The group also flagged the risk that Trump could deny this kind of help to other crypto competitors, creating a completely unfair playing field. They pressed both agencies to confirm whether they’ve put internal controls in place to block political interference and keep regulation, enforcement, and supervision free from White House orders. The senators asked directly: “How will you protect your independence when the President’s own company is the one being regulated?” GENIUS Act advances in Congress Since taking office, Trump has promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world” and claims the dollar-backed stablecoin is a step toward that goal. On March 7, Trump met with two dozen crypto executives at the White House and told attendees he wanted Congress to pass stablecoin legislation and send it to his desk by August. Bo Hines, a senior White House adviser focused on crypto, later said the bill could reach Trump for signing by May. The legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, passed through the Senate Banking Committee with an 18-6 vote. It even got support from five Democrats. But three of the five senators who signed the Friday letter—Warren, Van Hollen, and Reed—voted against it in committee. The other two, Booker and Wyden, aren’t on the committee but still raised concerns about the bill’s lack of checks on presidential power. The GENIUS Act is now headed to the Senate floor. If passed, it would hand stablecoin regulation to the Fed and OCC, but with no clear firewalls to keep the White House out of day-to-day decisions. That’s where the senators see a massive red flag: the very person who signs the bill could also block enforcement actions and tilt the system in favor of his own business.

After briefly touching higher levels of nearly $90,000, the asset has seen a 3.3% decrease over the past day, bringing its current price to roughly $84,222. While price volatility remains a short-term concern, Bitcoin’s broader trend shows signs of consolidation within this range. Amid the movement from BTC’s price, on-chain analysts are offering insights into Bitcoin’s behavior beyond the surface-level price action. Related Reading: CEO On Bitcoin: A Big Idea Whose Time Has Finally Come Bitcoin Mean Coin Age and Supply Dynamics in Focus A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Onchained points to Bitcoin’s Mean Coin Age (MCA) as a crucial metric for understanding current market sentiment. The MCA represents the average age of unspent transaction outputs (UTxOs), which can help reveal the behavior of long-term holders. According to Onchained, Bitcoin’s recent upward momentum is not a product of short-term speculation or news-driven hype. Rather, it is being influenced by the strategic actions of long-term holders. These participants typically acquire BTC during market downturns and hold through volatile phases, reducing the available supply and gradually increasing scarcity. This behavior creates conditions in which even moderate increases in demand can lead to stronger price responses due to reduced liquidity in the market. With Bitcoin’s supply capped at 21 million, the accumulation of coins by long-term holders contributes to a tightening of supply. As these coins become increasingly illiquid, they apply upward pressure on price when demand strengthens. This mechanism is a core feature of Bitcoin’s market dynamics and is viewed by some analysts as a signal of potential bullish continuation. Onchained wrote: This illiquidity creates a supply-demand imbalance, contributing to upward pressure on prices when demand increases. As fewer coins are available for trading, the price becomes more sensitive to buy-side pressure, leading to stronger upward price movements. Monitoring Behavioral Shifts for Market Signals The analysis also highlights the significance of a sudden drop in MCA, which can indicate long-term holders are beginning to move their coins. Such behavior may signal changing sentiment, profit-taking, or reactions to broader macroeconomic conditions. According to Onchained, “the movement of these coins from long-term holders can drive short-term volatility and is a signal that market dynamics are changing.” Onchained emphasized that relying solely on public commentary or high-profile announcements—such as regulatory statements, ETF launches, or tweets from influential figures—may distract from the deeper, data-driven trends that govern Bitcoin’s performance.

The analyst noted: The truth lies within the data itself. The blockchain speaks clearly and transparently, and it is through this data that we can understand bitcoin’s true movement. S.N architected Bitcoin to ensure that the financial information we need is open and accessible to all, so we can make informed decisions, not be misled by the stupidity of popular narratives. Let the data guide us, not the whims of outsiders who misunderstand what is truly happening.

While Cardano and TRON have focused on enhancing scalability and infrastructure, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking another route: making entry into crypto straightforward. Cardano leans on academic research while TRON prioritizes content decentralization, and both have achieved significant growth. BlockDAG, however, demonstrates that turning mining into a game can drive strong momentum. Its Tap Miner, accessed via Telegram, has attracted over 400,000 users by removing barriers to entry. With a presale haul exceeding $208 million and a 2,380% ROI from its first batch, BlockDAG suggests simplicity can unlock real growth. Cardano: A Blockchain Fueled by Peer-Reviewed Development Charles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, started Cardano (ADA) in 2015 to deliver a third-generation blockchain emphasizing long-term goals like interoperability, scalability, and sustainability. The platform is managed by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), known for its commitment to formal verification and research-based development. Cardano’s multi-stage fundraising, running from 2015 to 2017, raised $62.2 million, launching ADA at $0.0024. By September 2017, the platform went live with basic transactional capabilities. It utilizes Ouroboros, a Proof-of-Stake consensus system, and employs a dual-layer design—CSL for transactions and CCL for smart contracts—to maximize efficiency and security. Cardano has steadily progressed in adoption and technical upgrades. As of March 26, 2025, ADA is priced at $0.7456, showing a 13.63% annual increase. The asset sees daily trading volumes exceeding $1.1 billion, marking it as a major player in the blockchain space. TRON: Decentralized Media Sharing at Scale Founded by Justin Sun in 2017, TRON (TRX) aims to reshape digital content distribution by reducing intermediaries between creators and audiences. Its ICO, launched in September 2017 just before China’s crypto restrictions, brought in $70 million. Originally based on Ethereum, TRX migrated to its own blockchain by June 2018. TRON’s structure comprises three layers—Storage, Core, and Application—supporting smart contracts and decentralized apps. Its Delegated Proof-of-Stake model involves 27 elected Super Representatives managing block validation and governance. TRON continues to gain traction, especially in Asian markets. TRX is currently valued at $0.12, up from $0.10 one year earlier, reflecting a 20% annual rise. Its daily trading volume is close to $800 million. With its emphasis on performance, speed, and creator control, TRON remains a leading blockchain project. BlockDAG Made Mining Easy and Turned It Into a Viral Game Instead of relying on traditional mining models, BlockDAG launched Tap Miner—an engaging mobile game within Telegram—which has now brought in over 400,000 users. Over 100,000 people play it each day, proving that fun and accessibility can fuel high participation. Tap Miner removes the need for technical knowledge or hardware, offering a repeatable cycle: earn, upgrade, and keep playing. This gamified format removes entry barriers and encourages continuous use. Its impact isn’t just anecdotal—it’s statistically significant. According to BlockDAG’s CEO Antony Turner, Tap Miner’s performance has been outstanding. Over 800,000 users have joined the broader X1 Miner App platform, with TG Tap Miner acting as the initial gateway for many. This move to make crypto more approachable is paying off. BlockDAG has raised over $208 million in its ongoing presale, selling more than 18.9 billion coins. Its current batch 27 price sits at $0.0248, offering a 2,380% increase from its initial batch price. What BlockDAG is doing is shaping usage habits. Tap Miner is not a side feature—it’s the main engine drawing people into the project. Its simplicity and entertainment value are converting users into long-term participants. As the mainnet launch approaches, this early traction could turn into a solid foundation for broader growth and expansion. Final Remarks! The paths taken by Cardano and TRON are clearly defined—Cardano relies on academic development, and TRON empowers creators through direct access. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is focusing on a different strength: making crypto easier for everyone. With its 800,000-strong user base built through Tap Miner and the X1 Miner App, and an ROI of 2,380% from its first batch, BlockDAG is prioritizing engagement and reach over complexity. If ease of use becomes the key factor in the future of crypto, BlockDAG might be leading that charge rather than following it.

Avalanche offered speed and flexibility for developers and enterprises. But now, BlockDAG is entering the spotlight—not with just another tech upgrade, but by putting users at the center of the experience. Its team includes a respected cryptographer, a university professor, and a CEO focused on global inclusion. BlockDAG’s value lies not only in innovation but in how it turns technology into something people can use. Keynote 3 reflects this shift—away from theoretical promises and toward practical adoption. Chainlink: Bringing Smart Contracts & External Data Together Launched in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, Chainlink (LINK) was built to address the “oracle problem”—the need to connect smart contracts with off-chain data in a secure way. Its ICO ran from July to September 2017, offering tokens at $0.11 and raising about $32 million. The mainnet launched in 2019, giving developers access to decentralized oracles that feed data directly into smart contracts. As of March 26, 2025, LINK trades at $15.85, up 4.52% from the previous day but down 21.43% from its $20.18 value a year earlier. Still, it has grown 14,409% from its ICO price, showing that its early backers have seen long-term rewards. Chainlink’s role as a data bridge keeps it relevant, though its future growth may depend on how new use cases develop within the evolving smart contract landscape. Avalanche: Building for Speed & High-Volume Applications Avalanche (AVAX), created by Ava Labs and launched in September 2020, aims to be a fast and flexible platform for decentralized apps and enterprise-level blockchain solutions. Its July 2020 ICO raised about $42 million, with token prices starting at $0.50. On March 26, 2025, AVAX is priced at $22.76—up 1.15% from the day before. That figure marks a 4,452% increase since its ICO, highlighting its appeal to early investors. Avalanche’s tech supports fast finality and high throughput, making it ideal for DeFi and scalable custom blockchains. Its performance focus remains its biggest strength, and developers continue to explore Avalanche as a base for high-speed blockchain products. BlockDAG’s Leadership Team Is Designed for Real-World Impact At the heart of BlockDAG’s growing momentum is a leadership team with deep experience and a strong track record. CEO Antony Turner is steering global adoption efforts that have helped the project raise more than $208 million, sell 18.9 billion coins, and reach batch 27 at a token price of $0.0248. That’s a 2,380% return since batch one. Turner’s people-first approach has already attracted over 750,000 users through mobile mining apps. On the academic side, Maurice Herlihy—professor at Brown University and a leader in distributed computing—has played a key role in shaping the BlockDAG Academy. His work is giving both new and experienced developers the tools to learn and build on the platform. Security is in the hands of Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj, BlockDAG’s Chief Security Officer. A cryptographic engineer, he is building the infrastructure for a secure, fault-tolerant network. He’s also guiding third-party audits by Certik and Halborn to ensure that the mainnet launch meets industry-leading security standards. This blend of leadership—covering tech, education, and security—gives BlockDAG a foundation built to support long-term adoption, not just hype cycles. Execution & Real Utility Are Becoming the New Standard Chainlink tackled a key gap by enabling real-world data for smart contracts. Avalanche raised the bar with performance. Both have strong use cases. But BlockDAG is carving a new path—one built around accessibility, community tools, and real-world education. Its presale numbers, user engagement, and leadership team suggest something more than just another blockchain launch. BlockDAG is moving from theory to delivery, offering a model where technology and usability grow together. As crypto adoption evolves, the projects that succeed may be those that go beyond just being fast or smart—they’ll be the ones that are easy to use, well-supported, and secure by design. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 points in that direction—and it might just be the kind of blueprint the industry needs next.

As Shiba Inu sees renewed momentum and Meme Index approaches the end of a strong presale, both projects highlight how investor interest can spike with the right narrative. However, Dragoin offers something these others don’t: a structured, stage-based presale that actively rewards early commitment. While SHIB relies on trading volume and Meme Index leans into token aggregation, Dragoin’s Game of Thrones-inspired ecosystem stands out for its clear value proposition tied to early action. Its incremental pricing model doesn’t just incentivize speed—it makes financial sense. For many, it’s not just a meme—it’s strategy. Shiba Inu Surges on Bullish Momentum and Rising Volume Shiba Inu (SHIB) is gaining traction again, up 7% in the past 24 hours and 11% over the past week. This price movement, in turn, is backed by a 228% surge in trading volume, signaling growing bullish sentiment. Moreover, Open Interest has also climbed to $23.88 million, showing increased capital flowing into SHIB derivatives. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below 70, suggesting there’s still room for further upside before the asset becomes overbought. If buying pressure holds, SHIB could retest the $0.00003000 level and potentially aim for $0.00003300. On the other hand, if bears take over, a fallback to $0.00002300 or even $0.00002000 is possible. Consequently, traders are keeping a close eye on momentum indicators and support-resistance zones as SHIB’s price action unfolds. Overall, the current trend shows renewed interest, with data pointing toward optimism—but also caution as key levels are tested. Meme Index Nears $4M Presale Cap Ahead of Exchange Launch Meme Index is entering its final presale week with nearly $4 million already raised, capturing strong investor interest. Notably, the project introduces the world’s first meme coin index platform, offering users exposure to top meme coins through a single token. Through this approach, by using real-time data and community voting, the platform dynamically adjusts its index to track trending meme assets like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk. Importantly, the native $MEME token plays a central role, giving holders both exposure and governance power. Following the presale, with listings set for Uniswap and centralized exchanges, $MEME is positioned to tap into meme coin momentum with a more structured approach. Additionally, its model rewards holders with airdrops, staking benefits, and rebalancing bonuses. As a result, as excitement builds ahead of its launch, the project stands out for combining meme culture with utility, giving traders a simplified way to engage with high-volatility assets. Strike Early, Gain More: Dragoin Rewards First Movers Dragoin’s 25-stage presale model isn’t just a launch strategy—it’s a calculated opportunity for investors who value timing and foresight. Specifically, with each stage, the price of $DDGN rises incrementally, making early participation not only cost-effective but strategically rewarding. In fact, those who enter at Stage 1 secure the lowest possible price per token, meaning their investment stretches further compared to those who join in later rounds. As a result, this model encourages financial prudence. Instead of chasing price spikes post-launch, early buyers are positioned to maximize their token quantity at minimal cost. For instance, purchasing $500 worth of tokens at Stage 1 yields significantly more $DDGN than that same amount invested at Stage 10 or beyond. This becomes especially important when token value appreciates, multiplying potential returns based on entry price and token volume held. Furthermore, by rewarding speed and decisiveness, Dragoin turns early participation into a long-term advantage. At the same time, it builds a sense of urgency, pushing the community to act rather than wait. As such, as tokens become scarcer through the burn mechanism and stage-by-stage price hikes, early investors gain both financial leverage and a head start in the Dragoin ecosystem—from gameplay perks to staking opportunities. Dragoin’s Stage 1 presale is live at $0.0000292, promising a potential 6,700% ROI at the $0.002 launch price. Why Acting Early Could Be the Smartest Move in Crypto Right Now Momentum may drive projects like Shiba Inu and Meme Index into the spotlight, but momentum alone doesn’t guarantee value. Dragoin’s presale strategy is a reminder that structure and foresight often matter more than hype. By rewarding early participation through its incremental pricing model, Dragoin gives investors a clear reason to act early—not just for lower entry prices, but for greater long-term potential. While others chase volatility, Dragoin encourages calculated decisions. For those watching the market closely, the smartest play might not be following the noise—but getting in before the next stage closes.

According to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, as of March 21, 75.8% of SHIB addresses have held their tokens for over 155 days, surpassing Ethereum’s 74.2% and Bitcoin’s 73.3%. This shift suggests that more investors now view SHIB as a long-term asset rather than a short-term speculative play. A closer look at the data reveals a strong trend toward long-term investment in SHIB. Only 2% of holders have owned SHIB for less than a month, while 22% have held it for 1 to 12 months, and 76% for over a year. Among newer cryptocurrencies, SHIB now boasts the longest average holding period at 2.6 years, surpassing Ethereum’s 2.4 years, though Bitcoin still leads at 4.4 years. That said, only Litecoin (LTC) and Chainlink (LINK) have a higher percentage of long-term holders, at 77.7% and 77.5%, respectively. One key driver of SHIB’s long-term appeal is Shibarium , the project’s Layer 2 scaling solution. Adoption of Shibarium has surged, with daily sign-ups skyrocketing over 4,000%, according to data from Shibarium scan. Transaction volumes have also increased significantly, jumping 61% in a month from 2.38 million to 3.82 million. Meanwhile, smart contract deployments have soared 800%, with new contracts rising from 12 to 109 per day. This rapid growth underscores the rising developer interest in building decentralized applications (dApps) on Shibarium, further strengthening the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Beyond network growth, SHIB’s increasing long-term holder base aligns with improving crypto regulations, particularly in the U.S. Recent developments, such as the the establishment of a U.S. crypto research body have also boosted investor confidence, with the SHIB community hopeful SHIB will be added at some point. Speculation is also mounting around a potential Shiba Inu ETF , with growing community advocacy for its approval. Despite this optimism, SHIB’s price has faced bearish pressure, dropping 6.55% in the past 24 hours to $0.00001424 at press time. However, analysts like Master Ananda believe SHIB is approaching a key support level and could rebound soon. “The market bottom was hit in June 2023, and since then, we’ve seen higher highs and higher lows,” Ananda noted on Tradingview. “The 2024 corrective phase is coming to an end, and SHIB is poised for a bullish breakout.” According to Ananda, if history repeats itself, SHIB could rally 600% or more from its current levels, mirroring the 1,800% surge that followed its June 2023 bottom.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-29 02:11:25

With regulatory clarity emerging for blockchain gaming and real-world asset tokenization breaking new ground, the industry is evolving rapidly. Immutable X’s SEC investigation has officially concluded without any charges, boosting confidence in Web3 gaming, while Ondo Finance has crossed $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), showcasing the rising demand for tokenized assets. But where does Qubetics fit into this high-stakes equation? Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another project entering the crypto market. With a revolutionary approach to blockchain development through its QubeQode IDE, it’s solving real-world issues that have plagued both developers and businesses. The inefficiencies of outdated coding platforms, slow development cycles, and complex integrations are being streamlined through Qubetics’ ecosystem. Its powerful, user-friendly development environment is setting a new standard for blockchain application creation one of the top crypto projects to invest in. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Development Qubetics is a blockchain innovation designed to simplify and enhance development processes through its unique QubeQode IDE. Unlike conventional blockchain programming tools that require deep coding expertise, QubeQode offers an intuitive environment where businesses, professionals, and developers can create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) with ease. Imagine an enterprise needing to build a supply chain tracking system but struggling with the complexity of blockchain implementation. QubeQode allows for seamless drag-and-drop functionalities, built-in debugging tools, and real-time collaboration features, reducing development time by more than 60%. This shift isn’t just about efficiency—it’s about accessibility, enabling businesses to integrate blockchain solutions without hiring an army of specialized coders. The numbers reinforce its potential. Qubetics has raised over $15.5 million, with more than 504 million $TICS tokens already sold in its crypto presale . With over 23,900 token holders, the project’s traction is undeniable. Those securing $TICS at its presale price of $0.1300 could see significant growth, with potential ROIs ranging from 669% to 11,437% if market adoption follows its projected trajectory. To put it into perspective, a simple $200 purchase at the current presale stage would yield approximately 1,538 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $1, that $200 could grow to $1,538. And if adoption continues to build momentum and $TICS reaches $15, that same $200 turns into $23,070. That’s the kind of future-focused math that’s drawing attention—and participation. One of the top crypto projects to invest in. Immutable X (IMX): A Milestone for Web3 Gaming For months, the Web3 gaming community has been watching the SEC’s scrutiny of Immutable X, the Ethereum-based layer-2 scaling solution for gaming applications. With the investigation now officially closed, the path is clear for Immutable to drive further innovation without regulatory uncertainty looming over it. Immutable X is already a force in blockchain gaming, providing gas-free transactions, enhanced scalability, and true asset ownership. Its marketplace is home to some of the most promising blockchain gaming projects, ensuring frictionless transactions and seamless interoperability across platforms, one of the top crypto projects to invest in. IMX’s market performance reflects renewed confidence, currently trading at approximately $0.722112—a 12.66% surge within 24 hours. However, its value remains 22.90% below the projected target of $0.936548 by March 30, 2025, indicating that further growth opportunities still exist. For blockchain developers and gaming projects seeking a reliable, scalable, and regulatory-friendly ecosystem, Immutable X remains a top contender. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Redefining DeFi with Institutional-Grade Tokenization Ondo Finance has achieved what many DeFi projects have struggled to accomplish: bridging traditional finance with decentralized assets. By surpassing $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), Ondo is proving that the appetite for tokenized U.S. Treasuries and institutional-grade financial instruments on the blockchain is more than just speculation—it’s becoming a fundamental shift in the financial sector. Ondo’s rise to prominence is based on a straightforward yet powerful premise: providing secure, high-yield, tokenized assets that institutional and retail participants can access with ease. Unlike speculative DeFi protocols, Ondo’s offerings are anchored in tangible, government-backed financial products, giving it a layer of credibility that few crypto projects can match. ONDO is currently priced at approximately $0.78, with analysts pointing to its increasing role in transforming DeFi by enabling real-world assets to be traded in a trustless and permissionless manner. As traditional financial institutions explore blockchain integration, Ondo is positioning itself as a key player in this sector’s evolution. The Road Ahead for These Top Crypto Projects to Invest In The blockchain landscape is shifting fast, with Qubetics, Immutable X, and Ondo Finance leading the charge. Qubetics is making blockchain development more accessible, Immutable X is cementing its place in Web3 gaming with newfound regulatory clarity, and Ondo is redefining institutional DeFi. For those seeking the top crypto projects to invest in , staying ahead of these developments is crucial. Whether it’s Immutable X’s gaming ecosystem, Ondo’s real-world asset tokenization, or Qubetics’ groundbreaking QubeQode IDE, these projects are shaping the future of blockchain technology. Qubetics’ presale is moving fast, and with its ability to solve real-world problems that have hindered blockchain adoption, it’s not just a project to watch—it’s a project to be part of. Stay informed, stay ahead, and embrace the next wave of blockchain innovation. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics a top crypto project to invest in?

How does Immutable X’s SEC clearance impact its future? With regulatory scrutiny lifted, Immutable X is poised for growth in Web3 gaming, making its ecosystem more attractive to developers and gaming projects. Why is Ondo Finance’s $1 billion TVL significant? This milestone highlights the rising demand for tokenized real-world assets, positioning Ondo as a key player in DeFi’s institutional adoption.

After gathering a massive $11.4 billion since its collapse, the cryptocurrency firm is ready to begin making significant payouts as per a latest report from Bloomberg . While smaller creditors with “convenience claims” have already received payments, FTX will begin paying its major debt holders on May 30, according to bankruptcy lawyer Andrew Dietderich, who informed the judge overseeing the Chapter 11 case. The main creditors of FTX are investors who are owed millions of dollars, along with institutions that had cryptocurrency stored on the FTX platform. Massive Payout Challenge The 2022 collapse of FTX, once a leading cryptocurrency exchange, left behind a huge number of creditors from all walks of life. While settling these claims quickly would help preserve the most value, the process is complicated by the massive number of claimants resulting from the exchange’s downfall. What makes it worse is that Bitcoin has increased in value by more than four times since FTX’s bankruptcy, adding to the frustration of many former customers who were hoping to be repaid in digital assets instead of cash. Paying off all creditors will take time, as FTX is dealing with a large number of questionable claims. Lawyer Andrew Dietderich explained that some of these claims could conflict with “know your customer” (KYC) rules, which require FTX to confirm the identities of its creditors. While other claims might not be valid at all, making the process of resolving them more complicated and time-consuming. 27 Quintillion Claims! Intriguingly, FTX is dealing with an overwhelming number of claims, totaling “27 quintillion,” according to Dietderich. A quintillion is 1 followed by 18 zeros—1 billion times bigger than 1 billion. In bankruptcy cases, lawyers typically filter out duplicate, inflated, and false claims after a payout plan is approved by a judge. FTX is facing billions of these flawed claims, Dietderich said. FTX needs to pay legitimate creditors quickly because the interest it’s earning on the $11.4 billion is lower than the 9% rate creditors are earning while waiting for their payments. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 after its crypto platform was shut down and handed over to insolvency experts. It got court approval for its payout plan in October. Atkins Questioned Over FTX Ties U.S. lawmakers grilled potential SEC Chair Paul Atkins over his connections to the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, while also criticizing the agency’s former chair, Gary Gensler. Notably, FTX hired Patomak Global Partners, where Paul Atkins is involved, as an adviser in 2022. Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out the potential conflict of interest that could arise if Atkins is confirmed as SEC Chair, due to his firm’s past ties with FTX.",News|Crypto news|Hack,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 02:31:45

The most notable of these is RCO Finance (RCOF), which has surpassed big heavyweights like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL). RCO Finance: The New Leader in Crypto Innovation RCO Finance’s (RCOF) AI-powered trading platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions are making it the best crypto to buy in 2025. RCOF offers a smooth and effective ecosystem for traders and investors, in contrast to Cardano and Solana, which struggle with scalability and network congestion. Using real-time data analysis, RCO Finance’s AI-powered Robo Advisor is one of its greatest assets. It assists traders in making well-informed judgments. This technology minimizes risks and maximizes profits by allowing users to precisely navigate the cryptocurrency market. RCOF is becoming a favorite among investors because of its quick acceptance, and in the upcoming months, its value is predicted to soar. As more traders become aware of its potential, RCOF is solidifying its position as the best crypto to buy in April 2025. Cardano: A Promising Project Facing Challenges In the cryptocurrency market, Cardano (ADA) has long been regarded as a leading candidate. Cardano has, however, suffered from sluggish development and postponed updates in spite of its robust community and scholarly approach. There is a $722.99 million 24-hour trading volume at the current price of $0.72 per ADA. Cardano’s current value is 76.66% lower than its peak of $3.10. Although it has expanded, it does not have the same explosive potential as RCO Finance. RCO Finance is the best crypto to buy for investors looking for large profits because the market is moving toward projects with instant utility. Solana: High Speed, but With Network Issues Solana (SOL) remains popular among investors and developers due to its high speed and low fee. However, network failures are frequent, and issues with centralization have raised questions about its long-term survivability. It is now trading at $138.21 per SOL , with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.769 billion. Solana is now trading at 53.12% below its all-time high price of $294.85. While it has made notable gains, its volatility makes it less attractive than RCO Finance. RCO Finance is a more stable investment with its decentralized AI-powered ecosystem, and therefore the best crypto to buy in April 2025 for long-term appreciation. RCOF ‘ s Beta Platform: Real- Life Performance The majority of presale projects remain in the idea stage, but RCOF has already introduced its Beta Platform, offering investors the chance to live their experience with its AI-powered Robo Advisor . Such pre-launch exposure makes it clear that RCOF relies on substance, not hype, as it truly helps traders optimize their strategy and risk management. For the interested investor seeking a strong token presale, RCOF’s live Beta Platform is solid proof of its promise. Early birds have been amazed at a clear edge, with Robo Advisor spotting winning bets ahead of when they are trending. Find out more about the RCO Finance Beta Platform. Render has been on a wild ride in the last 24 hours, dipping to a low of $3.1554 before surging to a high of $3.7954, and that’s a 14.19% increase. This price action is a demonstration of the volatility traders can tap into for potential profits. By buying at the lows and selling at the highs, smart investors are able to leverage these variations to the fullest. With RCO Finance’s AI-based Robo Advisor, traders can utilize real-time, data-based insights to navigate the market with precision and confidence. RCO Finance: A Safe and Transparent Investment Safety is the top priority for RCOF. The project has been vetted by SolidProof, ensuring its smart contracts are secure and trustworthy. Being transparent in this way has guaranteed more investor confidence, as presale funding has already reached $14.41 million. RCOF is trading at $0.100000 currently, before the upcoming surge to $0.13000. It is a time-sensitive offer, making it the best crypto to buy before the next price surge. RCO Finance is changing the game when it comes to crypto privacy. Unlike centralized exchanges that have strict KYC requirements, RCOF offers a fully decentralized trading experience. This makes it the choice for investors who wish to maintain financial anonymity while investing in a high-growth project. No KYC translates to safe and convenient trading, further making RCO Finance the best crypto to buy in April 2025. The Future of Crypto Investing: Why RCOF is Ahead With its decentralized model, trading intelligence powered by AI, and fully functional Beta Platform, RCO Finance is surpassing Cardano and Solana. Investors’ demand is surging to an all-time high, with over 51.12% of tokens available already sold.

The company has accumulated $11.4 billion in cash since it shut down and filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. Minor creditors, who hold what FTX labels “convenience claims,” began receiving payments earlier, but the main group of creditors must wait until the end of May. This group includes investors owed millions of dollars such as institutions that held huge amounts of crypto on the platform. They suffered huge losses when the exchange collapsed in 2022. Dietderich informed US Bankruptcy Judge Karen Owens in Wilmington, Delaware, that the delay in paying all creditors stems from a large number of questionable claims. He said that FTX faces “27 quintillion” claims, emphasizing that a quintillion is a 1 followed by 18 zeros. These include duplicates, false claims, or conflict with KYC requiring identity checks. While such large numbers of claims are not unusual in major bankruptcies, Dietderich warned that it will take time to filter out the invalid ones. He added that the company seeks to compensate legitimate creditors as soon as it can. The case is FTX Trading Ltd., 22-11068, in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

An analyst suggests a monthly close above its current range could position the cryptocurrency for a 35% surge. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Key $2.40 Support Amid Breakout – Is A New High Coming? Chainlink Retest Crucial Price Zone Chainlink has retraced 9.1% in the past 24 hours to retest the key $14 support zone again. The cryptocurrency surged 15.7% from last Friday’s lows to hit an 18-day high of $16 on Wednesday, momentarily recovering 35% from this month’s low. However, the recent market correction halted the momentum of most cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling back to the $83,700 mark and Ethereum (ETH) dipping to the $1,860 support zone. Today, LINK dropped from $15 to $14.07, losing all its Wednesday gains. Previously, analyst Ali Martinez noted that the cryptocurrency has been in an ascending parallel channel since July 2023. Chainlink has hovered between the pattern’s upper and lower boundary for the last year and a half, surging to the channel’s upper trendline every time it retested the lower zone before dropping back. Amid its recent price performance, the cryptocurrency is retesting the channel’s lower boundary, suggesting a bounce to the upper range could come if it holds its current price levels. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital highlighted that the token is testing its multi-month symmetrical triangle pattern, which could determine the cryptocurrency’s next move. As the analyst explained, Chainlink consolidated inside a “Macro Triangular market structure” for most of 2024 before breaking out of the pattern during the November market rally. During the Q4 2024 breakout, the cryptocurrency hit a two-year high of $30.9 but failed to hold this level in the following weeks. As a result, it has been in a downtrend for the past three months, with LINK’s price falling back into the Macro Triangle. “The main goal for LINK here is to retest the top of the pattern to secure a successful post-breakout retest,” Rekt Capital detailed, adding, “It’s possible this is a volatile post-breakout retest.” LINK Needs To Hold This Level Rekt Capital pointed out that, historically, Chainlink has had downside deviations into this price range: “Back in mid-2021, LINK produced a downside deviation into this price area in the form of multiple Monthly downside wicks.” Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency is downside deviating “but in the form of actual candle-bodies closes rather than downside wicks” this time. The analyst also highlighted that, like in 2021, LINK is trading within a historical demand area, at around $13-5 and $15.5, testing this zone as support. Based on this, the cryptocurrency must successfully hold this area to “position itself for upside going forward.” Related Reading: Is Solana Preparing For Rally To $180? SOL’s Social Sentiment Hits Historic Positive Levels Moreover, the retest is key for reclaiming the top of its triangular market structure. Breaking and recovering that level would “exact a successful post-breakout retest” and enable the price to target the $19 resistance in the future. The analyst concluded that if LINK closes the month above the triangle top, it “would position price for a successful retest, despite the downside deviation.” As of this writing, Chainlink trades at $14.09, a 6.9% drop in the monthly timeframe.

Despite the token’s dramatic 95% crash just hours after its launch, regulators found no evidence of fraudulent activity or malicious intent on Welch’s part. The once-hyped memecoin skyrocketed to a staggering $500 million valuation before plummeting below $60 million in a matter of 20 minutes, sparking widespread criticism and accusations of a pump-and-dump scheme. JUST IN: ""Hawk Tuah"" girl Haliey Welch says SEC closed its investigation into her crypto meme coin that crashed 95% hours after launch. She says they will not pursue any charges or monetary sanctions. pic.twitter.com/RNxzf6IDjb — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 28, 2025 In a statement, Welch confirmed the SEC’s decision, stating, “The investigation is closed, and I will not face any charges or monetary sanctions.” The SEC recently clarified its stance, asserting that meme coins do not qualify as securities, which may have influenced the outcome. However, the debate around regulatory oversight continues, with concerns about “rug pulls” and investor protection remaining central. Though Welch walks away unscathed from the SEC’s scrutiny, the crypto community remains divided on how to handle such volatile assets. What Experts Are Saying? Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel commented on the development and said, “The SEC did not find “no wrongdoing.” That’s not something the SEC ever says when closing an investigation. Rather, the current administration has declared meme coins are not securities, and thus the SEC has no jurisdiction.” James Murphy, also known as Metalawman, said it’s no surprise. Meme coins are typically not considered securities, so the SEC has no jurisdiction. The SEC is focusing on its core responsibilities these days.

42563495,https://coingape.com/?p=246562,1743220006,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Here’s Why Peter Schiff Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) Price Crash to $10K,https://coingape.com/heres-why-peter-schiff-predicts-bitcoin-btc-price-crash-to-10k/,"Peter Schiff, a BTC critic, has recently predicted that Bitcoin price could plummet to as low as $10,000. Schiff has expressed concerns over Bitcoin’s long-term viability, particularly in comparison to gold. His argument revolves around Bitcoin’s current performance, which he believes is being driven by short-term hype rather than solid fundamentals. Schiff’s prediction is particularly alarming for those who view Bitcoin as a store of value. In the current trends, Peter Schiff notes that millions of young people are invested in Bitcoin while gold, a standard hedge, is pushing higher. This view stems from his assertion that when gold prices rise to new record levels then the value of Bitcoin may plummet. “By the time they get to their target of $5K for gold, they will drag Bitcoin down to $10K, meaning a drop of 95% from the highest it was valued at in 2021,” Schiff reasoned. Bitcoin Price Recent Performance Against Gold According to Peter Schiff, Bitcoin price has underperformed in relation to gold. Gold prices recently broke through $3,000 per ounce as global economic conditions continued to affect the global economy. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has depreciated in value, especially in terms of the precious metal, gold. Since early 2025, the prices of Bitcoin have come down by over 30% against gold with one Bitcoin currently only equivalent to 27.4 ounces of gold as compared to 41 ounces in December of 2021. If Bitcoin is an asset that people only buy when the stock market is going up and risk appetite is high, what is it that investors are buying? It's not a stock as it will never have earnings or pay a dividend. It's clearly not a risk-off asset, a store of value, or digital gold. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 28, 2025 Another issue that Schiff dislikes about Bitcoin also revolves around its categorization as a “risk asset.” He says that BTC price movements are synchronized with the rest of the market, especially when investors are more willing to take risks. While gold provides investors with a safe-haven, the Bitcoin price operation is defined as having a volatility closer to that of the traditional markets among investors. Therefore, as argued by Peter Schiff, BTC price may decline as investors turn to the safe-havens, such as gold, in turbulent times. Market Analyst Weigh In On Bitcoin Trend Several market analysts are echoing Schiff’s concerns, suggesting that Bitcoin price could face challenges in the near term. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, has pointed out that Bitcoin might be on a path to $65,635, citing a “bear wedge” pattern that has emerged in the cryptocurrency’s price charts. Meanwhile, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe shared his own cautious outlook on Bitcoin’s short-term prospects. Van de Poppe noted that while Bitcoin price has been holding above the $80,000 mark, its price action is starting to show signs of weakness. He added, “It starts to look slightly less good,” and suggested that if Bitcoin falls below $84,000, a deeper correction could be imminent. Similarly, the crypto trader TheKingfisher expressed doubts about a sustained bullish recovery, indicating that Bitcoin’s current price movement aligns with a typical market cooldown. He suggested that Bitcoin could be approaching a “seasonal reset” as part of the broader market trend. Alternative Views on Bitcoin’s Future Trend Not everyone shares Peter Schiff’s pessimism about Bitcoin price. Charlie Morris, founder of ByteTree, highlighted that despite recent challenges, Bitcoin may have already seen its worst. He explained that while gold ETFs are experiencing slower inflows, Bitcoin could be positioned for a potential recovery. This view contrasts sharply with Peter Schiff’s, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency may not be as doomed as some critics suggest.

On March 27, hackers executed a series of coordinated moves, dumping large amounts of Ethereum onto the market. This has, understandably, raised some concerns about volatility and security within the Ethereum ecosystem. Not to mention, those hackers probably shouldn’t be doing what they’re doing. This has all been happening alongside a severe downturn in Ethereum-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Not fun times for investors in the digital asset world. The Hack: Large ETH Dump and the Impact on the Market As per the latest reports, a fresh wallet has obtained 3,433 ETH from the THORChain decentralized liquidity network. It then promptly sold the same for 6.8 million DAI, putting the price per ETH at $1,981 during the time of the sale. This transaction, albeit a large one, was just an appetizer. Two other wallets, possibly linked to the same group of intruders, were served the main course—a total of 14,064 ETH obtained from THORChain and the Chainflip decentralized exchange. These wallets then flipped their Ethereum for 27.5 million DAI at an average price of around $1,956 per ETH. Hackers are dumping $ETH ! 2 new wallets(likely related to hackers) received 14,064 $ETH from #THORChain and #Chainflip , then dumped for 27.5M $DAI at an average selling price of $1,956. https://t.co/hSP1PRGpuL https://t.co/6axvL6d7Dg pic.twitter.com/7RoYCGMdWD — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 28, 2025 The dump of ETH is very concerning, and the amount involved — more than 17,000 ETH — is a substantial portion of what’s available on the market. The pressure this forced onto Ethereum opened a window for speculators to take the price down. And for a token that has been struggling to find legs lately, the market did not need any help from the outside to lower it further. Meanwhile, the hackers behind the hack have plenty of other avenues to explore with their DAI. They could convert it to another asset, still using a pseudo-anonymous method through mixers and other tools. Or, they could find a way to put it to work, which is honestly something we should all be holding our breath for. Ethereum ETFs See Outflows Amid the Market Disturbance Following the ETH dump, there has been a direct impact on Ethereum-related financial products. On March 27, Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had a total net outflow of $4.22 million. Notably, none of the nine Ethereum ETFs that we tracked during this timeframe were able to muster any net inflows. This fact, coupled with the total outflow, indicates a pronounced turn in investor sentiment toward these Ethereum products. On March 27, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $89.06 million, marking the tenth consecutive day of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $4.22 million, with none of the nine ETFs recording any net inflow. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 28, 2025 This is a big step for Ethereum. For ETF, see “Ethereum ETF.” An Ethereum ETF would allow institutional investors to invest in the Ethereum blockchain and Ether, the cryptocurrency that blockchain “powers,” without holding Ethereum directly. This is a great way for institutional investors to get exposure without holding the underlying asset. The problem is that it makes Ethereum a far less stable investment in the long run. And this is quite clearly because there are security issues with Ethereum. Broader Implications for Ethereum and the Crypto Market Hacker actions and Ethereum ETF liquidations: a warning to the crypto universe. Ethereum ETFs have been selling ETH in big quantity—Ethereum ETF liquidations have been a problem recently. Hackers, meanwhile, haven’t been sitting idle. They’ve also been selling off a big pile of ETH. The outflows (and the ETH price drop that has accompanied them) are ostensibly related to the pens we’ve been putting together for the Ethereum ETF that we expect to be and to make big waves in the near future. But informal reports from various factions over inside the Ethereum network also suggest that those network vulnerabilities are currently being more than usually exploited. And when you put all this together—Ethereum ETF liquidations, the selling off by hackers, and the fact that those hackers are allegedly exploiting network vulnerabilities—you realize that there’s a fair bit of Ethereum that’s been dumped, for several different reasons, into a not very accommodating price environment. Apart from the direct selling pressure on Ethereum, the actions of these hackers could have consequences for how Ethereum is viewed in the long term. When something is described as ‘risky and unpredictable,’ people tend to hold back from embracing it, and the much-told tale of crypto-risks seems like a narrative under which potential new investors might be dissuaded from engaging with Ethereum or institutional players from getting involved in crypto whatsoever. And that kind of dissuasion is not helpful for Ethereum’s adoption as a global asset. The drop-off in Ethereum ETF inflows could show that traditional investors are even more hesitant to get into the crypto space, especially after recent security issues. They (ETFs) have been seen as a vehicle for exposure that’s safer, if not exceedingly so, and that’s certainly a factor in the kind of regulated environment these ETFs provide. But if fewer institutional investors want in and if they’re even pulling back from this vehicle as a way to get into the crypto market, then that’s, I think, a credible sign for a broader pullback. What’s Next for Ethereum? Questions about the cryptocurrency’s future keep surfacing when hackers offload Ethereum onto the open market and when institutional investors shy away from Ethereum ETFs. But despite these recent disturbances, not just to the price but to the very security of the Ethereum network, the fundamentals of the Ethereum market, I believe, remain strong: Ethereum is more scalable than ever; it is more useful than ever as a decentralized finance platform; and as for price volatility, well, that is a hallmark of all cryptocurrencies. To restore Ethereum’s recent sell-off and rebound back to where it was, not so long ago, the digital currency must reassert its security—even more so given the recent high-profile hack of a major Ethereum-based service. That security must be reinforced against the sorts of attacks that brought down the Ethereum service on July 20. Ethereum could be more volatile in the short term. This is particularly true if the hackers behind the recent sell-offs are forced to liquidate even more of their holdings. But sell-offs caused by hackers don’t reflect on the long-term health of a cryptocurrency—only its short-term price action. And Ethereum’s price isn’t the only thing that has been moving when it comes to this altcoin—some very significant developments have been occurring. So let’s get into those.

They are fueled mostly by the actions of long-term holders. When I say, “long-term holders,” I mean investors who buy Bitcoin at low prices, hold it for extended stretches of time, and think very little about the liquidity of their Bitcoin investments. These investors marry their Bitcoin, and like the loyal spouses and partners that many of us are, they promise to stay with their Bitcoin, in sickness and in health and till death do us part, for the longest and most serious stretch of time. Bitcoin’s Current Market Dynamics: The Role of Long-Term Holders One of the primary telltales that disclose the market behavior of long-term Bitcoin investors is the Mean Coin Age (MCA). The MCA measures the average age of all Bitcoin in circulation and indicates how long holders have kept their assets before moving them. When the MCA is high, it’s kind of like saying that a significant portion of the Bitcoin in existence has been held for a long time and not moved, kind of like the way people keep their money in long-term savings accounts. These long-term holders are not only less likely to sell but also have held onto their Bitcoins since before the last couple of bull runs. So they’re probably in it for the long haul and are not the kind of people who push around the liquidity in the market. Bitcoin’s price isn’t just hype—it’s driven by long-term holders. • Mean Coin Age (MCA) shows they buy cheap, hold tight, and reduce liquidity. • Less $BTC available + rising demand = price squeeze. • If MCA starts dropping, a market shift could be coming. Forget the… pic.twitter.com/lUHO5JydpY — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 28, 2025 Currently, the price movement of Bitcoin can largely be attributed to the behavior of long-term holders, who are maintaining the upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. In the past several months, the price action indicates continued dominance by these investors, who have been reluctant to sell even when the broader market has been undergoing its own fluctuations. Yet, this may not last much longer. Some recent indicators suggest that the price movement dynamics are shifting. Possible Shift in Market Sentiment A possible warning sign that a market is shifting can be seen in the Mean Coin Age (MCA). If the MCA begins to decrease, this could signal that more Bitcoin is changing hands, apparently between wallet addresses. This in turn suggests that Bitcoin holders are becoming either less confident or more nimble (or both) and are either readying to sell or to move their coins in advance of a possible price drop. A likely outcome of lowering the MCA is that it could increase the supply of Bitcoin in the marketplace. (Recall that the now-in-effect MCA had already decreased the supply, which is presumably one reason for the increase in Bitcoin’s price.) If the same decline in demand accompanied this possible increase in supply, then downward price pressure could very well result. This would definitely not be a desirable outcome for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Positive Signs: U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Seeing Record Inflows Even though a possible market shift is worrisome, there are still some good signs for Bitcoin investors. One of the most encouraging developments is the ongoing growth of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. On March 27, they had a net inflow of $89.06 million. This was the tenth consecutive day of net inflows. So about four and a half months into 2023, it’s increasingly clear that institutional capital is being directed toward Bitcoin-focused ETFs. On March 27, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $89.06 million, marking the tenth consecutive day of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $4.22 million, with none of the nine ETFs recording any net inflow. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 28, 2025 The consistent influx of assets into Bitcoin ETFs underscores Bitcoin’s emerging legitimacy in conventional finance. Investors are clamoring for more ways to access this digital asset, and the ETF has become the vehicle of choice. Yet, three things stand in the way of that becoming a reality. The ongoing success of Bitcoin ETFs, however, raises an important question: are the inflows into them driven by the institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term price performance, or are they just a result of speculation on its short-term price movements? If the latter, then these vehicles might not aid stabilizing long-term price performance for Bitcoin; and, in fact, they could make things worse. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Although it is impossible to say with certainty what direction Bitcoin will take next, the current market situation is one of delicate balance. The actions of long-term holders have been the main factor influencing the price of the cryptocurrency of late, but the potential for a shift in the market is very real. As the number of BTC available in the market continues to rise and the dynamics of the market shift, it becomes even more important for investors to stay alert and watch for signposts that might indicate the next price move. One way to do this is to look at the diversification of Bitcoin supply across market participants. Regardless of the long-term investment strategy one adheres to, Bitcoin is an asset whose income-bearing qualities one must respect. Some holders of Bitcoin may argue against this and state that they intend to hold their assets indefinitely. Yet, even those long-term holders must acknowledge the reality of the potential income that their assets could yield short of simply sitting back and waiting for their portfolio to appreciate. The next few weeks will be critical in deciding if the Bitcoin market will be propelled by long-term holders or if a new trend will push it in a different direction, reshaping its price pattern. For now, Bitcoin remains an intriguing but volatile asset, one that continues to attract a lot of eyes from investors all over the world. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

CZ Responds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has rolled out two new mechanisms designed to boost community involvement in token management: Vote to List and Vote to Delist. These initiatives allow users to have a direct say in which tokens get listed or removed from the platform, hinting at a more decentralized decision-making. However, amid the excitement, fake news began circulating claiming that Binance plans to delist Ethereum (ETH) from its CEX. This rumor quickly sparked panic among traders, but Binance’s Changpeng Zhao (CZ) addressed it, dismissing the claims with a sharp response: “Whoever believes this deserves to be poor.” Whoever believes this deserves to be poor. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) March 28, 2025 Despite CZ’s firm rebuttal, the situation has ignited a broader debate within the crypto community. A data analyst raised concerns in the comment section, explaining the potential drawbacks of Binance’s listing and delisting strategies. According to the analyst, new tokens often experience hype-driven price surges, only to crash by over 95% post-unlock. “New listings are overhyped, then crash hard. Old coins get delisted or monitored when they no longer benefit Binance or show low trading volumes,” the analyst pointed out. This pattern has led some to question whether Binance is repeating the mistakes of other top exchanges like Bittrex and Poloniex, which faced declines after neglecting user interests. The analyst added, “Memecoins today, gone tomorrow. If Binance wants to stay #1, it needs to address this imbalance. Retail traders deserve better!” As Binance continues to dominate the crypto space, the focus now shifts to how the exchange will balance community-driven decisions with the long-term interests of its diverse user base.

The developments centered around recent news reports that allege Davis has been up to some not-so-savory activities concerning the $MELANIA token. In short, it seems Davis has been liquidating his $MELANIA holdings in a very underhanded manner and sending the millions of tokens he’s been cashing out to a series of centralized exchanges. For weeks, Davis’s wallets lay inactive, prompting many to think he’d abandoned his token ventures. But just 12 days ago, his MELANIA wallets burst back into life. Davis was last seen in this space with tokens like LIBRA, which he upped the ante with in a previous expose done in conjunction with YouTuber-investigator Coffeezilla. With his recent wallet activity, he’s now hitting us big again with these transactions. Covert Moves: Millions in MELANIA Tokens Sent to Exchanges For the past fortnight, Hayden Davis has been busily divesting himself of MELANIA tokens through a little-known method called single-sided liquidity. It’s a way of selling into liquidity pools that doesn’t require a corresponding buy order to keep things in balance—a fact that could, in theory, be making token prices go down. In any case, on September 21, Davis sold us $1,065,153 worth of alarms. These movements are very similar to the ones that Davis used in the launch and sale of LIBRA, a token that has also drawn a lot of controversy because of the price manipulation tactics that it uses. So, a lot of people in the cryptocurrency community are now asking whether he is using the same strategy with these tokens to benefit financially while screwing over retail investors and the broader market. 1/ Hayden Davis is STILL selling MELANIA He recently sent $1M to exchanges and extracted over $2M from the liquidity pools pic.twitter.com/1sWIkGmtxj — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) March 28, 2025 In addition to the amounts transferred to centralized exchanges, Davis also pulled in more than $2 million from the liquidity pools. These moves seem to indicate that he is taking advantage of the increased liquidity of $MELANIA to lock in some seriously profitable trades, once again raising the issue of whether his trading is aboveboard. A Pattern of Market Manipulation: LIBRA, MELANIA, and Beyond Hayden Davis and his tokens, like LIBRA and MELANIA, are not well understood. They are surrounded by controversy and suspicion. Davis is involved in several projects, and many of those have hit significant rough patches—price volatility and even tampering have led to concerns that Davis may just be pumpin’ them up so that he can serendipitously cash in on the upswing. Most recently, Davis has done just about all that he can do to category-amplify suspicions regarding MELANIA. Davis employs a strategy that sells large amounts of tokens. These are not just any tokens; they are carefully chosen and gelled with gleam over them. The next two sections offer a closer look at the standout ones, even as we keep in mind that not all kinds of standouts are worth holding or using. Davis’s tactics, which involve the strategic selling of large quantities of tokens through liquidity pools, appear to be part of a broader strategy to extract value from the market without necessarily creating long-term value for holders or users of the tokens. His approach to liquidity pools also allows him to offload tokens in a way that might not be immediately visible to other market participants. His wallets had stayed inactive for weeks. Then they suddenly began to dump large quantities of MELANIA tokens. This doesn’t look good. None of this looks good. What does look good is the sailing away of profit that appears to be coming from Davis’s wallet, which is quite imbuing with the previously mentioned pattern of following consistent, reliable profit in consistently, reliably undetectable ways. Implications for the MELANIA Community and the Crypto Market Hayden Davis is selling MELANIA tokens at an ongoing pace, and this has left many holders in a state of uncertainty. For investors holding onto their MELANIA tokens, recent sales have likely created downward price pressure, which has led some to recently express concern over the potential for losses on the tokens (especially for those with higher average purchase prices). Davis’s wallets that haven’t yet sold their tokens also have many wondering if the future holds even more sell-offs and lower prices. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is called into question by Davis’s actions. Despite substantial developments in the space, cryptocurrency still seems to be without the sorts of clear regulatory guidelines that most industries have. This is in part because, as we know, the whole business of cryptocurrencies—from mining to trading to storing them securely—takes place in a virtual world that’s accessible only to a select few. And when we talk, in the context of Davis’s case, about holding people accountable for their actions, we have to remember that the world of cryptocurrency is one where price manipulation and market abuse can occur without leaving behind many discernible trails. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale for Investors The MELANIA market is ongoing, and Hayden Davis is in it and making moves. It is a reminder of the species of market risk that attaches to the MELANIA token and to investing in highly speculative tokens, especially when they are connected to market manipulative personalities. Davis’s sell-offs are, in a way, an act of caution psychology that should give pause to anyone tempted toward entering in or staying long around MELANIA. The cryptocurrency market is maturing, and with this maturation comes the need for increased transparency and regulatory oversight. Without stronger protections in place, individual investors and pension funds alike are left vulnerable to the machinations of trading firms that prefer to operate in the shadows. Clearly, my view is that the actions of firms like the one that employed Hayden Davis are bad for the markets, and things are going to have to change. Until they do, be careful out there.

The crypto firm, backed by President Trump’s family, has raised concerns within the Senate Banking Committee. In a March 28 letter , they called on key officials, including Michelle Bowman of the Federal Reserve and Rodney Hood of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to outline their plans for regulating WLFI and its stablecoin. Congress to Decide on Stablecoin Rules The letter comes as Congress debates the GENIUS Act, a new bill aimed at regulating stablecoins. If passed, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act would give the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve the power to oversee stablecoin issuers like WLFI and its USD1 coin, marking a major shift in crypto regulation. In February, Trump signed an executive order that mandates federal agencies, like the OCC, to regularly coordinate with the White House, giving the president greater control over federal decisions and policies. “President Trump’s involvement in this venture, as he strips financial regulators of their independence and Congress simultaneously considers stablecoin legislation, presents an extraordinary conflict of interest that could create unprecedented risks to our financial system and to the integrity of decisions made by the [Fed and OCC],” the letter noted. “The launch of a stablecoin directly tied to a sitting President who stands to benefit financially from the stablecoin’s success presents unprecedented risks to our financial system.” Senators Raise Red Flags Over Trump’s Stablecoin Ties Senators are questioning how regulators can effectively oversee WLFI, considering its close connections to the current president. At the same time, Congress is pushing for new laws to regulate stablecoins—digital currencies meant to work like the dollar for holding value or buying other crypto assets. Launched in March 2025, WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin is seen as a direct competitor in the booming digital currency market. Available on major blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain, the project’s limited transparency has raised skepticism among critics. Meet USD1 — the stablecoin your portfolio’s been waiting for.

This would seem to indicate the emergence of significant trends and investment preferences in our space. What are some of these very particular narratives? From the not-so-secret world of the burgeoning memecoin sector to the plainly visible rising prominence of AI-driven platforms, to the less visible resurgence of gold-backed tokens, investors are apparently diversifying their strategies and making carefully targeted investments in a handful of very select cryptocurrencies. The latest data shows an unmistakable interest from smart money in memecoins, AI projects, and gold-backed tokens. The most heavily collected assets were memecoins and unique narratives, with 17 wallets accumulating them. Smart money also engaged with the AI sector, with 10 wallets focusing on that. Gold-backed tokens earned the attention of 5 smart money wallets. These actions are reflective of a larger phenomenon, with movements in the wallets of smart money indicating new opportunities being seized in the exciting (and rapidly growing) sectors of memecoins, AI, and gold-backed tokens. Memecoins Continue to Dominate Smart Money Accumulation The memecoin market is still bringing in the smart cash, betting on tokens with strong community loyalty, unique stories, and viral growth potential. Investors are most focused right now on $BROCCOLI, $PIKA, and $WOLF. $BROCCOLI, a memecoin connected to CZ’s dog, saw the highest accumulation within this category. For this memecoin, 10 smart money wallets accumulated $103,000 worth of it, making its market cap $56.5 million. Its unique narrative and AI-powered features helped in its appeal, but its listing on Binance was probably the big factor in drawing so much attention. $PIKA, another memecoin that gained attention because of its ties to protests, attracted six smart money wallets and accumulated $20,000. Despite its smaller market cap of $874,000, $PIKA’s unique narrative has resonated with investors and made it one of the standout tokens in the memecoin space. Meanwhile, $WOLF, a memecoin strongly tied to $PEPE, also attracted the attention of two smart money wallets that accumulated $10,000. With a market cap of $25.5 million, $WOLF continues to draw attention because of its alignment with other popular meme-based assets. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: Memecoins and unique narratives (17 wallets) AI and AI Agents (10 wallets) Gold-backed tokens (5 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $BROCCOLI (CZ's Dog) ->… pic.twitter.com/uLswbQPt5L — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) March 28, 2025 AI Tokens See Growing Investor Interest The AI segment keeps pulling in hefty funds as the story arc around artificial intelligence and AI agents swells to become a driving force in the crypto market. In the past 24 hours, AI-focused projects such as $SERV and $DKING have captured the attention of discerning investors, to the tune of what looks like some smart money flowing into them. $SERV, a platform positioned as a leader in AI agent technology, attracted 2 smart money wallets that accumulated $10K worth of the token. With a market cap of $16 million, $SERV is drawing attention due to its strong partnerships and potential for growth in the AI-driven space. Another AI project, $DKING, which combines sports betting with AI, received $18K worth of investments from 3 smart money wallets. With a market cap of just $5 million, $DKING is still in its early stages but shows promise with its innovative approach to blending AI with traditional sports betting platforms. Gold-Backed Tokens: A Secure Investment Amid Volatility Even though the memecoin and AI sectors are where many smart money investors are currently active, traditional assets aren’t being completely ignored. Investors are increasingly turning to tokenized gold as a safe haven investment. Over the last 24 hours, two of the most accumulated tokens in the gold-backed sector were $PAXG and $cbBTC. $PAXG, a token backed by physical gold, remains a decent, stable investment amid the ongoing volatility of the crypto market. One smart money wallet recently accumulated $22K worth of $PAXG (market cap = $668 million). Listed on a number of exchanges, $PAXG appears to be attracting a fair number of investors looking for a more secure store of value in the crypto space. Moreover, $cbBTC, a Bitcoin token that has been wrapped and is now issued by Coinbase, has drawn the sharp interest of some extremely well-connected investors. In this case, two different wallets picked up $76K worth of $cbBTC. With a market cap of $700 million, the token’s abilities to work across different blockchain networks and its solid foothold in the market provide a nice option for those wanting to diversify their portfolios and still have a play in Bitcoin. Conclusion: Smart Money Continues to Diversify Across Key Narratives The last 24 hours of activity from smart money have shown a relatively narrow focus, but that is exactly the point. It appears the cryptocurrency market is undergoing a movement from broad diversification within portfolios to sector specialization. And in the past 24 hours, if you invested in three specific areas—memecoins, AI-driven platforms, and gold-backed tokens—you would have seen a serious uptick in the value of those assets, thanks in part to some special situations playing out within those three sectors. The crypto market keeps evolving, but smart money is betting on assets of two kinds: the kind we can only dream are secure and stable, from speculative coins like $BROCCOLI and $PIKA to cutting-edge AI tokens like $SERV and $DKING, and the kind we know for sure is secure and stable, like gold-backed tokens ($PAXG and $cbBTC) and other reliable infrastructure of digital finance. This is a bet worth studying: It speaks to the relativity of today’s market. Some investors go bold; some play it safe. What can we learn from the smart-money playbook?

Popcat and Brett Coin have shown impressive price movements, but they remain highly speculative. In contrast, Dragoin stands out by combining meme culture with strong tokenomics, giving it a distinct advantage. While Popcat benefits from a surge and Brett Coin shows recovery potential, Dragoin is uniquely positioned with its community-driven ecosystem, a play-to-earn game, and a clear roadmap for growth. This blend of viral appeal and solid financial backing makes Dragoin a more promising investment opportunity. Popcat’s Recent Surge: A Closer Look Popcat, a meme coin within the Solana ecosystem, has recently experienced a notable price surge. On March 25, 2025, Popcat’s price reached $0.2722, marking its highest level since March 3. This increase has propelled its market capitalization to approximately $254 million, positioning it as the sixth-largest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem. Additionally, the quantity of Popcat tokens held on exchanges has declined by nearly 10% over the past week, now totaling 237.85 million tokens. This reduction suggests that investors are transferring their holdings from exchanges to private wallets, a behavior often interpreted as a bullish indicator. Furthermore, these developments occur alongside a broader recovery in meme coins within the Solana network, including tokens like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Peanut the Squirrel, all of which have seen price increases exceeding 20% in the last seven days. However, it’s important to note that while Popcat’s recent performance is promising, the meme coin market is known for its volatility. Brett Coin Price Forecast: A Look at Its Potential Growth Brett Coin ($BRETT), a meme coin tied to the Base blockchain, has seen notable price swings since its launch. After reaching an all-time high of $0.236 in December 2024, the coin faced a sharp decline at the beginning of 2025. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about its future. By the end of 2025, some predictions suggest that Brett could stabilize at around $0.10, with the potential to revisit its peak near $0.24. Looking further ahead, the coin is expected to see steady growth, with average predictions of $0.35 in 2026 and even a possible $0.50 if it achieves wider adoption. For 2030, the more bullish outlook places Brett at approximately $2.73, depending on successful partnerships and increased usage within the Base blockchain ecosystem. However, like many meme coins, Brett remains highly speculative, and its future success will depend on broader market conditions and community engagement. Dragoin Combines Viral Appeal with Serious Investment Potential Dragoin ($DDGN) is shaping up to be a meme coin with more than just viral appeal.

The “abrupt halving model” of Bitcoin frequently results in miner turnover and a lack of network stability. Similarly, Ethereum struggles with high gas fees and limited scalability, which are persistent issues. On the other hand, BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces a “continuous halving model” that smoothly decreases rewards, helping to sustain miner profitability and avoiding sharp declines. This methodical reduction not only retains miner participation but also promotes the overall health of the network for the long haul. Consequently, BlockDAG emerges as a viable answer to the challenges encountered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, establishing itself as a forward-looking model for upcoming blockchain infrastructures. Bitcoin: The Trailblazer of the Digital Currency Era Introduced in 2009 by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin emerged as the inaugural decentralized digital currency, ushering in a revolutionary era in finance. Starting from a value of nearly nothing, its first noteworthy exchange was in 2010 when 10,000 BTC were traded for two pizzas. Over time, Bitcoin transitioned from relative anonymity to widespread acceptance, characterized by both extreme volatility and remarkable growth. In November 2013, it hit a milestone of $1,000 per BTC for the first time, escalating to a peak of about $20,000 by December 2017. Despite significant price swings, Bitcoin has shown tenacity, surpassing its prior peak in 2021 with a value exceeding $60,000. As of March 26, 2025, Bitcoin’s price stands at roughly $87,847.17, an astounding rise of over 2,928,000% since its inception. This trajectory has resulted in substantial returns for early adopters and buyers who maintained their stakes, as Bitcoin continues to lead the cryptocurrency market, functioning both as a digital reserve of value and a safeguard against inflation. Ethereum: Pioneering Programmability in Blockchain Conceived by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and officially launched on July 30, 2015, Ethereum has significantly altered the blockchain landscape. Unlike Bitcoin, which is often likened to digital gold, Ethereum introduced a programmable blockchain, empowering developers to create decentralized solutions and applications (dApps). Its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014 saw Ether (ETH) priced at only $0.31 per token, amassing over $16 million. This groundbreaking innovation swiftly gathered a robust developer community, which catalyzed the proliferation of numerous decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and NFTs. Ethereum’s price experienced a meteoric rise from under $10 in 2016 to more than $1,000 by January 2018. As of March 26, 2025, Ethereum’s value has climbed to approximately $2,068.60, demonstrating an extraordinary growth of over 667,000% since its ICO. This impressive surge has delivered tremendous gains for early backers, solidifying Ethereum’s pivotal role in driving blockchain innovations and the flourishing DeFi landscape. Revamping Miner Rewards: BlockDAG’s New Method vs. Bitcoin’s Classic Approach Bitcoin’s halving process has always been a mixed blessing. Precisely every four years, the miner rewards are cut by 50%, leading to dramatic declines in revenue that challenge profitability. This “abrupt halving model” tends to push less efficient miners out, potentially leading to network centralization and security risks. Contrastingly, BlockDAG employs a different strategy with its “continuous halving model” . This model smoothly tapers off rewards following a geometric curve, rather than implementing steep cuts. This gradual reduction enables miners to adjust gradually, ensuring sustained profitability and avoiding abrupt financial shocks. This method helps maintain a healthier network by keeping a larger number of participants active. BlockDAG’s effective strategy is underscored by its impressive performance metrics. During its presale phase, it raised $208 million, with its coins currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27. From the first batch, the return has escalated to a notable 2,380%. Moreover, more than 18.9 billion coins have been sold, indicating robust community support and buyer confidence. In stark contrast to Bitcoin, which experiences significant mining disruptions with each halving, BlockDAG’s steady reward reduction model ensures continuous miner motivation, fostering enduring stability across the network. This approach is vital for preserving miner involvement, promoting decentralization, and enhancing security measures. As Bitcoin continues to struggle with miner retention post-halving, BlockDAG’s sustainable approach offers a viable solution to some of the enduring challenges in the blockchain arena. As this model gains traction, it could potentially revolutionize the way cryptocurrency networks address miner incentives and maintain network security. Redefining Blockchain Sustainability Using BlockDAG As the blockchain sector evolves, the limitations of established protocols like Bitcoin’s “abrupt halving” and Ethereum’s scalability hurdles are becoming more apparent. Bitcoin faces the danger of losing miners due to its sharp reward reductions, while Ethereum deals with ongoing network congestion. In this landscape, BlockDAG’s “continuous halving model” emerges as a strategic alternative, aimed at maintaining miner participation and overall network robustness. BlockDAG’s method of gradually decreasing mining rewards, rather than abrupt reductions, fosters a stable and enduring environment. This approach, coupled with a strong focus on scalability and security, highlights its potential to serve as an effective blockchain solution. As the demand grows for feasible alternatives that offer balanced and sustainable models, BlockDAG could well define the future standards of blockchain resilience.

42564122,https://nulltx.com/?p=147563,1743220811,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Shows Strong Interest in Memecoin Market as Inflows Outpace Outflows,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-shows-strong-interest-in-memecoin-market-as-inflows-outpace-outflows/,"The memecoin market has been very active lately, with smart money inflows and outflows taking significant turns on March 27, 2025. Recent data show the market netting a positive volume of $3.33 million. Inflows of $5.00 million outpaced outflows of $1.67 million, indicating a clear shift toward the memecoin space. “We’re definitely seeing some confidence coming back into memecoins,” said one analyst. Memecoins, pushed on by community enthusiasm and speculative trading, have established themselves in recent years. Though often considered volatile and high-risk assets, these tokens seem to be catching the attention of both retail and institutional investors. On March 27, 2025, the market saw some fairly impressive inflows into certain memecoins, with some tokens really emerging in terms of performance and demand from investors. Inflow Dominance: Top Memecoins See Significant Gains Among the most remarkable events in the memecoin market, $FARTCOIN has truly farted its way into the influx of capital, with an inflow of $3.9 million. This represents the bulk of the total seen across the market, suggesting that $FARTCOIN may be gearing up for a big, uh, growth spurt. As one of the highest volume memecoins in recent weeks, $FARTCOIN’s surge in investment can be attributed to renewed interest in its meme-based narrative, which frankly, is more coherent than some actual investment theses I’ve seen. Other memecoins that caught the spotlight on March 27 were $GHIBLI, which gained an inflow of $232K. Most likely named after the well-known animation studio, the token uses pop culture to attempt to rope in investors looking for the next big speculative asset. Following it closely, $POPCAT gained an inflow of about $75K, and $MNDE, a much smaller-name token, had an inflow of around $67K. Both of these tokens are of viral nature themselves and are seen trying to capitalize on the pop culture moment. They had no big or obvious reason to show up and appear in my radar. Also, $WOULD, another memecoin on the market, saw a small but significant inflow of $47K. While this is a lesser amount than we saw for $FARTCOIN, $GHIBLI, and others, the consistent investment into $WOULD is a clear indicator of the ongoing interest we’re seeing in a range of memecoins across the sector. Outflows: Some Memecoins Experience Investor Retreat The overall market experienced inflows, but several specific tokens saw outflows, indicating that investor sentiment may be shifting. The largest outflow was seen by $AVA, one of the more established memecoins, which lost $578K in just the past week. This is a significant retraction for $AVA and suggests that it might be more of a balancing act for crypto portfolios these days. Even then, with $578K leaving the market for $AVA, surely that cash must be going towards something. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 27/03/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $5.00M Outflow: $1.67M Volume: $6.67M Net Volume: $3.33M There was inflow into: $WOULD ($47K) $POPCAT ($75K) $MNDE ($67K) $GHIBLI ($232K) #FARTCOIN … pic.twitter.com/FxHBOYuxix — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 28, 2025 Other tokens that saw pour-outs are $ARC, which experienced a reduction of $87K, and $FAT, which had a small outflow of $78K. On the other hand, $GIGA and $LAYER also saw outflows, with $102K and $132K, respectively, being removed from their total. All of these outflows could suggest some short-term uncertainty or even a change of strategy on the part of the investors, who might be moving the capital to other projects in the memecoin space. It is curious that, even with these outflows, March 27 still has a net positive movement of $3.33 million, which underscores that the memecoin market has a pretty rosy outlook at this moment. Meanwhile, even if some tokens are a bit inactive, the memecoin market keeps going—like some sharting on an elevator—thanks to the sustained momentum brought by highly demanded assets like $FARTCOIN and $GHIBLI. The Role of Smart Money in Shaping the Memecoin Market The inflows on March 27 spotlight the continuing influence of smart money—large investors or entities with sophisticated market knowledge—on the memecoin market. These investors have taken to favoring certain upstart tokens, and they’re starting to favor the ones that do well by their communities, the ones that are highly liquid, and the ones that on their face have a better chance of being economically viable in the future. Memecoins, which are notorious for being speculative, today are a high-risk, high-reward asset class. Still, the smart money actively participates in the memecoin market. Indeed, it would appear that, in general, the cryptocurrency market is adopting memecoins as part of a broader investment strategy. Also in play, of course, is the El Salvadoran government, which has thrown its lot in with Bitcoin and, by extension, the memecoin market. The swift movement of capital observed on March 27 shows that the memecoin market is heavily influenced by the whims of investors and is capable of making sharp turns in a very short period of time. Memecoins are no safer or saner than any other speculative instrument; in fact, they may be less safe and less sane, because speculating on them is like speculating on a joke. Yet on the evening of March 27, when memecoins were supposedly under heavy selling pressure, capital was in fact moving into such coins at a surprising rate. Conclusion: Growing Investor Activity in Memecoins To sum up, the memecoin marketplace is now seeing an uptick in investor interest. Where not long ago it appeared that the highest-profile memecoins and memes like Dogecoin were falling out of favor, now inflows of capital to specific memecoins within the marketplace seem healthier and more sustainable than their outflows. Still, even a cursory glance at the deal flow of memecoins across the past quarter is a bit alarming. Is the following bulleted list of some leading recent memecoin fundraising rounds supposed to lend any positive vibes to the market? $FARTCOIN $GHIBLI Another Positive Vibes Only (PVO) moment for the memecoin market. As the market keeps evolving, memecoins will probably stay a vital but thrilling sector of the cryptocurrency landscape. With both rapid gain potential and the speculative trade risks they bring, investors need to watch closely how these coins affect and are affected by the movements of capital in this space. Otherwise, they might find themselves not ahead of the curve but rather behind it. The future memecoin market is as uncertain as ever. Its coins’ value is going to derive mainly from their street cred, social media impacts, and, above all, the continued engagement of their loyal communities.

In the DeFi world, Ethereum is currently the number one player, with its decentralized apps (DApps) like Uniswap, Compound, and Maker. Decentralized finance around Bitcoin simply doesn’t exist–at least not in any significant way–despite the fact that Bitcoin has more than tripled in value over the past year. Indeed, the total value locked up in Bitcoin-backed DApps amounts to a paltry $182 million, according to DeFi Pulse. With 25.49% of the total TVL, $CORE leads in #BTCFi . This reflects higher user trust, greater liquidity, and broader use than its competitors. #Core 's dominance makes it the most reliable and stable choice for those seeking security and growth in BTCFi. #JustUseCore #Crypto pic.twitter.com/w5sCb8jzvf — CryptoRoar (@CryptoRoar07) March 24, 2025 The prominence of $CORE in the BTCFi space illustrates more than just its market standing; it underscores the CoreDAO ecosystem’s effectiveness and allure. The ecosystem is seeing consistent growth and adoption, powered by an array of integrated projects that supply a revenue stream and make the BTCFi space more useful and appealing. $CORE has more than 50% of the total locked value in its BTCFi products (that’s a pretty healthy growth factor). And it is now the dominant player in BTCFi products (which is more than just a place with a peachy user interface: those BTCFi products have some $-value attached to them). The CoreDAO Ecosystem: A Broad Range of Partners Driving Growth The $CORE ecosystem keeps gaining momentum, driven by the appearance of numerous projects that instil it with the kind of “liquidity” and “utility” that decentralized financial structures need to thrive. In addition to the performance of the $CORE token itself, which is leading a sector we call “BTCFi,” a number of high-performing projects in the DeFi space around CoreDAO have since unfurled their sails. And the total value locked (TVL) in these projects offers a glimpse at the kind of diverse capabilities that the $CORE ecosystem is crystallizing. These projects include CoreSwap, CoreDEX, CoreBNB, and Adax.pro . The key projects in the CoreDAO ecosystem are @DesynLab, @colend_xyz, and @Pell_Network. These projects have an incredible amount of trust and activity among users, as demonstrated by their TVL amounts. They are clearly driving the engagement and momentum of the Core ecosystem. 1. @DesynLab: TVL = $191.63 million, making it one of the top projects in both Core and the greater Web3 space. 2. @colend_xyz: TVL = $131.35 million, showing a very impressive amount of user interest and engagement. CoreDAO’s appeal is even further enhanced by @Pell_Network, which has $113.97 million secured in its platform. Other contributors to the ecosystem include: • @BitFluxFi, with a total value locked of $99.49 million. • @SumerMoney, with a total value locked of $91.66 million. • @avalonfinance_, with a total value locked of $70.87 million. @Coredao_Org Ecosystem Total Value Locked Distribution Mapping out the TVL distribution within CORE thriving DeFi ecosystem. @DesynLab – $191.63M @colend_xyz – $131.35M @Pell_Network – $113.97M @BitFluxFi – $99.49M @SumerMoney – $91.66M @avalonfinance_ – $70.87M… pic.twitter.com/dlEmTJ5ubE — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) March 26, 2025 All these projects are helping to shape the CoreDAO ecosystem into a vibrant hub of DeFi innovation. Yet farther down the list, still playing a significant role, are @b14g_network, Core Earn, and @glyph_exchange, each contributing their own distinct offerings and ambiance to the community, as diverse outfits do in any neighborhood. @b14g_network has $12.76 million under management. Core Earn, with its own distinct vibe, has $8.08 million. @glyph_exchange, very much in tune with the others, adds $6.31 million under management. These outfits together are part of the BTCFi scene. They serve the community in particular ways, really hitting four quadrants of a Bitcoin Finance neighborhood. Almost a phrase I would never use in 2023: Bitcoin Finance. CoreDAO’s Strong Position in the BTCFi Sector BTCFi TVL’s largest share, $CORE, shows not only the platform’s leadership but also its capacity to draw in huge amounts of liquidity. Liquidity is trust in this space. Users of decentralized financial products need to feel secure that things won’t break. They just won’t engage if there’s even a whisper of doubt that everything is okay. $CORE dominates the DeFi space because its reputation is rock-solid, and increasingly, people are coming to see the strength of the CoreDAO ecosystem in providing secure, scalable Bitcoin-based financial solutions. Those solutions run the gamut. $CORE integrates a ton of platforms and protocols, which means from a user perspective, $CORE is an access point to all kinds of Bitcoin-secured, DeFi financial services. This broad ecosystem, made up of diverse projects with different use cases, offers a comprehensive suite of options for investors, traders, and developers within the BTCFi space. CoreDAO’s ability to seamlessly integrate these projects and to grow its TDL share is a testament to the strength of its ecosystem and its potential to drive, y’all, yet more BTCFi growth in the coming months and years. The Future of $CORE and the BTCFi Ecosystem The future seems bright for $CORE and the bigger BTCFi ecosystem. The total value locked in the CoreDAO ecosystem is showing us that not just users but also institutions are seeing the value proposition of engaging with DeFi protocols built on Bitcoin. As this sector expands, it’s very likely that $CORE will maintain its position as something akin to a Bitcoin 401(k), continuously attracting new projects and users to its ecosystem. In addition, CoreDAO stands to benefit greatly from the surging demand for decentralized finance products that are backed by Bitcoin, putting it in an excellent place to take advantage of the much-hyped DeFi adoption. With the promise of Core now working its way into many different projects, these next few months should be filled with excitement as we see what sorts of unusual (in a good way) products are likely to come out of these experiments. As trust grows among users, and they continue to take part in BTCFi, the $CORE positioned right now to be even less influential in a rapidly space, where security, liquidity, and innovation are crucial, could all of a sudden start being more influential. This is particularly the case because security, liquidity, and innovation are absolutely what $CORE has been offering. Following is an outline of the three pillars in which $CORE offers a reliable and stable choice for users. And a big part of this play for BTCFi is that $CORE is now absolutely for real.

42564285,https://nulltx.com/?p=147565,1743221155,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"SEC Closes Investigation Into Crypto.com, No Enforcement Actions to Be Taken",https://nulltx.com/sec-closes-investigation-into-crypto-com-no-enforcement-actions-to-be-taken/,"The cryptocurrency industry has received a substantial boost from a recent development. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has informed the popular exchange Crypto.com that it is closing the investigation that it had opened into the exchange some time ago and that it will not be taking any enforcement action against the exchange. According to other sources, the SEC’s decision to not take any action against the exchange right now clears up what has been a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the exchange and its users and is the result of what had previously been a fairly deep dive taken by the SEC into the workings of the exchange. The SEC’s latest step is a sign of a stormy season for Crypto.com, which has found itself in crosshairs of the regulatory body as part of its ongoing effort to bring greater oversight to the cryptocurrency space. Despite the potential risks posed by the investigation, Crypto.com has managed to sidestep the enforcement actions that many (including us) had feared, potentially establishing a precedent for other crypto firms under similar types of regulatory scrutiny. The Legal Back-and-Forth: From Wells Notice to Lawsuit Last year, the SEC issued a Wells notice to Crypto.com, which was the start of the investigation. A Wells notice is a formal notification that the SEC has identified possible violations of federal securities laws. Of course, this is traditionally a not-so-welcome sign for companies. It usually signals that the SEC is considering enforcement actions and gives the company a chance to respond with its defense or take legal action before enforcement is attempted. SCOOP: The @SECGov has officially closed its investigation into @cryptocom with no enforcement actions being brought against the exchange, according to a source close to the matter. The move comes after the company received a Wells notice from the SEC in October of last year,… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 27, 2025 In reaction to the SEC’s notice, Crypto.com took the uncommon step of suing the agency to get it to stop overreaching its jurisdiction. The exchange claimed that the SEC simply doesn’t have the authority to regulate what it does, and it especially doesn’t have the authority to classify its services and tokens as securities. This was a big move for Crypto.com and a pretty clear message that it thinks—and really wants everyone to believe—that it isn’t a security and shouldn’t be treated like one. Nonetheless, the legal duel was short-lived. By December last year, Crypto.com had decided to abandon its lawsuit and, in a surprising shift, was now opting for a more cooperative approach with the SEC. What seemed to prompt this even more sunshiny shift? A surprise announcement by Donald Trump that he intended to appoint Paul Atkins—a longtime pro-crypto advocate who pretty much likens the regulatory environment for crypto to what the colonialists encountered when they crossed the Delaware—a much different SEC chair than Gary Gensler. The decision by Crypto.com to withdraw the lawsuit was part of a larger shift in the industry’s dynamic. With the hope of new leadership at the SEC, many in the cryptocurrency sector were beginning to think that the regulatory environment might be shifting to one more welcoming of innovation and growth. The SEC’s Decision: No Enforcement Actions A significant victory for Crypto.com—this is how many in the broader cryptocurrency industry see the SEC’s conclusion of its investigation. Not only was Crypto.com avoided by the SEC from enforcement action, but it appears that the SEC is shifting here, too, in not taking such a heavy-handed and fearful approach in regulating crypto. Before this, increasing scrutiny by the SEC over the activities of crypto exchanges and service providers in general had a lot of people in the crypto space very concerned. For Crypto.com, this means the exchange can put the investigation behind itself and move forward without the threat of penalties or legal action. One of the largest global players in the virtual space and growing larger all the time, the exchange is in a good position to expand its services and user base without regulatory headwinds. Currently, when a variety of regulatory bodies have existed for a long time and the rules are well known, there is still considerable uncertainty around how to apply these rules to crypto. One of the major tools that the SEC uses to enforce compliance with the federal securities laws is the threat of bringing an enforcement action. That the SEC didn’t bring an enforcement action in this case may suggest that they don’t consider it strictly a securities problem. A Changing Regulatory Landscape for Crypto The legal drama surrounding Crypto.com and its resolution shines a light on the changing regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Although the SEC has been a very watchful and sometimes harsh overseer of the space, its own methods and goals seem to be changing. The conclusion of this case without any sanctioning of Crypto.com might signal that the SEC is not as eager as it once was to enforce its interpretation of the securities laws against what it sees as violators in the space. The worldwide crypto community has for a long time been voicing a desire for precise and uniform regulations pertaining to digital assets. The lack of certitude has generated a headwind for industry participants. Why is a rule-based landscape so desired? Because our digital asset economy is growing and maturing. Every day, more exchanges, wallets, and service providers enter the market with a lineup of new offerings and experiences. They hope, and we hope, that regulatory agencies like the SEC will soon give not just them, but also us, a clear signal on how to operate safely within the law. If new leadership comes in at the SEC, the way it handles probes and enforcement against the crypto industry might change. If pro-crypto figures like Paul Atkins are put into key spots, the SEC could operate in a more “balanced” and “supportive” manner toward the crypto space, thus encouraging further growth and innovation within it. At present, Crypto.com appears to have mostly avoided any damages from this legal quagmire and has emerged with no enforcement actions lined up against it. The exchange, which has become a major player in the worldwide world of cryptocurrencies, now seems to be in as good a place as it could be to push forward and offer even more services to a user base that just keeps growing. The overall outcome for the cryptocurrency industry could be a sense of relief, especially if it indicates space for constructive dialogue between crypto firms and regulators. For the maturity of the industry, that’s a good sign. With the unfolding legal and regulatory landscape, exchanges like Crypto.com are probably going to remain at the vanguard of navigating the crypto-construct dialogue and the relationship between crypto and traditional finance.

42564441,https://nulltx.com/?p=147566,1743221290,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Stablecoin Reserves Surge, Reflecting Increased Market Activity and Liquidity Across Web3",https://nulltx.com/stablecoin-reserves-surge-reflecting-increased-market-activity-and-liquidity-across-web3/,"In a clear sign of increasing market activity, stablecoin reserves at exchanges have surged in just a 24-hour period to a new total of about $32.8 billion. This sharp increase in reserves indicates that profits are being taken, and that capital is flowing, within the wider cryptocurrency market—and is yet another sign that sentiment in this market has shifted materially over just a week toward more liquid and reliable assets. Stablecoin reserves across all exchanges surged from $32.1 billion to $32.8 billion in just 24 hours, signaling increased profit-taking activity in the market. pic.twitter.com/fKfd0P5CPx — Ali (@ali_charts) March 28, 2025 The increase also signals a burgeoning need for liquidity in DeFi ecosystems and capital flowing into numerous Web3 platforms. Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. Dollar, have long been the backbone of trading in digital assets, providing traders and investors with a safe harbor from the volatility that still often surrounds cryptocurrencies. This latest surge in stablecoin reserves serves to shine a light on not just one, but two, seemingly maturing markets: markets for these instruments themselves and markets for the overall growth of Web3. $USDC Achieves Historic Milestone, Ethereum Leads the Pack One of stablecoins’ most notable developments is the continued dominance of USDC. The supply of the stablecoin has hit an all-time high of $60 billion. This explosive growth embodies a broader shift toward stable, more reliable assets in the still-evolving world of cryptocurrency. USDC doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon. It seems to be the stablecoin of choice for quite a few in the crypto world, and it doesn’t appear that it has much in the way of rivals. Ethereum is at the forefront of stablecoin adoption. The smart contract platform has attracted a large amount of value in stablecoins, with over $36 billion in reserves currently held on the network. The stablecoin ecosystem on Ethereum is impressive in scale. Not only is the amount of value served by stablecoins considerable, but several of these stablecoins are also employed extensively for different purposes both within the realized DeFi ecosystem and in other manners that are partially on-chain or entirely off-chain. This allows not just for a way of moving value around that thoroughly exceeds anything served by either Bitcoin or any of the numerous blockchains that have issued other types of tokens, but also for several systems of decentralized applications (dApps) that extensively use stablecoins and are probably the leading-edge examples of blockchain-based financial systems. Nonetheless, Ethereum isn’t the only blockchain network reaping the rewards of the stablecoin upswing. Other networks such as Solana, Base, HyperliquidX, and Arbitrum have also registered significant stablecoin usage. They are gaining serious momentum in the Web3 arena, serving up scalable and efficient solutions for the kind of decentralized applications that today count on stablecoins for liquidity, trading, and all sorts of financial activities. Solana, with its high throughput and low fees, has secured a spot as a big player in the stablecoin universe. While it’s not yet at Ethereum’s level of dominance, the network is making a strong push to capture a large share of the stablecoin market. Base and HyperliquidX, two much newer contenders, are also making waves as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and protocols increasingly turn to stablecoins for liquidity and stability. Stablecoin reserves are also seeing very rapid growth on Arbitrum, reflecting the adoption of Arbitrum as a scaling solution for decentralized applications. That is to say, Arbitrum is seeing growing adoption as a means for operating decentralized applications, and that is obviously a very good thing for Arbitrum. Why is Arbitrum doing that? Why is it seeing fast growth in stablecoin reserves? For several very good reasons, Arbitrum is now a go-to layer 2 for stablecoin transactions. A $230 Billion Market Cap for Stablecoins: Growing Liquidity and Demand The total stablecoin market cap is now more than $230 billion. This speaks to not only the unprecedented growth of stablecoins but also their burgeoning importance in the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) worlds. With their low volatility, increasing adoption, and inbuilt stability, stablecoins are emerging as a pivotal part of the Web3 ecosystem. The total stablecoin market cap surpassing $230 billion emphasizes the burgeoning quest for not only traditional crypto market liquidity but also for that in DeFi platforms and dApps. The trend here is clearly to move even deeper into the realm of the Web3 space, thereby inking a deal of deeper market penetration. The manner in which digital assets like these are being soaked up by both retail and institutional figures across the space is quite impressive, and it speaks to the unfurling comfort and exceptional pace of adoption that these pseudo-cash instruments are enjoying. 1. The Role of Stablecoins in the Blockchain Ecosystem Stablecoins are a crucial component of the ecosystem surrounding blockchain technology. They enable users to transact quickly, securely, and at minimal cost across the many different networks that make up the blockchain universe. $USDC supply tops ATH of $60B — a 100% year-over-year increase. @ethereum leads with over $36B, followed by @solana , @base , @HyperliquidX , and @arbitrum . The total stablecoin market cap has now surpassed $230B, signaling deeper liquidity and rising demand across Web3. pic.twitter.com/vv69B9sTdE — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) March 26, 2025 Despite their being a relatively new phenomenon, the use cases for stablecoins are multiplying. As the underlying technology continues to spread, these specific value-expressing tokens will become a common element of nearly any application built on top of a blockchain architecture. Moreover, stablecoins represent a far more stable medium of exchange than do either Bitcoin or Ethereum. They are backed by assets that are themselves stable; hence, they can be employed with far greater confidence in any application that necessitates a reasonably predictable expression of value. Looking Ahead: The Growing Role of Stablecoins in Web3 Even as the overall stablecoin market cap continues to swell, the future of stablecoins in the Web3 ecosystem looks inevitably bright. That is, stablecoins appear to be following the path of least resistance toward their probable, if still controversial, destination. Stablecoins’ evolution is correlated with the broader development of DeFi and blockchain’s marching into the establishment. More and more, users are turning to stablecoins as an antidote to the price volatility of other cryptocurrencies, which seems to make stablecoins a semi-necessary asset class in the crypto landscape. The continued integration of stablecoins into decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and other blockchain-based financial services will generate liquidity and stir innovation across the sector. But look at stablecoins and what they hold in store for the crypto market. They are sitting on exchanges with the potential to create a liquid marketplace for profit-taking. They are also being adopted by institutions, and their growing use portends a future infused with stablecoins. The crypto space is in a profit-taking, stablecoin-infused moment. As we look ahead, it is evident that stablecoins are not merely a fad but an essential component of the Web3 revolution. As the stablecoin market grows, new technological advances and regulatory developments will mold the use of these assets, integrating them deeper into the global digital economy. The future, it seems, is rather bright for the stablecoin. There are still many ways in which it—and the environment it serves—might grow, but the basic idea is that it now facilitates a more stable, more liquid blockchain and DeFi ecosystem.

In a little over just 100 days, we are now achieving a remarkable $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). That accomplishment puts us in the same frame as some of the fastest emerging blockchain platforms like Arbitrum and the BNB Chain and gives us company among some of the names in DeFi that we all know. In a little over just 100 days, we are now achieving a remarkable $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Unprecedented TVL Growth: Berachain at the Forefront In the fast-growing universe of blockchain technology, TVL is commonly used as a yardstick to assess a network’s vitality and desirability. TVL stands for Total Value Locked; and it measures the sum of value (in the form of crypto-assets) that has been locked into a network’s smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). TVL is a good metric of user trust in a blockchain, and also, it is a strong indicator of how much developer interest there is in the system. Berachain’s speed of growth has set it apart from many of its rivals. These often take longer to hit similar milestones. When you stack Berachain up against big hitters like BNB Chain and Base—both of which topped $1 billion in TVL (Total Value Locked) within a year—it’s hard to not be impressed by Berachain’s relatively swift ascent. These established networks, with the backing of prominent centralized exchanges (CEXs), took a longer, more sustained route to ecosystem-building. Berachain is the fastest-growing chain by TVL Today, @SonicLabs TVL reached $1B, a milestone achieved in just over 100 days. Meanwhile, @berachain and @arbitrum are leading in terms of TVL growth speed. @BNBCHAIN and @base — both backed by major CEXs — surpassed $1B in TVL… pic.twitter.com/9kXjrApv0Q — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) March 27, 2025 In addition, the surge in Berachain’s popularity has positioned it within striking distance of Arbitrum when it comes to the speed at which total value locked (TVL) is piling up on the two networks. This is noteworthy because Arbitrum has already distinguished itself as an up-and-coming scaling solution for Ethereum and a pathway toward Ethereum’s promise of true, global state. TVL growth is also a pathway toward capturing developer mindshare and user attention in the otherwise crowded Layer 1 and Layer 2 space. What Sets Berachain Apart? Several key factors can be credited for Berachain’s swift ascent to prominence. The blockchain boasts a robust technical infrastructure that, alongside its unique features, makes it a highly desirable option for both developers and users. Berachain’s current and future implementations demonstrate an unequivocal commitment to satisfying the ever-growing demands of decentralized applications and financial services. When it comes to offering a truly viable solution, it appears that Berachain is indeed attempting to fulfill all of the promises that a next-generation blockchain should. Moreover, the architecture of the Berachain blockchain is meant to tackle the limitations of previous-generation blockchains, furnishing a more efficient and speedy solution for developers. It is this focus on not just optimizing transaction speeds, but also on trimming transaction costs down to the bone, that has made Berachain an attractive choice for DeFi protocols. Another key aspect of Berachain’s rapid expansion is the lively ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) being constructed on its framework. Benefiting from a robust community of developers, the network is witnessing ongoing innovation and the unveiling of fresh applications, which in turn is drawing a steadily increasing number of users and liquidity. These dApps are absolutely vital in terms of how they are driving up the network’s total value locked (TVL) figure, given that users are much more likely to lock up assets in a dApp and thereby increase Berachain’s TVL if the dApp is a non-trivial, engaging application. Competitive Landscape: Berachain Among the Best In the larger blockchain world, Berachain’s growth is really exceptional. BNB Chain and Base, which are supported by big central exchanges, took close to a year to go past the $1 billion mark in total value locked. And yet here comes Berachain, apparently being configured to scale and also deliver as a working network, and not only sitting at close to $1 billion TVL in just five months of its being live, but also rising daily, as far as I can tell. Indeed, this rumored working network is apparently very well liked by users and developers, as it now has a much bigger user base than just five months ago. Berachain’s swift adoption stacks up well against newer blockchain platforms like Sui Network and Aptos, which took considerably longer to reach the same level of standing. All the same, Sui Network and Aptos have been fetching decent reviews and pretty much straight lines in their growth charts for some time now. Yet I’ve missed their breakout sessions in the same way I missed R&B heartthrob Usher back in the day. Berachain starts off as an audacious underdog in a sews with a mighty chain of command by its DeFi community. The Future of Berachain and DeFi Innovation Looking forward, Berachain’s growth is showing no signs of easing up. Having reached $1 billion in TVL so swiftly, the platform is set to keep on pulling in developers, liquidity, and users. The network’s laserlike focus on scalability, low fees, and smooth transaction processing makes it a magnetic choice for decentralized applications that want to ensure efficient and cost-effective performance. In addition, as Berachain keeps expanding its ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and of smart contracts, the expectation is that the network, too, will generate further innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. If projects built on Berachain prove successful, they might inspire other blockchain platforms to take similar approaches. And that might have some further effects on the future of DeFi and the future of blockchain technology. To conclude, Berachain’s rapid growth and its capacity to achieve $1 billion in TVL in just over 100 days signify a big step for the blockchain ecosystem. As one of the platforms that are “growing the fastest” when it comes to TVL, Berachain is showing that it can compete with many of the big names in the industry. Its success moving forward will likely have a sizable impact on DeFi’s future, and even its potential for more growth is something to keep a close eye on in the coming months and years.

The platform’s evolution and the unbroken flow of inventive ideas coming from its direction underscore something interesting about how it’s going about its business: there’s creativity, and even a bit of avant-garde panache, in what Shape_L2 is doing. That’s something that’s not easily found in the blockchain industry these days. Strong Network Growth and Steady Activity USDC is the digital dollar. Given this, the vast majority of users will only ever experience the USDC as an on-chain dollar. In July 2022, 61% of contracts deployed on USDC were on-chain. The USDC is just a way of lending and borrowing money with MobileCoin on a trustless, decentralized basis. The first half of 2023 saw 15 contracts deployed on-chain with USDC; the second half of 2023 may have more, as interest in deploying contracts to the MobileCoin network continues to grow. USDC can, therefore, be seen as the only on-chain dollar in MobileCoin’s network. The consistent expansion of the Shape_L2 network owes itself to the network’s seamless integration with the Optimism Stack, which allows the Layer 2 network to function as something akin to an alternative to Ethereum’s mainnet. The way that the Shape_L2 network has scaled and integrated with the Optimism development framework means that the network can now offer low-cost, high-speed opportunities for doing business on the blockchain. (As the creators of the network like to point out, this is superbly well-suited for the NFT economy.) And this seems to have worked well enough that the creators and developers of decentralized applications are finding ways to make use of it. Gasback: A Game-Changer for Contract Deployers One of the most thrilling aspects of Shape_L2 is the rollout of Gasback, a revolutionary mechanism that handles a colossal 80% of the sequencer fees in the platform. This means that when developers create a financial product on the platform, they are directly rewarded for doing so. Most net revenue from Layer 2 goes right back to the platform and, by extension, to the users of the platform. 1/ Live on Dune for a month, @Shape_L2 is an @Optimism Stack–powered ETH L2 built for NFTs and onchain culture. And now, $SHAPE is coming Here’s what’s happening on Shape, and some of the standout projects shaping this non-fungible ecosystem https://t.co/ohktIXalWk — Dune (@Dune) March 27, 2025 Since its implementation, Shape_L2 has already dealt with a grand total of $35,300 in transaction fees. Out of that, $24,100 has ended up netting Layer 2 in profit. Thus far, 203 accords have been inscribed for Gasback, with $19.3K set aside for reclamation by developers. Of that amount, $2.6K has already been divvied up, and there’s no indication that anyone in the platform’s community should be embarrassed to accept what they’ve been given. Gasback is not only a vital part of the Shape_L2 income stream, it’s also something that is likely to make that platform far more developer-friendly (and hence more appealing). After all, who wouldn’t want to work in an environment where there’s money available for what used to be called “experimental” (and is now called “innovative”) programming? Gasback is there to offer rewards for such “innovative” work. This financial incentive model is especially useful in the fast-moving environment of Web3 and NFTs. Developers are always trying to find new means of plummeting costs and raking in revenue. By making a directly profitable system for deploying contracts, Shape_L2 has created an ecosystem in which Web3 developers might actually thrive, experiment, and keep building. The Power of Stack: Reputation and Progress through Participation Shape_L2 uplifts engagement to the next level with Stack, its innovative reputation layer designed to reward users for participation. Stack turns everyday interactions into kind of progress that offers users rewards in the form of medals, ranks, and perks. It’s what Stack Shape_L2’s engagement mechanism that rewards users for participating in the platform. Up to now, the platform has produced 18,300 Stack NFTs and, across the community, has earned 76,000 medals. The top-ranking project, Proof of Personhood, has received 28,000 medals. This result demonstrates the community’s interest in establishing unique on-chain identities. With 10,100 Stack holders, Shape_L2’s reputation layer has proven to be an effective tool for building community engagement; its collaboration and engagement with the community has fostered an environment where users are encouraged to continue contributing to the growth of the platform. The gamified structure of Stack rewards users for their participation and keeps them hooked into the ecosystem. That’s great for developers and writers of content on Shape_L2. And as we expand our ecosystem, user reputation becomes even more important. Stack will play a role in that, too. So even as I was writing this, I began to realize just how central Stack is going to be to the creation of a vibrant decentralized community that recognizes user contributions. Exciting Projects and On-Chain Experimentation Shape_L2 is also home to several exciting projects that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of NFTs and on-chain culture. One of the standout projects is Otom, developed by @kGolid, which brings NFTs to life in a dynamic way. In Otom, everything is on-chain, allowing users to mine, annihilate, and combine NFTs to create molecules, earn energy, and interact with mechanics that feel alive. The platform has already seen significant engagement, with 30K daily actions and a peak of 76K actions on March 24. The most popular actions include annihilation and mining, which highlight the interactive nature of Otom and its ability to captivate users. Another electrifying initiative underway at Shape_L2 is DeePle, rendered by @deekaymotion. This project intersects art, identity, and on-chain personalization within an avatar experience. 543 unique items exist in this universe, 4.4K minted avatars inhabit it, and these figures generate $160K and $1.1K in primary and secondary sales, respectively. The DeePle experience is a testament to what can emerge from Shape_L2, which continues to act as a launchpad for dynamic NFT projects. The Future of Shape_L2 Shape_L2’s swift expansion and constant innovation promise a luminous destiny for the platform. With its powerful network-driven activities, its groundbreaking Gasback system, a gamified reputation layer, and a diverse array of on-chain projects, Shape_L2 has speedily positioned itself as a hub for NFTs and on-chain experimentation. As the platform scales and continues to evolve, it appears almost certain that it will play a leading role in defining the future of Web3 and decentralized culture. Shape_L2 is setting itself up as a big player in the whole Ethereum Layer 2 thing, and it’s doing it by giving developers and users kind of the opposite of what a usual top-down model would give. Instead of saying, ‘Hey, this is what you should build, and here are the rules you should follow,’ Shape_L2 is saying, ‘Here’s a bunch of interesting tools. Use them however you like. And, if you do use them and then come up with a decent reason why what you’ve built is worth backing, then you’ve got a shot at earning some cash on top of whatever else you stand to gain from your own praxeological innovation.

Yet, as with any rapidly expanding ecosystem, Arbitrum confronts serious challenges and tempting opportunities. Its decentralized autonomous organization—the Arbitrum DAO—has been in the spotlight, showing both impressive growth and some areas in need of attention. Despite the appearance of a net loss, the DAO has been diversifying its income sources and managing a strong treasury, all while the system attracts more users and new developers. Arbitrum DAO Financial Overview The Arbitrum DAO, in a recent financial disclosure, declared a total income of $107 million. But expenses far exceeded that figure (and are projected to continue exceeding it for the next several years), reaching $230 million—resulting in a net loss of $124 million. This tells us that while the DAO is generating a pretty significant amount of revenue, its operating costs are also high and continue to grow as the ecosystem itself expands and evolves. Year-to-date (YTD), Arbitrum has generated $5.8 million in income but has faced a slightly higher expenditure of $6.5 million—resulting in an even smaller loss for the current year. Transaction fees remain Arbitrum’s largest source of income. They make up a whopping 92% of the DAO’s total revenue. Some 7% of the DAO’s revenue comes from treasury management (which basically just means strategic tax planning). The DAO is in such a strong cash position that even this modest source of income makes Arbitrum look much better off than it actually is. Even though the overall financial picture indicates the DAO is losing money, the bright side is the underlying strength of the revenue streams and treasury management. The Arbitrum organization is focusing on something quite specific—”scaling” the Ethereum system so that more users can enjoy its benefits. The more users there are, the more Ether is available and the more revenue the organization gets—mostly in the form of interest from the Ether they lend out. The Growth of Arbitrum’s Real-World Assets (RWA) Arbitrum has progressed significantly in adopting real-world assets (RWAs), a growing trend in the blockchain ecosystem. The RWA market cap for the Arbitrum ecosystem reaches $183.3 million, with around 15% of this held by the DAO. RWAs are tokenized assets from the traditional financial world, like government bonds, real estate, and commodities. They are increasingly a part of blockchain ecosystems as a way to introduce stability and real-world value into the crypto space. Arbitrum holds real-world assets that largely comprise U.S. Treasuries (81%) and European Union assets (15%), with a small portion (2.5%) invested in real estate. Of the DAO’s top yielded assets, BENJI stands out with a 40% holding, followed by BUIDL, which recently saw a roughly 10% week-over-week increase. These RWAs not only provide stability to the DAO’s treasury but also generate returns. For instance, Arbitrum earned $523K in interest via STEP: a protocol for tokenized, real-world asset yields. 1/ Creator Spotlight: @EntropyAdvisors A research-driven contributor to Arbitrum DAO.

The DAO seems clear in its plan to ride the tokenized real-world assets wave, a potential key driver for future growth in the ecosystem. Uniswap V4 on Arbitrum: A Key Milestone A landmark development for the Arbitrum ecosystem is the deployment of Uniswap V4, the popular decentralized exchange (DEX), on its network. Uniswap V4 on Arbitrum has enjoyed a strong reception, with a total trading volume of $521 million and $18 million in liquidity (the last 30 days saw a notable $13 million uptick in that figure). Meanwhile, fees generated by V4 trades total $266,000, and 1,000+ liquidity pools with 140 hooks now constitute 1.5% of the total decentralized exchange volume on Arbitrum. Uniswap’s ever-increasing success on Arbitrum illustrates the burgeoning adoption of this Layer 2 network. Presently, this Layer 2 network is second in adoption only to Ethereum, which is still the most accepted platform in the space. The confidence that Uniswap V4 on Arbitrum commands is evidenced by the very high volumes and liquidity that it enjoys. Overall, the situation is a reassuring one for Layer 2 networks. They continue to prove their worth to the crypto community by providing low fees, fast transactions, and a high level of reliability. Ethena Labs and Strong TVL Growth The success of platforms like Ethena Labs also mirrors the decentralized finance growth on Arbitrum. They have a total value locked of $6.8 billion, which includes $5.3 billion in USDe and $1.4 billion in USDtb. Elsewhere, Ethena is doing exceptionally well in generating revenue as well. They snared $350 million in revenue from USDe, and $1.6 million from USDtb. Confidence in their offerings is so high that 58% of USDe has been staked into sUSDe. This sharp increase of TVL is a strong indication of the burgeoning demand for DeFi on Arbitrum, and the growth in apparent usage of the platform and staking of its native token further cements the impression of Arbitrum as a credible option among Ethereum scaling solutions. If you are a user or developer looking for a robust alternative to on-chain Ethereum, there is a strong case to be made for DeFi on Arbitrum. The Road Ahead for Arbitrum Even though its latest report showed it is in the red, Arbitrum’s long-term outlook is still all rainbows and sunshine. Reasons include the DAO generating revenue through transaction fees, the RWA diversification strategy that is making real-world, off-chain assets available to smart contracts, and the burgeoning adoption of decentralized finance applications on the platform. The Arbitrum ecosystem is tending to evolve. It’s going to be more important for the decentralized autonomous organization to focus on the usual business priorities of any startup: managing expenses while scaling operations to meet the growing demand we’ve seen in the past couple of months. Nonetheless, because it’s been broadly adopted and has shown some interesting innovations, I think Arbitrum is well-positioned to keep overcoming these business challenges and remain one of the leading Layer 2 solutions.

42564897,https://nulltx.com/?p=147580,1743221977,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Aptos: Rapid Growth and Innovation Solidify Its Position as a Top L1 Blockchain,https://nulltx.com/aptos-rapid-growth-and-innovation-solidify-its-position-as-a-top-l1-blockchain/,"Aptos , one of the fastest-growing layer 1 (L1) blockchains in the crypto space, has seen explosive growth over the past year. Its performance indicators show a sharp upward curve as more users come to the platform and make use of its services. The blockchain’s key metrics, such as daily active wallets, total value locked (TVL), and transaction volume, have improved noticeably and consistently across the board. With its low fees, high throughput, and ever-expanding ecosystem, Aptos is a rising star in the notoriously competitive layer 1 (L1) blockchain space. Aptos is not just a player with potential; it is a player with deliverables. Over the past year, it has enjoyed a favorable reception throughout the crypto world, with a clear surge in activity on the network that is a sign of user adoption and engagement with the platform. One of the most striking statistics is the 10x growth in daily active wallets. The active user base on Aptos has reached nearly 1 million, signs of which are evidently visible with the rapid uptick in activity on the network. This reaffirms Aptos as a large-scale system; at this point, it is only to be seen what kind of upper limits (if any) the system will have. Overall, there has been much favorable sentiment surrounding Aptos, not just in terms of its activity metrics but also in terms of user engagement. 1/ @Aptos is leveling up fast—and making moves as one of the top-growing L1s in crypto: Read more about this exciting ecosystem built with the Move programming language in our newly released ""State of Aptos report"". Link at the end of this thread pic.twitter.com/ptBN1MF7Qf — Dune (@Dune) March 26, 2025 Strong Growth in Key Metrics The most persuasive indicator of Aptos’ swift development is its total value locked (TVL), which has skyrocketed from $100 million to more than $1 billion. This stellar rise in TVL is a sign of the trust that users and developers are placing in Aptos as a dependable and scalable blockchain platform. TVL itself is a key metric that shows just how much liquidity and how many assets are within a network, and Aptos’ significantly increased TVL is almost certainly a reflection of a growing wave of confidence in its durability. Moreover, Aptos has experienced a hefty transaction volume, with over 380 million unique transactions logged since the start of the year. This milestone is a testament to the platform’s adoption and growing ability to process transactions en masse, if not at record speed. As a blockchain, Aptos has reviewed its proof of concept, and seen enough to sign off on its scalability and efficiency, enabling the wide variety of applications that are now humming on its network. Aptos has built a blockchain architecture that can pretty much guarantee high throughput and low latency, and that’s what makes it successful. Many blockchains have for the past years been dealing with something called “scalability” (Can they grow? How do they grow? What happens when they grow?), and Aptos seems to have solved this on a pretty fundamental level. So if you program to the Aptos blockchain, you can pretty much offer your users minimal fees and fast transactions, which makes the whole system look very attractive indeed compared to its competitors. A Growing Ecosystem of DeFi and Real-World Assets Aptos’ rapid growth brings many exciting aspects, among them its DeFi ecosystem, which is something we haven’t touched on much till now. Just yesterday, we got a look at some solid DeFi protocols building on Aptos, like @EchoProtocol_ and @AriesMarkets, which are creating some interesting financial products for users—lending, borrowing, and staking—to use and engage with on Aptos. The influx of DeFi applications has helped position Aptos as something of an emerging hub for decentralized finance, with quite a few offerings that give users the chance to engage in “DeFi”—something that most of us expect will be central to the Web3 space. Besides DeFi, Aptos has also attracted a new wave of stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets. Stablecoins are pegged to traditional currencies or assets and offer a stable alternative to the volatility seen in other cryptocurrencies. Serving a crucial role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, these coins are gaining momentum on the Aptos blockchain as a tool for allowing more predictable transaction facilitation. And of course, that makes the platform more appealing. Aptos can expand its ecosystem through real-world assets (RWAs) represented in tokens. These assets, which can include anything from commodities to real estate, are being digitized and traded on the blockchain, granting users greater access to investment opportunities. By enabling the tokenization of real-world assets, Aptos is bridging the traditional finance-world gap between it and decentralized finance on the rise. The Future of Aptos: What’s Next? Aptos has expanded at a remarkable pace over the past year, yielding a potent and promising platform. With a burgeoning user base, an impressive total value locked in (TVL), and a rushing tide of growing transaction volume, Aptos looks well-poised to continue its vertical ascent in the blockchain space. Its impressive focus on low fees, high throughput, and a suitable way to scale has made Aptos from which to build an efficient and robust blockchain—all enticements for developers. The future looks bright for Aptos, with growth expected to continue. This seems particularly true for the DeFi protocols being built on it, as a nascent ecosystem seems to be taking shape. Signs from the market and the protocol itself (awash in VC funding) suggest that Aptos might be something of a next-gen Layer 1. Its growing adoption among stablecoin issuers is particularly encouraging. Stability is what you want from money; if Aptos can handle that, respect its capacity, and then some. The real-world tokenization of physical assets is a big deal too; Aptos seems well-positioned there. As more developers and users come to the platform, Aptos will continue to affirm its status as a key player in the layer-1 blockchain space. With impressive growth in user engagement, transaction volume, and liquidity, Aptos is proving that it’s not just another blockchain—it’s a fast-evolving ecosystem that could shape the future of decentralized finance and beyond.

42564948,https://nulltx.com/?p=147581,1743222115,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Aave’s Evolution: From Whale-Dominated to Platform for Everyday Users,https://nulltx.com/aaves-evolution-from-whale-dominated-to-platform-for-everyday-users/,"Aave , the largest lending and borrowing protocol on Ethereum , is transforming itself dramatically. Over the past couple of years, the dynamics of the platform’s supply and borrow usages have shifted evenly—rather, shiftily—toward everyday users. This kind of user is no longer, by far, the least significant kind of participant in the platform. Two years ago, over 80% of Aave’s activity was in the hands of large users. Now, that user type only commands roughly 20% of Aave’s activity. Why is this significant? It shows us that Aave has broadened its appeal to a large number of users across many different community sectors. It is no longer just the whale platform. In 2 years, the concentration of @aave supply and borrow usage went from above 80% in favor of whales down to ~20%. This means the platform isn't just used by large entities, but by normal, everyday users. pic.twitter.com/Nyydi7Tjzg — Dynamo DeFi (@DynamoDeFi) March 27, 2025 Aave has nailed down its spot as the top DeFi platform for lending and borrowing on Ethereum, with more than $19.5 billion in TVL. It has a reputation for offering very innovative, very interesting financial products; in fact, it’s become the certification authority for such products in the crypto space. If you want to earn interest on something, or if you want to pledge something as collateral to take out a loan, Aave is pretty much the place to go if you want to do it in a DeFi way. The platform happens to be incredibly user-friendly as well, which also counts for something. And you have to give them credit for being strong, transparent, and getting governance right—all of which matters-matters for both institutional players and individual users. Aave ( $AAVE ) ➙ Biggest lending/borrowing protocol on Ethereum ➙ $19.5B+ in TVL, $60M annualized revenue with no token unlocks left ➙ Starting $1M/week token buybacks soon, which will add some buying pressure. pic.twitter.com/ucLWiqO3qN — Sjuul | AltCryptoGems (@AltCryptoGems) March 27, 2025 Aave’s Growing Appeal to Everyday Users Falling levels of concentration in the supply and borrowing activities of Aave’s big “whale” users are now a clear sign that the smart contract banking platform has become much more popular among everyday users. Since Aave has been providing services to an ever-expanding base of normal individuals, the use of its platform has also included a corresponding increase in the normal transaction patterns and level of participation that these types of individuals exhibit. The nice thing about this event as a whole is that it is both quite inclusive and equally a step toward a more decentralized financial system. User demographic shifts may be a response to DeFi adoption. As finance becomes more decentralized, we have more control over our money, and platforms like Aave are set up to meet our needs. Aave lets you earn interest on assets you just have lying around. You can effectively rent them out to people who want to take out loans. You can also take out a loan yourself from the same platform. Aave is set up to do these things without anybody getting in the way, and it was apparently designed with people in mind who have previously been somewhat shut out of the finance sector. Aave no longer serves mainly large entities; it serves a more diverse clientele. This is a sign that the DeFi space, in which Aave is a major player, is maturing. It means that Aave is accessible—and perhaps even inviting—to an increasing number of retail users and experienced participants in DeFi. That is something to admire about Aave. Key Features and Future Growth Beyond the increasing enthusiasm of typical users, Aave’s core structure is seeing continued advancement. The total value that is now locked (TVL) in Aave has gone past $19.5 billion, keeping Aave distinctly above any nearest rivals as the largest lending and borrowing protocol on Ethereum. Even when not paying attention to the growing user base, it’s clear that Aave’s leadership in decentralized finance is being solidified by some very interesting, innovative, and user-friendly features. The protocol’s remarkable total value locked mirrors not just its triumph in drawing users—it also indicates a win in keeping cash on hand, which is necessary for the protocol to make the transactions it needs to make and be competitive in the DeFi lending space. Aave sitting at the head of the Ethereum lending market speaks volumes about the protocol’s capacity to pivot when necessary. In the DeFi ecosystem, Aave is working to strengthen its position further. It has some new initiatives in place that are aimed at driving growth and, more importantly, creating a lot more value for the holders of its token. One of the most exciting programs that are now set to launch is Aave’s new buyback program. It’s a huge buyback program that is going to start quite soon. Aave is going to buy back $1 million worth of its token every week for potentially a long time. The buybacks show that the Aave team is working to add value to its ecosystem, which in turn benefits both holders and users of its tokens. Now that all the tokens that were slated for unlocking have been unlocked, the Aave team is focusing on giving back to the community that supports it and on driving the token’s market position in a way that is beneficial to both holders and users. Aave’s Impact on the Broader DeFi Ecosystem Aave’s influence in the decentralized finance ecosystem is growing, and it is, without question, the rising star of this new universe. DeFi can now unfurl its sails effectively—with Aave’s wind in its favor, as it were—and move into the future. Aave’s success carries weighty implications for the concept of decentralized lending and borrowing. As with any widely adopted platform, Aave sets the stage for what comes next in the rapidly developing space of decentralized finance. By offering new capabilities and channeling ever more funds into its aethereal universe, Aave also lays bare to what extent a platform can satisfy critics and dreamers alike by operating efficiently, transparently, and, above all, safely. To what extent can DeFi achieve these things? If critics are to be believed, quite a few promises remain unfulfilled. If dreamers are to be believed, most of what happens in Aave’s universe is a miracle. In conclusion, Aave’s transformation from a platform dominated by whales to one that caters to everyday users spotlight its rising influence in the DeFi space. With a substantial TVL, strong feature set, and a future with token buybacks, Aave looks good for future growth. It continues to expand its everyday user base and offer “all on-chain” services by which “value” can be measured. What will keep Aave at the forefront of the DeFi movement is that it appears to be placing all the right bets with its near-term roadmap. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

42565057,https://nulltx.com/?p=147582,1743222236,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"TON Token Makes a Strong Comeback, Rebounding from March’s Losses as Investors Accumulate Again",https://nulltx.com/ton-token-makes-a-strong-comeback-rebounding-from-marchs-losses-as-investors-accumulate-again/,"One of the few digital assets that seems to be performing well today is the TON token. After traveling a downtrend for a few months, the asset seems to be rebounding. Much of March saw TON’s price action leave nearly 100% of its holders in the red. March 2023 was not a good month for TON holders. The token drifted downward and escaped no one’s grasp. Certainly, it escaped the grasp of the 100% price action that devastated nearly every asset as the broader market wasn’t performing nicely either. The resurgence of TON has not only been marked by a steady rise in price but has also been accompanied by a considerable outflow of tokens from exchanges. In light of yesterday’s noteworthy exodus of 1.1 million TON from exchanges, it seems clear that investor sentiment is shifting, with many opting to move their assets into more secure wallets, rather than keeping them on trading platforms. And this behavior is more than just a temporary thing. It seems many TON investors, confident in the future prospects of the token, are increasingly opting to accumulate it. TON’s Rebound Signals Investor Confidence A recovery in TON is a promising sign for not only the token but also the wider cryptocurrency market. This is especially true given the challenges the asset faced earlier this month. In early March, the token was in a tailspin, with its price significantly dropping, and nearly all of its holders were sitting on paper losses. This situation is typical in the highly volatile world of cryptocurrencies, where price fluctuations are common and often extreme. Nonetheless, TON’s capability to recover from these testing conditions is suggestive of the robustness of its community and the promise of a long-term growth trajectory. The token we have been studying seems to have bottomed out, for now, and is slowly working its way back from the depths—mostly thanks to a couple of recent partnerships, including one with a very influential artist. Currently, right about 87% of folks holding the token over at Binance are now operating at a profitable level. That’s some pretty damn good assurance for investors. 1/ TON is one of the few tokens in the green today, rebounding from a prolonged downtrend that left nearly 100% of holders at a loss in early March. Its steady upswing now has roughly 10% of holders back in profit. pic.twitter.com/zcWXmoFLkE — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) March 28, 2025 The present recovery is also remarkable because it mirrors wider market trends. At a time when numerous tokens are badly attempting to restore value after a stretch of losses, TON’s performance stands tall as an emblem of resilience. While it’s still too early to make any calls on whether this upward push will continue, the fact that it is in play has traders and investors feeling quite optimistic. A Surge in Accumulation Points to Growing Confidence One of the most clear indicators of the recovery of TON has been the recent outflow of tokens from exchanges. More than 1.1 million TON were withdrawn yesterday from various trading platforms, and this is clearly a sign that gives me assurance that investors are confident enough to hold their tokens long-term rather than to engage in any kind of short-term trading. This outflow, then, is an indication of positive investor sentiment. It suggests, to me at least, that many more people than before are in a position to hold the token long-term and are more likely to be liquidating their holdings at a profit rather than at any kind of loss. Traditionally, when large amounts of tokens are transferred from exchanges, it signifies that investors are accumulating and expecting significant price appreciation. Investors may be signaling that they believe the current price of the TON is undervalued, with expectations that it will rise alongside improving market conditions. Additionally, transferring tokens to private wallets may indicate that investors intend to hold the tokens long-term. To the best of our knowledge, there hasn’t been a large-scale transfer of TON to private wallets in the past. When exchanges have seen a TON outflow, the price of that token has tended to go up. That can only mean that investors are increasingly confident in the asset—and that confidence could bring even more gains in the near future. What’s Driving the TON Recovery? TON’s recent rebound could be due to several factors. The recovery of the broader cryptocurrency market was one of the main reasons for the rebound of TON as it was part of this broader trend. The entry of institutional investors in the cryptocurrency space could have had a positive effect on assets like TON. These new investors see TON as a potential mainstream cryptocurrency and are looking to diversify their portfolios. In addition, a vital aspect allocating TON to recovery is its community. As with many cryptocurrencies, the strength and loyalty of a project’s community can play a key role in its success. TON seems to be an exception since it could recover from a steady decline in its price. With a price of $0.03391905 on March 15, 2023, the token recovered to a price of $0.05973801 on June 13, 2023. In summary, the recuperation of TON from the downward trend it suffered in early March is a sign not only for the token itself but also for the greater crypto market that better days may lie ahead. The token has shown a steady increase in price, and we have seen accumulation by all kinds of investors. A recovery seems to be materializing with the token now showing a steady upswing in price, and a significant outflow of tokens from exchanges is a good sign for hodlers. Whether it can maintain this upswing is another matter, but the signs certainly are looking better for the token itself. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Reactions from institutional players and growing volumes of social media posts signal that the largest digital asset may be poised for a breakout. Recent events seem to guarantee a commensurate uptick in favorable commentary to negative commentary that we saw in earlier parts of this year. Indeed, the ratio we see today is 18:1 in favor of Bitcoin and a commensurate recovery in the space. Institutional Moves Driving the Bullish Trend One major reason Bitcoin is gaining unprecedented acceptance among the masses is that institutional interest has never been stronger than it is today. Recently, the likes of GameStop and BlackRock have embraced the crypto world, with the former dipping its toes into integrating Bitcoin into its business model—which now looks a lot like the something that might have, say, 10 uses—while the latter has done who knows what with the digital asset. (It was BlackRock, by the way, that got GameStop to look into Bitcoin in the first place; mostly kidding here, but the institutional world is once again showing signs of life.) At the same time, investment behemoth BlackRock has been making some very positive crypto headlines. They have gone ahead and launched the very first yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on Solana—the fast, efficient blockchain platform. Now, this wasn’t just some random BlackRock move. It was an important, almost revolutionary, shift for the whole community of institutional investors. You don’t get a much bigger player in the traditional finance world than BlackRock. And to see them embrace Solana, yield-bearing treasury funds, and the cryptocurrency space in general is a big validation of the crypto space itself. With news that institutions like GameStop and BlackRock are integrating Bitcoin and launching yield-bearing tokenized treasury funds on Solana, crypto's #5 market cap asset is seeing an astounding level of bullish sentiment pouring in on social media. Many social media posts… pic.twitter.com/Mgm2o1qrkB — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 26, 2025 When these institutional players keep on building, they keep on buying, and they keep on influencing the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. They strengthen public confidence in how legit and real these digital assets are, and they cause many of us—investors and enthusiasts—to take even more seriously the idea that Bitcoin and its brethren are on a path toward the kind of widespread acceptance that the financial world calls mainstream. Social Media Influence and the Role of Community Support While the backing from institutions is undoubtedly vital, it is the online communities and social media that are shaping the “Future of Bitcoin”. For a long time, these platforms have been the medium where information and discussions within the crypto space are shared. The current price rise for Bitcoin and its “future optimism” is largely being driven on social platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Discord, is what a recent Coindesk article noted. This may have something to do with being an influencer and the influencer effect. One of the bull market’s current features that stand out is the nearly unprecedented level of positive sentiment on social media. Data show that the ratio of positive to negative commentary related to Bitcoin is an astonishing 18:1. That’s 18 positive posts or comments for every one negative. This is a stance rarely, if ever, taken in the not-so-recent past. The bullish conversations surrounding Bitcoin are all about its price reaching new all-time highs, the market recovering faster than the eye can see, and the incessant flood of positive press Bitcoin’s getting from the big boys on Wall Street. This positivity is derived not simply from speculation but also from Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a way to preserve wealth, a countermeasure to inflation, and a long-term investment. The Twitter hype surrounding Bitcoin is made even more potent by the crypto community’s online influencers, who are not shy about expressing their bullish sentiment and, even more, about using this platform to educate their massive audiences on the incalculable benefits of preserving wealth with Bitcoin and what they figure is the imminently bright future of decentralized finance. A New Era for Bitcoin? Given these factors—the presence of substantial institutional investment and a surge of almost too-good-to-be-true optimism on platforms like Twitter and Instagram—it seems clear that Bitcoin is undergoing a once-in-a-generation metamorphosis. As Bitcoin garners more and more attention, the overall crypto market is expected to gain from this uptick. Altcoins, like Ethereum, Solana, and many others, are seeing swelling interest from investors keen to diversify into a range of digital assets. It’s a reflection not only of Bitcoin’s ongoing success but also of the crypto ecosystem’s broader growth. That, in turn, seems to be a pretty clear signal of society’s increasing acceptance of DeFi and the sorts of digital currencies that are part of the future financial landscape. At present, the institutional adoption and technological progress, community backing, and influencer activism combine to yield an outlook for Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency realm that’s practically off the charts. With almost an 18-to-1 ratio of favorable sentiment, it seems perfectly safe to assert that the tomorrow of Bitcoin appears brighter than ever. And with the conversations on social media seeming to pump this optimism up even further, the market looks primed for the kind of pay-off growth and institutional legitimacy that seems bound to occur in the months ahead.

The appreciation in price can be credited to a number of factors, with some rather favorable developments lately, including a noticeable boost in social media visibility and a burgeoning interest from some pretty important folks in the LINK token. Where it all stands now, though, is within the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap, where current momentum might have some people thinking this is just the first leg in a more extended rally for Chainlink. Private Meetup with US Government Leaders Fuels Social Dominance What seems to be fueling Chainlink’s recent growth is its networking with key players, especially in government. A private meetup that Chainlink hosted with leaders from the U.S. government is indicative of how much the project has solidified its presence in the political stakeholder community. From what we can see on social media, a considerable amount of discussion has stemmed from this recent Chainlink government meetup. It seems likely that the meetup has helped boost Chainlink’s social dominance, which is a measure of how much public conversation there is on social platforms about a cryptocurrency. The project seems to be talking with a lot of powerful, and apparently happy, government people, which has got to add some appeal both to investors and to institutions. I mean, who doesn’t want to buy into a project that’s having meetups with top government officials? And in a period when discussions around blockchain and cryptocurrency regulation seem to be heating up, this adds even more appeal to Chainlink. This alignment with policymakers is critical, given that the regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies are still very much up in the air. If you’re an investor, you might look at a prominent project such as Chainlink and view it as an indicator token—that is, a token that is possibly well-positioned to get through some future regulatory obstacle course. That’s mainly because of the relationships that project is building with governmental bodies. Whale Activity and Growing Stakeholder Holdings Besides the Chainlink social media buzz, another critical driver of its recent growth stems from the notable increase in the holdings of key stakeholder wallets. These wallets hold between 10,000 and 10 million $LINK tokens. And they have collectively seen a surge in activity. At present, these large holders hold an all-time high of 438.33 million $LINK tokens, which amounts to an astonishing 43.8% of the total coin supply. Chainlink has seen a jump in social dominance across crypto social media following its hosting of a private meetup with key US government leaders. The #11 market cap has jumped +25% in value since March 10th. Additionally, we are seeing growth from key stakeholder wallets… https://t.co/DmDUemu5dm pic.twitter.com/YdoxjFFxin — Santiment (@santimentfeed) March 28, 2025 These stakeholders behave in a way that is particularly noteworthy because the accumulation of such a substantial share of the circulating supply by so few wallets signals confidence in the token’s long-term value. When large holders front-run accumulation of this nature, it communicates a number of things that might otherwise remain hidden to the market. For instance, it might signal to us that those in the know expect upcoming developments or potential partnerships that could really drive Chainlink’s growth. Additionally, the holding of such a large proportion of the total supply by these wallets also points to Chainlink continuing to lure in institutions to put their money behind it. When it comes to price movements, whale activity often acts as a leading indicator. That is, when we see a lot of big purchases happening, it can frequently be interpreted as a sign that a price increase is on the way. Since there has been a noticeable rise in not just whale activity but also the price of $LINK itself, it seems that the Chainlink train is going to keep on rolling for the time being. Chainlink’s Potential as a Key Player in the DeFi and Blockchain Ecosystem For a long time, Chainlink has been viewed as a key part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, providing necessary, essential services such as secure, decentralized oracles that smart contracts can use to work with external data sources. Increasingly, Chainlink seems to be establishing itself as the blockchain ecosystem’s go-to source for enabling the kinds of interactions between smart contracts and external agents that are necessary for decentralized financial applications to do their jobs. The blockchain industry is still growing, and Chainlink is all the more essential for its mission to connect real-world data to decentralized applications. The project operates by relaying information from off-chain to on-chain systems that presumably exist in many more forms than we can currently imagine. If you think of all the possible use cases for smart contracts, there are endless potential scenarios where they need reliable, real-time data in order to fulfill their programmed functions. Chainlink is the very best bet for this situation. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Chainlink? The increased prominence of social media, a powerful stakeholder network, and burgeoning institutional attention uniquely position Chainlink for a likely trajectory of greater success. In a climate where cryptocurrency projects can no longer count on public indifference and are instead facing something more akin to thorough vetting, the pro-Chainlink advances made by aforesaid Clout Network could very well render it a poster child for compliance and, hence, regulatory legitimacy. In closing, Chainlink has cemented its status as an essential player in both the cryptocurrency world and in governmental affairs. Its price has shown outstanding growth, and investor interest has accelerated. The project is going places, and how it evolves from here will be something to watch. The impressive strength of LINK makes it a serious contender for the title of best altcoin. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The transaction, worth $11.14 million, represents a gain of $4.63 million from an earlier purchase made a month before. This massive transfer has been noticed by the crypto community, and it’s not hard to see why. This is the kind of well-timed trade that underlines the huge potential (or is it danger?) for just-for-fun investors trying to make a buck in the topsy-turvy crypto market. The Strategic Move: From $0.75 to $1.26 – A $4.63 Million Profit Approximately a month ago, 8.7 million $LAYER tokens were taken out of Binance, when the token’s price stood at merely $0.75. Back then, the worth of those tokens was around $6.51 million. The entity behind this big move—likely a whale or an institutional player that was building a substantial position in $LAYER—was certainly not doing so at a time when it could reasonably expect anything but a rebound to make its accumulation worthwhile. In only 30 days, the $LAYER token has shown an astounding upswing in value, with the price now sitting at $1.26. Earlier today, when Binance received 8.7 million tokens back, the value of those tokens had shot up to an astonishing $11.14 million. As such, this token’s meteoric rise has yielded an impressive profit of $4.63 million in just one month. The move comes at a time when $LAYER has drawn growing interest from both retail and institutional investors, and the price surge very much reflects a trend of increasing demand. The whale’s decision to offload such a substantial portion of its holdings on Binance likely indicates confidence in the price action, capitalizing on what appears to be market momentum for a profitable exit. Why $LAYER? Institutional Investors Seizing Opportunities For institutional investors, timing is everything. The capacity to buy things at low prices and then sell them at peak moments, when prices have rallied, guarantees investors a path toward profits. In the case of $LAYER, the whale’s initial investment of $6.51 million at the $0.75 price point has paid off handsomely, with a return of over 70% in just one month. Although the exact reasons for the surge in $LAYER’s price are somewhat opaque, we think it likely reflects a mix of the following elements: As with any token, $LAYER’s price can sometimes seem like a one-way elevator: Positivity around $LAYER can make it go up. And with that in mind, virtue No. 1 for $LAYER is that it’s quite a nice token to be virtue-signaling with. Why? Because $LAYER gives you a positive way to think about a world with fully decentralized storage infrastructure. 一个月前以 $0.75 的价格囤积 $LAYER 的鲸鱼/机构，在 20 分钟前将 870 万枚 $LAYER ($11.14M) 以 $1.26 的价格转进币安，盈利 $463 万。 ◎这 870 万枚 $LAYER 是在一个月前从币安提出，当时 $LAYER 价格是 $0.75，价值 $651 万。 ◎20 分钟前全部转进币安，现在的 $LAYER 价格是 $1.26，价值 $1114… pic.twitter.com/Tt3hZBcUit — 余烬 (@EmberCN) March 28, 2025 This transfer is especially significant because of the size. 8.7 million tokens moved to Binance. With $LAYER now at $1.26, that means 8.7 million tokens have been transferred to an exchange, which is nearly 2x what gets moved in an average day (with LAYER’s 24-hour volume currently at $4.14M). These tokens represent a good portion of the total circulating supply, and large transactions like this can definitely shift market sentiment. A Look at Binance and Market Sentiment One of the world’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance critically affects the price movements of many tokens. When a whale transfers 8.7 million $LAYER tokens to Binance, it likely signals that the whale believes there’s too much demand for the token on the exchange for it to be considered safe. In that case, aberrant price-supporting behavior by Binance could push the price of $LAYER up. The market sentiment pertaining to $LAYER has changed radically over the preceding month, as its price has almost doubled from $0.75 to $1.26. It’s apparent that both institutional and retail investors are looking at $LAYER as a potential token with strong growth. Whether this rally is sustainable isn’t clear, but a whale deciding to offload a large portion of their holdings after such a surge suggests that the investor is taking advantage of the current market peak. It’s worth noting that the price of cryptocurrencies can be markedly affected by whale activity, as large transactions can create ripples in the market. The 8.7 million $LAYER tokens transferred to Binance could elicit further trading activity on the exchange that might influence the price of the token, depending on how other investors react to the movement. The Impact of Whale Movements on Crypto Markets Movements of whales are an integral part of the cryptocurrency market, often making a significant impact on market prices because of the sheer volume of assets being traded. Some might view transfers of large-scale assets as a sign of strength or confidence in a token’s price trajectory. Yet, these same large-scale transfers could just as easily be viewed as a signal that authorities are stepping in to manipulate the market, or that whales are trying to lock in profits. The reasons behind institutional players’ actions and the way they operate can be very illuminating for the average retail investor when it comes to understanding the currents that drive the market. One huge player made a huge bet on a new token called $LAYER. This player purchased $LAYER at $0.75. They held the tokens for a month and then transferred to Binance (the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume) a month later at $1.26. So, what does this mean? As $LAYER keeps attracting interest from retail and institutional investors alike, the price of $LAYER is likely to remain under the influence of similar orders from top-tier traders and bigger market movements. For now, though, the profit of $4.63 million realized by this $LAYER whale clearly indicates how much richness can be found in trading this cryptocurrency with a proper amount of richness and somewhat reasonable timing. To conclude, this profit of $4.63 million serves as a reminder of the kinds of handsome rewards that can come from carefully executed cryptocurrency trades. With its swift growth in value and robust institutional interest, $LAYER may well. continue to be a central focus for crypto traders intent on profiting from short-term price swings. The future of $LAYER is anyone’s guess. But for this particular whale, the outcome of this investment strategy was decidedly not left to chance. The payoff was big.

A recent snapshot of this was captured by a trader who realized extraordinary gains by trading the freshly introduced $Mubarak token in the hours following its listing on Binance this morning. The trader grew a nearly 150K investment into a staggering 1.6 million bucks by strategically buying, selling, and moving $Mubarak coins across various crypto venues. The Strategic Trade: A Timeline of Success This lucrative trade’s journey began between March 14 and March 16 when the unknown trader spent a total of $149,000 to acquire 13 million $Mubarak tokens at $0.011 per token. Eventually, the token shot way above these prices, going as high as $0.5 in May and currently at around $0.3. Therefore, the profits for this trade started off at some point between March 14 and March 16, and have definitely materialized by now. It should be noted too that this price trajectory is not something we have seen with all altcoins so far in 2023. 在币安 5 点上线 $Mubarak 现货后，一个地址将 1100 万枚 $Mubarak ($1.49M) 转进了币安。他在 $Mubarak 上得到了 $160 万 (+1075%) 的收益。 ◎他在 3/14-3/16 一共花费 $14.9 万资金购买了 1300 万枚 $Mubarak，价格 $0.011。 ◎6 天前通过 Bitget 以 $0.133 的价格卖出了 200 万枚 ($0.266M)；… pic.twitter.com/Pzve1hccRh — 余烬 (@EmberCN) March 28, 2025 Speeding up to six days ago, this trader sold 2 million of the 13 million $Mubarak tokens via the Bitget exchange. These tokens were sold at $0.133 apiece, and the sale netted a partial profit of $266,000, if my rough arithmetic is right. This sale, while only representing a portion of the trader’s holdings, allowed the trader to lock in some gains while still maintaining the bulk of their $Mubarak coins. The trader’s most profitable actions occurred after Binance opened trading for $Mubarak this morning at 5:00 AM. When the coin went live on the spot market at Binance, the trader sent over the last of his tokens—11 million in total—to the platform. For a brief moment, the price of $Mubarak on Binance was hovering around $0.135. This was just barely above the price at which the trader had sent partially finished sell orders over to Bitget. Even though the recent price increase compared to the earlier sale on Bitget was slight, the trader nonetheless reaped a tidy sum from their initial investment, considering they had bought the tokens for a mere $0.011. By taking the remaining 11 million $Mubarak over to Binance and cashing them out at $0.135, this individual saw an additional $1.49 million tumble into their lap. Altogether, they netted a monstrous profit of $1.6 million. This shows a profit increase of over 1075%—not only an impressive feat but also a demonstration of the almost ludicrous profit potential in the cryptocurrency market when we make decisions that, in hindsight, look good. By purchasing early, selling at strategic moments, and taking advantage of a major exchange listing, this trader was able to realize a significant return on their initial investment. Why Did $Mubarak Surge? Binance Listing and Market Sentiment Several factors caused the value of $Mubarak to surge, which in turn led to substantial profits for this trader. The prime factor: a listing on Binance. Binance is one of the world’s largest, most potent cryptocurrency exchanges, and simply being added to its coin roster opens all kinds of doors. To put it plainly, a new token being listed on Binance tends to have its price increased because of, you know, a thing called demand. Besides the listing, the overall market sentiment about $Mubarak has been responsible for its price uptick. When a new token shows promise, investors and traders usually rush toward it; and when that token launches on a major exchange like Binance, the excitement can get pretty loud. For a lot of traders, the idea of getting in on a potentially good token at an early point is with a relative low cost is a strong enough shelling reason to go ahead and shell out for said coin. Investing in $Mubarak ahead of its Binance listing was a well-informed move for the trader. This was not only because of the trends in the token’s price but also because of the overall market trends and the probability of a successful exchange listing. The trader bought the tokens at a low price and sold them post-listing, achieving significant returns by leveraging the Binance momentum. The Future of $Mubarak: Will This Momentum Continue? $Mubarak already has demonstrated the potential for enormous price increases over brief spans of time. So, many are asking if this momentum will persist—or if $Mubarak may be due for a price correction. Like any cryptocurrency, the price of $Mubarak is quite volatile. And even though the recent price surge has been impressive, it’s not at all clear if that price growth is going to sustain. The profit potential is clear for traders who entered early like this particular investor. However, for those considering investing now, it is crucial to weigh the risks involved. Sharp price fluctuations are a hallmark of cryptocurrencies, and while a token’s value can increase dramatically, it can also plummet just as dramatically. At present, $Mubarak’s outstanding performance spotlights the significance of timing and strategy in cryptocurrency trading. This particular trader has made an impressive profit that stands out in recent memory, and the way he’s gone about it offers lessons to be learned in what to do if and when you find yourself in a similar situation. On the face of it, the actions of this trader, which netted him a big profit this week, seem to run contrary to advice that’s often given about trading. Indeed, the steps he took highlight what some would call a “timing trade.” Here are the basics, one by one. This tale recalls the payoffs that can result from taking the right steps at the right moment in the fast-moving sphere of digital currencies. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Ethereum Price Hits 4-Year Low Against BTC,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-crypto-crashing-ethereum-price-hits-4-year-low-against-btc/,"The post Why is Crypto Crashing? Ethereum Price Hits 4-Year Low Against BTC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market took a major hit on Friday, wiping out nearly all the gains from earlier this week. Bitcoin, which was hovering close to $88,000, plunged to $83,800, marking a 3.8% decline in just 24 hours. Major altcoins like Avalanche (AVAX), Polygon (POL), Near (NEAR), and Uniswap (UNI) losing almost 10%. The market shed a staggering $115 billion in value as per market data. Ethereum also struggled, dropping over 6% and hitting its weakest price against Bitcoin since May 2020. Unlike Bitcoin ETFs, which have seen over $1 billion in inflows over the last two weeks, Ethereum ETFs have failed to attract new investments since early March. This lack of interest adds to concerns about ETH’s performance compared to BTC. How Are U.S. Stocks and Economic Woes Impacting Crypto? The downturn wasn’t just limited to digital assets. The broader U.S. stock market also saw a sharp decline following the release of weak economic data. The S&P 500 fell 2%, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.8%. Crypto-related stocks suffered even more, with MicroStrategy (MSTR), the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, losing 10% and Coinbase (COIN) falling 7.7%. The February inflation report showed a 2.5% year-over-year rise in the price index, with core inflation at 2.8%, slightly above expectations. Consumer spending only grew by 0.4%, with adjusted figures indicating weak economic growth. The Federal Reserve’s GDPNow model now predicts the U.S. economy could shrink by 2.8% in the Q1, raising fears of stagflation. Plus, new U.S. tariffs set to take effect on April 2 have added to investor concerns. Was This Bitcoin Price Crash Expected? Bitcoin’s drop to $84,000 was anticipated due to the CME futures gap from earlier this week. Historically, BTC tends to revisit these gaps and this pullback was likely. However, with Bitcoin closely following the Nasdaq’s movements, a continued downturn in U.S. stocks could lead to further losses in crypto. But Santiment notes that while global stock markets, including the S&P 500, faced sharp declines due to tariff and inflation concerns, Bitcoin managed a slight weekly gain, hovering around $84.3K. A mild BTC rebound after the stock market’s close hints at crypto’s growing independence from equities, a contrast to its strong correlation during the 2022 bear market. Despite the ongoing correction, some experts see long-term positives. Joel Kruger, a strategist at LMAX Group, pointed out that crypto adoption is growing, with major financial institutions expanding their involvement. While more short-term dips could occur, he expects strong support around the $70,000–$75,000 range, making a potential recovery later this year more likely. On the Downside… Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe warns that Bitcoin is losing momentum, with key liquidity levels below $84K at risk. If BTC breaks this support, further declines could follow. He suggests another week of drops might be on the way before a potential rebound in Q2. What crypto market is down today? Weak U.S. economic data, rising inflation, and new tariffs triggered a broader selloff across both crypto and stock markets.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 04:37:58

Grayscale aims to convert its existing trust product into a publicly traded exchange-traded fund (ETF). The proposed AVAX ETF is part of a broader wave of crypto ETF filings as asset managers look to capitalize on the regulatory momentum following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs earlier this year. According to official documents, Nasdaq has submitted Form 19b-4 to the US SEC to apply for listing shares of Grayscale Avalanche Trust. https://t.co/bfLjTMu1Qj — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 28, 2025 The filing comes amid increasing interest in AVAX, which ranks as the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. If approved, this ETF would provide investors with a regulated and accessible avenue to gain exposure to AVAX. The submission follows VanEck’s recent S-1 filing for a similar AVAX-based investment product, indicating a competitive race to introduce the first AVAX ETF. Grayscale’s move also aligns with its broader strategy of expanding its portfolio of cryptocurrency ETFs, which already includes pending applications for XRP, Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Polkadot (DOT). Growing Institutional Interest in Altcoin ETFs Grayscale’s latest filing is part of a growing trend of institutional interest in altcoin ETFs as asset managers seek to diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The trend has accelerated in response to changing regulatory dynamics and increasing mainstream adoption of digital assets. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year set a precedent, encouraging firms to pursue ETFs for alternative cryptocurrencies. Grayscale’s submission of its AVAX ETF follows similar filings for Hedera (HBAR) , Polkadot (DOT) , Cardano (ADA) , and Dogecoin (DOGE) . Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicts that Litecoin and Hedera have some of the strongest approval odds among altcoin ETFs, given their progress with regulatory engagement. Our official alt coin ETF approval odds are out. Litecoin leads w 90% chance, then Doge, followed by Solana and XRP. We are only doing for 33 Act $IBIT -esque filings. But def poss to see futures or Cayman-subsidiary type 40 Act stuff get through as well. https://t.co/JSaNnifjbu — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 10, 2025 The SEC’s cautious but evolving stance suggests that while immediate approvals remain uncertain, the growing wave of filings indicates a broader acceptance of crypto-based financial products. Additionally, Nasdaq has been at the forefront of these developments, having filed multiple 19b-4 forms for crypto ETFs. Just earlier this month, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) submitted a 19b-4 application for Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF , further intensifying the competition among asset managers to secure a foothold in the expanding crypto ETF market. SEC’s Stance and Market Implications The SEC’s handling of these applications will be a key indicator of its evolving approach to crypto regulation. While the agency has historically been hesitant to approve spot cryptocurrency ETFs, recent shifts in political and regulatory sentiment suggest a more favorable outlook. The reelection of Donald Trump and his administration’s perceived crypto-friendly stance have spurred a wave of new ETF filings as issuers anticipate a more accommodating regulatory environment. The SEC’s acknowledgment of Nasdaq’s Hedera (HBAR) ETF proposal last week triggered a 21-day public comment period, allowing industry stakeholders to voice their opinions before a final decision is made. A similar process is expected for the AVAX ETF. @SECGov acknowledges @Nasdaq filing for @Grayscale 's HBAR Trust ETF. #HBAR #Grayscale https://t.co/oMGVuXUWTW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 12, 2025 In the broader market, the growing acceptance of altcoin ETFs could have significant implications for institutional investment strategies. If approved, these ETFs would offer investors a more accessible and regulated means of gaining exposure to digital assets, potentially driving increased liquidity and market stability. Moreover, the launch of altcoin ETFs could influence the SEC’s stance on other pending applications. With firms like VanEck, Franklin Templeton, and Bitwise actively pursuing ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin, there is high hope for approval. Particularly, if Grayscale’s AVAX ETF secures approval, it could push for broader institutional adoption of Avalanche and similar blockchain networks. For now, the community awaits the SEC’s response, which will play a crucial role in deciding others’ fates.

As part of its response, HyperLiquid’s Foundation will refund users who held JELLY long positions at the time of settlement, using a closing price of $0.037555. This move is expected to ensure that all JELLY traders, except those with flagged addresses, receive a settlement price that is beneficial to them. The decision follows the delisting of JELLY perpetual contracts after validators identified suspicious market activity. What Happened? The incident stemmed from a trader allegedly manipulating the price of JELLY, leading to significant unrealized losses for HLP, a market-making vault within HyperLiquid. The trader, who held $4.85 million worth of JELLY, combined a short position on HyperLiquid with on-chain spot buys, which triggered a liquidation event that transferred the short position to HLP. As the trader aggressively purchased JELLY on decentralized exchanges, its price surged, which temporarily caused HLP’s unrealized losses to reach $13.5 million. With liquidity on decentralized exchanges being relatively low, the price movement was more pronounced. In response, HyperLiquid force-closed the JELLY market and settled it at $0.0095, which is much lower than the $0.50 price reported by decentralized exchange oracles. This decision sparked discussions within the crypto community, with some experts questioning its legality. Meanwhile, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen criticized HyperLiquid’s handling of the JELLY delisting and warned it could follow the path of FTX. The exec argued that the decision, made by a small group of validators, raised concerns about decentralization. Chen also highlighted structural flaws, such as mixed vault risks and a lack of transparency. Her concerns were echoed by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who also questioned HyperLiquid’s decentralization claims. HyperLiquid’s Risk Management Updates In light of these events, HyperLiquid has announced several key changes to its risk management systems. First, the Liquidator vault within HLP will have stricter limits, meaning it will hold a smaller portion of the total HLP account value. It will also be rebalanced less often, and a more advanced system will be used to handle liquidations. Second, the automatic deleveraging (ADL) process will only activate if the Liquidator vault’s losses exceed a certain limit. This will help prevent funds from being automatically moved from other vaults to cover losses. Third, the platform will adjust open interest (OI) caps more dynamically based on market size to ensure they better reflect current conditions. Lastly, an on-chain voting system will allow validators to decide whether to remove assets that fall below certain thresholds. “Yesterday is a good reminder to stay humble, hungry, and focused on what matters: building a better financial system owned by the people. Hyperliquid is not perfect, but it will continue to iterate and grow through the collective efforts of builders, traders, and supporters.” The post Hyperliquid Announces Key Risk Management Updates Following JELLY Market Incident appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Hyperliquid (HYPE),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-29 04:54:59

According to Robert Mitchnick, the head of digital assets at BlackRock, the company is more excited about Ethereum than Bitcoin, especially among its tech team. Mitchnick revealed that for every four people excited about Ethereum, only one is focused on Bitcoin. This shows that BlackRock sees big potential in Ethereum’s ability to run smart contracts and support decentralized apps. Even though BlackRock already manages the biggest Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), its growing focus on Ethereum suggests they’re planning something big with ETH. Also, the number of Ethereum validators—the people who help secure the network—is going up, showing that Ethereum is growing and becoming more popular. Is Ethereum’s Bull Run Over? Ethereum’s price has been riding a rollercoaster, and while some are hopeful, experts say the bearish clouds are still hanging around. Analyst Josh from Cryptio World points out that even though Ethereum shows some short-term bounces, the bigger picture isn’t looking too bright. Ethereum’s price has been falling since it broke below an important support line that’s held for years. This move is a strong sign that the market is shifting from bullish to bearish. Ethereum is testing a key support level around $1,870, based on the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement. If it breaks below this level and struggles to get back above it, the next stop could be around $1,500, a previous low point. If Ethereum does bounce back, it could face heavy resistance between $2,100 and $2,200, which is where it recently hit a wall. In fact, Ethereum rejected that level almost exactly, confirming that it’s a tough barrier to break. While the Stochastic RSI is showing a bullish signal, hinting at a possible short-term bounce, the RSI is at its lowest since June 2022, showing that the overall trend is still leaning bearish.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 05:25:00

This move opens the door for financial institutions to explore the digital asset space without waiting for approvals that never arrived. The FDIC’s new guidance confirms that the “ FDIC-supervised institutions may engage in permissible activities, including activities involving new and emerging technologies such as crypto-assets and digital assets, provided that they adequately manage the associated risks. “ Further, as with all other activities, the institutions should consider the associated risks, consumer protection requirements; and anti-money laundering requirements and consult with their supervisors when needed. FDIC Shifts Stance After Legal Battle with Coinbase The FDIC, which oversees many small banks and protects the banking system, played a big role in the crypto debanking issue. A lawsuit with Coinbase showed the FDIC told banks to avoid crypto deals while creating new rules, but never actually set any. This move comes after President Trump appointed crypto-friendly leaders and urged his administration to support the industry. FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill stated that the new guidance marks a shift away from the previous, ‘flawed approach’ which the FDIC had taken over the last three years. “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards,” he noted. Bo Hines, head of the White House’s digital assets advisory council, praised the the move as a “huge step forward” in a social media post. Previously, the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and OCC all required banks to get pre-approval before engaging in crypto activities. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently reversed its 2022 guidance, which had been issued during a time when the digital asset industry was facing significant issues like failures of major companies and high-profile fraud cases, including the downfall of the global crypto exchange FTX.

Is Hayden Davis Behind Another Rug Pull? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Hayden Davis, the controversial figure behind tokens like MELANIA and LIBRA, is back in the spotlight. Blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps has revealed that Davis has been aggressively selling MELANIA tokens over the past 14 days. His wallets have dumped around $1.06 million worth of tokens onto centralized exchanges while also withdrawing over $2.05 million from liquidity pools. This pattern is shockingly similar to what happened with LIBRA, another project linked to Davis. Meme Horror Continues… 1/ Hayden Davis is STILL selling MELANIA He recently sent $1M to exchanges and extracted over $2M from the liquidity pools pic.twitter.com/1sWIkGmtxj — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) March 28, 2025 Crypto Investigator Bubblemaps, a well-known blockchain analytics platform, revealed that Davis and his team have already cashed out over $100 million from MELANIA and LIBRA using questionable tactics. In collaboration with Coffeezilla, Bubblemaps previously exposed how these tokens were created to make quick profits rather than build long-term projects. For weeks, Davis’s MELANIA wallets were inactive. However, about 12 days ago, he began covertly selling tokens using a one-sided liquidity setup, a trick also used with LIBRA. Millions of tokens were also sent to centralized exchanges like Kraken and MEXC, likely to be sold off. More Liquidity Drained from MELANIA New $MELANIA liquidity pool with 450k to cashout. 16 Minutes ago. The pool is: • single sided again (of course) • one bin step (basically for selling at a specific price) Hayden Davis is not stopping. pic.twitter.com/38I667ethO — dethective (@dethective) March 29, 2025 Soon after this breakout, new reports show a fresh MELANIA liquidity pool with $450K available for cashing out. This setup, detected just minutes after its creation, is designed for selling at a specific price. This suggests that Davis is still actively trying to pull funds out of the token, causing more instability in the market. As of March 28, constant sell orders kept pushing MELANIA’s price down. It dropped from $0.70 to $0.63 in just a few days, with even lower prices on some exchanges. It once peaked at $13.73 but has since lost billions in value. While there’s still some money left in the market, many of its 246,375 holders might struggle to sell before prices drop even more. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Senators Question Trump’s WLFI Stablecoin Over Conflicts of Interest , Political Memecoins- A Warning Sign? The rise of Trump-themed meme coins set the stage for this kind of crypto activity. On January 18, 2025, Donald Trump launched his own memecoin, TRUMP, which skyrocketed from a few cents to an all-time high of $72.68. The hype led to billions in trading volume and opened the door for more political meme tokens. Melania Trump launched MELANIA the next day, but it was seen as a pump-and-dump scheme. Most of the supply was held by a few wallets, and a presale wallet quickly sold off 10%. The same pattern repeated with LIBRA on a larger scale. What’s Next? With Davis continuing to sell, MELANIA’s price could drop even further. The situation shows the risks of investing in political memecoins, which often face price swings, liquidity problems, and possible regulatory crackdowns.

This time, he’s handing out pardons, and the latest beneficiaries are BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed. The trio had pleaded guilty to breaking banking laws, but Trump’s move wipes their records clean. With this bold step, many are now wondering—could Terra’s Do Kwon be next in line? Unexpected Turn in Crypto Regulation Trump’s pardon for the BitMEX founders is a major shift in U.S. cry p to regulation . Previously, the executives had settled their cases by paying $30 million in fines and serving prison sentences. With this pardon, they are now free from any legal restrictions. This decision follows Trump’s earlier pardon of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht , reinforcing his softer stance on crypto-related offenses. Could Do Kwon Be Next? The legal battle between Terra vs. SEC continues , and some in the crypto community believe that Trump’s decision could set a precedent in favor of Kwon. If a similar pardon is granted, it could open new opportunities for Terra and potentially reshape how crypto firms handle regulatory challenges. SEC’s 360 Degree U-Turn – How good is it? The U.S. SEC has also been showing signs of changing its approach. Recently, it dropped charges against Hailey Welch , the influencer linked to the HAWK token. This marks a shift from aggressive crackdowns to a more balanced regulatory stance. Instead of punishing individuals without solid evidence, the SEC’s decision suggests a move toward clearer guidelines and fairer enforcement. While the crypto cheers Trump’s pardon spree, Crypto expert and veteran Peter Schiff lashed Trump’s pardons of crypto executives, stating that while he opposes most anti-money laundering (AML) laws, he believes those pardoned were guilty. He also mentioned that the IRS attempted to indict him for AML violations for years but failed due to his bank’s clean records. Trump pardoned more crypto executives convicted of violating AML laws. I'm against most of those laws, so I'm fine with the pardons, but I'm sure they were guilty. The IRS tried for years to indict me for AML crimes, but my bank was so clean they couldn’t even trump something up. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 28, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What’s Next for Crypto After Ripple, Coinbase Dismissals? Incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins Speaks , The Future of Crypto Regulation Moreover, Paul Atkins, Trump’s nominee to lead the SEC, could give a positive boost. Unlike Gary Gensler, who focused on enforcement actions, Atkins has promised a structured and transparent regulatory framework. Many believe his leadership could encourage institutional investment and the broader adoption of digital assets. However, his own crypto investments, worth nearly $6 million , have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. With the changing trend, Trump’s recent decisions could set the stage for more favorable policies toward crypto.

Ether “died by its own hand” “ETH was buried in an avalanche of its own tokens. Died by its own hand,” Carter said. He said this in response to Lekker Capital founder Quinn Thompson’s claim that Ether is “completely dead” as an investment. Source: Quinn Thompson “A $225 billion market cap network that is seeing declines in transaction activity, user growth and fees/revenues. There is no investment case here. As a network with utility? Yes. As an investment? Absolutely not,” Thompson said in a March 28 X post. The ETH/BTC ratio — which shows Ether’s relative strength compared to Bitcoin ( BTC ) — is sitting at 0.02260, its lowest level in nearly five years, according to TradingView data. At the time of publication, Ether is trading at $1,894, down 5.34% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data. Ether is down 17.94% over the past 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, Cointelegraph Magazine reported in September 2024 that fee revenue for Ethereum had “collapsed” by 99% over the previous six months as “extractive L2s” absorbed all the users, transactions and fee revenue while contributing nothing to the base layer. Around the same time, Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran said Based Rollups could solve the issue of Ethereum’s layer-2 networks pulling liquidity and revenue from the blockchain’s base layer. Cochran said Based Rollups could “directly impact the monetization of Ethereum by making a pretty fundamental change to incentive structures.” Related: Ethereum futures premium hits 1+ year low — Is it time to buy the ETH bottom? Despite optimism toward the end of last year about Ether reaching $10,000 in 2025 — especially after reaching $4,000 in December, the same month Bitcoin touched $100,000 for the first time — it has since seen a sharp decline alongside the broader crypto market downturn. Standard Chartered added to the bearish outlook via a March 17 client letter , which revised down their end of 2025 ETH price estimate from $10,000 to $4,000, a 60% reduction. However, several crypto traders, including pseudonymous traders Doctor Profit and Merlijn The Trader, are “insanely bullish” and argue that Ether could be the “best opportunity in the market.” Source: Merlijn The Trader Magazine: Arbitrum co-founder skeptical of move to based and native rollups: Steven Goldfeder",,EN,0,0,ETH|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-29 05:41:24

But if you think the real gains are behind it—think again. Let’s dig into the hype, crunch the numbers, and find the Best Meme Coins for Exponential Returns that could turn a hundred bucks into a mini fortune. From Arctic Pablo Coin’s frosty fantasy presale journey to Melania’s comeback vibes and the Avalanche-powered COQ Inu surge, these meme coins aren’t just trending—they’re primed for takeoff. Let’s unpack what makes each of these coins a top contender for exponential ROI in 2025. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Frosty Frontier of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns with 9552% ROI Potential Imagine this: a daring explorer named Pablo tears across icy tundras on a snowmobile, not searching for fame—but for $APC tokens hidden within ancient arctic secrets. That’s not just lore—it’s the heart of the Arctic Pablo Coin story. This isn’t just another meme coin presale . It’s a mythical movement, a full-on cartoon-style adventure that ties every presale location to a fantasy-laced storyline. Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly being recognized as one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns, not just because of its narrative flair—but because of the numbers to back it. Currently cruising through its 16th location—Crystal Cove—Arctic Pablo Coin is priced at just $0.000083. With over $2 million raised, it’s not some low-effort rug. This thing is picking up steam fast. And get this—if you toss in $100 today, you’d receive 1,204,819.00 $APC tokens. If it lists at just $0.008, you could be staring at a juicy $9,638.55. That’s not a typo. That’s a 9552.41% ROI. It’s stats like these that rank Arctic Pablo among the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns in 2025. But it’s not just about price action. Arctic Pablo is giving serious value-back to the community with 66% APY staking. Stake your tokens, sit back, and rack up rewards while the narrative drives hype every single week. And here’s the kicker—unsold tokens are burnt weekly, tightening supply and juicing that deflationary model. Fewer coins, more value. Every. Single. Week. That deflationary fire is another reason why this project tops the list of Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns. No boring stages either. This presale is sliced into locations, and every location adds another chapter to the Pablo saga. The price goes up weekly, no matter what. This isn’t your typical “launch and pray” model—it’s gamified, serialized, and totally addictive. That’s why Arctic Pablo Coin is gaining traction among Gen Z and Millennial investors who are chasing the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns with real storytelling and serious staking rewards. The presale is lit with momentum, drawing in thousands of new holders across Australasia, the US, and beyond. Pablo isn’t just breaking ice—he’s breaking into wallets globally. This adventure-packed presale is rewriting the rules of crypto launches and cementing its spot as one of the Best New Meme Coins for Exponential Returns this cycle. Official Melania Meme (MELANIA): The Celebrity Bounce-Back Pick of 2025 Now let’s flip from frosty fantasies to firebrand fame. The Official Melania Meme coin is riding the wave of celebrity-fueled market buzz, and while it’s taken some hits since its all-time high of $13.73 in January, it’s currently trading at $0.6335. That’s down 95.4%—but that could be your cue, not your caution. It recently tapped a new all-time low at $0.6307, which for savvy investors signals one thing: reversal opportunity. With a solid market cap of $340.4 million, over $21.41 million in daily trading volume, and a loyal base of degens and meme traders alike, MELANIA is still very much alive and kicking. There’s no denying that volatility is the name of the game here. But if you’re the type who can stomach the swings, Melania might just be prepping for a big comeback. In a world where attention is the new currency, celebrity-backed tokens often get second winds—and third, and fourth. Especially when they’re still riding high on Solana, one of the fastest-growing blockchains in the space. The token has a circulating supply of 537.31 million and a total supply that nears 1 billion. While it lacks a hard cap, its massive community engagement and consistent CEX/DEX presence make it one of the Best Meme Coins for Exponential Returns this year. COQ Inu (COQ): Avalanche’s Feisty Little Goldmine Don’t let the name fool ya—COQ Inu isn’t just some low-effort clone riding the coattails of past giants. This Avalanche-based meme coin is pumping out numbers that make heads turn. Live price? $0.0000006658. Circulating and total supply? A jaw-dropping 69.42 trillion tokens. But here’s where it gets wild—COQ Inu is up 205,593.79% from its all-time low back in December 2023. If you ever wondered what exponential growth looks like on steroids, this is it. The market cap sits at $45.7 million, with a healthy $2.02 million in 24-hour trading volume. And while it’s still down about 90% from its ATH of $0.056467, the trajectory suggests one thing: this bird might fly again. As Avalanche picks up adoption and more meme coins shift over for cheaper fees and faster transactions, COQ Inu is in a prime spot. It’s already built a solid social presence, with mentions and memes flying fast across X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Discord. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that the Best Meme Coins for Exponential Returns in 2025 aren’t just about hype—they’re about timing, tokenomics, and trajectory. Arctic Pablo Coin leads the pack with its narrative-driven presale, juicy APY staking, and deflationary model that burns unsold tokens weekly. Meanwhile, Melania and COQ Inu offer high-volatility, high-reward plays that cater to risk-savvy investors and meme maniacs alike. So whether you’re chasing storyline-based crypto adventures or gunning for the next moonshot meme, now’s the time to make your move. Don’t just watch the Pablo adventure unfold— Join the Arctic Pablo Coin presale now and lock in your shot at life-changing gains.

Performance Benchmark: It compares the 90-day performance of these top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin (BTC). The Magic Number: The key threshold is 75%. If at least 75% of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days, we’re officially in Altcoin Season . Bitcoin Season Trigger: Conversely, when 25% or fewer of these coins manage to beat Bitcoin’s performance, it’s Bitcoin Season . Index Range: The Altcoin Season Index score ranges from 1 to 100, providing a granular view of the market’s leaning. As of 01:39 UTC on March 29th, the index stubbornly sits at 18, unchanged from the previous day. This low score definitively places us in Bitcoin Season territory. But what does this actually mean for the crypto market ? Why is Bitcoin Dominating the Crypto Market Right Now? The crypto market is a complex beast, influenced by a myriad of factors. When the Altcoin Season Index points to Bitcoin Season , it suggests a few potential drivers are at play: Flight to Safety: In times of uncertainty or market correction, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived ‘safer’ haven within the volatile cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin, being the original and most established cryptocurrency , tends to be viewed as less risky than smaller altcoins . Institutional Interest: Growing institutional adoption often favors Bitcoin. Large institutions are typically more comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin first before venturing into the more speculative realm of altcoins . Recent ETF approvals and institutional narratives around Bitcoin as digital gold further solidify this trend. Narrative Shift: Market narratives can dramatically influence capital flows. If the dominant narrative becomes focused on Bitcoin’s halving, regulatory developments specific to Bitcoin, or macroeconomic factors favoring Bitcoin, it can lead to a Bitcoin Season . Altcoin Underperformance: Sometimes, it’s not just Bitcoin surging, but altcoins lagging. This could be due to profit-taking in altcoins after a period of gains, project-specific issues, or a general cooling off of hype around certain altcoin sectors like NFTs or DeFi. Navigating Your Crypto Portfolio in Bitcoin Season So, the Altcoin Season Index is low, and Bitcoin Season is in full swing. What should you do as a cryptocurrency investor? Here are some actionable insights to consider as you navigate the current crypto market landscape: Re-evaluate Your Altcoin Holdings: This might be a good time to review your altcoin portfolio. Are your altcoins fundamentally strong projects with long-term potential, or are they purely speculative bets? Consider trimming positions in weaker altcoins and consolidating into stronger assets, including Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to accumulate more Bitcoin. If you believe in the long-term potential of cryptocurrency and Bitcoin as the leading asset, dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin during periods of Bitcoin Season could be a prudent strategy. Selective Altcoin Opportunities: While it’s Bitcoin Season overall, not all altcoins are created equal. Some altcoins may still outperform even during Bitcoin Season due to specific catalysts, technological advancements, or strong community support. Research and identify fundamentally sound altcoins that could weather the Bitcoin Season storm and potentially thrive in the next Altcoin Season . Risk Management is Key: Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season , risk management should always be paramount. Diversify your portfolio, don’t overextend yourself, and never invest more than you can afford to lose in the volatile crypto market . Will Altcoin Season Ever Return? The Future Outlook The million-dollar question: is Altcoin Season dead and buried? Absolutely not! The crypto market is cyclical. Just as winter follows summer, Bitcoin Seasons are often followed by Altcoin Seasons , and vice versa. The Altcoin Season Index is a dynamic indicator, and market sentiment can shift rapidly. Factors that could trigger a resurgence of Altcoin Season include: Bitcoin Consolidation: After periods of strong Bitcoin performance, Bitcoin may enter a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This can create an environment where capital rotates into altcoins seeking higher percentage gains. New Altcoin Narratives: Emerging trends and narratives within the cryptocurrency space, such as advancements in DeFi, NFTs, Metaverse, or new layer-1 protocols, can ignite renewed interest in altcoins . Increased Risk Appetite: As the crypto market matures and investors become more comfortable with risk, there may be a greater appetite for the higher volatility and potential rewards associated with altcoins . Technological Breakthroughs: Significant technological advancements in altcoin projects can attract attention and investment, potentially sparking an Altcoin Season . The current Altcoin Season Index of 18 serves as a stark reminder of the crypto market’s ever-changing nature. While Bitcoin Season currently reigns supreme, the cyclical nature of this market suggests that Altcoin Season will likely return. The key is to stay informed, adapt your strategies, and be prepared to navigate both Bitcoin Seasons and Altcoin Seasons to maximize your potential in the exciting world of cryptocurrency .

Without them, features stay theoretical, and projects fail to evolve. This is why BlockDAG’s builder-first approach is gaining so much attention. Keynote 3 revealed a major push for development: a complete launchpad, financial support, worldwide hackathons, ambassador roles, and a growing collection of tools made to support those building tomorrow’s decentralized apps. Backed by high-speed, secure, and scalable infrastructure, BlockDAG (BDAG) is becoming a reliable home for active Web3 builders. Full-Scale Developer Launchpad Offers Real Support While many platforms label themselves as developer-focused, BlockDAG delivers a complete ecosystem meant for real progress. The newly introduced Developer Launchpad is more than just a support center. It works as a space for technical ideas, a resource hub, and a platform to gain recognition within the crypto space. As Steven Clarke-Martin stated during Keynote 3, “This month we’ve launched a developer-first movement—a set of programs that will provide funding, mentorship, and opportunities for those who want to build the next wave of decentralized applications on BlockDAG.” The main objective is to remove common barriers that slow development. By using features like a no-code Token & NFT Wizard, full-stack smart contract tools, and easy-to-use APIs, BlockDAG creates a reliable starting point for every developer. Thanks to its DAG-based structure with parallel processing, the project avoids the performance limits that slow down other blockchain systems. This structure means builders can launch without the typical technical roadblocks. Backing Builders with Rewards That Drive Progress More than just great features are needed to attract developers—real benefits are key. That’s why BlockDAG introduced solid grant programs and international hackathons . Instead of vague promises, real funding is directed to creators of apps, tools, and community-based solutions. The hackathons go far beyond simple contests. With prize money above $100K, plus guidance, access to capital, and community support, these events help transform concepts into usable applications. Builders also gain valuable exposure and networking that’s often missing elsewhere. A bug bounty program is also in progress, letting security specialists test the platform while earning rewards for keeping it secure. Importantly, these programs aren’t temporary. BlockDAG has committed to ongoing support, regular events, and long-term engagement to make sure developer activity keeps rising. Strong Community and Trusted Support Systems BlockDAG is different due to the community it’s building—active, welcoming, and focused on teamwork. Through learning platforms like BlockDAG Academy and its Ambassador Program, newcomers and experienced developers alike find guidance and visibility. No matter your experience—whether you’re new or highly skilled—there’s a path to grow. “Whether you’re an experienced blockchain developer or just getting started,” Clarke-Martin explained, “these initiatives will support your journey.” This support is backed by real actions. With security audits from Certik and Halborn , a live and tested testnet, and a scalable mainnet, BlockDAG offers a trusted platform for development. Its network is also expanding fast due to global partnerships with major names like Inter Milan and the UFC. For builders, this means more than just access to tools—it brings real users and growth chances. Final Thoughts Among countless blockchain platforms, BlockDAG sets itself apart with more than just solid infrastructure—it’s all-in on empowering developers. The complete launchpad, ongoing grants, global hackathons, and focus on education make it more than just a coding platform—it becomes a place for meaningful creation. This project clearly understands that Web3’s future depends on those who create it. As more builders join the BlockDAG environment, one thing stands out: this isn’t just a toolset—it’s a movement that’s only gaining speed.

The latest reading of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing red, indicating a significant shift in market sentiment. It’s like the temperature gauge for the crypto world, and right now, it’s showing a decidedly chilly outlook. After hovering in slightly less fearful territory, the index has taken a tumble, signaling increased crypto pessimism . What does this mean for your investments, and should you be hitting the panic button? Let’s dive into the details. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Should You Care? Imagine having a tool that could give you a snapshot of the overall emotions driving the crypto market. That’s essentially what the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is. Provided by Alternative , this index analyzes various factors to gauge whether the market is experiencing excessive fear or greed. Why is this important? Because market psychology plays a huge role in price movements. Fear can lead to sell-offs and market downturns, while excessive greed can inflate bubbles and lead to unsustainable rallies. Understanding the prevailing sentiment can give you a crucial edge in navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Think of it like this: Extreme Fear (0-24): Investors are overly worried, often leading to potential buying opportunities as assets may be undervalued. Fear (25-49): Caution prevails, and investors are hesitant. This is still considered a bearish signal. Neutral (50): A balanced market sentiment, with neither strong fear nor greed dominating. Greed (51-74): Investors are becoming optimistic, potentially leading to market rallies. Extreme Greed (75-100): Market exuberance is high, which can be a warning sign of an impending correction or bubble. Currently, the index sits at 26, firmly within the “Fear” zone. This reading, taken on March 29th, marks an 18-point drop from the previous day, underscoring a rapid deterioration in crypto market sentiment . This significant decrease suggests that investors are becoming increasingly anxious about the near-term prospects of cryptocurrencies. Decoding the Fear & Greed Index: What Factors Drive Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t based on gut feelings; it’s a data-driven tool that crunches numbers from six key market indicators. Each factor contributes to the overall score, giving a holistic view of market emotions: Volatility (25%): Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with historical averages. High volatility often fuels fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Examines market momentum and trading volume in relation to recent averages. Weak momentum can indicate waning confidence. Social Media (15%): Analyzes sentiment trends on social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for relevant crypto hashtags. Negative social media sentiment can amplify fear. Surveys (15%): Conducts weekly crypto polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Survey results provide a direct pulse on market feelings. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal a flight to safety during fearful times. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Spikes in searches like “Bitcoin crash” can reflect increased fear. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a comprehensive and objective assessment of the prevailing crypto market sentiment . Why the Sudden Dip into Deeper Fear? Examining the Current Market Landscape The 18-point drop into deeper “Fear” isn’t just a random fluctuation. It likely reflects a confluence of factors currently weighing on the crypto market. While the provided content doesn’t specify the exact reasons for this downturn, we can speculate on potential contributing factors: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical tensions, can significantly impact investor sentiment across all markets, including crypto. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory attention and potential crackdowns on the crypto industry in various regions can create uncertainty and fear among investors. Market Corrections: After periods of price increases, natural market corrections are common. These pullbacks can trigger fear, especially if investors are overleveraged or lack long-term conviction. Negative News Flow: Bad news, such as exchange hacks, project failures, or negative pronouncements from influential figures, can quickly erode market confidence. Understanding the potential drivers behind the fear is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Is this a temporary dip fueled by short-term anxieties, or does it signal a more prolonged period of bearishness? Navigating Fear: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is flashing “Fear” – what should you do? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Don’t Panic Sell: Fear can be contagious, but making rash decisions based on short-term market fluctuations is often detrimental. Avoid emotional trading and stick to your long-term investment strategy. Review Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Ensure your portfolio is aligned with your investment goals and that you are comfortable with the level of risk you are taking. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t blindly follow market sentiment. Conduct thorough research on the projects you are invested in and understand their fundamentals. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): In a fearful market, DCA can be a prudent strategy. By investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, you can average out your entry price and potentially benefit from lower prices during downturns. Look for Opportunities: Historically, periods of extreme fear have often presented buying opportunities in the crypto market. When others are fearful, it can be a time to identify undervalued assets with strong long-term potential. Remember, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball. It provides valuable insights into market psychology, but it shouldn’t be the sole basis for your investment decisions. Combine it with your own research and risk assessment to navigate the crypto market effectively. Conclusion: Staying Calm Amid Crypto Market Anxiety The recent plunge in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 26 serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and emotional swings in the cryptocurrency market. While the “Fear” reading indicates widespread crypto pessimism , it’s crucial to remember that market cycles are a natural part of the investment landscape. By understanding the factors driving market sentiment, staying informed, and adhering to a well-thought-out investment strategy, you can navigate these periods of uncertainty with greater confidence. Don’t let fear dictate your decisions; instead, use it as a signal to be cautious, reassess, and potentially identify opportunities that may arise when the market is feeling anxious.

In his post, Claver emphasized the scale of adoption that could be unfolding, stating that as assets worth half a trillion dollars start moving onto the XRP Ledger (XRPL), people should take notice. He asserted that skepticism about XRP’s role in financial institutions has been misplaced and described the shift as a revolution happening in real time. We’re watching major banks test #XRP for real-time payments right now. When half a trillion dollars in assets starts moving onto the #XRPL , you better pay attention. The skeptics were wrong. The revolution is happening right before our eyes. Watch closely or get left behind. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) March 26, 2025 Claver’s remarks suggest that significant financial institutions actively explore XRP for payments and settlements. While he did not specify which banks are involved, his statement implies that institutional adoption of the asset is progressing. If major banks integrate XRP into their operations, it could indicate a shift in how cross-border payments are settled, potentially challenging traditional systems. Market Reactions and Differing Opinions The post led to varied opinions among X users, with some expressing skepticism about XRP’s impact on market movements. One user, CryptoTA, downplayed the significance of institutional usage, pointing out that there are approximately 11,000 banks using the SWIFT system, while Ripple has partnered with fewer than 100 banks. He argued that market movements are driven by large holders rather than adoption, suggesting that despite positive developments surrounding XRP and the broader cryptocurrency industry, price action has remained stagnant. CryptoTA’s perspective highlights the ongoing debate about whether adoption and utility translate directly into market value. Despite XRP’s increasing partnerships and regulatory developments, its price has not seen significant movement, reinforcing the view that market trends are often influenced by external factors such as large-scale liquidations rather than fundamental growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Utility and Regulatory Influence Another user, Dean G, responded to CryptoTA’s comment by addressing the potential for broader institutional adoption of Ripple’s technology. He noted that banks are not required to use SWIFT and questioned what could happen if a substantial portion of them began utilizing Ripple’s solutions Dean G also pointed out that XRP’s utility has been affected by the legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has slowed adoption. Given the country’s economic influence on global markets, he suggested that regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. has played a key role in limiting XRP’s expansion. His statement reflects that regulatory challenges have delayed XRP’s potential, but recent developments like the SEC dropping its lawsuit against XRP could accelerate the token adoption. Claver’s statement and the discussion it generated highlights the growing attention on XRP’s role in financial institutions. If major banks are indeed testing XRP for payments, it could signal a long-term shift in the industry. However, differing views on market dynamics suggest that while adoption may increase, it does not necessarily lead to immediate price appreciation.

42570788,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144535,1743230449,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Shift: Vitalik Buterin Champions Open Source Funding Over Public Goods,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/vitalik-buterin-open-source-funding/,"The crypto world is buzzing with a fresh perspective from one of its most influential voices. Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum, has recently sparked a crucial conversation, urging the community to rethink its approach to funding projects. Instead of primarily focusing on ‘public goods,’ Buterin is advocating for a strategic pivot towards open source funding . Let’s dive into why this shift is considered so vital and what it means for the future of blockchain innovation. What’s the Real Deal with Public Goods in Crypto? In a recent blog post that has ignited discussions across the crypto sphere, Vitalik Buterin articulated his thoughts on the effectiveness of funding models within decentralized ecosystems. He pointed out that while the concept of ‘public goods’ is noble and aims to support projects benefiting a large number of people, it often falls short in practice. Think about it: projects like open source software, essential blockchain research, and freely accessible educational resources are undeniably valuable. They are the backbone of a thriving decentralized world. But, are they getting the funding they truly deserve under the current ‘public goods’ umbrella? Buterin raises a critical point: the term ‘public goods’ itself is often misinterpreted, leading to misdirected funding and unintended consequences. Here’s a breakdown of the challenges he highlights: Misinterpretation and Misapplication: The term ‘public goods’ can be easily misunderstood. People might associate it solely with government-led initiatives, which is not always the case in the decentralized crypto space. Funding Based on Appeal, Not Impact: Often, projects that are visually appealing or have a strong marketing narrative tend to attract funding, regardless of their actual long-term value or contribution to the ecosystem. This can lead to resources being allocated inefficiently. Commercial Projects Masquerading as Public Goods: The lines become blurred when commercial projects, especially those launching their own tokens, claim to be public goods. While commercial ventures are not inherently bad, this practice can obscure the true nature of public goods and make it harder to distinguish between genuinely altruistic projects and those with profit motives. Why Open Source Funding Takes Center Stage? So, if ‘public goods’ funding has its pitfalls, what’s the alternative? Buterin champions a sharper focus on open source funding . His reasoning is quite compelling. He argues that the very nature of open source inherently aligns with the core principles of a public good – providing widespread benefits and fostering collaborative development. Let’s explore why open source funding is emerging as a potentially more effective strategy: Intrinsic Public Benefit: Open source projects, by definition, make their code and resources freely available to everyone. This inherently creates a public good, as anyone can use, modify, and build upon this foundation. Transparency and Collaboration: Open source fosters transparency and encourages community collaboration. This open nature can lead to more robust, secure, and innovative projects, as they benefit from the collective intelligence of a wider developer community. Clearer Funding Focus: Focusing on open source funding provides a more defined and actionable approach. It allows funders to directly support the development and maintenance of the fundamental infrastructure that underpins the entire crypto ecosystem. Reduced Ambiguity: Unlike the broader term ‘public goods,’ open source is a more concrete and well-understood concept, reducing the scope for misinterpretation and misapplication of funds. Benefits of Prioritizing Open Source Funding Shifting the focus towards open source funding in the crypto space could unlock a range of significant benefits. Imagine a future where the foundational layers of blockchain technology are robustly funded and continuously improved by a global community. Here’s what we could gain: Accelerated Innovation: Consistent open source funding can fuel faster innovation cycles. Developers are incentivized to contribute, leading to quicker advancements in core technologies. Enhanced Security and Reliability: With more resources dedicated to open source projects, we can expect stronger security audits, bug fixes, and overall more reliable infrastructure. This is crucial for building trust and stability in the crypto ecosystem. Empowered Developer Community: Open source funding directly supports developers, the lifeblood of crypto innovation. It can attract and retain talent, fostering a vibrant and thriving community of builders. Sustainable Ecosystem Growth: By investing in the foundational open source infrastructure, we pave the way for more sustainable and organic growth of the entire crypto ecosystem. Navigating the Challenges of Public Goods Funding While the intention behind public goods funding is commendable, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges that Buterin highlights. Ignoring these pitfalls could lead to inefficiencies and hinder the long-term progress of the decentralized web. Let’s delve deeper into the problems: Challenge Description Impact on Crypto Funding Ambiguity of ‘Public Goods’ The term lacks a clear, universally accepted definition in the crypto context, leading to varied interpretations. Makes it difficult to define which projects truly qualify for ‘public goods’ funding, leading to subjective decisions. Funding based on ‘Appeal’ Projects with strong marketing or visual appeal may attract more funding, regardless of their fundamental value. Resources may be diverted from essential but less ‘glamorous’ projects like core protocol development or security audits. Commercial Projects’ Claims Commercial entities launching tokens sometimes label themselves as ‘public goods,’ blurring the lines. Distorts the purpose of public goods funding, potentially benefiting for-profit ventures under the guise of public service. Measurement Difficulty Quantifying the ‘public good’ impact of a project can be complex and subjective. Makes it challenging to objectively evaluate the effectiveness of public goods funding and allocate resources based on impact. Examples: Open Source vs. Public Goods in Action To solidify the distinction, let’s consider some practical examples in the crypto landscape: Open Source Examples: Ethereum Protocol Development: The core Ethereum protocol itself is open source . Funding initiatives that support core developers working on protocol upgrades and maintenance directly contribute to open source funding . Solidity Compiler: The Solidity compiler, essential for Ethereum smart contract development, is an open source tool. Funding its development and improvement falls under open source funding . Web3.js and Ethers.js Libraries: These popular JavaScript libraries, used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, are open source . Supporting their development is a prime example of open source funding . Public Goods (Broader Interpretation) Examples: Educational Platforms: Free online courses and educational resources about blockchain technology can be considered public goods , but their open source nature might vary. Community Forums and Social Platforms: Online forums and platforms that facilitate crypto community discussions could be seen as public goods , but might not always be directly tied to open source code development. Decentralized Identity Solutions: Projects aiming to create universal decentralized identity systems could be classified as public goods , but the focus on open source implementation and funding might be less direct. Actionable Insights: Moving Towards Effective Funding Buterin’s call to action is not just theoretical; it’s a practical guide for the crypto community to refine its funding strategies. Here are some actionable insights we can glean: Prioritize Open Source Projects: Actively seek out and support projects that are genuinely open source and contribute to the foundational infrastructure of the crypto ecosystem. Focus on Measurable Impact: When evaluating funding proposals, prioritize projects with clear, measurable impacts on the open source ecosystem, rather than solely relying on subjective ‘public good’ assessments. Encourage Transparency and Accountability: Promote transparency in funding allocation and hold open source projects accountable for delivering on their promises and utilizing funds effectively. Educate and Raise Awareness: Foster a deeper understanding within the crypto community about the nuances of public goods versus open source funding and the importance of strategically allocating resources. Conclusion: A Smarter Path Forward for Crypto Funding Vitalik Buterin’s perspective offers a valuable course correction for crypto funding. By advocating for a sharper focus on open source funding , he highlights a pathway towards more effective, sustainable, and impactful resource allocation. The crypto space thrives on open collaboration and decentralized innovation. By strategically channeling funding towards the open source projects that underpin this ecosystem, we can unlock even greater potential and build a truly robust and beneficial decentralized future. It’s time to heed Buterin’s call and champion the power of open source as the bedrock of crypto progress.

This move, reported by CNBC, effectively wipes the slate clean for the trio who had previously admitted guilt in violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and agreed to hefty $10 million penalties each in 2022. This development arrives after the exchange itself already paid a staggering $100 million fine for serious anti-money laundering (AML) failures. What does this unexpected pardon mean for the future of cryptocurrency regulation and the industry as a whole? Let’s dive deep into this developing story. Trump Pardon: A Shockwave for Cryptocurrency Regulation The news of the Trump pardon has undoubtedly sparked widespread debate and speculation within the crypto community and beyond. The timing and implications of this presidential action raise several critical questions. Was this a politically motivated decision? What signal does it send regarding the U.S. stance on cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement, particularly concerning AML violations? Here’s a breakdown of the key aspects: Unexpected Relief: The pardon offers complete relief from the legal consequences for Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed. They are no longer under the shadow of their past guilty pleas and financial penalties related to AML violations . Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation: This move could be interpreted in various ways. Some might see it as a softening stance on crypto regulation, while others might view it as an isolated act of presidential clemency. The long-term impact on how regulators approach cryptocurrency regulation remains to be seen. Industry Reaction: The crypto industry is likely to have a mixed reaction. While some may see this as a positive sign of reduced government overreach, others might worry that it undermines the importance of compliance and AML violations prevention within the crypto space. Who are the BitMEX Co-founders and What Were the AML Violations? To fully grasp the significance of the Trump pardon , it’s crucial to understand who Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed are, and the nature of the charges against them. BitMEX, or Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, was once a dominant force in the cryptocurrency derivatives market. Here’s a closer look at the individuals and their offenses: Co-founder Role at BitMEX Charge Penalty (Pre-Pardon) Arthur Hayes CEO Violating Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) $10 million fine Benjamin Delo CTO Violating Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) $10 million fine Samuel Reed CFO Violating Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) $10 million fine The AML violations stemmed from BitMEX’s failure to implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering program. U.S. authorities argued that BitMEX deliberately skirted U.S. regulations, allowing the platform to be used for illicit activities. The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to have robust AML programs to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. BitMEX’s shortcomings in this area led to both individual charges against the co-founders and a substantial fine for the exchange itself. Arthur Hayes and the Future After the Pardon Arthur Hayes , as the former CEO and public face of BitMEX, is perhaps the most prominent figure among the pardoned co-founders. His journey from leading a crypto giant to facing criminal charges has been closely watched. Now, with the Trump pardon , what does the future hold for Hayes and his colleagues? Re-entry into the Crypto Space?: The pardon potentially clears the path for Hayes, Delo, and Reed to re-engage more actively in the cryptocurrency industry. Whether they choose to launch new ventures or take on advisory roles remains to be seen. Reputational Impact: While the pardon removes the legal burden, the reputational stain of the AML violations might linger. However, in the often-forgiving world of crypto, a comeback is certainly possible. Lessons Learned for Crypto Exchanges: The BitMEX case, even with the pardon, serves as a crucial reminder to all cryptocurrency exchanges about the paramount importance of robust AML compliance . Ignoring regulatory requirements can lead to severe legal and financial repercussions. The Broader Context of Cryptocurrency Regulation The Trump pardon occurs at a time when cryptocurrency regulation is a hot topic globally. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to oversee this rapidly evolving asset class. The BitMEX case and subsequent pardon highlight the complexities and challenges in this regulatory landscape. Here are some key takeaways in the context of cryptocurrency regulation : Regulatory Uncertainty: The crypto industry still faces significant regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions. The lack of clear and consistent rules can hinder innovation and growth. AML Compliance is Non-Negotiable: Regardless of individual pardons, the message from regulators is clear: AML compliance is not optional for cryptocurrency businesses. Robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML procedures are essential for operating legally. Global Coordination Needed: Given the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, international cooperation in cryptocurrency regulation is becoming increasingly vital to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure effective oversight. Actionable Insights and Looking Ahead What can we learn from this surprising Trump pardon and the BitMEX saga? For individuals and businesses in the crypto space, here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Compliance: For crypto businesses, investing in strong legal and compliance frameworks is not just about avoiding fines; it’s about building trust and ensuring long-term sustainability. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Staying updated on the latest rules and guidelines in your operating jurisdictions is crucial. Engage with Regulators: Proactive engagement with regulators can help shape sensible and effective regulations that foster innovation while mitigating risks. The Trump pardon of the BitMEX co-founders is a significant event in the cryptocurrency world, raising questions about the future of cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement. While it offers relief to the individuals involved, the underlying issues of AML compliance and regulatory clarity remain as critical as ever for the continued growth and maturity of the crypto industry.

Bitcoin is struggling to hold the $85,000 mark, which is a key support level. So, what’s causing this sell-off? A few key factors are at play. First, fresh tariffs announced by President Trump are causing market jitters, especially with new taxes on the auto industry. This uncertainty is making investors nervous, which affects both traditional markets and cryptocurrencies like XRP. Another reason is the fear of a potential recession, fueled by inflation data and economic reports. Even though the fear of a recession isn’t fully backed by facts, it’s still affecting investor confidence. Plus, there’s a lack of liquidity—meaning not enough money flowing into the markets, which makes prices more volatile. XRP Price: What Comes Next? XRP has been catching a lot of attention lately, with experts trying to figure out where its price might head next. Some think XRP could hit between $10 and $11, but that’s not set in stone. A big factor to watch is the potential approval of an XRP ETF, which could really shake things up. Crypto analyst Evan Aldo took a closer look at XRP’s chart and said it’s a bit unusual right now. He thinks XRP might hit around $5.83 soon, which is a key price level. However, he doesn’t expect it to break $6 this year, and reaching $10 might be a bit too ambitious. Aldo also pointed out that if XRP can go above $3.30, the next target could be around $5. It’s important to understand that XRP has a history of staying flat for a while before suddenly jumping, so things could change fast. At press time, XRP has dropped more than 5% and is trading at $2.14.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 07:01:39

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 888,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin could witness a death cross “in about one to two weeks” if the status quo remains. A death cross is a bearish signal that occurs when an asset’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average. According to Cowen, a sell-off could precede the death cross. “There’s plenty of times where there’s a sell-off just before the death cross, just before it… If it happens again, it could be kind of a scary time.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that a looming death cross foreshadows a Bitcoin correction, as witnessed in 2019 and 2021. The widely followed analyst also unveils his outlook in the event that his bearish prediction takes place. “Usually there’s a low around the time of that death cross and depending on how low the price is at that time would sort of give us some insight into the fate of the next rally – whether it’s a rally to a new high or just a counter-trend rally to a lower high.” According to Cowen, a drop below $70,000 could mean that Bitcoin has broken the market structure and will not rise above the current all-time high of around $109,000. “…[BTC could] resolve to a lower high if Bitcoin goes into the $60,000s, especially the low $60,000s… …if it’s like $63,000, it’s going to be hard to ignore.” If Bitcoin carves a local bottom above $70,000, Cowen says, “If it holds above $73,000, then there’s no guarantee with the market, but it would suggest that the structure of the market remains intact.” Bitcoin is trading at $85,052 at time of writing.

42571717,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144478,1743232202,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent CFTC Action: Crypto Derivatives Regulation Under Scrutiny,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cftc-withdraws-crypto-advisories/,"In a surprising move that has sent ripples through the digital asset space, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has announced the withdrawal of two significant staff advisories concerning cryptocurrencies. Are you wondering what this sudden shift in crypto regulation means for the future of digital assets and derivatives trading? Let’s dive into the details and explore the potential implications of this pivotal decision. Why Did CFTC Withdraw Crypto Advisories? The CFTC’s decision centers around two specific advisories: Advisory (23-07): Focused on expanding Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) clearing for cryptocurrencies. Advisory (18-14): Dealt with the listing of crypto derivatives. According to the official statement on the CFTC website, the withdrawal is a strategic move to ensure that there’s no misinterpretation that crypto derivatives are treated differently from other financial products under their regulatory purview. In essence, the CFTC aims for a level playing field, applying consistent regulatory standards across all derivatives, regardless of the underlying asset. Decoding the Crypto Regulation Rationale The core reason behind this withdrawal boils down to uniformity in crypto regulation. The CFTC wants to avoid creating a perception of special treatment for the crypto market. By withdrawing these advisories, they are signaling that crypto derivatives will be evaluated and regulated under the same framework as traditional derivatives. This move could be interpreted in several ways: Clarity and Consistency: It aims to provide clarity that the existing regulatory framework for derivatives applies equally to crypto derivatives. No Preferential Treatment: It emphasizes that the CFTC isn’t creating a separate or potentially more lenient regime for crypto. Risk Management Focus: It underscores the CFTC’s commitment to managing risks associated with crypto derivatives within the broader financial system. Impact on Crypto Derivatives Market What does this mean for the bustling crypto derivatives market? Here’s a breakdown of potential impacts: Impact Area Potential Effect Market Perception May initially cause some uncertainty as market participants adjust to the removal of specific crypto-focused guidance. However, in the long run, it could foster confidence by demonstrating regulatory maturity. Compliance Entities dealing with crypto derivatives will need to ensure they comply with the general derivatives regulations, without relying on the withdrawn advisories for specific crypto interpretations. Innovation Could potentially streamline innovation by removing any ambiguity about differentiated regulatory pathways for crypto derivatives. Innovators can focus on adhering to established derivatives regulations. Institutional Adoption May encourage institutional investors by reinforcing the idea that crypto derivatives are being brought under a familiar and robust regulatory umbrella, similar to other asset classes. Challenges and Opportunities in Crypto Regulation While the CFTC’s move towards uniform crypto regulation is generally seen as a step towards maturity, it also presents challenges and opportunities: Challenge: Interpretation and Application – The existing derivatives regulations might not perfectly map to the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies. Interpretation and application will be crucial and may require further clarification from the CFTC. Challenge: Industry Adaptation – Crypto firms accustomed to the withdrawn advisories may need to reassess their compliance strategies to align with the broader derivatives framework. Opportunity: Enhanced Legitimacy – Treating crypto derivatives within the established regulatory structure can significantly enhance the legitimacy of the crypto market in the eyes of traditional financial institutions and the public. Opportunity: Global Harmonization – This action could set a precedent for other global regulators to adopt a similar approach, fostering greater harmonization in international crypto regulation. Actionable Insights for Crypto Businesses For businesses operating in the crypto derivatives space, here are some actionable insights: Review Compliance Frameworks: Immediately reassess your compliance strategies in light of the withdrawn advisories. Ensure alignment with general derivatives regulations. Seek Legal Counsel: Engage with legal experts specializing in derivatives and crypto regulations to understand the nuances of this change. Engage with Regulators: Maintain open communication with the CFTC and participate in industry dialogues to contribute to the evolving regulatory landscape. Focus on Robust Risk Management: Strengthen your risk management practices to meet the rigorous standards expected under general derivatives regulation. Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream Crypto? The CFTC’s withdrawal of these crypto-specific advisories is a significant indicator of the evolving regulatory approach towards digital assets. By choosing to regulate cryptocurrency derivatives under the existing framework, the CFTC is signaling a move towards mainstreaming crypto within the traditional financial system. While questions and adjustments will undoubtedly arise, this action ultimately aims to foster a more consistent, transparent, and robust regulatory environment for the burgeoning crypto market. This decisive step could be a catalyst for greater institutional participation and broader acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class.

This is a bearish pattern usually that signals an imminent downtrend. He suggests that the price will drop, potentially reaching its lowest point from November 2024, unless the coin makes a strong recovery. XRP Struggles for Direction Amid Bearish Trend Since March began, XRP hasn’t shown a clear upward or downward trend. The altcoin has experienced both price drops and occasional rises, but overall, it remains in a bearish trend. “This could become bullish if 3.0 is exceeded, otherwise the implications is a decline to 1.07,” he noted. Don't shoot the messenger. Your favorite Beanie Baby/Pet Rock crypto displays a classic complex H&S top. This could become bullish if 3.0 is exceeded, otherwise the implications is a decline to 1.07. If you have an issue with this, take it up with Magee and Edwards $XRP pic.twitter.com/nHaIgn8uP4 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) March 28, 2025 Brandt’s chart shows that the left shoulder formed when XRP hit a $2.9 peak in early December 2024. This surge followed an uptrend that started in November 2024 after Donald Trump’s election win, with XRP rising from $0.5 in November to $2.9 in December before facing a price drop. After more than a month of sideways movement, XRP bounced back, reaching a new seven-year high of $3.4 in mid-January 2025. This peak marked the “head” of the pattern. However, after hitting resistance at $3.4, XRP dropped along with the broader market. Interestingly, following President Donald Trump’s announcement that XRP will be part of the U.S. crypto reserve, XRP rallied again, peaking at $3 on March 2, forming the “right shoulder.” Key Levels To Watch With both shoulders and the head in place, the pattern’s neckline is around $1.9 to $2. This level is crucial because it will decide whether the head and shoulders pattern holds or gets invalidated. In his latest analysis, Brandt called XRP a “pet rock,” echoing his previous negative opinions about the asset. However, he acknowledged that if XRP breaks above $3, the bearish outlook would no longer apply. If the head and shoulders pattern holds true, Brandt predicts XRP could drop to $1.07, a level last seen in November 2024. Falling below $2 and into the $1 range would be a bearish sign for XRP. Brandt previously warned that this drop could happen if XRP falls below $1.9, the key support level. Right now, XRP is trading at $2.16, down 6.12% in the last 24 hours. A further 12% drop could push it to test the $1.9 support. Previous analysts suggest that XRP stays bullish as long as it holds above $2. Economic Factors Besides, Beyond technical charts, economic factors also impact XRP’s price. The upcoming 25% tariffs on car imports, starting April 3 under Trump’s policy, could raise manufacturing costs and fuel inflation. Besides, the CME FedWatch Tool estimates the chances of a rate cut in June at 55.7%, down from 67.3% last week. If the Fed keeps rates higher for longer, it can decrease liquidity in speculative markets, which may negatively impact risk assets such as XRP.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 07:13:59

If there’s one thing to learn from past bull runs, it’s that the right meme coin at the right time can be an absolute game-changer. And right now? You’re standing on the edge of another major meme coin explosion, with BTFD Coin, Snek, and Osaka Protocol leading the charge. The FOMO is real: BTFD Coin entered Stage 15 of its presale, with only one stage left before full launch! The price has already surged from $0.00016 in Stage 14 to $0.0002 now, with forecasts predicting $0.0006 at launch and a potential moonshot to $0.006. That’s a 200% ROI at launch and up to 2900% if it hits the big leagues. Oh, and here’s the kicker—the legendary LAUNCH100 code is still active, doubling investors’ tokens for a limited time.

Unlike traditional meme coins, Osaka positions itself as a hybrid meme + utility token, integrating with Web3 infrastructure while keeping the vibes fun and engaging.

Deaton pushes the regulator to release the long-awaited Inspector General (IG) report on Hinman’s “Ether Speech.” John Deaton Urges SEC To Release Hinman Report In a recent X post, John Deaton urged the US SEC to bring transparency to the contentious Hinman speech. The lawyer pushes the regulator to fully disclose past wrongdoings, particularly regarding the SEC’s handling of former Director William Hinman’s 2018 “Ether Speech.” Significantly, John Deaton believes that the IG report should be made public to shed light on the SEC’s approach to crypto classification. He also believes that such a move could ensure transparency in regulatory actions. He argues that releasing the report is crucial to understanding whether regulatory decisions were made impartially. Thus, Deaton urges new SEC Chair Paul Atkins and key officials like Mark Udeya and Hester Peirce “to support making the report public.” John Deaton’s Call for Transparency Previously, in December, John Deaton underscored the necessity of releasing the IG report on the Hinman speech. The XRP lawyer wrote that the facts surrounding Willian Hinman’s 2018 Ether Speech suggest a potential conflict of interest. Reportedly, this violates the federal law 18 USC 208, which prohibits government officials from engaging in conflict-of-interest activities. Notably, John Deaton’s latest X post reinforces his previous statements. He emphasizes that the public has a right to know the investigation’s findings, regardless of the outcome. In a recent development, Deaton clarified the ambiguities surrounding the SEC’s explanations on the roles of XRP, SOL, and other altcoins within the US government. The SEC’s official page has released a document clarifying the altcoins’ roles. However, Deaton asserted that the SEC itself hasn’t been involved in it. Will SEC Bring Clarity To Crypto Regulations and Classifications? For context, John Deaton’s statement could be linked back to a controversial speech by William Hinman, the former Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance. In 2018, Hinman stated that Ethereum’s Ether token was not a security, which became a “free pass” for the token. Later, Empower Oversight flagged potential conflicts of interest due to William Hinman’s ties to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. The SEC’s recent shift towards a progressive crypto stance has sparked speculation that they may heed Deaton’s call for transparency. Recently, the SEC has officially dropped lawsuits against multiple crypto firms, including Kraken, Cumberland, and Consensys.

42572094,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144481,1743232833,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Hopeful Signals: San Francisco Fed Hints at Two Interest Rate Cuts Igniting Crypto Market Optimism,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/interest-rate-cuts-crypto-optimism/,"Exciting news for crypto enthusiasts! San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly has indicated that two interest rate cuts are still on the table for 2025. This development, reported by Reuters, has sparked discussions across financial markets, including the ever-volatile cryptocurrency space. Could this be the signal crypto investors have been waiting for? Let’s dive into what this means for the future of digital assets. Decoding Interest Rate Cuts: What’s the Buzz About? Interest rate cuts are a powerful tool used by central banks like the Federal Reserve to manage the economy. But what exactly are they, and why should crypto investors care? Stimulating the Economy: Lowering interest rates makes borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. This encourages spending and investment, ideally boosting economic growth. Impact on Inflation: While rate cuts can stimulate growth, they can also contribute to inflation if not managed carefully. The Fed must balance these competing forces. Market Sentiment: Rate cuts are often seen as positive for risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Lower borrowing costs can increase liquidity and investor appetite for higher-yield investments. In essence, when the Federal Reserve cuts rates, it’s like injecting adrenaline into the financial system. But as with any stimulant, the dosage and timing are crucial. Mary Daly’s Perspective: Inflation Still in Focus Mary Daly, a key voice at the San Francisco Federal Reserve , has reiterated that her primary concern remains inflation . Despite ongoing debates and economic data fluctuations, she stated, “100% of my focus is on what’s happening with inflation .” This laser focus on inflation is critical because it dictates the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. Here’s what we can glean from Daly’s recent comments: Two Rate Cuts Still Possible: Despite some speculation of fewer cuts or even further rate hikes, Daly’s statement suggests that two interest rate cuts in 2025 remain a reasonable expectation, in her view. Data Dependent Approach: While leaning towards two cuts, Daly emphasizes that decisions will be data-dependent. Future inflation reports and economic indicators will heavily influence the Fed’s actions. Balancing Act: The Fed is walking a tightrope, aiming to curb inflation without triggering a recession. Interest rate cuts are a tool to navigate this delicate balance. Daly’s stance provides a degree of clarity amidst economic uncertainty, signaling that the possibility of easing monetary policy is still alive. How Do Interest Rate Cuts Impact the Crypto Market? The cryptocurrency market, known for its volatility and sensitivity to global financial trends, often reacts strongly to signals from central banks. Interest rate cuts can have several positive implications for the crypto market : Impact Description Increased Liquidity Lower interest rates can lead to increased liquidity in the financial system. Some of this liquidity can flow into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Weakening Dollar Rate cuts can sometimes weaken the US dollar. As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are often priced against the dollar, a weaker dollar can make them relatively more attractive. Risk-On Sentiment Lower rates can foster a “risk-on” sentiment in the market. Investors may become more willing to take risks and allocate capital to assets like cryptocurrencies, seeking higher returns in a low-yield environment. Inflation Hedge Narrative In an environment where rate cuts might fuel inflation (even if moderately), the narrative of Bitcoin and some other cryptos as an inflation hedge could gain traction, attracting more investors. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is also influenced by a multitude of factors beyond macroeconomic policies. Regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market sentiment all play significant roles. Navigating the Economic Outlook: What’s Next? Daly’s comments offer a glimpse into the economic outlook and the Fed’s potential path forward. But what should crypto investors be watching for? Inflation Data: Keep a close eye on upcoming inflation reports (CPI, PCE). These will be key indicators for the Fed’s future decisions. Federal Reserve Meetings: Pay attention to the announcements and statements following Federal Reserve meetings. These provide direct insights into the central bank’s thinking. Broader Economic Indicators: Monitor GDP growth, employment figures, and other macroeconomic data that can influence the Federal Reserve policy. Crypto Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts to economic news and Fed announcements. Market sentiment can be a powerful force. The global economic outlook remains complex, and predicting the future with certainty is impossible. However, understanding the potential impact of interest rate cuts and closely monitoring key indicators can help crypto investors make more informed decisions. Conclusion: Hopeful Signs for Crypto on the Horizon? Mary Daly’s reiteration of the possibility of two interest rate cuts in 2025 injects a dose of hope into the financial markets, including the cryptocurrency sector. While the Federal Reserve’s primary focus remains taming inflation , the prospect of easing monetary policy could create a more favorable environment for risk assets. For crypto investors, this news warrants cautious optimism. Keep a watchful eye on economic data and Fed announcements, and prepare for potential shifts in market dynamics as the economic outlook unfolds.

The country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken legal action against OKX , one of the biggest crypto exchanges, for allegedly operating without a license. The Thai SEC has filed a criminal complaint against Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd., the operator of OKX, along with nine individuals linked to the platform. According to the regulator, OKX was offering crypto trading services in Thailand as far back as 2021—without the necessary approval. Why is OKX in Trouble? Authorities claim that OKX was actively promoting its services in Thailand via social media, including Telegram, X, and Line OpenChat. It even charges a 0.1% trading fee, just like licensed platforms. This, according to the SEC, violates Thailand’s Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses, a law that ensures only regulated firms operate in the crypto space. The nine individuals accused in the case allegedly helped OKX to leverage the Thai market by promoting it to investors. The SEC argues that their insider trading and involvement are directly connected to the exchange’s illegal operations. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : FDIC Clears the Way for Banks to Engage in Crypto Activities, No Prior Approval Required! , What Happens Next? The case has been handed over to the Economic Crime Suppression Division (ECD), which will determine further legal action. If found guilty, OKX and those involved could face hefty penalties under Thai law. Meanwhile, the SEC is warning investors about the risks of using unlicensed platforms. Without proper regulation, there’s no guarantee of security, and investors could be exposed to fraud or financial losses. The regulator advises traders to check a platform’s licensing status before investing. This case highlights the increasing pressure on crypto exchanges to comply with local regulations. With more governments cracking down, exchanges operating without proper authorization could face serious consequences. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As the market continues to become friskier, wise “gambler” are instead securing their stakes in major coins with the potential to deliver x125 or more within these shocking time spans. But as the names at the top get cook and go viral, BeerBear can really be the monster of the memes with potentially the most gains ahead. Solana (SOL) – Speed Demon Poised to Rip Solana is still highly preferred by high-frequency traders due to its impressive registration time and minimal charge. This is showing quite a lot of strength on charts and has more than one bullish signal on its charting indicators. Algo traders have woken up, whales are buying, and the next spike will take SOL to the next level. SOL has actually been up shortly, but forecasters affirm that this may perhaps merely be the starting. It is suggested that there will be another two times short-term pump and dump and x ten if it persists. Still, even in a hot one, Solana always strives to run competitively. XRP – The Sleeper That Might Snap XRP has been in a consolidation phase for several months, which might mean explosion is close. It has been noted that whales are active in the Ripple market, and there are speculations that institutions are about to enter the market and this may push XRP out of the consolidation phase any time. Currently, the traders are waiting for resistance levels, and once XRP breaks the levels, it may gain the kind of momentum that was observed in other previous cycles. Of course, there will be wild swings that come with a leap in a specific direction or a new partnership can en masse cause the stock to go up. PEPE – The Meme Coin That Refuses to Die Thus, one can conclude that PEPE is not an organism that would produce but a single great hit. The chart is becoming explosive again, and people in the crypto Twitter sphere are beginning to turn positive. Volume changes and liquidity increases are announcing something, and PEPE starts the movement when everyone will not expect it. The bands who are longing for a 20x have been right, and if the meme season begins with fresh listings and whale interest, then PEPE is gearing up for another rocket ride.

Since presale was announced, over 7,400 holders have already purchased tokens, demonstrating skyrocketing confidence in the platform’s decentralized lending infrastructure. Now at stage 4, with a price of $0.025 per token, the project shows no signs of slowing down. As such, investors are scrambling to get in ahead of stage 2’s 20% price-bump to $0.03, with analysts already pointing out a clear route to a 140% gain at $0.06 when it hits the exchanges. More conservative estimates predict MUTM to reach as high as $3.50 by the end of 2025, meaning those who buy the Tokens right at launch could find themselves in a unique position for exponential returns. The Presale Surge Happens Extremely Quickly Demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasing and now Phase 4 is racing to the sell-out. The proprietary presale model of the platform, which raises prices in a systematic manner in 11 phases, has spurred buying from investors who want to enter at lower levels. Anyone buying in at $0.025 will realize an immediate gain upon the activation of the price tag at $0.03 in Phase 5 — a 20% jump. Not only do the early adopters reap the rewards, this tiered model provides a built in sustainability model for continued growth after launch. Having collectively raised $5.6 million and swollen participation numbers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a new DeFi protocol integrated into the surge of decentralized finance based on Ethereum — is showing strong fundamentals against the backdrop of a volatile DeFi field. How Tokenomics Are Driving Predictions of a 14,000% Explosion With pragmatic utility and aggressive tokenomics to encourage holding, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a real opportunity. The $0.06 listing price represents a 140% profit for Phase 4 investors; more optimistic projections suggest something much bigger, however. The platform’s integration of revenue from its lending protocols to reinforce token buybacks and distribution to stakers guarantees a constant buy pressure. Combined with the real-life implementations such as overcollaterized loan and peer-to-peer lending that experts are indicating will be able to help MUTM rise as high as $3.50 just months after launch (14,000% from where it is right now). This growth would be greater than that of many established altcoins, bolstering Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more as a high-yield play rather than a speculative gamble. New Innovations Driving Institutional Interest The key attraction behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its mtTokens system, a feature that transforms user deposits into interest-bearing assets. For instance, staking ETH produces mtETH over time, which gains value while remaining liquid. Coupling this model with flexible interest rates and collateralized stablecoin plans, bridges the flexibility of DeFi with the stability of traditional finance. An additional $100,000 giveaway for presale participants has driven further engagement, but it’s the project’s intrinsic mechanics — and not promotional tactics — that are attracting serious investor interest. Security Improvements Almost Done Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is moving ahead with its developers working on finalizing a smart contract audit fronted by Certik, a leading blockchain security firm. This assessment, likely to wrap up in weeks, will confirm the stability of the platform ahead of its exchange launch. Open and transparent about these efforts, the team emphasizes a focus on trust, which is vital as the project scales. Mutuum — More Than a Move with DeFi Trends. With Phase 4 filling fast and a $3.50 price target generating momentum, the opportunity to buy tokens at presale prices is closing. In a market that is hungry for innovation, investors are flocking to the asymmetric returns that MUTM’s blend of utility, incentives and strategy promises. Act Before Phase 4 Closes The current price of $0.025 is the last opportunity to prepare for large-scale milestones. As Phase 5 nears, costs to enter increase, but also the trajectory of the project. Follow Mutuum Finance’s official channels for news about the audit and presale developments—and why not join the 7,400 holders before the next price explosion?

42572492,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144520,1743233425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Stablecoin Scrutiny: Senators Question Trump Family’s Crypto Venture,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/senators-question-trump-stablecoin/,"The crypto world is buzzing with a new point of contention as World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a firm linked to the Trump family, steps into the stablecoin arena with its project, USD1. However, this venture has swiftly landed under the regulatory scrutiny of U.S. lawmakers. Five Democratic Senators have voiced serious concerns about potential conflict of interest , igniting a debate about the intersection of politics, family ties, and the burgeoning digital currency landscape. Are these concerns valid, and what does this mean for the future of stablecoin regulation ? Let’s dive deep into this developing story. Why are Senators Raising Alarms About USD1 Stablecoin? The core of the issue revolves around the perceived conflict of interest . With WLFI being led by President Donald Trump’s family, alarm bells are ringing in Washington D.C. Senators are questioning the impartiality of financial regulators when dealing with a project so closely connected to a prominent political figure, especially amidst ongoing discussions about stablecoin legislation. Here’s a breakdown of the key concerns: Political Influence: The senators’ letter directly addresses concerns about diminished independence of financial regulators, implying a worry that political connections might unduly influence the oversight of USD1. Regulatory Gaps: At a time when Congress is actively debating and formulating laws around stablecoins, this project throws a spotlight on existing regulatory ambiguities and potential loopholes. Financial System Risks: The senators emphasize the potential risks to the broader financial system if stablecoins are not properly regulated, and they want to ensure that projects like USD1 are held to the highest standards. Transparency and Oversight: The lawmakers are seeking clarity on how agencies like the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) plan to oversee USD1, demanding transparency in the process. Decoding the Senators’ Letter: What Questions are Being Asked? The letter sent by the senators to Michelle Bowman and Rodney Hood is a formal request for information and assurances. It’s not just a casual inquiry; it’s a structured demand for accountability. Here are some pivotal questions they are likely posing: What specific regulatory framework will be applied to USD1? Senators want to know if USD1 will be subject to the same rigorous standards as other financial products, or if there will be any exceptions or special considerations. How will potential conflicts of interest be managed, given the Trump family’s involvement? This is a central point. The regulators need to demonstrate a clear plan to ensure unbiased oversight, free from any political influence. What measures will be in place to protect consumers and the financial system from potential risks associated with USD1? This speaks to the core purpose of regulation – safeguarding the public and the economy. What is the timeline for regulatory review and approval of USD1? Transparency about the process and expected timelines is crucial for public trust and market confidence. How will the agencies coordinate to ensure comprehensive and consistent oversight of stablecoin projects like USD1? Given the overlapping jurisdictions of different regulatory bodies, coordination is essential to avoid gaps or inconsistencies. The Broader Landscape: Stablecoins and Crypto Oversight This situation with USD1 is unfolding against a backdrop of increasing global attention towards stablecoin regulation and crypto oversight . Stablecoins, designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, have become critical components of the crypto ecosystem. However, their rapid growth and systemic importance have caught the attention of regulators worldwide. Here’s why crypto oversight of stablecoins is paramount: Systemic Risk: Large-scale stablecoins could pose systemic risks to the financial system if not properly managed, especially in times of market stress. Consumer Protection: Users of stablecoins need protection against fraud, market manipulation, and operational failures. Regulatory frameworks are needed to ensure fair and transparent operations. Monetary Policy Implications: The widespread adoption of stablecoins could have implications for monetary policy and the sovereignty of national currencies. Central banks are closely monitoring these developments. Financial Stability: Regulators aim to maintain financial stability and prevent the use of stablecoins for illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Community? The senators’ move highlights several key takeaways for the cryptocurrency community and investors: Insight Implication Increased Regulatory Focus Expect more intense scrutiny and potentially stricter regulations for stablecoins globally. Projects must prioritize compliance and transparency. Political Sensitivities Cryptocurrency projects with political connections will face heightened scrutiny. Reputation and perceived neutrality will be increasingly important. Importance of Compliance For stablecoin projects to succeed long-term, robust compliance frameworks and proactive engagement with regulators are no longer optional but essential. Market Volatility Potential Regulatory uncertainty can introduce short-term market volatility. However, clear and sensible regulations can ultimately foster long-term stability and growth. Looking Ahead: The Future of USD1 and Stablecoin Regulation The coming weeks and months will be crucial for USD1 and the broader stablecoin regulation landscape. The responses from the Federal Reserve and the OCC to the senators’ letter will be closely watched. This situation could set a precedent for how regulators approach crypto projects with political links and how stablecoins are governed moving forward. It’s a pivotal moment that underscores the growing pains of a rapidly evolving industry seeking to find its place within established financial and political systems. In conclusion, the senators’ concerns about WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin are a stark reminder of the complexities and challenges facing the crypto world as it matures. The demand for crypto oversight is intensifying, and projects must navigate a landscape where regulatory compliance and public trust are paramount.

President Donald Trump’s tariff policies targeting Canadian and Mexican goods, Chinese cars and more have caused volatility, but Arthur Hayes, chief investment officer at Maelstrom and co-founder of BitMEX, believes these measures will have little impact on Bitcoin’s trajectory. During a podcast with Kyle Chasse, Hayes noted that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent stance on monetary policy outweighs the importance of tariffs. Quoting Powell, Hayes said, “The inflationary aspects of tariffs are temporary,” signaling that the Fed is ready to inject more liquidity into the system. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Lists Two New Altcoins in Futures According to Hayes, this monetary easing could provide a favorable environment for Bitcoin and other risky assets. “Tariffs are no longer important to Powell and they shouldn’t be important to crypto investors,” he said, adding: “Whether Trump imposes 50% tariffs or just 2%, it doesn’t matter because we know Powell will continue to maintain easy monetary conditions to keep assets appreciating.” Hayes suggested that even if Trump’s tariffs lead to inflationary pressures, Powell would likely ignore the concerns and continue to support accommodative policies, potentially opening the door for further quantitative easing, an outcome that has historically benefited Bitcoin. Earlier this week, Hayes revised his Bitcoin price prediction and now predicts a rally to $110,000. *This is not investment advice.

This partnership might aid a Pi Coin price recovery after the altcoin recorded one of its worst trading weeks since launch after plunging by 17%. Pi Network Partners with Stellar for Pi Coin Stablecoin Several reports suggest that the Pi Network development team could be working on launching a stablecoin in partnership with the Stellar blockchain, which seeks to enable cost-effective money transfers. The Pi Network community identified a smart contract code that suggested that such a partnership deal would happen soon. At the same time, another report indicated that a Pi Coin stablecoin was being tested on the Stellar mainnet environment. Pi Coin Stablecoin Earlier this month, Coingape reported that Pi Network was working on a price pegging mechanism . This mechanism is used with stablecoins such as USDT and USDC and would bolster Pi Coin’s use as a means of payment. The reports of a Pi Coin stablecoin testing on Stellar come after Pi Network was integrated into the Telegram network . Some community members noted that the integration was a “historic step toward mass adoption of decentralized finance.” These developments suggest that Pi Coin is acquiring some strong fundamentals, which can aid a price recovery. Can Pi Network Price Rally 40%? Pi Network price trades at $0.824 today after a 2.6% decline in 24 hours. This altcoin has been under bearish pressure due to the falling Bitcoin price and a pullback across the broader crypto market. Moreover, the lack of a major exchange listing has added to the headwinds facing Pi Coin. Nevertheless, the 4-hour price chart indicates that a massive rally is looming. This is after Pi Coin confirmed a breakout from a falling broadening wedge pattern. If this breakout is strong and attracts buying pressure, it could reverse the current trend from bearish to bullish. A decisive breakout will lead to Pi Network price rising by more than 44% from the current price. In this case, Pi Coin will rise towards $1.19. The volume histogram bars have turned to green, which highlights a slight uptick in buying activity, which shows some traders bought the dip. However, the RSI is still below 40, which is a sign that sellers have the upper hand, leading to a bullish Pi network price prediction . At the same time, the Average Directional Index (ADX) indicator has tipped south, another signal that the current trend is weak. This may prevent a decisive breakout from the falling wedge. PI/USDT: 4-hour Chart A recovery for Pi Network price to $3 ATH could be aided by news of strategic partnerships and ecosystem growth. However, if buyers continue to show hesitance, it could cause a dip towards the $1 price level.

This strategic pivot is cemented by a groundbreaking 15-year hosting agreement with cloud-computing powerhouse CoreWeave, turning Galaxy’s Texas-based data center into a hub for AI and high-performance computing (HPC). Why Galaxy Digital is Making a Bold Bitcoin Mining to AI Pivot? For those deeply entrenched in the crypto world, the name Galaxy Digital is synonymous with digital asset innovation and investment. However, recent reports from TheMinerMag reveal a calculated recalibration of their business model. The core of this shift? A strategic move away from heavy reliance on Bitcoin mining and a decisive leap into the high-demand arena of AI infrastructure support. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a fundamental realignment of resources and focus, driven by the evolving demands of the tech world and the potential seen in AI. Here’s a breakdown of what’s unfolding: Data Center Repurposing: Galaxy Digital is transforming its Texas data center, initially designed for Bitcoin mining, into a state-of-the-art facility catering to AI and HPC. CoreWeave Partnership: A long-term 15-year hosting deal with CoreWeave ensures Galaxy will play a crucial role in supporting the infrastructure needs of a leading cloud-computing firm specializing in compute-intensive workloads like AI. Reduced Bitcoin Hashrate: As resources are redirected, Galaxy anticipates a decrease in its Bitcoin hashrate and, consequently, lower Bitcoin production in the coming quarters. Financial Performance: Galaxy Digital’s Q4 2024 earnings report, released on March 28th, highlighted their Bitcoin mining activities, showing 977 BTC mined in 2024, generating $22.1 million in revenue. This context underscores the scale of the operational shift as they move away from this revenue stream. Understanding the CoreWeave AI Partnership and its Significance The collaboration with CoreWeave is the linchpin of Galaxy Digital’s AI strategy. CoreWeave isn’t just any cloud provider; they are known for their specialized infrastructure tailored for demanding computational tasks, especially in AI and machine learning. By partnering with CoreWeave, Galaxy Digital is positioning itself at the forefront of supporting the AI revolution. This move taps into a market that is experiencing exponential growth, driven by the increasing demand for AI across various industries. Key aspects of the CoreWeave partnership include: Aspect Details Duration 15-year hosting deal, providing long-term stability and revenue stream. Facility Repurposed Texas data center, optimized for AI and HPC requirements. CoreWeave’s Expertise Leverages CoreWeave’s specialization in cloud computing for AI, machine learning, and other intensive applications. Strategic Alignment Aligns Galaxy Digital with the high-growth AI sector, diversifying beyond crypto mining. Impact on Crypto Data Centers and the Future Landscape Galaxy Digital’s decision reflects a broader trend where infrastructure originally built for crypto mining is being re-evaluated for alternative, potentially more lucrative applications. Data centers, especially those with robust power and cooling capabilities essential for mining, are highly adaptable for AI workloads. This pivot highlights the versatility of such facilities and the evolving nature of the digital infrastructure landscape. What does this mean for the crypto data center industry? Diversification: Crypto data centers are exploring diversification opportunities beyond mining, with AI and HPC emerging as attractive alternatives. Optimized Resource Utilization: Facilities can optimize resource utilization by catering to both crypto and AI demands, or shifting focus entirely based on market dynamics. Revenue Stream Expansion: Moving into AI infrastructure hosting can open up new and potentially larger revenue streams compared to the fluctuating profitability of Bitcoin mining. Market Adaptation: The industry is showing signs of adapting to market changes and technological advancements by embracing new sectors like AI. Unveiling the Potential of AI Infrastructure Hosting The move towards AI infrastructure hosting is not just opportunistic; it’s strategic. The demand for computational power to drive AI applications is exploding. From training complex machine learning models to powering AI-driven services, the need for robust and scalable infrastructure is paramount. Galaxy Digital, through its partnership with CoreWeave, is positioning itself to capitalize on this surging demand.

Stable Demand: Unlike the volatility of crypto markets, the demand for AI compute power is expected to be more stable and continuously increasing. Higher Margins: AI infrastructure services can potentially command higher margins compared to Bitcoin mining, depending on operational efficiencies and market conditions. Long-Term Contracts: The 15-year deal with CoreWeave exemplifies the potential for long-term, predictable revenue streams in AI hosting. Is This the End of Galaxy Digital’s Bitcoin Mining Era? While Galaxy Digital is significantly scaling back its Bitcoin mining operations, it’s crucial to note that they are not entirely abandoning the sector. The company’s Q4 report still reflects substantial Bitcoin mining revenue. However, the emphasis is clearly shifting. The partnership with CoreWeave and the repurposing of the Texas data center indicate a strategic prioritization of AI infrastructure. It’s more accurate to say Galaxy Digital is evolving its Bitcoin mining strategy rather than completely exiting the space. They are adapting to seize opportunities in the rapidly growing AI domain, recognizing its potential for sustained growth and profitability. Conclusion: A Strategic Leap into the Future Galaxy Digital’s pivot from Bitcoin mining to AI infrastructure represents a bold and forward-thinking strategic decision. By partnering with CoreWeave and transforming its data center, Galaxy is not just reacting to market trends but proactively shaping its future in the digital economy. This move underscores the dynamic nature of the tech industry and the importance of adaptability. As the lines between crypto and AI blur, companies like Galaxy Digital are leading the charge in exploring new synergies and opportunities at the intersection of these groundbreaking technologies. This strategic realignment could very well set a new precedent for how digital infrastructure companies navigate the evolving tech landscape.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 3.63% in 24 hours to $2.36. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Following this, the SEC will file a motion to lift the injunction, which Ripple will not contest. Once the judge signs off, the case will be finalized, most likely within 60 days. Coming to the expenses, which Ripple will be bearing, the case will be settled with a $50 Million payout to the SEC. That being said, we can expect the process to expedite, as Paul Atkins has given a positive statement in a recent speech about cryptocurrencies. Talking about the XRP price, it is presently down 4.7% to $2.14. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.362. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $1.96. Our XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” by providing short-term and long-term Ripple (XRP) price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.12743419 -4.93% Market cap $ 123,828,790,435.22 Circulating Supply 58,205,697,378.00 Trading Volume $ 4,008,064,541.4593 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as Franklin Templeton has announced filing for an XRP ETF. Once launched, it is expected to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. Moreover, Ripple has received approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to offer regulated crypto payments in the Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC). The exchange inflow vs outflow graph from March 1st to March 27th shows 646k outflows in comparison to 290k inflows. This signals a spike in strong investor interest, which is a big thumbs-up for XRP. XRP Exchange Inflow vs Outflow If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain under a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89.

There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the XRP price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

On-Chain Data Reveals the Truth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After failing to regain a bullish outlook on Friday during the Western financial markets, the crypto market continued to record bearish sentiment on Saturday during the early Asian trading session. The total crypto market cap dropped nearly 5 percent in the past 24 hours to hover about $2.813 trillion at the time of this writing. Bitcoin (BTC) price dropped around 3 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $83,719 on Saturday, during the early London session. Ethereum (ETH) price dropped over 2.3 percent in the past 24 hours to trade at about $1,878 at the time of this writing. Meanwhile, XRP price shed over 5 percent in the last 24 hours to trade at about $2.14. Top Reasons Why the Wider Altcoin Market Followed Bitcoin in Correction According to on-chain data analysis, the demand for crypto assets has significantly declined in the last few days. For instance, Bitcoin demand remains in contraction mode, even at a higher rate than what was experienced in December 2023. The overall cash inflow to altcoins led by Ethereum and XRP has significantly decreased in the recent past. The U.S. spot Ether ETFs are about to close March with the largest cash outflow since August 2024, of over $400 million. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows whale investors have increased their activity, possibly fleeing to the gold and stablecoins markets to protect capital.

All unsold tokens at the end of each week are burned, tightening supply and cranking up demand in a deflationary spiral that boosts value. And let’s talk staking—because this Best Crypto Presale to Buy doesn’t stop at just storytelling. With 66% APY staking, Pablo’s ecosystem rewards diamond hands.

This is hands down the Best Crypto Presale to Buy right now—especially for Gen Z and Millennial investors looking for narrative-driven, high-upside plays with community-first vibes. Zignaly – The Ultra-Microcap Sleeper on Solana On the opposite end of the crypto spectrum, lets got Zignaly—a stealth-mode Solana-based token that’s floating under the radar. It’s trading at $0.055447, with a Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) of just $5,450. Yep, five thousand dollars. That’s not even lunch money in crypto terms. But here’s where it gets wild: Zignaly has a total pooled supply of 1 billion tokens—but only 0.001231 SOL of liquidity. Translation? It’s an ultra-low float gem, and if demand spikes, this thing could explode vertically. Now, let’s be real—Zignaly isn’t verified on CoinMarketCap, and there are zero active holders on-chain right now. No buys or sells in the last 24 hours, but historically, we’ve seen single trades go as high as $297. That’s classic early degen territory—high risk, high potential reward. While Zignaly may not take the crown as the Best Crypto to Buy, it’s certainly one of the more intriguing under-the-radar plays of 2025. Chainlink – The Oracle Giant Plotting Its Next Comeback Now let’s pivot to the heavyweight of the trio—Chainlink (LINK). This one isn’t a presale play—it’s a legacy asset. Priced at $14.29 with a market cap of $9.39 billion, Chainlink sits comfortably in the top 15 on CoinMarketCap. It’s been a staple in DeFi infrastructure, connecting smart contracts to real-world data like weather, pricing feeds, and APIs through its secure oracle network. Chainlink saw its glory days in 2021 with an all-time high of $52.88—and although it’s down nearly 73% from that peak, it’s still up over 11,215% from its humble beginnings at $0.1263 back in 2017. Not bad for a project that doesn’t scream hype but quietly powers a massive chunk of the DeFi ecosystem. What’s driving LINK right now? Analysts are watching the $16 resistance level, and sentiment is bullish across crypto forums. If Bitcoin’s next leg sends the majors soaring, Chainlink could easily reclaim some of its former fire. Plus, the 657.09 million circulating supply out of a 1 billion total gives it enough room to run without overwhelming dilution. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the Best Crypto Presale to Buy in 2025. With a gripping narrative, weekly price hikes, deflationary burns, and a 66% APY staking system, it offers the perfect combo of utility, hype, and upside. Zignaly is a daring degen bet with ultra-low cap potential, while Chainlink holds the fort as a dependable infrastructure titan.

42573260,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144524,1743234619,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Visionary Brazil Eyes Bitcoin Reserve: A Bold Step Towards National Prosperity,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/brazil-bitcoin-reserve-prosperity/,"In a potentially game-changing move for national finance, a prominent Brazilian leader has voiced strong support for establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. This isn’t just another day in crypto news; it’s a bold proposition that could redefine Brazil’s economic landscape. Pedro Giocondo Guerra, the chief of staff to Brazil’s Vice President, Geraldo Alckmin, recently threw his weight behind the idea, suggesting that Bitcoin could be the key to unlocking Brazil’s future prosperity. Let’s dive into why this is making waves and what it could mean for Brazil and the wider crypto world. Bitcoin Reserve: A Vision for Brazil’s Prosperity? Speaking at a congressional ceremony on March 25th, Guerra’s advocacy for a Bitcoin reserve wasn’t just a casual remark. It was a clear endorsement of a strategy that could position Brazil as a forward-thinking nation in the digital age. According to reports from Decrypt, Guerra emphasized that a Bitcoin reserve is not merely about hopping on a trend; it’s about securing Brazil’s economic future and serving the public interest. He sees Bitcoin as more than just a speculative asset; he views it as a strategic tool for national economic growth. This endorsement from a high-ranking official signals a significant shift in how some Brazilian leaders are perceiving cryptocurrency. Why Bitcoin? The Allure of Digital Gold Guerra didn’t mince words when describing Bitcoin. He called it “digital gold,” a term that resonates deeply within the crypto community and beyond. But what makes this “digital gold” so attractive to a nation like Brazil? Here’s a breakdown: Global Wealth Transfer: Bitcoin’s borderless nature allows for swift and efficient wealth transfer across the globe. In an increasingly interconnected world, this capability is invaluable. Value Storage: Bitcoin is designed to be a store of value, much like traditional gold. Guerra highlighted its ability to preserve the value of labor, protecting against inflation and economic uncertainties. Decentralization and Security: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, Bitcoin’s decentralized nature offers a layer of security and autonomy, reducing reliance on conventional financial systems. The “digital gold” narrative positions Bitcoin not just as a currency, but as a robust asset class that can play a crucial role in a nation’s financial strategy. For Brazil, this could mean diversifying its reserves and tapping into a new form of economic power. Congressman Biondini’s Bill: Paving the Way for Bitcoin Adoption Guerra’s advocacy isn’t happening in isolation. It aligns perfectly with a recent legislative push by Brazilian congressman Eros Biondini. Biondini has proposed a bill that aims to formally establish a national Bitcoin reserve . This isn’t just about dipping a toe into crypto; the bill suggests a significant commitment, requiring the Brazilian government to acquire Bitcoin equivalent to up to 5% of the nation’s international reserves. This proposal is a concrete step towards making the Bitcoin reserve a reality. Let’s break down the key aspects of Congressman Biondini’s bill: Feature Details Purpose Create a national Bitcoin reserve for Brazil. Reserve Target Up to 5% of Brazil’s international reserves to be held in Bitcoin. Rationale Enhance national prosperity and financial strategy. Proponent Congressman Eros Biondini. This bill, combined with Guerra’s vocal support, indicates a growing momentum within Brazil’s political sphere to embrace cryptocurrency , specifically Bitcoin, as a strategic national asset. Benefits of a National Bitcoin Reserve for Brazil Why should Brazil consider taking such a bold step? The potential benefits are manifold and could significantly impact Brazil’s economic standing on the global stage: Financial Sovereignty: A Bitcoin reserve could reduce Brazil’s dependence on traditional financial systems and potentially offer greater financial autonomy. Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized nature position it as a potential hedge against inflation, safeguarding Brazil’s national wealth. Attracting Investment: Embracing cryptocurrency could signal Brazil as an innovation-friendly nation, attracting foreign investment and fostering growth in the tech sector. Technological Advancement: Adopting Bitcoin could spur innovation in financial technology and position Brazil at the forefront of the digital economy. Economic Diversification: Holding a Bitcoin reserve diversifies Brazil’s asset portfolio, reducing risk associated with traditional reserve currencies. Challenges and Considerations for Brazil’s Bitcoin Strategy While the potential benefits are compelling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that Brazil must address to successfully implement a Bitcoin strategy : Regulatory Framework: Clear and comprehensive regulations are essential for managing a national Bitcoin reserve . Brazil needs to establish robust legal frameworks to govern Bitcoin holdings and transactions. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Managing risk associated with Bitcoin’s price fluctuations will be a critical aspect of reserve management. Public Understanding and Education: Ensuring public understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrency is important. Educational initiatives may be needed to foster broader adoption and trust. Security Concerns: Secure storage and management of a significant Bitcoin reserve are paramount. Brazil would need to invest in robust security infrastructure to protect these digital assets. Geopolitical Implications: Adopting a Bitcoin reserve might have geopolitical implications, potentially impacting relationships with international financial institutions and other nations. Bitcoin Reserve: A Global Trend or a Unique Brazilian Approach? While Brazil’s potential move is noteworthy, it’s important to consider the broader global context. Several nations are exploring or have already taken steps towards integrating cryptocurrency into their financial systems. Some countries are using Bitcoin to bypass sanctions, while others are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Brazil’s approach, however, focusing on a national reserve, could set a unique precedent. It positions Bitcoin not just as a currency for daily transactions, but as a strategic asset for national economic stability and growth. Is Brazil leading the charge towards a new era of national cryptocurrency adoption? Only time will tell. But one thing is clear: the conversation around Bitcoin and its role in national economies is evolving rapidly, and Brazil is positioning itself to be at the forefront of this exciting transformation. Conclusion: Brazil’s Bold Bet on Bitcoin Pedro Giocondo Guerra’s advocacy for a Bitcoin reserve , coupled with Congressman Biondini’s bill, marks a potentially pivotal moment for Brazil and the global cryptocurrency landscape. This visionary approach could not only enhance Brazil’s financial sovereignty and economic resilience but also inspire other nations to consider the strategic value of digital assets. As Brazil navigates the complexities and opportunities of this bold initiative, the world will be watching closely to see if this South American giant can indeed pave a path to national prosperity through the power of Bitcoin.

42573633,https://coinpedia.org/?p=438404,1743235205,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Pi Network News: Why PI Token Is Falling Despite Telegram Integration,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-news-why-pi-token-is-falling-despite-telegram-integration/,"The post Pi Network News: Why PI Token Is Falling Despite Telegram Integration appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With a series of negative news, KYC controversy , Network issues, and updates, nothing has worked in favor of the Pi Network. Not only that Pi Network (Pi), after the massive hype, is struggling to recover as its price has dropped over 61% in the past month. Even after integrating with Telegram’s Crypto Wallet, Pi hasn’t seen any real buying momentum. The token is stuck in a bearish trend with no clear sign of a turnaround. With fading investor interest, it will be interesting to see if it can beat this downtrend or not. Telegram Partnership Fails to Spark a Rally When Pi Network announced its integration with Telegram’s Crypto Wallet, many expected a price boost. Instead, the token has remained under pressure. Pi’s Bollinger Band Trend (BBTrend), which tracks momentum, has been negative for 12 straight days, currently sitting at -22.34 as per data . A negative BBTrend means sellers are in control, and the further the number moves from zero, the stronger the trend. Despite the Telegram news, investors have not shown enough interest to reverse the decline. The market remains cautious, and without a major push from buyers, Pi may continue to slide. Moreover, many also expected that Pi would rise once it was listed in Binance but that too is not coming true , making it worse and more painful for the network to sustain the current selling pressure. Weak Buyer Interest Keeps PI Stuck However, there’s a small sign of recovery, as Pi Network’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved up from an oversold level of 23.8 to 40.45. The RSI measures whether an asset is overbought or oversold, with values below 30 indicating extreme selling pressure. While Pi is no longer oversold, its RSI is still below the neutral 50 mark—suggesting that buyers remain hesitant. For Pi to break out of this downtrend, the RSI would need to climb above 50, signaling a shift in sentiment. Until that happens, the token is more likely to continue consolidating or even drop further. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : How Will Pi Network’s Token Unlock Impact Pi Coin’s Price? , Key Levels to Watch – What’s Next for PI? Pi Network is testing an important support level at $0.718. If it fails to hold, the next major support sits at $0.62, which could act as a floor for price stabilization. However, if selling continues, the Pi might fall even lower. On the upside, if Pi gains momentum, the first major resistance to break is $1.05. A successful breakout above this level could push the token toward $1.23 , and if the rally continues, it could even reach $1.79. For now, the Pi Network remains in a downtrend. Unless a major catalyst sparks demand, the token’s struggle may not be over yet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

42573680,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144528,1743235216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Groundbreaking FDIC Crypto Guidance: Banks Embrace Digital Assets, Igniting Mainstream Adoption",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fdic-guidance-banks-crypto-adoption/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement following the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) latest guidance on banks engaging with crypto-related activities. This move is being hailed as a potential game-changer, paving the way for wider crypto adoption and greater mainstream acceptance. David Sacks, a prominent voice in the tech and crypto space, has lauded the FDIC’s initiative, signaling a significant shift in the regulatory landscape. Let’s dive into what this means for the future of crypto and traditional finance. Why is FDIC Guidance a Big Deal for Crypto Adoption? For years, one of the major hurdles for cryptocurrency has been bridging the gap between the decentralized world of digital assets and the established framework of traditional finance. Banks, as cornerstones of the financial system, have been hesitant to fully embrace crypto due to regulatory uncertainties and perceived risks. The FDIC’s new guidance aims to clarify the rules of engagement, making it easier and safer for banks crypto to participate in the digital asset ecosystem. Here’s why this guidance is being celebrated as a pivotal moment for mainstream crypto : Clarity and Confidence: The FDIC’s guidance provides a clearer framework for banks, reducing ambiguity and fostering confidence in their ability to engage with crypto activities compliantly. This clarity is crucial for banks that were previously hesitant to enter the space due to regulatory gray areas. Reduced Risk Perception: By outlining how banks can safely engage in crypto, the FDIC is implicitly acknowledging the legitimacy and growing importance of digital assets. This can help reduce the perception of crypto as a risky and unregulated sector, encouraging broader institutional and retail participation. Increased Liquidity and Accessibility: With banks entering the crypto space, it could lead to increased liquidity in the market and make crypto services more accessible to the general public. Banks can offer regulated and insured avenues for buying, selling, and holding cryptocurrencies, which can be reassuring for new users. Fueling Innovation: As banks become more comfortable with digital assets , it can spur innovation in financial products and services. We could see the development of new hybrid offerings that blend the best of traditional banking with the dynamism of the crypto world. David Sacks’s Optimistic View: A Mainstream Crypto Catalyst? David Sacks, known for his insightful commentary on technology and finance, took to X (formerly Twitter) to express his positive outlook on the FDIC’s guidance. He specifically credited the FDIC’s initiative for making it simpler for banks to engage in digital asset operations. His appreciation for the agency and Acting Chairman Travis Hill underscores the significance of this regulatory development. Sacks stated that this move is “one of the best ways to mainstream crypto further,” highlighting the potential for widespread integration of crypto into the financial mainstream. Sacks’s endorsement carries weight in the tech and investment communities. His perspective reinforces the idea that regulatory clarity, as provided by the FDIC, is a vital ingredient for the continued growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies. What Does the FDIC Guidance Actually Say? While the full details of the guidance are being analyzed by industry experts, the core message is clear: the FDIC is providing a pathway for regulated banks to participate in certain crypto-related activities under specific conditions. This likely includes areas such as: Custody Services: Banks could offer custody services for digital assets, providing secure storage solutions for institutional and retail clients. Stablecoin Activities: The guidance may address how banks can handle stablecoins, potentially facilitating their use in payments and settlements. Blockchain Technology Integration: Banks might be exploring ways to integrate blockchain technology into their existing infrastructure to improve efficiency and transparency. It’s crucial to note that the FDIC is expected to maintain a cautious approach, emphasizing consumer protection and financial stability. The guidance likely includes safeguards and requirements for banks to manage risks associated with crypto assets, such as volatility and cybersecurity threats. Challenges and Considerations for Banks Entering Crypto While the FDIC guidance is a positive step, banks venturing into the crypto realm will still face challenges. These may include: Challenge Description Regulatory Compliance Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape for crypto assets will be complex. Banks will need to ensure they comply with all applicable rules and regulations, which can vary across jurisdictions. Technological Expertise Understanding and managing the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and blockchain requires specialized expertise. Banks will need to invest in talent and infrastructure to effectively handle digital assets. Risk Management Crypto assets are known for their volatility and unique risk profiles. Banks will need to develop robust risk management frameworks to mitigate potential losses and protect consumer deposits. Public Perception and Education Educating customers about crypto assets and addressing public concerns will be important for banks to build trust and encourage adoption. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those interested in the intersection of traditional finance and crypto, here are some actionable insights and things to watch: Monitor Bank Announcements: Keep an eye on announcements from major banks regarding their crypto initiatives. This will provide real-world examples of how the FDIC guidance is being implemented. Track Regulatory Developments: Stay informed about further regulatory updates from the FDIC and other agencies. The regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving, and ongoing developments will shape the future of bank involvement. Observe Market Trends: Analyze how the market reacts to banks entering the crypto space. Increased institutional participation could influence market dynamics and price movements. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in discussions and forums about the role of banks in crypto. Your insights and perspectives are valuable in shaping the future of this evolving industry. Conclusion: A Groundbreaking Leap Towards Crypto Mainstream The FDIC’s guidance on banks and crypto is undeniably a groundbreaking development. It signals a maturing of the crypto industry and a growing recognition from regulatory bodies of the need to integrate digital assets into the mainstream financial system. David Sacks’s enthusiastic endorsement further underscores the potential of this initiative to accelerate crypto adoption and pave the way for a more inclusive and innovative financial future. While challenges remain, this guidance represents a significant leap forward, promising to reshape the landscape of both banking and cryptocurrency.

With the unveiling of Keynote 3, BlockDAG (BDAG) has decisively demonstrated its ambition to surpass the usual boundaries of most Layer 1 projects. The presentation revealed a burgeoning protocol poised to conclude its presale with a staggering $600 million. After witnessing this keynote, the conversation shifts from “if” to a definitive “when.” The presentation meticulously charted a comprehensive strategy—from gaining community engagement and boasting technical excellence to enhancing developer initiatives and demonstrating impressive testnet results. This positions BlockDAG as arguably the most ready-to-launch blockchain initiative currently. For those still watching from the sidelines, it might be time for a reconsideration. “We are more than a project; we are pioneers of a new decentralized era.” This proclamation by BlockDAG’s CEO, Antony Turner, during the opening remarks, resonated throughout the event. This was not merely a technological showcase but a bold statement. With over 800,000 X1 App users, more than 170,000 stakeholders, and a global presale now exceeding $208 million, the magnitude of their achievements is palpable. Reflecting on the path from Keynote 1 to the present, Turner highlighted BlockDAG’s success in surpassing expectations and defying skeptics by maintaining a lead in their timeline: “Against all odds we completed the core infrastructure ahead of schedule. However, instead of rushing to launch, we made a strategic decision—to extend our presale and take additional time to refine and optimize the network.” This “strategic decision” has proven to be a masterstroke. While other projects rush to deploy underdeveloped mainnets, BlockDAG is methodically establishing a foundation for sustained superiority, ensuring they do not sacrifice scalability, security, or community trust. BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet V1 Goes Live: A Promising Start with More to Come BlockDAG isn’t just talking about innovation—they’re making it happen. The launch of Beta Testnet V1 during their recent keynote is a testament to their commitment, having already facilitated over 1.2 million transactions through more than 100 community nodes across the globe. This achievement is just the beginning. As highlighted in the keynote: “With this beta version you can expect so much more. This includes: Our core blockchain running twice as fast A vastly improved explorer A Token and NFT creation wizard And various dApps for you to engage with” These developments are not mere future plans; they are either currently operational or set to debut in the coming weeks. They serve as the foundation for a fully functional DeFi ecosystem expected at launch. The anticipation around user rewards, vesting contracts, and incentives for testnet participation suggests that activity and engagement could significantly increase soon. DAG-Chain Ascends as Blockchains Fade: A New Era Begins Maurice Herlihy, BlockDAG’s esteemed blockchain advisor, captivated the audience with a compelling explanation during one of the keynote’s most pivotal moments. He outlined why BlockDAG’s innovative DAG-based architecture resolves issues that traditional blockchains cannot overcome. “In legacy blockchains, forking is purely and simply a waste of time and money… The key insight behind BlockDAG’s design is this: instead of treating forking like sand in the stopwatch, why not embrace it?” Herlihy detailed how the DAG structure facilitates parallelism in mining, accelerates block confirmation, and drastically enhances throughput. Moreover, it maintains compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), offering a smooth transition for current developers and users. This architectural innovation is why a $600M funding goal seems not just feasible, but likely. Dynamic Ecosystem and Strategic Growth BlockDAG’s ecosystem is more than theoretical—it’s active and growing. The X1 App, which supports mobile mining and live interaction, has already attracted over 800,000 users. Additionally, the Tap Miner game on Telegram boasts 400,000 registrants and maintains 100,000 daily active players. Looking ahead, the roadmap includes: The roll-out of X30/X100 miners Listings on over ten leading exchange platforms An expansive global ambassador initiative Ongoing developer grants and hackathons Having already amassed over $208 million, BlockDAG is swiftly advancing through its presale, currently at Batch 27 with BDAG coins priced at $0.0248. To date, the project has sold over 19 billion coins and distributed more than 16,600 mining units to early participants, solidifying its status as one of the fastest-growing Layer 1 ecosystems in the cryptocurrency sector. With each new batch, the price per coin climbs, presenting significant potential gains for early buyers. Given these developments, it’s understandable why many anticipate the presale reaching the $600M threshold well ahead of its final phase. BlockDAG Revolution: Beyond Promises to Real-World Impact Keynote 3 transcended the typical promotional discourse. It marked a definitive phase for BlockDAG, transitioning from a promising initiative to a dynamic, full-fledged movement. With its mainnet on the horizon, rising adoption rates, and a tech infrastructure primed for expansion, BDAG is increasingly seen as a portal to genuine, sustainable returns. A pivotal statement from Turner set the tone: “Let’s make history, one block at a time. Look out for our next keynote—oh, did I say ‘Keynote’? I meant ‘Launchnote’ coming soon!” This statement not only underscored the imminent launch of the mainnet but also signaled that the window to jump before broader market recognition is narrowing quickly. The initial $208 million raised was fueled by belief; the forthcoming $392 million is expected to be driven by tangible results. The BlockDAG era is not approaching; it is unfolding right now.

The rollercoaster ride of the crypto market continues, and this time, it’s Pi Network’s token, PI, taking a significant tumble. If you’ve been keeping an eye on your portfolio, you might have noticed the unsettling PI token price drop . Over the last 30 days, PI has witnessed a dramatic 61% decrease in its value, leaving investors and enthusiasts wondering what’s next for this once-promising digital asset. Is this just a temporary dip, or is there more to this concerning trend? Let’s dive deep into the analysis to understand the factors contributing to this downturn and what the future might hold for Pi Network’s crypto. Decoding the Stark PI Token Price Drop: What’s Behind the Bearish Trend? The numbers don’t lie. A 61% price drop in a month is nothing to scoff at. According to recent BeInCrypto analysis, the PI token price drop isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s backed by solid bearish technical indicators. But what exactly does this mean? Let’s break down the key elements signaling this downward pressure: Persistent Negative Bollinger Band Trend (BBTrend): Imagine a channel around the price movement, indicating volatility. The Bollinger Band Trend, or BBTrend, has been negative for a worrying twelve consecutive days. Hitting a low of -41 on March 21st, this prolonged negative trend strongly suggests sustained bearish momentum. Think of it like a river flowing strongly downstream – it’s hard to swim against such a current. Relative Strength Index (RSI) Below Neutral: The RSI is like a speedometer for price momentum, ranging from 0 to 100. A reading below 50 indicates bearish momentum. PI’s RSI consistently staying below 50 signals that sellers are dominating the market, and buyers are hesitant to step in. This lack of buying pressure further exacerbates the PI token price drop . Short-Term EMAs Below Long-Term EMAs: Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) help smooth out price data to identify trends. When short-term EMAs (reflecting recent price action) trade below longer-term EMAs (representing longer trends), it’s a classic bearish signal. This pattern on OKX’s PI/USDT four-hour chart reinforces the notion that the current downtrend is not just a short-lived blip but a potentially more sustained movement. Is There Any Hope? Pi Network’s Telegram Partnership – A Glimmer of Light? Amidst the gloom of the PI token price drop , there’s a faint glimmer of hope. Pi Network recently announced a partnership with Telegram Crypto Wallet. Partnerships in the crypto world can often act as catalysts for positive price movement. Does this collaboration have the potential to reverse the current bearish trend? Here’s a balanced perspective: Potential Positives of the Partnership: Increased Accessibility: Integrating with Telegram Crypto Wallet could make PI more accessible to Telegram’s massive user base. This increased accessibility could potentially drive demand for PI tokens. Enhanced Utility: The partnership might unlock new use cases for PI within the Telegram ecosystem, increasing its utility and attractiveness to users. Positive Sentiment Boost: News of partnerships often generates positive buzz and market sentiment, which could temporarily halt or even reverse a downtrend. Challenges and Limitations: Market Sentiment Overrides News: In a strong bearish market, even positive news might struggle to overcome the prevailing negative sentiment and technical pressures driving the PI token price drop . Partnership Impact Timeline: The actual impact of the partnership on PI’s price might not be immediate. It takes time for integrations to be implemented and for users to adopt new functionalities. Broader Crypto Market Context: The overall health of the crypto market plays a significant role. If the broader market remains bearish, PI might still face headwinds despite positive developments. While the Telegram partnership is undoubtedly a positive step for Pi Network, its immediate impact on reversing the PI token price drop remains to be seen. It’s crucial to consider the broader market context and the strength of the prevailing bearish trends. Navigating the Bearish Crypto Market: Is PI Token a Victim of Wider Trends? The crypto market analysis often reveals interconnectedness. Is the PI token price drop an isolated incident, or is it a symptom of broader market trends? The reality is often a mix of both. Here’s how the wider crypto market context might be influencing PI’s price: General Altcoin Volatility: Altcoins, in general, tend to be more volatile than established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. When the market experiences a downturn, altcoins often suffer more significant percentage losses. PI, being an altcoin, is susceptible to this increased volatility. Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of economic uncertainty or market corrections, investors often adopt a “risk-off” approach, moving away from perceived riskier assets like altcoins and towards safer havens. This risk aversion can contribute to selling pressure on altcoins like PI, exacerbating the PI token price drop . Bitcoin’s Dominance: Bitcoin’s price movements often dictate the direction of the broader crypto market. If Bitcoin is experiencing downward pressure, it typically drags altcoins down with it. The current crypto market analysis might reveal Bitcoin’s influence on the altcoin market, including PI. Therefore, while internal factors specific to Pi Network and PI token play a role, it’s crucial to acknowledge the influence of the broader crypto market analysis . Understanding these macro trends provides a more complete picture of the forces impacting the PI token price drop . Future Price Prediction for PI Token: How Low Could It Go? The million-dollar question on everyone’s mind: What’s next for PI token’s price? While precise altcoin price prediction is notoriously difficult in the volatile crypto market, technical analysis can offer potential scenarios and price targets. According to the BeInCrypto report, if the current correction persists, PI could potentially fall as low as $0.62. Let’s examine the factors supporting this altcoin price prediction : Continuation of Bearish Technical Patterns: If the BBTrend remains negative, the RSI stays below 50, and EMAs continue their bearish alignment, the technical indicators point towards further downside. Lack of Strong Buying Support: For a price reversal, strong buying pressure is essential. Currently, the analysis suggests a lack of significant buying interest to counteract the selling pressure driving the PI token price drop . Psychological Support Levels: Price levels often act as psychological barriers. If PI breaks below certain support levels, it can trigger further selling as traders anticipate further declines. The $0.62 level might represent a key psychological support that, if breached, could lead to even lower prices. Important Disclaimer: It’s crucial to remember that altcoin price prediction is speculative and based on current analysis. The crypto market is highly dynamic, and unexpected events can drastically alter price trajectories. This $0.62 target should be considered a potential scenario based on current technical analysis, not a guaranteed outcome. Actionable Insights for PI Token Holders: Navigating the Downturn So, what should PI token holders do amidst this concerning PI token price drop ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest news and analysis regarding Pi Network and the broader crypto market. Reliable sources of information are crucial for making informed decisions. Manage Risk: Assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Consider whether your PI token holdings align with your overall investment strategy, especially in light of the current downturn. Diversification: Diversification is a fundamental risk management strategy. Ensure your crypto portfolio isn’t overly concentrated in a single asset, especially one experiencing significant price volatility. Technical Analysis (Optional): If you are comfortable with technical analysis, monitor PI’s price charts for potential reversal signals. However, remember that technical analysis is not foolproof. Long-Term Perspective: Consider your long-term belief in Pi Network’s project and technology. Bear markets can be challenging, but they can also present opportunities for those with a long-term investment horizon (though DYOR – Do Your Own Research is always recommended). Conclusion: The Bleak Outlook for PI Token – A Wake-Up Call? The 61% PI token price drop serves as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the Telegram partnership offers a potential silver lining, the prevailing bearish technical indicators and broader market context paint a concerning picture for PI token in the short term. The potential fall to $0.62, as suggested by analysis, should be taken seriously by investors. This situation underscores the importance of thorough research, risk management, and a balanced perspective when navigating the exciting yet unpredictable world of crypto investments. Is this bleak outlook a wake-up call? Perhaps. But in the crypto world, change is the only constant, and the story of PI token is far from over.

This figure shows Bitcoin’s market share compared to all cryptocurrencies. Despite hopes for an altcoin season, Bitcoin’s dominance keeps growing, defying the usual trend where capital shifts to altcoins as the market matures. Many crypto investors have been waiting for an “alt season” where altcoins outperform Bitcoin with big returns. Usually, this happens after Bitcoin rallies, as traders cash out and invest in riskier, higher-reward altcoins. However, even with conditions that typically trigger alt seasons, like Bitcoin stability, more market liquidity, and institutional interest, this shift hasn’t happened as expected. Why is the Bitcoin Dominance Growing? Bitcoin’s dominance continues to grow because of several key factors. Corporate accumulation strategies, particularly from Strategy keep buying Bitcoin, which creates consistent buying pressure. Besides, there are also more new tokens than ever, which can spread out investment instead of focusing on established altcoins. Finally, spot Bitcoin ETFs make it easier for traditional investors to buy Bitcoin, while most altcoins don’t have the same level of access. Ethereum ETF approval last summer was expected to reduce Bitcoin’s dominance, but the impact has been minimal. While ETH ETFs had strong early interest, they didn’t boost the altcoin market as expected. The alt season might still happen, just delayed, with future events potentially triggering a shift to altcoins. Analyst Sparks Optimism for Altcoins Rekt Capital, a well-known analyst on X, sparked optimism for an upcoming altcoin season with a key technical signal. He shared a chart showing that if the altcoin market cap closes above a certain level this week, it could trigger the next big rally. After a sharp crash in early March that wiped out weeks of gains, the altcoin market cap briefly fell below $200 billion however it ended the week above that level. Since then, it has steadily climbed, reaching around $249 billion. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital emhasized that a weekly close above $250 billion could signal a major shift for altcoins.

Gox’s Shocking BTC Transfer & Recession Fears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-market-drop-mt-gox/,"The cryptocurrency market recently experienced a noticeable dip, leaving investors and enthusiasts wondering about the underlying causes. Was it just another day in the volatile world of crypto, or were there more significant factors at play? According to Inky Cho, a financial markets strategist at Exness, the recent crypto market drop might be more than just random fluctuation. Let’s delve into the potential reasons behind this downturn, focusing on the influence of Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin transfer and growing recession fears. What Triggered the Recent Crypto Market Drop? One of the primary catalysts for the recent market jitters, as highlighted by Inky Cho, is the movement of Bitcoin (BTC) from the infamous, now-defunct exchange Mt. Gox. For those unfamiliar, Mt. Gox was a major cryptocurrency exchange that collapsed in 2014 after a massive security breach. Years later, the exchange is in the process of settling debts with creditors, and recent reports indicated a significant Mt Gox BTC transfer . This transfer, intended for creditor repayment, seems to have sparked panic selling in the market. Why? Let’s break it down: Fear of Increased Supply: The market perceived the Mt. Gox transfer as a potential influx of a large amount of Bitcoin hitting the market. Creditors receiving BTC might choose to sell it, increasing the supply and potentially driving down prices. Psychological Impact: The Mt. Gox saga is a dark chapter in crypto history. Any news related to it can trigger negative sentiment and remind investors of past market crashes, leading to fear-based selling. Uncertainty and Speculation: The exact timing and scale of creditor selling are uncertain. This ambiguity fuels speculation and anxiety, prompting some investors to preemptively sell their holdings to avoid potential losses. In essence, the Mt Gox BTC transfer acted as a trigger, shaking investor confidence and initiating a wave of selling pressure across the crypto market. Recession Fears: Another Headwind for Crypto? Adding fuel to the fire, concerns about a potential economic recession fears are also weighing heavily on both traditional and cryptocurrency markets. Inky Cho pointed out that comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about a possible recession have further dampened market sentiment. How do these fears translate to the crypto space? Risk-Off Sentiment: During times of economic uncertainty, investors tend to move away from riskier assets and towards safer havens. Cryptocurrencies, often perceived as high-risk, can be negatively impacted by this risk-off sentiment. Correlation with Stock Markets: While Bitcoin is sometimes touted as a safe haven asset, its correlation with stock markets, particularly the Nasdaq, cannot be ignored. Cho notes that BTC’s correlation with the Nasdaq is around 40%. If stock markets decline due to recession fears, Bitcoin and other cryptos might follow suit, at least in the short term. Reduced Investment Appetite: Economic downturns can lead to reduced disposable income and investment appetite. People might be less willing to invest in volatile assets like cryptocurrencies when facing economic hardship or job insecurity. Therefore, the broader macroeconomic environment, characterized by recession fears , is acting as a significant headwind, exacerbating the negative impact of the Mt. Gox news on the crypto market. Bitcoin as a Hedge: Is BTC Diverging from Altcoins? Interestingly, Cho highlights a divergence within the crypto market itself. While the overall market experienced a downturn, Bitcoin’s behavior suggests it might be carving out a unique role. He observes that Bitcoin as hedge against economic uncertainty and U.S. tariffs is becoming more prominent, while altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), remain more closely tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq. What does this mean for investors? Bitcoin vs. Altcoins: Diverging Paths Asset Correlation Key Drivers Role in Current Market Bitcoin (BTC) Moderate with Nasdaq (~40%) Economic uncertainty, tariffs, safe haven narrative Increasingly seen as a hedge, potential safe haven in economic downturns Altcoins (e.g., ETH) High with Nasdaq Tech sector performance, broader market sentiment Remain closely linked to tech stocks, more susceptible to Nasdaq fluctuations This divergence suggests that Bitcoin as hedge narrative might be gaining traction. Investors are potentially viewing Bitcoin as a store of value and a hedge against traditional market risks, while altcoins are still largely treated as risk-on tech assets. This could have significant implications for portfolio diversification and investment strategies within the crypto space. Altcoin Market Analysis: Why Are Altcoins Lagging? The altcoin market analysis reveals a more challenging picture compared to Bitcoin. As Cho points out, altcoins, including Ethereum, are still heavily correlated with the Nasdaq. This means they are more vulnerable to fluctuations in the tech sector and overall market sentiment. Several factors contribute to this: Higher Risk Profile: Altcoins are generally considered riskier investments than Bitcoin. In risk-off environments, investors tend to reduce their exposure to these higher-risk assets first. Liquidity Concerns: Compared to Bitcoin, many altcoins have lower liquidity. During market downturns, selling pressure can be amplified in less liquid markets, leading to sharper price declines. Tech Sector Dependency: Many altcoins are built on platforms or technologies related to the tech industry. Their performance is often tied to the broader tech sector’s health and investor sentiment. Therefore, the altcoin market analysis indicates that these assets are facing a double whammy: general crypto market negativity compounded by their correlation with a potentially weakening tech sector due to recession fears. Investors in altcoins need to be particularly cautious during this period. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Current Crypto Landscape So, what can investors take away from this analysis? Here are some actionable insights to navigate the current crypto landscape: Understand Market Dynamics: Recognize the factors influencing the crypto market, including Mt. Gox-related events and macroeconomic conditions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider diversifying your crypto holdings. Bitcoin might offer some hedging benefits, while altcoins could provide higher growth potential but also carry greater risk. Monitor Market Correlations: Pay attention to the correlation between Bitcoin, altcoins, and traditional markets like the Nasdaq. This can help you anticipate market movements and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news and developments related to Mt. Gox, economic indicators, and market analysis from reputable sources like Exness. Manage Risk: Implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and only investing what you can afford to lose. Conclusion: A Complex Picture Demands Prudence The recent crypto market drop is likely a result of a confluence of factors, with the Mt Gox BTC transfer acting as an immediate trigger and broader recession fears exacerbating the negative sentiment. While Bitcoin might be showing signs of diverging and establishing itself as a hedge, the altcoin market analysis suggests continued vulnerability, particularly due to its correlation with the tech sector. In this complex and uncertain environment, a prudent approach to crypto investing, characterized by informed decision-making, diversification, and risk management, is more crucial than ever.

Since the start of the year, its price has dropped by over 10.5%, now trading at $83,706.02. This decline seems to mirror the US stock market, where the S&P 500 has fallen by 5.44%. But while Bitcoin and stocks are slipping, gold is soaring. Gold has surged 17.56% this year, reaching $3,085.345, sparking fresh debates on whether investors are shifting away from Bitcoin. Some experts believe this trend could spell trouble for the crypto market, with gold advocate Peter Schiff even predicting a Bitcoin crash to $10,000 if gold crosses $5,000. Is Bitcoin losing its edge against traditional assets? Let’s break it down. Bitcoin vs. Gold: Schiff Warns of a Crypto Crash Peter Schiff, a longtime critic of Bitcoin, believes the cryptocurrency lacks real value and could suffer a major crash if gold keeps rising. He argues that Bitcoin’s price is driven mostly by speculation, while gold has maintained its position as a trusted store of value for centuries. Despite his skepticism, Schiff acknowledges that Bitcoin has gained popularity among younger investors, who see it as a digital alternative to gold. Gold hit another record high, above $3,080. Meanwhile, millions of young Americans are allowing this train to pass them by as they fixate on Bitcoin instead. By the time gold hits $5K, they'll likely ride Bitcoin down to $10K, a 95% decline from its 2021 peak priced in gold. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 28, 2025 Bitcoin Losing Value Against Gold – What the Data Says? At the beginning of 2025, one ounce of gold was worth 0.02771 BTC. Since then, gold’s value against Bitcoin has risen by more than 32.8%. Currently, one ounce of gold costs at least 0.03680 BTC, having peaked at 0.03763 BTC on March 11, 2025. Just yesterday, it gained another 5.47% against Bitcoin. This means Bitcoin has lost nearly 33% of its value compared to gold since January. Back in December 2021, one Bitcoin was worth 41 ounces of gold, but now it is only worth 27.4 ounces. Is Bitcoin’s Bull Run Over? Analysts Weigh In Several experts share Schiff’s concerns about Bitcoin’s future. Veteran trader Peter Brandt warns that Bitcoin’s price chart is showing a bearish wedge pattern, which could push the price down to $65,635. Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe highlights $84,000 as a key support level. He predicts that if Bitcoin falls below this level, it could trigger strong bearish momentum and lead to further losses. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Dominance Hits 3-Year High, But Why Are Altcoins Still Struggling? , Can Bitcoin Recover? Some Experts Remain Hopeful Not all analysts are pessimistic. Some believe Bitcoin may have already reached its lowest point. ByteTree founder Charlie Morris suggests that Bitcoin has bottomed out, meaning a further drop is unlikely. Meanwhile, financial author Robert Kiyosaki remains confident in gold as a hedge against inflation but believes silver could outperform both gold and Bitcoin in the near future. Gold may be shining now, but Bitcoin has a history of bouncing back when doubt is at its peak.

However, the last few weeks’ incidents have affected its image and performance severely, causing security and transparency concerns. Amid the whales continuously exploiting Hyperliquid’s liquidation system, its worth is declining. What’s all the chaos? Let’s discuss this. Hyperliquid Price in Turmoil Following the Jelly Incident Hyperliquid, being a decentralized crypto platform, has been gaining investors’ attention against the top centralized exchanges on various metrics. However, all that shifted with the crypto whales exploiting the network and drawing security concerns. This began with a Bitcoin whale shifting a $4M loss on the network by removing its collateral in mid-trade. Soon, more and more similar incidents happened on the platform, resulting in serious security concerns. The most recent one includes the JELLY price manipulation incident, where a trader deposited $7M across three accounts and executed leveraged trades. Interestingly, two accounts took the long positions and the other in the short. Their association resulted in the JELLY price surging 400%. With that, the short got liquidated, but the loss got passed to Hyperliquid’s Provider Vault (HLP). In response, Hyperliquid delisted the JELLY token, citing suspicious activity. Although the foundation promised to compensate affected users, the Hyperliquid price was severely affected due to specific account limitations. Community Criticism Fueled Hyperliquid Price Crash This incident drew the global crypto community’s attention and criticism. Various crypto leaders showed disappointment with the platform, with some, like Bitget CEO, calling Hyperliquid unprofessional and stating that it is following FTX’s path. More importantly, community criticism followed due to the compensation for the JELLY incident for specific accounts. Investors have pointed out bias and favoritism. Users with JELLY long positions at the time of settlement will be refunded by the Foundation as if their position settled at the closing price of 0.037555. This results in all JELLY traders being settled at a price advantageous to them, except flagged addresses, said Hyperliquid The Bitget CEO also highlights structural flaws. Her concerns were echoed by BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who also questioned HyperLiquid’s decentralization claims. Amid all this chaos, the Hyperliquid price crashed, losing more than 20% of its value over the week and 8% in the last 24 hours. It currently trades at $12.92 and stands 63% away from its all-time high of $35.02 set three months ago. Hyperliquid News: New Risk Management Policy Draws Attention Hyperliquid has taken strict action to prevent such events. In an X post announcement, the team revealed four major updates in the risk management policy. From now on, the liquidator vault will have a tighter cap, which means it will only hold a small portion of the total HLP account value. In addition, the frequency of rebalancing has reduced. More importantly, liquidation will be handled with a more sophisticated system. There are also changes in the functioning of the automatic deleveraging (ADL). Once the liquidator vault hits a certain limit, the ADL process will be triggered, preventing the automatic movement of funds. There are also changes in the Open Interest policies. Per the new risk management policy, the OI is based on the market and will reflect the current condition better. Interestingly, the most important update is allowing validators to remove poorly performing digital assets with on-chain voting. What’s Next For Hyperliquid Price? These whale incidents have exposed the Hyperliquid and similar DeFi trading models’ vulnerability. The HYPE token has faced extreme conditions and price declines amid criticism and community backlash. Despite everything, the platform is still working. Some experts believe that the new risk management update may improve investor sentiments toward the platform. However, the bearish trend on the Hyperliquid is likely to stay high for some time, affecting its price.

The White House confirmed the pardons on Friday, which also extended to Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo, BitMEX’s co-founders, along with senior employee Greg Dwyer and the exchange’s parent company, HDR Global Trading. The move, first reported by CNBC, comes nearly four years after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed charges against the group for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) . In 2020, prosecutors accused BitMEX of operating as a haven for anonymous crypto trading, alleging the platform failed to implement basic Know-Your-Customer (KYC) measures. The exchange’s lax controls allegedly allowed billions of dollars to flow through its platform without proper oversight. Though all four executives eventually pleaded guilty and were sentenced to probation and fines, they have consistently claimed they were unfairly targeted. BitMEX Co-Founders Claim Vindication Following the announcement, Delo released a statement expressing relief, calling the pardon a “vindication” of their stance. He argued that BitMEX had been unjustly made an example of by regulators attempting to send a political message. “This full and unconditional pardon by President Trump is a vindication of the position we have always held — that BitMEX, my co-founders, and I should never have been charged with a criminal offense through an obscure, antiquated law,” Delo said. Meanwhile, Hayes kept his response short and direct, simply posting “thank you” on X. Trump Pardons Raise Questions Despite the pardons, BitMEX’s legal troubles are far from forgotten. In 2021, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined the exchange $100 million for violating the Commodity Exchange Act, separate from its DOJ settlements. The pardons have sparked mixed reactions within the crypto industry. While some view the move as a win for over-regulated crypto entrepreneurs, others see it as politically motivated. Trump’s decision comes just days after he pardoned Trevor Milton, former Nikola Motors CEO, and a few months after granting clemency to Ross Ulbricht , the Silk Road founder.

Mysterious Prison Transfer Fuels Debate,https://coinpedia.org/news/sam-bankman-fried-moved-to-oklahoma-whats-behind-the-sudden-transfer/,"The post Why Was Sam Bankman-Fried Moved? Mysterious Prison Transfer Fuels Debate appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Sam Bankman-Fried, the former FTX CEO convicted of orchestrating an $8 billion fraud scheme, has been unexpectedly moved from his New York prison to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma. Authorities have not given a reason for the transfer, which took place in the early hours of the morning. The sudden move has sparked speculation about possible changes to his prison conditions and how it might affect his legal defense. Reports reveal that Bankman-Fried was woken up at 3 a.m. before being transported. With no official explanation, many are wondering if this could make it harder for him to work on his appeal or if it signals a shift in his treatment behind bars. Legal Roadblocks for SBF His time in prison has already been difficult. Earlier this month, he was placed in solitary confinement after giving an unauthorized interview with Tucker Carlson . The move raised concerns that his access to his legal team could be restricted. Now, with his unexpected transfer, some believe his ability to fight for a reduced sentence may face new obstacles. Is the Law Tougher for SBF? In November 2023, Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison . Alongside this, he was slapped with an $11 billion fine, with Judge Lewis Kaplan making it clear that SBF was fully aware of his actions. Kaplan stated that the former FTX boss knowingly committed fraud and was simply betting against getting caught. While SBF faces a lengthy sentence, some of his closest allies secured significantly lighter punishments. Caroline Ellison, former Alameda Research CEO and key witness, received only two years in prison. Meanwhile, FTX co-founder Gary Wang and the company’s director of engineering, Nishad Singh, avoided jail time altogether after cooperating with authorities. Their testimonies played a major role in proving that FTX’s downfall wasn’t just mismanagement—it was deliberate fraud. Could Trump Pardon Sam Bankman-Fried? A new debate is emerging: Could Bankman-Fried receive a presidential pardon? Betting platform Polymarket has reported a surge in wagers that Donald Trump might step in. While there’s been no official discussion, the increase in betting activity has led to speculation about whether SBF’s legal fate could take an unexpected turn. SBF PARDON COMING SOON? The odds Trump pardons FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried have tripled. Should he? https://t.co/YPLefvdycw — Polymarket (@Polymarket) March 28, 2025 Recently, new names have been added to pardon discussions, including Arthur Hayes and his team, raising further questions about Trump’s potential stance on financial crimes. Senator Kennedy’s Blunt Criticism During a Senate Banking Committee hearing on March 27, US Senator John Kennedy pressed SEC nominee Paul Atkins on the possibility of a pardon for Bankman-Fried. Kennedy didn’t hold back, calling him a “crook” and criticizing his family’s donations to Stanford. He urged the SEC to ensure Bankman-Fried doesn’t receive any leniency. Rumors in January suggested that SBF’s parents were seeking a Trump pardon, similar to the one given to Silk Road’s Ross Ulbricht . However, legal experts say the two cases are very different, making a pardon for Bankman-Fried unlikely. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : FTX Set to Begin Paying Major Creditors by End of May: Bloomberg , Where Will Bankman-Fried End Up? For now, the Oklahoma facility is believed to be a temporary stop before he is moved to a permanent prison. Some speculate he could be sent closer to his hometown in Stanford, California. Regardless of where he ends up, his legal fight is far from over. Whether through appeals or a long-shot presidential intervention, Bankman-Fried’s future remains uncertain – but the crypto world is watching closely. Behind bars, cut off from the crypto empire he built and broke, SBF now faces his toughest gamble yet – one where the odds aren’t in his favor. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Introduction to SOL and its role in the Solana ecosystem Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability. It supports decentralized applications and competes with platforms like Ethereum. It emphasizes quick transactions and wide development support. The native cryptocurrency, SOL, is essential to its system. SOL facilitates transactions and powers various programs. It rewards users who support the network. The Solana ecosystem relies on SOL to operate and support projects. Solana differs from other platforms by not using sharding or second-layer solutions for scaling. This makes it appealing to developers and investors seeking robust network capacity. The platform’s unique approach and growing ecosystem give SOL potential appeal in the market. Its focus on high-speed and scalability hints at promising use cases as blockchain adoption grows. Conclusion While coins like SOL may show less potential in the short term, Catzilla emerges as a standout in the current bull run. Positioned as the ultimate meme coin hero, Catzilla aims to bring financial freedom to everyone, offering a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale. With its triple utility — governance, incentives, and staking options — it invites crypto enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains and achieve new heights.

Martin Law can “open the door for abuse” “The law has no need to prove intent, creating a low standard of proof that can open the door for abuse like this. It shouldn’t exist,” he said. New York’s Martin Act is one of the US's strictest anti-fraud and securities laws, allowing prosecutors the power to pursue financial fraud cases without needing to prove intent. The NAYG alleged that Galaxy Digital violated the Martin Act over its alleged promotion of Terra, with Galaxy Digital agreeing to a $200 million settlement. According to NAYG documents filed on March 24, Galaxy Digital acquired 18.5 million LUNA tokens at a 30% discount in October 2020, then promoted them before selling them without abiding by disclosure rules. Scaramucci reiterated that Galaxy CEO Michael Novogratz was under the impression everything he was saying about Luna was true, as he had been deceived by Terraform Labs and its former CEO, Do Kwon. Source: Amanda Fischer Meanwhile, MoonPay president of enterprise, Keith Grossman, said he had never heard of the Martin Act and had to look it up using AI chatbot ChatGPT. “It is so broad and essentially is the essence of lawfare,” Grossman said. “Sorry you got caught in the crosshairs of it, Mike,” he added. Related: Sonic unveils high-yield algorithmic stablecoin, reigniting Terra-Luna ‘PTSD’ The filing alleged that Galaxy helped a “little-known” token, referring to LUNA, increase its market price from $0.31 in October 2020 to $119.18 in April 2022 while “profiting in the hundreds of millions of dollars.” Asset manager and investor Anthony Pompliano said he isn’t familiar with the details of the lawsuit but vouched for Novogratz, calling him a “good man” who has devoted a lot of time and money to helping others. The Terra collapse is one of the crypto industry’s most infamous failures. In March 2024, SEC attorney Devon Staren said in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York that Terra was a “house of cards” that collapsed for investors in 2022.

The primary reason cited is regulatory risk, with banks waiting for complete legal clarity before publicly committing to any collaboration involving Ripple’s technology or XRP. WHY BANKS WON’T ANNOUNCE RIPPLE PARTNERSHIPS YET. Ripple’s legal fight is ending, but banks stay silent. Why? Regulatory risk. Until the SEC case is fully closed, compliance concerns hold them back. Let’s break down why they’re waiting. pic.twitter.com/7fNGUf64q2 — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) March 25, 2025 Regulatory Compliance as a Barrier U.S. banks operate under strict oversight from multiple regulatory agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the SEC, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Each of these regulators imposes specific requirements for financial institutions engaging in new business activities, including FinTech partnerships. If a bank were to announce a partnership with Ripple before the legal process is fully resolved, it would have to conduct an extensive risk analysis and demonstrate to regulators that such a collaboration does not violate financial laws. Until banks can be certain they meet these requirements, they will remain hesitant to move forward publicly. The OCC had previously imposed strict approval requirements for banks engaging in cryptocurrency-related activities. Although these restrictions were eased in March 2025, financial institutions are still required to prove they have robust risk management systems in place. Any premature engagement with Ripple without full regulatory clarity could lead to penalties, regulatory scrutiny, or legal challenges. Concerns Over AML and Compliance History Financial institutions are also cautious due to Ripple’s past regulatory challenges. In 2015, FinCEN fined Ripple $700,000 for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by failing to register as a money services business (MSB) and lacking sufficient anti-money laundering (AML) controls. Banks must ensure that Ripple is fully compliant with AML regulations before proceeding with large-scale partnerships. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory frameworks require banks to prevent money laundering, and any association with a firm that has faced compliance issues increases due diligence requirements. If a bank were to engage with Ripple without confirming full regulatory compliance, it could risk fines, investigations, or even the loss of its banking charter. Third-Party Risk Management and Reputation Concerns Banks approach partnerships with fintech firms cautiously, conducting extensive due diligence before moving forward. Given that Ripple has been under SEC litigation, banks must ensure there are no unresolved legal liabilities . They also need to confirm that XRP transactions will not be classified as securities offerings. Until these legal risks are fully addressed, banks will delay any public announcements. Another factor contributing to this hesitation is reputation management. No bank wants to be the first to publicly align with Ripple and risk becoming the subject of regulatory scrutiny. Financial institutions prioritize stability, and any association with a firm that has been involved in a legal battle with the SEC carries potential risks. Even if Ripple’s legal issues are resolved favorably, banks will likely proceed cautiously by testing RippleNet in private pilot programs before making any formal announcements regarding XRP usage. Future Timeline for Announcements Currently, banks are reportedly engaged in private discussions with Ripple. Public confirmation of partnerships is expected to follow once financial institutions are confident that regulators will not object. However, the process will be gradual rather than immediate, as banks take a measured approach to integrating Ripple’s technology.

The cryptocurrency has faced significant volatility due to both technical and macroeconomic factors. Recent market movements have put XRP in a crucial position, with key support and resistance levels defining its potential next move. Technical Analysis: Support and Resistance Levels Daily Timeframe: Support: $2.00 Resistance: $2.64 XRP has been testing the $2.64 resistance level but has struggled to break above it. If this level is breached, the price may climb toward $2.80. However, if XRP fails to hold support at $2.00, it could trigger a further decline. Weekly Timeframe: Support: $2.02 Resistance: $2.94 On a broader scale, $2.94 remains a critical resistance level. A breakout above this level would signal bullish momentum, while a dip below $2.02 could lead to bearish pressure in the market. Monthly Timeframe: Support: $1.40 Resistance: $3.29 Long-term investors are watching the $3.29 resistance, which, if surpassed, could push XRP into a stronger uptrend. Conversely, a breakdown below $1.40 may indicate a prolonged correction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Next Move Recent price action has shown mixed signals. On one hand, the formation of a “Golden Pocket” suggests a potential 20% rally if bullish momentum sustains. On the other hand, bearish signals such as a head and shoulders pattern indicate the possibility of a 50% correction if XRP fails to maintain key support levels. Immediate Projection Given the current price of $2.12 and XRP’s struggle to break resistance at $2.64, the immediate outlook remains neutral to slightly bearish. If buyers fail to gain control, XRP may retest the $2.00 support level. A decisive break below this could lead to further downside toward $1.80. However, if bullish pressure increases, a breakout above $2.64 could push XRP toward the $2.80-$2.94 range in the short term.

Investors To Approach Supreme Court Next The commission stated that since crypto transactions aren’t fully regulated in India, it cannot investigate the matter. The NCDRC stated that since cryptocurrencies are neither legal tender nor officially recognized as investment assets in India, the lawsuit’s claim of financial fraud against WazirX lacks legal basis. The investors’ lawyer, Aman Rehaan Khan plan to approach the Supreme Court next and seek recovery of lost funds and criminal proceedings against the entities and individuals involved. Some Positives Despite the Setback The lawyer said that although the decision was a setback, there were some positives. The consumer forum agreed that cryptocurrencies are considered ‘goods’ under the Consumer Protection Act and are also treated as property under the Income Tax Act. The complaint was filed by 40 investors who claim to have lost around INR 12 crore (about $1.4 million) in cryptocurrency. Crypto isn’t legal tender in India , but the government taxes crypto profits at 30%. All exchanges must register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) under the finance ministry.

In 2020, it lifted the RBI’s 2018 ban on crypto trading and later criticized the government for not setting clear rules on crypto trading and fraud investigations. Users to Recover Stolen Crypto by April Notably, WazirX, led by Nischal Shetty, is planning a major restructuring to help customers recover some of the $234 million lost in the hack.

This plan has been approved by the Singapore Court, and WazirX has completed the rebalancing process, allowing users to claim their stolen crypto by April. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The altcoins are also struggling on a daily scale, with ETH dropping beneath $1,900, while XRP is well under $2.15. BTC Slips to $84K It all seemed to be going well for the primary cryptocurrency, whose price started to gain traction last Sunday and peaked on Monday. Within that 24-hour period, the asset jumped by several grand and marked a multi-week high of just under $89,000. The ETF inflows had changed for the better, and the overall sentiment had improved. However, BTC couldn’t break through that resistance and started to consolidate in the next few days, trading mostly in a tight range between $86,000 and $88,000. On Friday, though, the lower boundary gave in and bitcoin slumped beneath it. It kept going south and dropped to $83,500 for the first time since last Friday. Thus, BTC lost all gains made during the week. As of now, it struggles below $84,000 once again, while its market cap has plunged to $1.665 trillion on CG. The silver lining is its growing dominance over the alts, which has spiked to 59.1% as most have bled out heavily. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Turn Red As mentioned above, most altcoins have posted notable price declines lately. Ethereum, which challenged $2,100 earlier this week, is below $1,900 now after another drop in the past 24 hours. Ripple’s native token has lost another 4% of value despite the positive news for the company this week. As a result, XRP sits beneath $2.15. More daily losses come from the likes of BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, LINK, TON, SUI, and many others. In fact, the last two have lost over 6% of value in the past day alone. With most other alts in a similar state, it’s no wonder that the total crypto market cap has dropped to $2.810 trillion – almost $200 billion lower than this week’s peak.

42575915,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144416,1743238858,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unprecedented Access: Dogecoin ‘DOGE’ Eyes SEC Systems in Groundbreaking Crypto Regulation Move?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dogecoin-sec-access-crypto-regulation/,"Hold onto your digital wallets, crypto enthusiasts! The rumor mill is buzzing with a rather… unique development. Imagine Dogecoin, yes, the meme-turned-cryptocurrency sensation, potentially gaining access to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) closely guarded systems and data. Sounds like something straight out of a crypto fever dream, right? But let’s unpack this intriguing, albeit eyebrow-raising, news reported by Cointelegraph and delve into what this could actually mean for the future of crypto regulation and digital assets. Is Dogecoin Really Seeking SEC System Access? Unpacking the ‘DOGE’ Mystery Now, before you envision Shiba Inus hacking into government mainframes, let’s clarify a crucial point. The original report mentions ‘DOGE, the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.’ While the idea of Elon Musk leading a ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ is… creative, it’s highly likely this is a humorous or satirical misinterpretation. In the crypto context, ‘DOGE’ almost universally refers to Dogecoin. So, let’s proceed with the more probable interpretation: the article is playfully suggesting Dogecoin, as a prominent cryptocurrency, is metaphorically or symbolically engaging with the SEC regarding data access and regulatory frameworks. It’s important to understand that Dogecoin, as a decentralized cryptocurrency, doesn’t have a formal ‘department’ or CEO in the traditional sense. However, the community and its prominent figures, like Elon Musk, do exert influence and can engage in discussions relevant to crypto policy. Therefore, the news, while presented with a humorous twist, touches upon a real and important theme: the increasing interaction between the cryptocurrency world and regulatory bodies like the SEC. What Does ‘SEC System Access’ Even Mean for Dogecoin and Crypto? Let’s move past the satirical framing and consider the core issue: potential interaction between a crypto entity and the SEC regarding data. What could this entail, and why might it be significant? Enhanced Transparency and Compliance: If there were a formal liaison between a cryptocurrency representative (let’s say, for the sake of argument, a Dogecoin Foundation or similar entity) and the SEC, it could pave the way for clearer communication and a better understanding of regulatory expectations. This could be crucial for fostering digital asset compliance within the crypto space. Data Sharing for Regulatory Clarity: Access to certain SEC systems, even in a limited and controlled manner, might allow crypto projects to understand the type of data the SEC deems important for regulatory oversight. This could help projects proactively address concerns and structure themselves in a way that aligns with regulatory requirements. Collaboration on Framework Development: Open dialogue and data sharing could facilitate a more collaborative approach to developing crypto regulation . Instead of regulations being imposed top-down, input from the crypto community, informed by an understanding of SEC data needs, could lead to more practical and effective frameworks. Addressing Concerns and Misconceptions: Direct interaction can help dispel misconceptions and address specific concerns the SEC might have about certain cryptocurrencies or the broader digital asset market. This could foster a more constructive relationship between regulators and the crypto industry. The SEC’s Stance: Cooperation with Caveats According to the report, the SEC has indicated a willingness to cooperate with this ‘DOGE’ initiative, stating they plan to form a liaison team. However, the SEC also emphasizes that this cooperation will adhere to established protocols: Ethics Requirements: Any interaction will strictly adhere to ethical guidelines, ensuring fairness and preventing any undue influence or preferential treatment. IT Security: SEC data is highly sensitive. Access, if granted, would be subject to stringent IT security protocols and safeguards to prevent breaches or unauthorized access. System Training: Individuals from ‘DOGE’ (or a representative crypto entity) would likely require specific training on SEC systems and data handling procedures. ‘Need to Know’ Basis: Access to restricted systems and data would be granted only on a strict ‘need to know’ basis, ensuring that only relevant information is shared and accessed for specific, justified purposes. This cautious approach from the SEC is understandable. Regulatory bodies must balance the need for industry engagement with their mandate to protect investors and maintain market integrity. Unfettered access to sensitive systems would be highly unlikely and inappropriate. Elon Musk’s DOGE Influence: A Factor in the Equation? The mention of Elon Musk DOGE influence, even in the original report’s satirical context, isn’t entirely irrelevant. Musk’s vocal support for Dogecoin has significantly impacted its market movements and public perception. His involvement, even indirectly, could lend weight to any initiative aimed at fostering dialogue between the crypto world and regulators. However, it’s crucial to differentiate between Musk’s personal endorsements and formal government or regulatory processes. While his opinions and actions can influence the crypto conversation, the SEC’s decisions and regulatory frameworks are ultimately based on legal and policy considerations, not individual endorsements. Potential Benefits and Challenges of Crypto-SEC Engagement Let’s summarize the potential upsides and downsides of increased interaction between cryptocurrency entities and regulatory bodies like the SEC, particularly concerning data and system access: Benefits Challenges Improved regulatory clarity for crypto projects Enhanced digital asset compliance More collaborative and informed crypto regulation development Reduced misunderstandings and improved communication Potential for tailored and effective regulatory frameworks Risk of overreach or excessive regulatory influence Concerns about data security and privacy of SEC data Potential for uneven access or preferential treatment Complexity and bureaucratic hurdles in establishing effective liaison Balancing innovation with regulatory oversight remains a delicate act Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? While the ‘Dogecoin accessing SEC systems’ headline might be a humorous exaggeration, the underlying theme is significant. It points to the evolving relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory bodies. Here’s what crypto investors and enthusiasts should consider: Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: Keep track of news and updates related to crypto regulation, not just in the U.S., but globally. Regulatory changes can significantly impact market dynamics and project viability. Understand Compliance Efforts: Pay attention to how different crypto projects are approaching regulatory compliance. Projects that proactively engage with regulators and prioritize compliance may be better positioned for long-term success. Be Realistic About ‘Access’: Don’t expect unfettered access to SEC systems for any cryptocurrency. Any interaction will be carefully controlled and limited. Focus on the broader message of potential dialogue and collaboration. Monitor SEC Communications: Keep an eye on official SEC announcements and statements related to cryptocurrency regulation. These are the most reliable sources of information. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Crypto-Regulatory Landscape The notion of Dogecoin directly accessing SEC systems is likely a playful, attention-grabbing way to highlight the increasing intersection of cryptocurrency and regulation. While the literal interpretation is improbable, the underlying message is clear: the crypto industry and regulatory bodies are increasingly engaging with each other. This evolving relationship, marked by discussions around data, compliance, and framework development, will be crucial in shaping the future of digital assets. As the crypto landscape matures, expect to see more dialogue, more collaboration, and hopefully, more clarity in the regulatory space. Whether it’s Dogecoin leading the charge or not, the conversation around Dogecoin SEC access and broader crypto regulation is undoubtedly gaining momentum.

Resistance: $0.7531 – A breakout here could fuel a surge toward $0.80. With ADA up 6.60% in the past week, it’s clear buyers are stepping in. However, failure to reclaim resistance could bring fresh selling pressure. Weekly Timeframe: Support: $0.70 – A pivotal level defining market sentiment. Resistance: $0.77 – Conquering this could lead to a broader uptrend. With Bollinger Bands tightening, volatility is brewing. Expect fireworks soon. Monthly Timeframe: Support: $0.5706 – Losing this could send ADA into deeper bearish waters. Resistance: $1.17 – A long-term breakout target for patient investors.

This week’s highlights include the groundbreaking decision of Bitso to launch its peso-pegged Stablecoin in Mexico. This happens as the banking sector embraces blockchain technology in Latin America. Bitso Business, a part of the Mexican cryptocurrency exchange Bitso, is planning to create a stablecoin linked to the Mexican peso on the Layer 2 Ethereum network called Arbitrum. A report from Cointelegraph shows that the new stablecoin, MXNB, will be issued and controlled by Juno, Bitso’s newly formed company. According to a statement issued by Bitso Business, MXNB will be fully backed by Mexican pesos on a one-to-one basis, providing user stability and reliability. Ben Reid, Bitso Business’s head of stablecoins, stated that MXNB’s principal use case is to ease international investment and trade within Latin American markets. He underlined that the stablecoin would allow firms to function in a “more efficient” manner than traditional financial infrastructure, which frequently offers considerable monetary issues. With obstacles such as high middleman charges and slow transaction times, MXNB intends to simplify cross-border payments for multinational firms looking to service customers in new countries. The rise of stablecoins in Mexico, combined with a favorable remittance environment, has heightened interest in cryptocurrencies. According to Chainalysis, Mexico is a “key country to watch” for cryptocurrency-based remittances, with an annual receipt of around $61 billion, largely from the US. This trend is reinforced by increased adoption rates of stablecoins, as indicated by a 9% increase in stablecoin purchases on Bitso’s exchange, driven by local users seeking reliable stores of value in the face of significant inflation and currency devaluation. Blockchain and tokenization reshape LATAM’s financial landscape During Fintech Americas Miami 2025, experts from Bitso, Koibanx, and Banco Nación (Argentina) emphasized the advancements of blockchain and tokenization in the traditional financial system, enhancing efficiency and financial inclusion across the region. According to Cointelegraph , representatives illustrated how these technologies are revolutionizing various processes, from remittance transfers to investment access through asset tokenization. Leo Elduayen, CEO of Koibanx, pointed out that regulatory frameworks are beginning to encompass the tokenization of financial securities, marking a pivotal step towards democratizing capital markets. The debate also focused on the growing relevance of blockchain in remittances and international payments. Bitso’s strategic alliances director, Nano Rodríguez, reported that stablecoins and blockchain technology are already used in 10% of remittances between the US and Mexico, possibly accounting for over $64 billion in transaction volume. Argentina’s thirst for real-time, decentralized financial operations is demonstrated by the $98 billion in bitcoin transactions performed in 2023, which exceeds the total value of the country’s imported goods. With banks such as Macro and Mercantil incorporating blockchain solutions for payment processing, it is clear that traditional banks are developing to play a larger role in bitcoin adoption. Guatemala proposes to transform landfills into Bitcoin data centers The Blockchain Association of Guatemala has offered a novel method for addressing landfill environmental issues: transform them into Bitcoin data centers. This project attempts to address two major issues : limited space and the risk of fires at garbage disposal sites. As cities expand, garbage creation grows dramatically, posing operational capacity difficulties for landfills and necessitating the urgent need for new disposal sites. Without proper solutions, many communities may confront waste management challenges in the coming years. The group contends that locating Bitcoin data centers in landfills could be a novel solution for addressing both trash management and energy challenges. Bitcoin data centers undertake the sophisticated calculations required to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network, which mandates the use of renewable, continuous, and low-cost energy sources. This concept, by exploiting existing trash sites, not only aims to improve garbage disposal efficiency but also supports the use of renewable energy in the developing bitcoin sector.

42576304,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144550,1743239455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Thailand SEC Files Shocking Legal Action Against OKX Crypto Exchange,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/thailand-sec-okx-crypto-exchange/,"In a significant move that sends ripples across the cryptocurrency landscape, Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has initiated legal action against Aux Cayes FinTech, the entity operating the popular crypto exchange OKX. This development marks a critical juncture in the ongoing global debate about digital asset regulation and the operational compliance of crypto platforms. Are you concerned about the implications for the future of crypto trading in Thailand? Let’s dive into the details of this breaking story. Why is the Thailand SEC Taking Action Against OKX? The core issue at hand is the alleged operation of an unlicensed exchange by OKX within Thailand’s jurisdiction. According to the official statement from the Thailand SEC, criminal charges have been filed against Aux Cayes FinTech and nine individuals. The crux of the accusation lies in the violation of the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses of 2018. This decree mandates that any entity providing digital asset trading services within Thailand must possess the necessary license from the SEC. Here’s a breakdown of the key allegations: Unlicensed Operation: OKX is accused of providing crypto exchange services without obtaining the required license from the Thailand SEC. Violation of Emergency Decree: The SEC alleges that OKX’s operations contravene the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses (2018). Service Provision Date: The investigation pinpointed October 15, 2021, as the date when OKX allegedly began offering digital asset trading services through its online platform. Transaction Fees: OKX reportedly charged a 0.1% transaction fee for trades conducted on its platform. Extensive Promotion: The SEC highlighted OKX’s aggressive promotional activities across various social media channels including Telegram, X (formerly Twitter), and Line OpenChat groups, aimed at attracting Thai users. What are the Potential Ramifications of Operating an Unlicensed Exchange in Thailand? Operating a crypto exchange without proper authorization in Thailand carries significant legal and financial risks. The Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses is designed to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the financial market. Violations can lead to severe penalties, including criminal charges and substantial fines. Consider the potential consequences: Consequence Description Criminal Charges Individuals involved in operating an unlicensed exchange can face criminal prosecution, potentially leading to imprisonment. Financial Penalties Significant fines can be imposed on the operating entity and individuals, potentially amounting to several times the revenue generated from the illegal operations. Reputational Damage Legal action and negative publicity can severely damage the reputation of the exchange, eroding user trust and future business prospects. Operational Disruption Regulatory crackdowns can lead to forced cessation of operations in Thailand, impacting users and the exchange’s global strategy. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Regulation Landscape? This legal action by the Thailand SEC is not an isolated event. It reflects a global trend of increasing scrutiny and stricter digital asset regulation . Governments worldwide are grappling with how to oversee the rapidly evolving crypto market, balancing innovation with investor protection and financial stability. Here’s what this case highlights about the current regulatory environment: Growing Regulatory Scrutiny: Regulators globally are intensifying their oversight of crypto exchanges and digital asset service providers. Emphasis on Licensing: The need for proper licensing and authorization is becoming a non-negotiable aspect of operating a crypto business legally. Investor Protection: Actions like this underscore the commitment of regulatory bodies to protect investors from potential risks associated with unregulated crypto platforms. Global Regulatory Coordination: While regulations vary across jurisdictions, there’s a growing trend towards international cooperation and information sharing among regulators to address cross-border crypto activities. Clarity and Compliance: This case serves as a stark reminder for crypto businesses to prioritize regulatory compliance and seek clarity on operational requirements in each jurisdiction they operate in. What Does This Mean for OKX and its Users? For OKX, this legal action presents a significant challenge in its expansion strategy and operations within Thailand. The immediate implications are primarily legal and reputational. The exchange will need to respond to the charges, engage with the Thailand SEC, and potentially adjust its operational model to comply with local regulations. For users of OKX in Thailand, the situation introduces uncertainty. While the exchange remains operational for now, the unlicensed exchange allegations and subsequent legal proceedings could lead to: Potential Service Disruptions: There’s a possibility of regulatory orders that could disrupt or halt OKX’s services in Thailand. Increased Scrutiny: Users might face increased scrutiny or need to verify their accounts further as a result of the regulatory spotlight on the exchange. Shifting Market Dynamics: The incident could prompt users to reconsider their choice of exchanges, potentially shifting market share towards licensed platforms. Importance of Due Diligence: It highlights the importance for users to conduct due diligence on the regulatory compliance status of the exchanges they use. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Evolving Crypto Regulation Landscape The Thailand SEC’s action against OKX offers valuable lessons for both crypto businesses and users as the digital asset regulation landscape continues to evolve. For Crypto Businesses: Prioritize Compliance: Regulatory compliance should be a top priority. Engage with legal experts to understand and adhere to the specific regulations in each jurisdiction of operation. Seek Clarity: Proactively seek clarification from regulatory bodies on licensing requirements and operational guidelines. Transparency is Key: Maintain transparency in operations and communications with regulators and users. Risk Assessment: Conduct thorough risk assessments to identify and mitigate regulatory risks associated with operating in different jurisdictions. For Crypto Users: Verify Exchange Licenses: Before using a crypto exchange , check if it is properly licensed and regulated in your jurisdiction. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in the crypto space, particularly in your country of residence. Diversify Platforms: Consider diversifying your holdings across multiple regulated platforms to mitigate risks associated with regulatory actions against a single exchange. Understand Risks: Be aware of the risks associated with using unregulated or offshore exchanges. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Crypto World The Thailand SEC’s shocking move against OKX serves as a potent reminder of the increasing seriousness with which regulators are approaching digital asset regulation . For crypto exchanges , the message is clear: operating without a license is no longer a viable option. For users, it underscores the critical need for vigilance and informed decision-making in the rapidly evolving crypto market. As regulatory frameworks mature globally, expect to see more such enforcement actions aimed at ensuring compliance and safeguarding investor interests. This is not just about Thailand; it’s a bellwether for the future of crypto regulation worldwide.

XRP poised for growth despite recent dip Over the past week, XRP’s price has dipped by 6.77%, fluctuating between $2.25 and $2.61. This slight decline may concern some, but the coin’s overall trend remains promising. In the last month, XRP’s price has increased by 4.02%. More notably, over the past six months, it has skyrocketed by 303.38%. This significant growth shows strong market interest and potential for further gains. The nearest support level is at $2.05. If the price stays above this, it could provide a base for a rebound. The key resistance level is at $2.79. Breaking through this point could lead to substantial upward movement. Given these factors, XRP may be set to rise from its current range. A move to the resistance level would be an increase of about 15% from current prices. Traders are watching to see if XRP can continue its upward momentum. Solana’s price teeters between support and resistance levels Solana (SOL) is currently priced between $124.50 and $138.79. Over the past week, the coin has seen a modest increase of 2.61%, hinting at potential upward movement. However, looking at broader time frames, Solana’s price has decreased by 2.33% over the past month and 11.92% over the past six months. This downward trend indicates ongoing bearish pressure in the market. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level at $145. A breakout above this level could lead to further gains. Yet, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 44.32, the momentum appears weak, suggesting that the price may struggle to surpass this resistance. On the downside, the nearest support is at $116.07. If the price fails to move higher, it could decline toward this support level, representing a potential decrease of about 10% from the current price range. Based on the data, Solana’s price may be more likely to fall in the near term unless buying pressure increases. Conclusion While established cryptocurrencies like XRP and Solana command attention, their short-term potential appears limited compared to emerging projects. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a standout contender, harnessing true artificial intelligence to maximize profits in the dynamic meme coin market. Codename:Pepe crypto employs advanced AI to identify promising memecoins, predict market trends, and provide exclusive trading signals. It offers automated trading capabilities and grants holders access to a top-secret DAO for strategic collaboration. With a capped supply and community-driven growth, this crypto aims to replicate the impressive gains of its predecessors, presenting a compelling opportunity for investors seeking significant returns.

According to blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain, the whale’s losses have ballooned to nearly $16 million on his TRUMP memecoin trades this month. “This whale sold 743,947 TRUMP ($7.92 million) at $10.66 [Friday] – taking another $3.3 million loss on TRUMP! He only profited on his first TRUMP trade. The next three were all losses, bringing his total loss to $15.7 million.” Earlier this month, Lookonchain noticed that the same whale at first made nearly $12 million on his initial TRUMP trade, before suffering the large losses. “This whale made $11.82 million on his first TRUMP trade, lost $24.35 million on the second, and took another $201,000 loss on the third! Now, he’s back-spending $11.28 million to buy 777,684 TRUMP at $14.50. Will he turn a profit this time?” Other whales are also looking at losses on their recent TRUMP trades. One deep-pocketed investor sold TRUMP for a loss of $207,000 this week after spending $5 million worth of Circle’s stablecoin, USDC, to accumulate the memecoin right after President Donald Trump posted “I LOVE TRUMP” on his social media platform Truth Social, according to Lookonchain. President Trump launched the memecoin in January, just days before his inauguration. TRUMP is trading for $10.27 at time of writing, down 8.1% in the last 24 hours.

42576715,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702178,1743239752,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42576715.jpeg,Maple CEO brings Wall Street-style institutional lending on-chain with Bitcoin-backed loans,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/maple-ceo-pioneers-btc-backed-lending/,"Sid Powell, CEO and co-founder of Maple, is bringing an inspired Wall Street lending model to the crypto sphere, using Bitcoin as the basis. His company is pioneering a new way to conduct institutional lending where it combines the best of traditional finance with the velocity and liquidity of a blockchain network. In a recent interview with TheStreet Roundtable , Powell described Maple’s innovative approach as “asset-backed lending on-chain.” The concept has already piqued the interest of high-net-worth individuals and fixed-income investors seeking reliable returns in the digital asset space. Powell pushes to establish Bitcoin as the backbone of global lending Maple lends to institutions such as trading firms and hedge funds, using cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, as collateral. Borrowers receive stablecoins directly into their wallets, while the firm holds the collateral in liquid digital assets. Afterwards, investors earn a yield on those loans, just as they would in traditional credit markets. In addition, Powell claimed that Maple provided more enticing over-collateralized loans with 30-day redemption periods. Contrast that with private credit markets, where loans are frequently unsecured and locked for years. He continued that anybody who had worked with pledged securities or margin lending would understand that the main benefit of cryptocurrencies is liquidity. Moreover, Powell stated that it takes six months to sell a house but only a few hours to sell a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin. Therefore, it is concluded that if the loan does not work out, he could sell his digital assets in many places. Maple implements a strategy to curb cryptocurrency risks The 2022 collapse of several crypto lenders, such as BlockFi, has heightened concerns about risk management in the sector. Powell acknowledges these challenges and insists that Maple has built-in safeguards to mitigate them. To solve this, Maple provides yields on par with high-yield credit but with transparent margin policies and a safety net of liquid collateral through institutional-grade custodians such as BitGo. “We spend a lot of time explaining how we manage margins,” Powell observed. “If Bitcoin drops in price, how long do we wait before selling the asset? How long do we give someone to post more collateral or pay the loan?” It is noteworthy that Powell was dedicated to achieving goals beyond this one. For him, accomplishing this objective was the first move to face more established financial giants like Apollo or Ares. Thus, it might be possible to work with companies like J.P. Morgan to offer standardized Bitcoin-backed securities to pension funds and combine the speed of cryptocurrencies with the stability of traditional finance. Maple launches the Lend + Long product to achieve BTC growth without downside exposure According to reports published on January 27, decentralized lending platform Maple Finance introduced an on-chain structured yield product designed to give financial institutions exposure to Bitcoin. Dubbed Lend + Long , the product was aimed at yield funds, corporate treasuries, and institutional investors, allowing them to gain exposure to Bitcoin price appreciation without direct exposure to the downside. According to Sid Powell, institutional investors have been seeking a way to gain all the upside of Bitcoin exposure but don’t want the stress of the volatility that comes with it. Lend + Long offered structured exposure to Bitcoin without having to own the underlying asset. The product worked by buying Bitcoin call options and accruing yield from a high-yield liquidity pool run by Maple itself. Maple Finance manages several lending pools tailored to different risk appetites. For example, its Maple High Yield Secured Pool accepts a wide range of low market cap risky altcoins as collateral while paying lenders higher interest rates. On the other hand, its Blue-Chip Secured Pool accepts only Bitcoin and Ether as collateral, making for a much more risk-averse lending ecosystem. To minimize risk, all loans in Maple’s high-yield, on-chain pool are over-collateralized, requiring borrowers to collateralize more than they borrow. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

That comes after the company filed for insolvency in January 2024. It applied for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after its $40 billion empire fell in 2022. As part of its closure, Terraform Labs introduced a crypto loss claims portal. The online portal allows creditors to claim refunds from losses that resulted from the Terra USD debacle and subsequent events. According to the blog : The Crypto Loss Claims Portal, managed by Kroll Restructuring Administration LLC, will open on 31 March 2025 at claims.terra.money to submit Crypto Loss Claims. Meanwhile, the online portal will be open until 30 April 2025, with claims that miss the deadline declared void. How to claim? Proving asset ownership is key for creditors to claim reimbursements. That includes verifying wallet addresses for the crypto holdings and API keys for assets on CEXs. Meanwhile, eligible users should sign up on claims.terra.money and submit the essential supporting documentation. Claimants will submit the required documents through the online portal. The process targets fairness and transparency to refund creditors who endured losses because of Terraform Labs’ collapse. The Wind Down Trust will examine and verify the submitted claims. The platform will notify creditors about the claim’s status through the portal within three months. The notification will clarify the claim amount or request additional time for review. Terraform confirmed it will refund creditors between $185M and $442M as part of its restructuring plans. Meanwhile, the Online Portal represents a key milestone for stakeholders and investors who endured losses due to Terraform’s debacle. The strategic claim process allows affected participants to enjoy refunds and possibly recover from incurred losses. LUNA price action Terra’s token lost 9% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.1926. The surged trading volume reflects increased market activity as prices dip. Chart by Coinmarketcap With Terraform Labs’ claim portal launching next week, enthusiasts will watch LUNA’s reactions in April and beyond. Traders should brace for speculative volatility as participants seek money-making opportunities during the ecosystem developments. LUNA’s price could soar if Terraform adopts a structured disbursement plan or an optimistic legal solution. Also, the claims portal could bolster investor confidence if it proves reliable and transparent, supporting price actions. On the other hand, the claims period could trigger renewed scrutiny. That could revive investor worries about Terra’s financial and legal risks. Negative sentiment will likely repel investors, hindering LUNA’s potential recoveries. Moreover, claimants may dump their LUNA holdings to avoid devaluation, catalyzing selling pressure on the altcoin. Furthermore, broad market developments could influence LUNA’s performance. Solid recoveries could help stabilize the altcoin, while bearish trends will weaken it.

The broader market, however, recovered to levels last seen at the start of the month. As of late Asian trading hours on Friday, it hovered around $2.95 trillion. Market sentiment improved, recovering towards neutral levels, up 13 points from the previous week. Altcoin traders entered the weekend with modest gains, with a handful of prominent projects standing out in terms of weekly gains. Why is Bitcoin down this week? Bitcoin traders entered this week with cautious optimism as inflation concerns cooled off. However, by the end of the week, fresh bearish pressure prevented the flagship crypto from gaining footing above the $85 support level. The decline followed US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on all imported automobiles, set to take effect on April 2. The move weighed on risk assets across the board, with Bitcoin falling in tandem with US equities as the correlation between the two markets continued to rise. Adding to market pressure, US inflation data released on March 28 showed stronger-than-expected results. While headline PCE numbers aligned with forecasts at 0.3% month-on-month and 2.5% year-on-year, core PCE figures came in 0.1% higher than expected, warning of persistent inflationary pressures. By the end of the week, BTC seemed to have lost momentum as it moved to visit multi-week lows. Will Bitcoin go up? Analysts remained sceptical about the broader crypto market, noting that Bitcoin’s recent stability above $80,000 hasn’t yet confirmed a recovery. Veteran trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted the “trend remains to be upwards” for BTC, but admitted it’s beginning to “look slightly less good.” In a recent X post, he warned that a break below $84,000 may “see a test at $78–80K and perhaps lower” before the price recovers. At press time, Bitcoin was quickly approaching those levels. Fellow trader AlphaBTC echoed that caution, emphasising that Bitcoin needs to hold above the monthly open at $84,300, a key level that Bitcoin “must hold” to avoid ending the month in the red. According to the analyst, Bitcoin might be drifting toward that level and into “max pain” territory, referring to the Friday March options expiry, which could add further pressure before the month wraps up. More bearish predictions came from well-followed market commentator Ted Pillows, who predicted a drop towards $74,000 if BTC fails to make a weekly close above $89,000. On the weekly chart, Bitcoin had formed a falling wedge pattern, the analyst noted in a March 28 X post. See below. Source: Ted Pillows on X Yet the bull run isn’t over just yet, according to analysts at CryptoQuant. In a recent Quicktake blog, they pointed to four on-chain metrics that are currently in flux, showing signs of short-term turbulence, but not signalling a cycle top. These include the MVRV ratio, NUPL, and the Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP), which turned bearish back in February. Contributor Burak Kesmeci noted that while “Bitcoin is experiencing significant turbulence,” none of the data points suggest things have overheated. For sentiment to shift, he added, the IFP needs to climb back above its 90-day simple moving average. Source: CryptoQuant As of the last check on Friday at 4 p.m. GMT, Bitcoin was trading at $84,264, showing no gains on the weekly timeframe. Altcoin market recovers The total altcoin market hit a weekly high of $1.25 trillion before receding to $1.21 trillion on late Friday. Bitcoin remained the dominating force in the market with the altcoin season index at 17, down four points from the week before. Although the vast majority of the top 99 altcoins had failed to recover from last week’s losses, the top gainers of the week all posted double-digit gains: Cronos Cronos (CRO) shot up 37% over the past week, exchanging hands at $0.106 when writing, while its market cap stood at $2.83 billion. Trading activity also picked up big time, going from $67 million to $140 million during the same period. Source: CoinMarketCap Most of this week’s gains came from reports that Trump Media, the parent company of Truth Social, is partnering with Crypto.com to launch a series of exchange-traded funds under the Truth.Fi brand, including one featuring a basket of cryptocurrencies like CRO and Bitcoin. The altcoin also got a big boost after the US securities regulator reportedly dropped its investigation into the Crypto.com exchange. Additionally, Cronos recently rolled out its v26 mainnet upgrade, introducing new features along with better cross-chain support with ZK rollups. Berachain Berachain (BERA) gained 28.7% over the previous week as its market cap soared to $230 million. Its daily trading volume stood at $230.2 million as of press time. Source: CoinMarketCap Berachain is gaining strong momentum as its DeFi ecosystem continues to grow. According to DeFiLlama, the network’s total value locked surged to a record high of $3.495 billion yesterday, a significant rise from the year-to-date low of $770 million. The BERA token is also climbing, partly because the stablecoin market cap on the network has grown to over $1.3 billion. On top of that, BERA’s price got another boost thanks to the launch of “proof of liquidity”, a new feature that helps make the network more decentralized while letting users earn rewards. Four Over the past week, Four (FORM) rallied 27% to trade at $2.3 per coin at the time of writing. Its market cap stood at $63.14 million, while its daily trading volume was 37% higher over the past day at $63.17 million. Source: CoinMarketCap While no immediate drivers fueling this rally could be identified at the time of writing, the project recently completed its rebranding from BinaryX (BNX), with its token symbol updated to FORM. Four has also been actively expanding its ecosystem, integrating various DeFi, GameFi, and meme-related projects. Further, the altcoin’s listing on prominent exchanges like Binance, KuCoin and Gate.io earlier in the week has also helped boost its visibility and attract more traders.

42576702,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144549,1743240051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Ethereum Flashes Bearish Signals – What Crypto Traders Need to Know Now,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-bearish-signals-crypto-analysis/,"Is the Ethereum bull run losing steam? Recent analysis of Ethereum’s derivatives market paints a concerning picture for investors. Key indicators from futures and options markets are flashing Ethereum bearish signals , suggesting that the recent price dip might not be over yet. Let’s break down what these signals mean for ETH and the broader crypto market. Decoding Ethereum Bearish Signals : Futures Market Insights One of the primary indicators of market sentiment is the futures premium. Think of it as a gauge of optimism – or pessimism – among traders. A healthy futures market, indicative of bullish sentiment, usually shows a premium of 5% to 10%. This premium reflects the additional cost traders are willing to pay for future contracts, anticipating price increases. However, when this premium shrinks, it can signal waning confidence. According to data from crypto analytics platform Laevitas, as highlighted by Cointelegraph, the ETH Futures Premium has alarmingly dropped to around 2% since March 8th. This significant decrease from the neutral 5-10% range points towards a considerable weakening in demand for long positions. In simpler terms, fewer traders are betting on Ethereum’s price going up in the future, a clear Ethereum bearish signal . Key Takeaway: Falling Futures Premium = Cooling Bullishness ETH Options Skew : A Deeper Dive into Derivatives Sentiment Beyond futures, the options market provides another crucial lens for understanding market sentiment. The ETH Options Skew , specifically the 1-month options 25% delta skew, is a sophisticated metric that measures the relative cost of put (sell) options compared to call (buy) options. It essentially tells us whether traders are more inclined to protect against downside risk (buying puts) or bet on upside potential (buying calls). Here’s a simple breakdown: Low Skew (Below 6%): Implies traders are more bullish or neutral, with call options being relatively more expensive or equally priced to put options. High Skew (Above 6%): Suggests increasing bearish sentiment. Put options become more expensive than call options as traders seek downside protection. Laevitas data reveals that the ETH 1-month options 25% delta skew has risen to 7%. Historically, a skew above 6% is considered a strong Ethereum bearish signal . This indicates that traders are increasingly expecting a potential downtrend, and are paying a premium for put options to hedge against price drops. This heightened demand for downside protection further reinforces the bearish outlook. Key Takeaway: Rising Options Skew = Growing Bearish Expectations Crypto Market Analysis : Is $1,800 Support the Last Stand for ETH? Combining the insights from both futures and options markets, the overall picture for Ethereum appears increasingly precarious. The derivatives market is currently offering little reassurance that ETH’s recent price correction has bottomed out. Investors are now nervously eyeing the $1,800 support level, questioning its resilience in the face of mounting Ethereum bearish signals . What does this mean for you? Increased Volatility: Expect potential price swings as market sentiment remains uncertain. Risk Management is Key: Consider implementing robust risk management strategies to protect your portfolio. Monitor Support Levels: Keep a close watch on the $1,800 support level. A decisive break below this could trigger further downside. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market indicators and news updates to stay ahead of potential market shifts. Navigating the Ethereum Price Drop : What’s Next? While these indicators point towards a bearish short-term outlook, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile and sentiment can shift rapidly. This Ethereum price drop could be a temporary correction within a larger uptrend. However, the confluence of bearish signals from both futures and options markets warrants caution. For traders and investors, the current market conditions emphasize the importance of: Due Diligence: Conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio to mitigate risk. Patience: Avoid impulsive reactions based on short-term market fluctuations. Long-term perspectives often prevail in the crypto space. In conclusion, the analysis of ETH futures premium and ETH options skew presents a compelling case for Ethereum bearish signals . While the future remains uncertain, these indicators serve as a valuable crypto market analysis tool, urging investors to proceed with caution and be prepared for potential further Ethereum price drop . Staying informed and adaptable is paramount in navigating these turbulent market conditions.

Stage 3 Now Sold Out with $5,600,000 Raised",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-mutuum-finance-mutm-the-most-successful-presale-in-2025-stage-3-now-sold-out-with-5600000-raised/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) received widespread market attention after its presale phases cleared out at rapid pace and collected $5.6 million from more than 7,300 investors. The last phase (III) of the project concluded simultaneously even though Phase 4 exists currently at $0.025 per token. The upcoming phase will cause a 20% price rise so the token value reaches $0.03. The initial stage of advantages from being the first to adopt will help pioneers in their financial growth as expert analysts predict substantial earnings when launch occurs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates new prospects for DeFi (decentralized finance) utility-driven investing by developing an autonomous lending system that generates steady demand flow. Presale Momentum Accelerates Phase 4 shows strong signs of running out of tokens ahead of what could become another price increase. Investors acquiring MUTM tokens for $0.025 can secure future profits equivalent to 140% since the exchange listing value of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will start at $0.06. Each presale supply limitation triggers an increase in demand according to the tokenomics system. Following their analysis of the platform’s revenue-based token buyback operations analysts predict increasing token value. Professional market predictors forecast that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will exceed its initial listing price to reach $1.50 during the next few months thus creating exceptional returns from the presale purchase. The prospective $1,000 investment holds potential to evolve into more than $60K during launch time which provides a compelling motivation for both retail investors as well as institutional stakeholders. Mechanics Driving Demand Unlike many speculative counterparts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings value to the table as a real, utility-first financial ecosystem. Users can deposit ETH, DAI, etc. and mint mtTokens that accrue interest over time. Overcollateralized loans provide liquidity to borrowers while ensuring systemic stability. As a dual-ended platform, this model generates consistent platform revenues, part of which goes towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) buybacks. Staking rewards and transaction fees pay back into the ecosystem, establishing a reinforcing cycle of scarcity and rewards. A P2P lending feature on the way will allow users to negotiate custom terms for niche assets like meme coins, expanding the ecosystem’s popularity. Prioritizing Security & Transparency Amid surging presale interest, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to finalize a smart contract audit with CertiK, a pivotal step that is set to strengthen investor confidence. The results will be published through official channels, confirming the protocol’s resistance to exploits. This scrutiny dovetails with the project’s careful methodology when it comes to token distribution, where reserves are set aside for liquidity mining, partnerships and development. Mutuum’s focus on audit-backed security and systematic growth contrasts with hype-driven projects, reflecting the kind of institutional-grade due diligence that is often absent in the sometimes-erratic world of DeFi. Timing the Opportunity Phase 4’s $0.025 entry window closes by the day, with the upcoming price increase on course to wipe out the discounts available today. Those delay would forfeit not only the immediate 20 percent gain between phases but potential exponential growth post listing. Historical examples in DeFi show how early investors in audited, utility-focused projects tend to reap disproportionate benefits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a passing fancy — its lending infrastructure, revenue mechanics and tokenomics combine as a formula for perpetual significance. The relevant question isn’t whether Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be the princely narrative of 2025’s presale summaries, but how high it could fly once exchanges hold the keys to its capacities. As Phase 4 fills up fast, the opportunity to embrace this ascendant endeavor is drying up. Head to Mutuum Finance’s official platform to claim some tokens before the next wave of growth reopens access.

While this may appear a sign of strength, the broader sentiment around SOL remains cautious. Analysts are warning that the latest surge in price could be nothing more than a bull trap, setting the stage for further downside. Despite the recent bounce, price action continues to show weakness, with lower highs forming on multiple timeframes — a classic sign of bearish continuation. Related Reading: XRP Must Break Above $3 To Invalidate Bearish Pattern And Flip Bullish – Analyst The overall crypto market remains under pressure, and many investors fear that a deeper bear market could be unfolding. Macroeconomic uncertainty, combined with rising risk-off sentiment, has added to the concern. As a result, confidence among retail and institutional investors is fragile. Some are exiting positions, while others are choosing to hold through the volatility, sitting on unrealized losses in hopes of a long-term recovery. With SOL struggling to establish clear momentum, analysts believe the path of least resistance remains to the downside unless bulls can reclaim higher levels with strong volume. A failure to maintain the $150 level could confirm bearish continuation and open the door for a move toward lower support zones. Until buyers return with conviction, Solana remains in a precarious position — caught between the fading momentum of a short-lived rally and the growing weight of market uncertainty. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether SOL can recover or if more pain lies ahead. Solana Key Test As Bearish Sentiment Grows Solana price action shows signs of weakness as bulls struggle to build momentum. The recent market surge brought temporary relief to altcoins, but many analysts warn it may have been a bull trap — a short-lived rally within a larger downtrend. With volatility rising again, Solana is now facing a critical test that could define its short-term direction. Investor sentiment remains divided. Some fear a deeper bear market is on the horizon, pointing to macroeconomic instability, rising interest rates, and broader risk-off sentiment. Others continue to hold through unrealized losses, hoping for a long-term recovery despite mounting uncertainty. As SOL trades in this fragile zone, conviction remains low, and every move is being closely watched. Runefelt highlighted a significant technical risk: if Solana’s current ascending support fails, the token could drop to as low as $113. This support line has so far held up against sell pressure, but repeated tests without a clear bounce raise the risk of a breakdown. A drop to $113 would mark a major correction and erase much of the gains made earlier in the year. Until bulls can reclaim higher resistance levels and confirm a breakout, the dominant trend remains bearish. Analysts are warning that unless Solana can hold its current structure, the next leg down could come quickly. With the market on edge and momentum fading, Solana’s price action over the coming days will be crucial in determining whether the asset can stabilize — or if further declines are ahead. Related Reading: Avalanche 12-Hour TD Sequential Flashes Sell Signal After Nailing 50% Rally – Details Bulls Aim To Reclaim Momentum Solana (SOL) is trading at $128 after two consecutive days of selling pressure, which erased a portion of its recent gains and pushed the asset back below key resistance levels. The market’s sudden shift in sentiment has left bulls on the defensive, with price action weakening across the board. For SOL to regain momentum and confirm a bullish reversal, reclaiming the $180 level in the coming days is essential. The $180 zone has acted as a significant resistance point during previous rallies, and a decisive move above it would likely trigger renewed buying interest and open the door to a broader recovery. Without this breakout, however, the outlook remains fragile. If bulls fail to push prices higher and reclaim critical levels, Solana risks falling deeper into bearish territory. Continued weakness could lead to another leg down, as traders eye lower support zones and brace for a potential bearish surge. Related Reading: Ethereum Fails To Break $2,100 Resistance – Growing Downside Risk? Market conditions remain volatile, and macro uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on risk assets. For now, SOL’s short-term future hinges on whether buyers can step in soon and drive a move back above the $150–$180 range to avoid a steeper decline.

Panama is making waves in Latin America with a groundbreaking draft bill designed to regulate cryptocurrencies and propel the growth of blockchain services. Could this move position Panama as the next big fintech hub in the region? Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating development. Panama Embraces Cryptocurrency Regulation: A Bold New Era Panama is not just dipping its toes into the crypto world; it’s diving in headfirst! The nation has officially unveiled a comprehensive draft bill with the ambitious goal of establishing clear legal frameworks for digital assets. This isn’t just about keeping up with the times; it’s about strategically positioning Panama as a fintech leader in Latin America. The bill, as reported by CryptoSlate, mandates licensing for virtual asset service providers and sets the stage for widespread cryptocurrency regulation within the country. What Does Panama’s Draft Bill Actually Do? This isn’t just another piece of legislation; it’s a fundamental shift in how Panama views and interacts with digital assets .

This technical formation is often considered a bearish reversal signal, suggesting that the asset could experience a significant price drop if it fails to hold key support levels. The chart by Martinez illustrates the classic structure of the head-and-shoulders pattern. The critical support level, the neckline, is around $2.05. If XRP breaks below this level, it may decline toward lower prices, possibly below $1.50. If $XRP can break above $3, it would invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially flipping the outlook bullish. pic.twitter.com/B6mrtXm1TS — Ali (@ali_charts) March 28, 2025 Can XRP Invalidate the Bearish Pattern? While the current outlook appears bearish, Martinez noted that an upward breakout could shift sentiment. Specifically, he stated that “if XRP can break above $3, it would invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially flipping the outlook bullish.” A move above this level would disrupt the pattern’s structure and could lead to renewed buying pressure, supporting a continued uptrend. A decisive break above $3 would indicate strong bullish momentum and could attract traders anticipating a reversal. Such a move might also coincide with broader market strength or fundamental developments that drive demand for XRP. Martinez has been tracking this head-and-shoulder pattern for some time now, and without such a breakout, the technical structure remains unfavorable. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Potential Next Move XRP’s price action will largely depend on market conditions and investor sentiment in the coming days. If selling pressure intensifies and the neckline breaks, a bearish continuation could follow. On the other hand, sustained buying pressure and a push above $3 could shift the narrative toward a more optimistic outlook. The digital asset is trading at $2.19 and has experienced a drop of over 7.5% from last week despite news of the SEC dropping its appeal against Ripple. Analysts expect a trend reversal soon, and traders will likely monitor XRP’s price closely for confirmation. However, a breakdown below support would validate the head-and-shoulders pattern’s bearish implications. While a breakout above $3 would challenge this technical setup, the digital asset has not reached this price since its decline in early February , and some in the community are worried that it may not reclaim this level. For now, XRP remains at a critical juncture, with technical signals pointing to a decisive move in either direction.

In a letter sent on March 28 to Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve’s committee chair on supervision and regulation, and Rodney Hood, the acting comptroller of the currency, the senators demanded clarification on how the agencies plan to oversee WLFI and its stablecoin. The letter was signed by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and four other Democrats, who expressed deep concerns over the former president’s financial ties to the project, warning it could compromise regulatory independence. The letter highlighted the timing of the stablecoin’s launch, which coincides with Congress deliberating on the GENIUS Act—a bill that would place stablecoin oversight under the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If passed, the legislation would tighten regulatory scrutiny over issuers like WLFI. Trump’s Executive Order Raises Red Flags Adding to the controversy, the letter pointed to Trump’s February executive order that directed all federal agencies, including financial regulators, to consult with the White House on policy decisions. Critics argue the directive could give the president direct influence over the Fed and OCC’s stablecoin policies, creating what the lawmakers called an “extraordinary conflict of interest.” “The launch of a stablecoin directly tied to a sitting President who stands to benefit financially from the stablecoin’s success presents unprecedented risks to our financial system,” the letter stated. Since its founding in September 2024, WLFI’s operations have remained largely secretive. The company’s website reveals that Trump and his family control 60% of the firm’s equity, raising concerns over whether USD1’s success could directly enrich the former president while his administration shapes crypto regulations. Trump-Backed WLFI’s Rapid Expansion World Liberty Financial has already made significant inroads in the crypto market. According to the firm, it raised $550 million through two public token sales. On March 24, the company launched its USD1 stablecoin on both the BNB Chain and Ethereum. Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., also promoted the stablecoin during a speech at the DC Blockchain Summit on March 26, standing alongside three WLFI co-founders.

Although experts are divided on the likelihood of a swift dismissal, a prevailing view is that the case is unlikely to drag on beyond two months. Recently, an XRP proponent claimed that the SEC would not produce an official announcement on the XRP lawsuit until August 7. However, attorney Marc Fagel quickly debunked the assertion, labelling it as incorrect. XRP Lawsuit Settlement: Is August 7 in Focus? As the community eagerly awaits the XRP lawsuit settlement, there are diverse predictions and opinions on the potential developments. In significant development, Brett, a prominent XRP community member, took to X to assert that the SEC will keep silent on the XRP lawsuit until August 7. He cited a court ruling that supported his claim. His statement read, “Breaking news: SEC Won’t Make Official Announcement on Lawsuit Until August 7.” However, his post sparked controversy, with many criticizing it as outdated information. The community noted that the document was from the previous summer, casting further doubt on its relevance. Significantly, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel criticized the post , calling it “stupid and wrong.” This adds more ambiguity to the credibility of the expert’s words on the SEC’s delay in the XRP lawsuit until August 7. Why the SEC Delays the Ripple Case? In an astounding development, the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped its appeal against Ripple. In response, the platform withdrew its cross-appeal. These significant developments, along with the SEC’s recent dismissal of multiple crypto lawsuits, have fueled anticipations of a quick resolution in the XRP lawsuit. However, driven by certain complexities surrounding the case, there is still a possibility for a potential delay in the Ripple lawsuit’s end. For instance, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett revealed major reasons for the SEC’s delay in the case. She suggested that the agency should ask Judge Torres to remove the injunction, which is different from other cases. When Will the SEC Officially Drop the XRP Lawsuit? Recently, the SEC officially announced the dismissal of multiple lawsuits, including Cumberland, Kraken, and Consensys. This critical development has further sparked anticipations about the legal status of the XRP lawsuit. According to lawyer Fred Rispoli, the Ripple lawsuit would be settled within the next two months. He posited that Ripple has already prepared the required documents for a settlement. This would follow the SEC commission’s vote, anticipated within 30 days.

While most countries are gravitating towards Bitcoin and other technologies, the lack of a mention left Australians with dismay. In the week before the Treasurer’s speech on Tuesday and the traditional Thursday night sequel from opposition leader Peter Dutton, expectations were not high about a change in the budget. Both parties had been talking about the technology industry for a while with topics like how to capitalize on the AI boom, protecting Australians from scams, and cracking down on cybercrime among others. Nevertheless, most of the concerned parties understood that there would be a sense of realism in their pre-election budget . For instance, they needed to talk about things that would sway voters to their side like tax cuts or energy prices. While the expectations were quite low, the budget week still managed to surprise most, while worrying even the most devoted realist in the tech industry. Australia’s parties cuts Bitcoin and other tech in budget One of the core notes to mention is that tech was not a winner in the Labor Party budget. The budget did not exactly make any major cuts in other aspects, so one cannot say it was downright bad. More accurately, the party ignored tech and vaguely mentioned aspects like AI, cybersecurity, quantum, and online safety. In addition, no new spending was allocated to the aspects that were mentioned in the budget. Opposition leader Peter Dutton also followed the same path two days later, albeit with a greater vague mention of tech in his budget. Dutton promised to encourage new areas of the economy, including areas like artificial intelligence (AI), automation, space, cybersecurity, nanotechnology, and biotechnology without a clear explanation of how to achieve it. The biggest complaint about the budgets is the failings in acknowledging artificial intelligence, with none of them discussing how to boost the technology or make it safe for Australians. Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA) chairman John Pane showed his disappointment towards the budget. “Australia remains the last signatory [to the Seoul AI Summit Declaration] to stand up an AI Safety body or regulator,” Pane said. Many were waiting for an update on the AI Safety Institute that the country promised to establish in May 2024, but were left disappointed when it was not mentioned. It is also quite concerning that the country has yet to release its plan for AI regulation, let alone implement it. Minister for Science and Industry Ed Husic mentioned in January that the government was on the verge of rolling out its AI regulation, but has gone quiet on the issue since then. Quantum computing and other sectors also miss out AI was not the only sector that was ignored by the budget, with quantum computing not even seeing as much as a mention. In addition, there was no mention of any spending on the government’s flagship tech policies, the teen social media ban, or the news media bargaining incentive (known as the tech tax). Cybersecurity was only mentioned about previous spending, with $60 million used to help small businesses protect themselves from data breaches. Cyber Director at cybersecurity firm NSB Cyber, Evan Vougdis, showed his dismay towards the budget and its lack of note on cybersecurity. “The Federal Budget for 2025 treats cybersecurity as background noise,” he said. He also added that the government needs to change its approach and take more decisive actions in the sector. Another big loser in tech is the research and development (R&D) space. Mr Husic noted that Australia’s investment in R&D had been plummeting last month, noting that the trend must stop. But the budget released this week showed that the government would wind back tax breaks for R&D by $640 million in the next four years. A spokesperson for Husic also mentioned that the federal government has made core investments in the tech sector, noting the $500 million earmarked for PsiQuantum to build the world’s first quantum computer in Brisbane which was announced last year. “In just the last few weeks, our $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund has invested almost $100m in world-leading Australian tech companies across quantum, AI and cybersecurity,” the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also earmarked the feat the government hopes to achieve in the next five years in the tech sector. “We have spent our first term laying the foundation for a thriving tech sector, setting a target of 1.2 million tech jobs by 2030, establishing first national strategies for robotics and quantum,” the spokesperson added. Funding for key regulators restored after last year’s cuts One of the reliefs in the budget was the restoration of funding for the regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OIAC). The Privacy Commissioner had previously taken action against AI facial recognition company Clearview. The commissioner accused the company of privacy breaches. Actions were also taken against social media firm Meta over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The regulator suffered an $11.1 million cut in the last budget, leading to the loss of 35 full-time staff amid a more targeted approach to enforcement. The current budget restored much of the cut budget, promising to provide $8.7 million in three years to support enforcement actions, $5.3 million to facilitate Digital ID and Identity Verification Service programs, and $2.3 million to carry out oversight of My Health record starting from 2025. Funding for the government’s online safety regulator, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner remained static, with some minor cuts expected to happen in some years to come. While it remains to be seen what both parties will likely sway voters with after their tech snub, the sector and those concerned will be anticipating new funding for the sector during the campaign before the election on May 3. However, after this week, the low expectations are now sinking. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Traders are closely monitoring the price action, which suggests that Dogecoin could rise as much as 450% from current levels. RSI Shows Bullish Divergence on DOGE Recent technical analysis on Dogecoin price reveals a shift in market sentiment. In the hourly chart, the RSI shows a bullish divergence which suggests that the bearish trend is losing steam. This indicates that the DOGE price might regain some relief in the short-term and may possibly work its way out of the current downtrend. As per crypto strategist Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin’s price is finding its bottom, which could lead to a recovery soon. The RSI points toward a shift from bearish pressure to more favorable conditions for buyers. This seems to imply that the DOGE price trend is towards the upside with potential to even test higher resistance levels in the short term. Dogecoin Price Market Structure Shifts to Uptrend According to Trader Tardigrade, Dogecoin’s market structure has transitioned from a downtrend to an uptrend on the daily chart. This shift is characterized by the formation of higher higher highs (HHs) and higher low (HLs), which is commonly used as a pointer of a bullish market. The analyst has identified certain levels that might be crucial for a further continuance of the rally. The major resistance levels consist of $0.178 and $0.164, which have played a significant role in the DOGE/USD pair’s volatility. Therefore, if the Dogecoin price stays above $0.178, the upward trend should persist with increasing chances of making fresh higher highs. However, if the DOGE price falls below $0.178 but remains above $0.164 the trend may remain range bound, thus negating an uprising. Thus, if the price falls below $0.164, it will be a continuation of the downtrend, which would take a lot of effort to retest it. The “Doge Circle” and Potential for a Rally One approach that can be seen in its price change history is a distinct cycle referred to as the “Doge Circle”. This pattern has been apparent in setting important support levels and major up moves in the past. The lower border of the Doge Circle has played a role of providing support for the currency since 2015, where the price has bounced each time. In the prior cycles, DOGE retested $0.0001 in 2015 and 0.0012 in 2020 to embark on fresh rallies that reached all-time high prices. The most recent cycle showed DOGE bouncing back by 26% when it reached the lower limit at $0.1432. These historical movement trends hint at the possibility of DOGE preparing for another surge and potentially new all-time highs as have been observed with previous market trends. #Dogecoin macro chart follows the $Doge Circle pic.twitter.com/Os6scDp1T9 — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) March 27, 2025 Currently, DOGE has exited the oversold zone, and analysts predict that it could rise toward the overbought zone, with a potential price target of $8 to $10. This projection indicates a massive potential upside from the current price, with some estimates suggesting a 4,259% increase. Resistance Levels and Key Price Targets A crypto analyst by the username of Moein Haddadian has pointed out the following levels which Dogecoin price needs to break out as he selectively aims to rally higher. Each of them regards $0.25 as a critical level that needs to be surpassed to continue the upward movement for DOGE. If price rises above the $0.25 level and sustains it, the next major barriers are between $0.30 and $0.334. Haddadian also stresses the need for Dogecoin to remain stably above $0.16. This means that any further closing above this level will mean that the bullish prognosis is still valid. If DOGE price fails to consolidate and defend this level, and falls remains below $0.16, the whole bullish outlook would be deemed invalid. In that case, DOGE can revisit the levels around $0.122 or $0.113.

At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining attention for completely different reasons. The project has completed its third major keynote, revealing plans to raise $600 million. With over $208 million already secured in just ten months, the momentum around BlockDAG continues to grow rapidly, showing increasing support from its growing backers. XRP’s recent surge highlights a price-focused rally, while BlockDAG is concentrating on building a complete and ready-to-use blockchain ecosystem. This comparison brings a clear contrast—short-term price jumps versus long-term project development. And for those seeking substance beyond price action, BlockDAG’s latest keynote made one thing very clear: it’s shaping an economic framework with wide potential. XRP’s Breakout Sparks Hopes of Hitting $3 XRP has moved beyond an important resistance zone, surpassing its 50-day exponential moving average and renewing talks of an upcoming bullish run. Trading volumes have picked up alongside the price, and analysts are now pointing to $2.80 and possibly $3.00 if strength continues. After enduring sluggish momentum and regulatory clouds, this turnaround has added energy to Ripple’s broader efforts, especially among those who anticipate stronger institutional involvement soon. Still, a deeper issue persists—XRP has long struggled with developer activity. Despite Ripple’s continued focus on financial infrastructure, the XRP Ledger still lacks meaningful growth in decentralized apps. Unlike modern Layer-1 chains with rich ecosystems, XRP’s reliance remains tied to enterprise use cases, offering a stark difference from the product-centric development underway at BlockDAG. BlockDAG’s $600M Goal Kicks Off Strong With $208M Already Raised Keynote 3 marks a major step forward for BlockDAG and expands the discussion on what a truly launch-ready Layer-1 looks like. With $208 million already collected and a growing base of 170,000+ holders, the team now targets a $600 million raise. As explained by CEO Antony Turner, the funds will be applied directly to tangible developments—real infrastructure, community growth, and a structured plan for mainnet rollout focused on long-term presence. “We’re not merely constructing a new blockchain—we’re building a fast, scalable platform for this world and beyond,” said Turner during the keynote. Concrete numbers back this direction. More than 750,000 people use the X1 Miner app , 400,000 are active on TG Tap Miner , and over 100,000 members engage across its ambassador and community channels. What began as a simple presale has matured into a deep, adoption-driven initiative. Another key announcement from the keynote was the upcoming “Launchnote”—a milestone that will finalize the mainnet release schedule. The beta testnet, currently live, processes transactions at twice the speed of the earlier alpha version. It also allows wallet users to test core features and receive weekly token allocations. Security-Centered Architecture in BlockDAG’s Keynote Speed and scalability often dominate Layer-1 claims, but BlockDAG’s keynote emphasized that security forms the core of its build. In the security segment, Youssef Khaoulaj explained the various protection layers now integrated within the protocol. With audits already completed by Certik and Halborn , and a complete chain-wide audit in progress, the project is showing its readiness to prevent issues before they happen. Its technical structure further adds to this strength. Using a Directed Acyclic Graph combined with proof-of-work, the system avoids linear delays by allowing simultaneous validations. This model increases speed and reduces the chances of bottlenecks or forks. At launch, BlockDAG will support 2,000 TPS, with planned scaling to 15,000 TPS over two years. Further, the project’s treasury is protected with MPC-grade tech, removing weak points and matching the standards of top financial tech firms. Everything—from contract execution to node functionality—has been built to deliver consistent performance. “Security is not a feature—it’s the bedrock upon which we’ve built everything,” said Khaoulaj. Beyond its fundraising and technology, BlockDAG is dedicating real resources toward development support. The team has introduced the BlockDAG Academy, global hackathons, and a grants program to support building tools like DeFi platforms, games, lending apps, and stablecoins. The mainnet will also include user-friendly tools like token generators and account abstraction to ease onboarding for newer Web3 users. So, BlockDAG’s $600 million goal isn’t just a financial number. It represents the drive to create a functioning, full-scale decentralized system from day one, without relying on Layer-2 additions or market waves. It moves with purpose—and delivers with action. Final Thoughts While XRP’s attempt to hit $3 continues to attract attention in the short term, the larger question is about where crypto is heading next. BlockDAG is moving far beyond early funding, turning its community into a working ecosystem, and its presale into the launch of one of the most ambitious Layer-1 systems in recent years. With $208 million already in hand and a roadmap pointing toward $600 million, one thing stands out: BlockDAG is not trying to follow others—it’s paving the road ahead.

Despite this decline, Ripple continues to defend the critical support level at $2. Analysts forecast that as long as this support holds, XRP price could soon rally by 600% to $15. Analyst Forecasts 600% XRP Price Rally to $15 Popular analyst Crypto Elites believes that XRP price could be on the verge of a 600% rally to $15. The analyst observed that Ripple had formed a rounding bottom pattern, which often signals that the trend is about to shift to bullish. By defending the support level at $2, XRP price is also retesting the neckline of the rounding bottom. If this level holds, the token is bound to make a massive 600% rally to $15. At this point, Ripple will have attained a market cap of nearly $1 trillion, which will see XRP rival Ethereum and Bitcoin in market dominance. XRP Price Chart Besides the bullish XRP price prediction by analysts, other signals have emerged suggesting that despite the recent downtrend, Ripple still has a bullish outlook. Crypto influencer John Squire noted that recently, one whale moved 8M XRP to an external wallet, hinting at a lack of intent to sell. Moreover, digital assets manager Grayscale has revealed that XRP price has the highest year-to-date returns among the top ten largest cryptos. This could bolster investor confidence in Ripple being a high-potential crypto to buy. Bearish Case for Ripple Price Despite the bullish forecast for XRP by analysts, several factors suggest that the price is not out of the woods yet. One of these factors is a bearish outlook in the derivatives market. Data from Coinglass shows that XRP funding rates have turned negative, which is indicative of more short sellers entering the market. This influx in the number of traders betting against Ripple price as they expect it to drop. XRP Funding Rate Besides the funding rates, the XRP 4-hour price chart shows that sellers are in control. The RSI has plummeted to 25, which signals that the token is heavily oversold. The ADX line is also rising, an indication that the current bearish trend is strong. If the negative sentiment continues, Ripple price can lose the critical support level at $2. This could spark a dip towards the $1.81 Fibonacci level. XRP/USDT: 4-Hour Chart To sum up, XRP price seems to be at a pivotal point where bulls and bears are fighting to have control. As long as Ripple can defend levels above $2, it has a chance to make a rebound, However. If this support fails to hold as selling intensifies, a crash to $1 is likely to happen.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s value struggled throughout February, enduring significant downturns. On February 27, the cryptocurrency dropped steeply, falling below $78,000 for the first time in more than three months. Analysis of on-chain data suggests that the decrease was largely driven by sell-offs from “Bitcoin tourists”—newcomers to the trading scene. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election.

Recent news/opinions on BTC According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs faced $275.83 million in net outflows on Feb. 27, 2025, pushing the week’s total net outflows to $2.71 billion. Bitcoin price prediction March 2025 February was the reddest month for Bitcoin since June 2022, when the world’s largest cryptocurrency’s performance was -37.28 %. According to crypto data provider Santiment, Bitcoin whales and sharks have dumped ~6,813 coins since last week, which is the largest drop since last July. Will the BTC price recover in March 2025? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $89,000 and be pushed further, at least $95,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $72,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction March 2025 $72,000 $89,000 $95,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Bitcoin spot ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $95,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF demand might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

The donation follows a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck on March 28, leaving widespread destruction and hundreds of casualties. Zhao made the announcement in a March 28 X post , expressing his hope for the safety of everyone affected by the disaster. He revealed that Binance and Binance Thailand will facilitate the distribution of the funds unless a reliable third-party onchain donation platform can be found. The earthquake, which struck near Mandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, caused severe damage to buildings and triggered flooding in several regions. According to The Guardian, at least 144 people have been confirmed dead, with first responders racing against time to rescue individuals still trapped under the rubble. The number of fatalities is expected to rise, as reports indicate that 732 people have been injured. In the aftermath, Myanmar’s junta chief Min Aung Hlaing issued a plea for international assistance, calling on other countries to provide aid in the ongoing relief efforts. Crypto’s Growing Role in Global Crisis Relief Zhao’s donation highlights the growing role of cryptocurrencies in humanitarian aid , particularly during natural disasters. With their borderless nature, low transaction fees, and near-instant settlement times, crypto donations offer a fast and efficient means of providing financial support to disaster-stricken regions. This isn’t the first time crypto has played a key role in crisis relief. Following the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that devastated Turkey and Syria in February 2023, philanthropist Haluk Levent spearheaded a campaign to collect crypto donations, rapidly amassing significant funds for relief efforts. Crypto Donations Provide Rapid, Unrestricted Aid Similarly, The Giving Block, a platform dedicated to enabling crypto donations for nonprofit organizations, has facilitated several successful fundraising campaigns. In 2023, the platform helped raise over $1 million for victims of the Maui wildfires, and in January 2024, it launched an emergency relief fundraiser for those affected by the California wildfires, raising another $1 million. As Binance continues to use its influence to mobilize funds for crisis response, Zhao’s donation underscores how crypto can be a powerful tool for delivering direct and immediate aid. With the death toll from the Myanmar-Thailand earthquake expected to climb, the flexibility and efficiency of crypto donations could prove vital in providing relief to those in desperate need.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $96.12 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $283.37 by 2031. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its own cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As the adoption of decentralized identities and Web3 technology grows, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $16.18 Market Cap $577.25 Trading Volume $47.07M Circulating Supply 100M ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $16.95 24-h Low $16.14 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Volatility) 18.38% 50-Day SMA $23.68 14-Day RSI 40.85 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 15 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $26.87 Ethereum Name Service price analysis: ENS sees slight gains TL;DR Breakdown : ENS is trading near the lower Bollinger Band indicating sustained bearish pressure The RSI is close to oversold territory which suggests limited buying momentum Without a breakout above the mid-Bollinger Band ENS may continue to consolidate or decline Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart ENS/USD chart Image Source: TradingView Based on the 1-day chart on March 29, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) appears to be in a bearish consolidation phase following a steep decline from its previous highs. The price hovers near the lower Bollinger Band at $15.78, indicating persistent downward pressure and a lack of bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 36.84, suggesting the asset is approaching oversold territory but has not yet reached an extreme. The middle Bollinger Band (20-day moving average) at $16.92 serves as immediate resistance. Without a strong reversal signal or breakout above the mid-band, ENS may continue to trend sideways or decline further. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENS/USD chart Image Source: TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is experiencing sustained consolidation after a prolonged downtrend. The price is near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating bearish pressure with limited upside momentum. The MACD histogram has turned slightly negative, and the signal line is diverging downward, suggesting a weakening bullish crossover. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power is at -1.00, pointing to seller dominance. Unless ENS can break above the $17.43 mid-Bollinger level with increased volume, further downside toward $16.10 or even lower support levels is likely. Market participants should remain cautious as momentum remains fragile and unclear. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 22.87 SELL SMA 5 $ 20.75 SELL SMA 10 $ 19.89 SELL SMA 21 $18.51 SELL SMA 50 $ 21.59 SELL SMA 100 $ 27.60 SELL SMA 200 $26.89 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 19.27 SELL EMA 5 $ 21.49 SELL EMA 10 $25.26 SELL EMA 21 $29.21 SELL EMA 50 $31.18 SELL EMA 100 $29.04 SELL EMA 200 $ 25.72 SELL What to expect from ENS? Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is navigating a period of persistent bearish pressure with limited bullish momentum. On the daily chart, the price is hovering near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting a continuation of the downtrend unless a strong reversal emerges. The RSI on both timeframes hovers below 40, indicating weak buying interest and approaching oversold conditions. The 4-hour chart shows marginal attempts at consolidation, but the MACD remains in bearish alignment. Unless ENS breaks above the mid-Bollinger Band and gains volume-backed bullish divergence, the token is likely to remain range-bound or drift lower. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will fully recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $124.93 by 2027. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending up to $250 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest.

The announcement came on March 28, coinciding with a U.S. judge’s rejection of Musk’s attempt to dismiss a class-action lawsuit related to his acquisition of Twitter. The lawsuit accuses Musk of misleading former Twitter shareholders by delaying the disclosure of his initial stake in the company. Critics Say xAI’s Acquisition of X Raises Legal Stakes for Elon Musk With xAI now owning X, critics say the legal stakes have grown. “It’s a whole lot spicier now,” said Adam Cochran , a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, adding that the move exposes xAI to legal risk as well. Musk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, incorporating $12 billion in debt. He originally purchased X for around $44 billion in April 2022. Announcing the merger, Musk wrote, “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined… This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capabilities with X’s massive reach.” @xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt). Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025 Cochran, however, criticized the structure of the deal, alleging that Musk used xAI’s inflated valuation to absorb X at an overestimated price while still reporting a significant loss. “He’s screwing over xAI investors and X investors,” Cochran argued, suggesting the deal may be a mechanism to transfer user data to xAI. xAI is the creator of Grok, an AI chatbot integrated into X that Musk claims outperforms the original version of ChatGPT on several academic benchmarks. Musk has positioned Grok as a tool designed to assist human progress and support research. Still, the $80 billion valuation for xAI has drawn skepticism. “An insanely dumb valuation,” Cochran said, while others, including crypto developer “Keef,” defended the move, saying Grok may well be a leading model for various AI tasks. This lawsuit just got a whole lot spicer though, as now he has opened up his AI entity to exposure here too and it’s a much bigger pie https://t.co/wO3sM8DfOE — Adam Cochran (adamscochran.eth) (@adamscochran) March 28, 2025 Elon Musk’s DOGE Team Gains Access to SEC Systems Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is reportedly being integrated into the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under a newly formed liaison initiative. As reported, the SEC has agreed to allow DOGE representatives access to its internal systems and data, effectively treating them as staff for integration and network purposes. An internal SEC email cited in the report confirmed that DOGE team members will be granted the same access rights as SEC employees when it comes to networks, systems, and sensitive data. The SEC has begun assembling a dedicated liaison team tasked with working alongside DOGE representatives. The internal communication emphasized that all processes will adhere to standard protocols, including ethics clearances, IT security reviews, and access approvals. While specific goals of DOGE’s work with the SEC have not yet been made public, the collaboration raises questions about the role private-sector influence may play in regulatory frameworks moving forward.

Many traders are now looking beyond the crowded names and focusing on early-stage projects with strong fundamentals. One token currently priced at $0.025 is starting to turn heads across the DeFi space—Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With projections placing its value above $1 in the long run, this low-priced token is becoming part of conversations about serious upside potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What’s fueling this interest isn’t just the price tag—it’s the utility behind the project. Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to give users more control and flexibility with their digital assets. Unlike traditional finance or even many legacy DeFi apps, Mutuum allows you to either supply liquidity and earn interest or borrow against your crypto without having to sell it. The current phase of the presale is offering MUTM at $0.025. So far, over 340 million tokens have been sold, and the project has already raised more than $5.7 million. With over 7,400 holders involved, the traction is growing fast. Not long ago, the price increased by 25%—and with the next presale phase set to raise the token price to $0.03, the window to enter at this level is closing quickly. MUTM is set to launch at $0.06, but analysts are looking beyond that. Some are targeting a move toward $1.45 in the future, which would mark a 58x return from today’s price. While that kind of gain requires time and strong adoption, it’s not an empty prediction. The token is tied to real mechanics that feed value back into the system. Mutuum plans to use a portion of its protocol revenue to regularly buy MUTM on the open market and distribute it to users who lock up their mtTokens. The concept of mtTokens is central to how Mutuum works. When users contribute assets to the protocol, they are issued mtTokens as a representation of their deposit. These tokens represent the value of the original deposit and automatically reflect earned interest over time. They can be held, transferred, or even traded, and they remain active across the DeFi ecosystem. Their flexibility makes them more than a placeholder—they’re a functional part of the platform’s core. Another feature that makes Mutuum stand out is the structure of its lending system. The platform offers two lending approaches: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P), giving users flexibility in how they interact with the protocol. With P2C, users interact with a shared liquidity pool that adjusts interest rates automatically based on usage. In the P2P model, users negotiate directly with one another, setting terms based on personal strategies or asset volatility. This dual approach creates room for both conservative and more customized lending behavior. And it’s not just the architecture that’s forward-looking. The Mutuum team is preparing to roll out the beta version of the platform at the time of the token’s launch. That means users won’t have to wait months for functionality—it’ll be ready from the beginning. Combined with an ongoing smart contract audit by CertiK, the project is making moves that show it’s focused on long-term reliability and transparency. To keep the energy up, Mutuum is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway for its community. Ten winners will split the prize pool, and the entry process is open on the project’s official website. It’s another way the team is engaging early supporters and adding momentum as the presale pushes forward. In a market where many low-priced tokens rely purely on speculation, MUTM is different. The foundation is being built in real-time, and the numbers already back it up. With a launch just around the corner, a functioning platform on the way, and a smart mechanism for rewarding long-term holders, Mutuum Finance is proving that a $0.025 token can carry far more weight than its price suggests.

This pattern is often seen as a bearish signal. On top of that, there’s also the looming issue of tariffs set to take effect on April 2nd, which could affect market sentiment, including Bitcoin’s performance. However, not everyone is sold on all the bad news. Death Cross: Bear Signal or Market Bottom Indicator? Crypto analyst Evan Aldo explained that the death cross might not be as negative as it sounds. It could be a sign that Bitcoin is about to bounce back.

Specifically, he alluded to BTC’s RSI, which is showing a similar pattern to last year, just before the rally to new highs. Bitcoin’s RSI Targeting Daily Retest That Triggered 2024 Price Rally In an X post, Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin’s RSI is targeting a daily retest that triggered the 2024 price rally. He mentioned that last week, the daily RSI successfully performed a post-breakout retest of the RSI downtrend, which dates back to November 2024, to confirm the breakout. He added that the RSI is now going for another retest of that same downtrend. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin RSI Dominance Needs To Crash To This Level For The Bull Run To Resume The Bitcoin price rallied to $100,000 during this November 2024 period following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections. Rekt Capital’s accompanying chart showed that the RSI is retesting the 40 zone, with a break below this level likely to spark another downtrend for the flagship crypto. On the other hand, holding above this RSI level could spark another uptrend for BTC, sending its price to new highs. However, the Bitcoin price looks more likely to face another major correction at the moment, having dropped from its weekly high of around $88,500 to below $84,000 on Friday. Macro factors like Donald Trump’s tariffs and the US Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening policies are weakening the flagship crypto’s bullish momentum. Trading firm QCP Capital opined that any short-term upside for the Bitcoin price remains capped as markets wait for clarity from Trump’s next move in the escalating trade war. The PCE inflation data, which was released on Friday, also sparked a bearish outlook for BTC as the core index rose beyond expectations. BTC Could Form Local Bottom At Current Price Level Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that the Bitcoin price could form a local bottom at its current price level. He noted that BTC is still holding above a strong confluence of supports, including the monthly Tenkan and midline of the monthly Fair Value Gap. The analyst added that the last two times BTC has held these supports, it has marked a local bottom. Related Reading: Popular Analyst PlanB Expects Bitcoin Price To Double In 2025 As Bear Market Is Not Here In an earlier post, Titan of Crypto had raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price rallying to $91,000 soon. He stated that a bullish pennant had formed on the 4-hour chart. According to him, if this pattern breaks to the upside, the BTC target is around $91,400. Meanwhile, legendary trader Peter Brandt looks bearish as he recently predicted that BTC could drop to as low as $65,635. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $83,900, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The magnitude of the loss has prompted calls for international assistance. Binance co-founder promises aid to affected countries In the wake of the earthquake, Myanmar’s junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing urged nations globally to provide any available aid to support relief efforts, highlighting the need for urgent support in the country. While rescue efforts are still ongoing, the former Binance CEO took to his X account to wish the people of both countries well, while promising to make sizable donations to alleviate the effects of the earthquake. In his post on X, CZ mentioned that he wants to donate 500 BNB each to both Myanmar and Thailand, asking his 10 million followers the best method to send the funds. “I will donate 500 BNB each to Myanmar and Thailand. Is there a transparent on-chain donation system with DID? If not, I will rely on @Binance and @Binance_TH_ to distribute,” he said. I will donate 500 BNB each to Myanmar and Thailand. Is there a transparent on-chain donation system with DID? If not, I will rely on @Binance and @Binance_TH_ to distribute. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 28, 2025 Some of his followers gave their opinion on the method to move the funds to the affected victims. While some agreed that a transparent DID system would be good, others mentioned that using Binance for the distribution would be a good idea. “This is incredibly generous respect! If there’s a transparent DID-based system, that would be amazing for accountability. Otherwise, trusting Binance for distribution sounds like a solid plan. Thank you for supporting the people of Myanmar and Thailand!” a user said. Donation shows the importance of crypto during crises This is not the first time that the former Binance boss will be donating to victims affected by mishap as he previously donated $100,000 (150 BNB) to the victims of the Javier Milei-endorsed rug pull Libra. Investors suffered huge losses after the project collapsed within hours of launch after enjoying huge patronage after an endorsement made by the president of Argentina. In turn, the wallet he used to donate was rewarded with up to $1 million in several digital assets. The current crisis has opened up the transformative role of digital assets in times of disaster relief. Aside from the cross-border efficiencies, transactions using digital assets are near-instant, and cost less, making it the ideal method to provide aid during a crisis. Aside from the current crisis, previous ones have shown the power of digital assets, with the February 2023 earthquake affecting Turkey and Syria as good examples. Crypto donations were led by philanthropist Haluk Levent to assist victims of the earthquake. A notable organization in this aspect, The Giving Block, has successfully raised funds for various disaster relief initiatives, including over $1 million raised for wildfire victims in Maui in 2023. The group also mobilized support for victims of the California wildfires, raising more than $1 million since January 2023. The efforts highlight the growing trend of using digital assets in crises. While the financial landscape continues to evolve, the integration of digital assets into traditional finance may well help humanitarian efforts, changing the way funding is carried out. While established platforms continue to facilitate these donations, the crypto sector stands as a force that will help these platforms reach their goals faster during crises. However, organizations will need to seek credible partnerships to achieve this positive effort. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

First, with a 16% surge to a 26% crash, the holders witnessed high volatility within just a few days. However, analysts’ mixed sentiments on this GME news hint at higher uncertainty, especially as the bears double down and hint at the possibility of either a further crash or a short squeeze. In 2021, such a squeeze resulted in the GME stock price creating its ATH. GameStop Stock Price Tumbles & Short Volume Doubles The Bitcoin treasury announcement resulted in a significant uptrend for the token, which rose to a high of $29.39. However, GameStop’s plan to raise $1.3 billion to buy Bitcoin affected investors’ sentiments significantly. Today, GME trades at $21.73, with a 26% drop from the high, indicating the investors’ concerning sentiments. The short trader’s volume had increased significantly in anticipation of a further drop. In the last 24 hours, the count has increased by a staggering 234%, reaching 30,884,606. Due to such a high count, the NYSE has put a trading restriction on the GME stock, affecting its price. GameStop Stock Price to Hit New ATH? The high count of the short volume clearly indicates that the traders are betting on the GameStop stock price drop . Although it is correct per the current scenario, investors believe this gaming firm’s stock will follow the MSTR’s price rally. Trend changes and the GME stock price surge will result in the liquidation of these shorts. As a result, the short sellers will jump into re-buying GME to restore their losses. In an optimistic scenario, this would result in generating a short squeeze, i.e., the stock’s price would rise sharply. This happened in 2021; the short volume was high, and the chain reaction resulted in the price jumping to an all-time high of $82.25. If history repeats itself and a high buying pressure builds, a short squeeze could form, resulting in the GameStop stock’s price rally to new ATH. GameStop’s Short volume on the monthly chart is higher than during the 2021 short squeeze. This is insane, adds analyst. Experts Predict GME Price to Hit $1000 Experts like Peter Schiff and others are criticizing GameStop’s Bitcoin buying choices. One added that GameStop’s announcement is just a distraction from their decaying finances. Investors are fleeing as fast as they can. They know the BTC announcement is all just a failed weak attempt at a distraction from their decaying financials. Others think contrary, anticipating a comeback similar to the Metaplanet and MicroStrategy’s stock price rally . Interestingly, Metaplanet became Japan’s hottest stock due to Bitcoin buying, as its price surged 3.575% within a year. The same is true for Michael Saylor’s MSTR. As a result, under the pretext of short-squeeze, investors anticipated GME stock price to hit $1000 or higher. However, the most realistic scenario is based on the Bitcoin price rally, where analysts predict a lower yet bullish outlook. They believe that if the BTC reached $150,000, the GameStop stock price would mirror it, pushing it to $40 or higher. As this digital asset is the key metric here, investors must monitor Bitcoin’s performance, GameStop BTC buying, and similar updates.

After a volatile week, the cryptocurrency is testing a critical support zone between $82,000 and $84,000, and analysts are split on whether it is the calm before another leg up or the start of a brutal correction. Bear Trap or Bear Market? Crypto influencer Kyle Chasse sent alarm bells ringing, cautioning , “If that support is lost, expect a drop to $80K. $77K-78K if we lose that support.” YouTuber Crypto Rover called it a “big danger for all Bitcoin holders” as it slides dangerously close to breaking a crucial uptrend formed in March. Adding to the suspense, crypto trader Daan Crypto pointed out to his more than 400,000 followers on X that April 2, dubbed “Liberation Day” by U.S. President Donald Trump, could bring unexpected volatility as he imposes new tariffs, including a 25% charge on foreign-made cars and auto parts. “With April 2nd approaching and potentially some headlines leaking, I wouldn’t be surprised to see some action this weekend,” the investor speculated. CME Gaps and Brazil’s Big Play While the short-term outlook seems shaky, a surprising twist is emerging: BTC adoption is heating up. Shortly after video game retailer GameStop announced plans to buy $1.3 billion worth of Bitcoin, a senior official in the Brazilian government revealed that the country is pushing to allocate 5% of its national reserves to the asset, a move that could potentially send shockwaves through the market. Could this be a setup for a huge reversal? Then there’s the infamous CME gap. BTC recently created a new gap at $84,418, sparking speculation about a potential fill next week. However, traders are divided, with some expecting a violent breakdown and others seeing the situation as a classic bear trap designed to shake out weak hands before a rally. “Two words: bear trap,” fired JAN3 CEO Samson Mow in an X post. If Bitcoin loses key support, market indicators suggest we could be staring down a brutal correction to the $71,000 level. However, if the bulls defend $82,000, and depending on the market’s reaction to news leaks regarding April 2, a recovery past $90K may not be off the table.

In the last seven days alone, the market has dropped by around 2%. Currently, the price of Ethereum sits at $1,877.46. A post by renowned macro strategist Mike McGlone asks: “Is $1,000 next?” Read on for more details! Ethereum Price Drops – What’s Driving the Decline? At the start of this month, the Ethereum price was around $2,216.71. Since then, the ETH market has seen a fall of 15.48%. At one point on March 2, the ETH price was as high as $2,550.37. Right now, the price stands at least 26.59% below the month’s peak. It was expected that Ethereum would find support at the $1,900 level. However, the level failed to act as a strong support. The current price of ETH is $1,877.46. Mike McGlone states that the Ethereum market is linked to the broader financial market. He notes that if Ethereum drops further, it could affect the broader market, especially the S&P 500. Since the beginning of this month, the S&P 500 index has declined by over 4.48%, and the Nasdaq 100 index has dropped by nearly 5.59%. Expert’s Warning: Is ETH Leading a Market Downtrend? McGlone warns that if Ethereum continues its downward momentum , other top altcoins may join the trend. Among the top altcoins , Ethereum has shown the highest 30-day downtrend. The majority of top altcoins have also shown downtrend in the last 30 days. XRP has slipped by 4.5%, BNB by 1.65, Solana by 9.4%, Dogecoin by 16.7%, Chainlink by 10.6% and Avalanche by 12.8%. Could Ethereum Crash to $1,000? Key Support Levels to Watch. In his post, McGlone questions whether ETH might drop to $1,000. #Ethereum vs. $2,000 may guide the way for risk assets. Is $1,000 next?

Experts believe that the $2000 mark is a key psychological level. Experts think that if the Ethereum market fails to stay above the $2,000 psychological level, it could drop to $1,000. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Over Bitcoin at BlackRock: Could a $3000 Rally Be Next? , ETH Investors Remain Active – Trading Volume Surges Despite Price Drop Reports suggest that despite the price drop, the trading volume of the market has surged by 36.92%.

Ethereum’s Future: Can Strong Fundamentals Trigger a Recovery? Experts believe that the ETH market is currently in a profit-taking phase. They think that once the market recovers from this phase, it could witness strong upward momentum. They trust that Ethereum has the advantage of strong long-term fundamentals. They also believe that the Ethereum market could benefit from growing adoption, including the launch of a bank-issued stablecoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A $600 stake today could transform into $30,000, making it one of the most promising altcoins on the rise. The presale campaign for the project currently operates in Phase 4 at the lowest price point of $0.025. Investors actively purchase MUTM tokens because the upcoming price rise is projected to reach $0.03 in the next phase, 20% from its current value of $0.025. Mutuum Finance has received $5.7 million in funding from 7400 holders who participate in the project at 0.06 dollars per coin. This presents a potential 140% return on investment to investors who acquire tokens right now. The experts forecast that Mutuum Finance will experience a 50x price increase which will take it to $3 during 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates To Phase 4 The third phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 4 of the presale has surpassed $5.7 million total shares and attracted more than 7400 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.025 during Phase 4 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 3 obtained 140% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. Furthermore analysts predict MUTM will reach $3 upon listing resulting in almost 50x the original amount. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 5 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.03 Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives The $100,000 giveaway conducted by Mutuum Finance aims to give away $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants as part of its adoption drive. The referral system within Mutuum Finance provides users with rewards for bringing new members into the platform which helps the community to expand while accelerating its growth naturally. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to attract strong market interest because it has amassed 7,400+ holders and raised $5.7 million. The price of MUTM is expected to move from $0.025 towards $0.03 before accelerating to $3 by 2025 while the upcoming price increase will happen before that milestone occurs. A $600 investment today could reach $30,000. You should join the presale immediately since the value will increase after the next phase.

This rise contradicts the wider expectations of a so-called “altcoin season” when alternative cryptos rally harder than BTC. The Altcoin Season Index, which tracks the price performance of the top 50 altcoins against Bitcoin , is at 18. A reading below 25 indicates a “Bitcoin season,” meaning altcoins are faltering compared to Bitcoin. Investors drive Bitcoin’s dominance over altcoins During altcoin season, investors move their profits from BTC into smaller markets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) to get higher returns, but lately, the once-anticipated season has been experiencing a dry spell. Bitcoin has retained its dominance in the market for the longest period, forcing analysts to question whether there will be an altcoin season at all this year. Even after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that allowed people to buy and sell ETH through traditional brokerage accounts, we still haven’t witnessed a surge in the coin’s price. Likewise, Solana’s low-cost transactions and faster processing times boosted its NFT and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors, which gave investors hope for an altcoin season. However, because of recent market corrections and concerns over its liquidity, this growth still wasn’t enough to raise the price of SOL. Some crypto analysts claim that BTC will likely retain its dominance for longer if there are no changes in the regulations and challenges affecting altcoins’ liquidity. But because history repeats itself in the crypto world, we will likely receive an altcoin season once BTC stabilizes, however long it takes. Bitcoin’s dominance strengthens as altcoins await their turn Because of inflation, interest rate decisions, and increased Bitcoin ETF trading volumes, we can only expect BTC to stay ahead of altcoins for the foreseeable future. But that doesn’t mean there is no hope for altcoins with BTC around because projects like Fetch.ai (FET) and Render Network (RNDR), focusing on AI, Web3, and decentralized applications, could still benefit once BTC stabilizes. Ethereum’s expected upgrade could also revive stagnant interest in its ecosystem, possibly spawning a new altcoin season. For now, BTC remains in control and will likely dictate the fate of other ecosystems for a while. BTC’s price is currently at $83,825. Its market cap is $1.65 trillion, and its 24-hour global trade volume is $26.87 billion. Throughout the past day, Bitcoin has traded within a range of $84,784 to $87,723, reflecting a volatile market. Technical indicators across multiple timeframes suggest a prevailing bearish sentiment.

It’s exciting to imagine, but the chances at that even if BTC gets to $500,000 are quite slim. However, there’s another token that shows much more promise in terms of growth potential, Rexas Finance (RXS).

Rapid Growth and Impressive Price Surge Rexas Finance (RXS) has seen an extraordinary surge in interest, driven by its promising ecosystem and growing investor confidence. Starting at a humble price of just $0.03, the token has now soared nearly 8x to $0.20 in its final presale stage.

With its strong focus on Real-World Assets, impressive price surge, and a successful CertiK audit, RXS is attracting attention from both investors and industry insiders. The upcoming launch in June 2025, coupled with plans for listings on top-tier exchanges, positions Rexas Finance to become a major player in the crypto market.

However, smart investors knew all along that corrections in an extremely bullish market (referring to Bitcoin’s November run) are healthy. In fact, they only mean one thing – new accumulation zones before the next rally begins. Several strong technical analysis signals are now pointing towards the same, i.e., Bitcoin is currently in an accumulation phase and that it’ll soon begin its next leg higher. Read on as we dive deeper into Bitcoin’s analysis, why this could be the perfect time to be a buyer, and finally which new meme coins on presale you should be looking at. 4 Reasons Why Bitcoin Could Rally Higher Here’s a detailed run-through of all the major reasons why $BTC is in a pole position to reach new highs. 1. The Long Term Holder Supply for Bitcoin is showing a noticeable increase. This simply means that long-term $BTC HODLers who initially sold the crypto to lock in some profits are now re-purchasing it. A phenomenon like this is exactly what precedes a parabolic price movement. 2. The Value Days Destroyed (VDD) Multiple is currently very low. This metric, by the way, measures Bitcoin transactions based on both transaction size and coin age and then compares it to a previous yearly average. The VDD Multiple being low is great news because it tells us that large, older Bitcoins are not being transacted. Essentially, institutional buyers are holding onto their $BTC. 3. The Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) has once again entered the ‘Belief’ zone after briefly slipping into ‘Anxiety’ during the recent fall. This is a strong sign that Bitcoin’s current prices could be a long-term higher low. 4. The Hash Ribbons Indicator has just churned out a buy signal thanks to a bullish crossover. The short-term hash rate trend has just moved above the longer-term average, showing that miners are confident that Bitcoin’s price is going to increase in the near future. Having pointed out the general direction Bitcoin is expected to follow next, we’d like to mention three presale meme coins that you should consider purchasing to make the most of the next $BTC rally. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – The Best New Meme Coin on Presale Right Now With the Bitcoin bull market currently in accumulation, we have on our hands what smart money refers to as the perfect time to buy long-term assets. While directly buying Bitcoin could be a good decision, consider becoming an investor in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) if you want to maximize your earnings. Because BTC Bull Token gives out free $BTC every time the OG crypto surges past a new milestone (such as $150K, $200K, and $250K), the token’s price will rise alongside Bitcoin’s. Keep in mind, though, that you must hold $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet to qualify for automatic Bitcoin airdrops from BTC Bull Token. Additionally, the $BTCBULL team plans to get rid of a part of the total token supply at regular intervals. This will ensure there’s always enough demand for $BTCBULL and that its price follows an upward trajectory. The best crypto to buy now for Bitcoin maximalists, BTC Bull Token is currently in presale. It has raised over $4.2M at the time of writing, and it’s just over a month old. You can grab one token for just $0.002435 if you get in now. For more info, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy $BTCBULL . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Top AI Agent Coin Revolutionizing Crypto Investing If you’re looking for a reliable ally to help you hunt down the best altcoins, try MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . It’s a revolutionary AI agent coin equipped with state-of-the-art hive-mind intelligence that will help you build a rock-solid crypto portfolio capable of outperforming the average market returns. Essentially, it will interact with the crypto community on online forums, like dApps and X, understand all that’s being said about crypto and the numerous tokens therein, and finally separate the wheat from the chaff. $MIND token holders will be the only ones who get this AI’s exclusive market insights and token recommendations. Interestingly, down the line, they’ll also be rewarded with early-bird access to cryptos created by $MIND firsthand. The MIND of Pepe presale is currently ongoing and has so far amassed over $7.7M. Each token is currently available for just $0.0036234, which is the cheapest you’ll ever get it for. Here’s how to buy $MIND . 3. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – AI Crypto Project Currently in Presale Lightchain AI is one of the most anticipated projects, seeing as it plans to combine the superpowers of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Simply put, it will use AI to create blockchains that are smarter and more secure than the ones that came before them. Owning $LCAI, the project’s native cryptocurrency, will also give you the power to vote on the future of Lightchain AI. Luckily for you, this fantastic and unique community-driven AI-crypto partnership is still in its presale, which is why it’s available for a low price of $0.007125 per token. Put together, the project has raised more than $18.6M, meaning it’s easily among the best crypto presales right now. Bottom Line Although Bitcoin’s positive outlook is undeniable, it’s worth remembering that no amount of analysis can guarantee a certain outcome. At the end of the day, the market does what it wants to. The ability to deal with uncertainty is at the heart of investing, especially in crypto. This is why we recommend only investing a small amount. Additionally, you must always do your own research before investing. None of our guides are a substitute for professional financial advice.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-29 11:33:46

What’s notable is the inclusion of crypto industry leaders within the working group—a move that signals a growing willingness to collaborate rather than restrict. While the bill focuses on regulation, its broader impact could be increased clarity, reduced uncertainty, and a stronger foundation for mainstream adoption. For investors, moments like this often mark the beginning of renewed interest—especially in projects with solid fundamentals or strong cultural relevance. Best Crypto to Buy Now BTC Bull BTC Bull sits at an intersection that becomes more relevant as regulation becomes clearer: accessibility and narrative alignment. While Bitcoin remains the symbol of crypto resilience, its price point makes it less flexible for traders looking to engage quickly. BTC Bull offers a parallel play—lower barrier, same energy, with community-driven systems built for scale. But it’s not just mimicking Bitcoin’s image. The token uses a milestone-based reward system where community growth unlocks airdrops, creating a participatory rhythm that keeps interest alive without needing constant outside catalysts. That self-contained momentum matters, especially as macro developments like the Financial Technology Protection Act hint at a maturing landscape. A key feature is the burn model. As supply contracts and community expand, value isn’t just a function of hype—it’s tied to scarcity and participation. It’s a meme token, but one designed to evolve with its holders—something which was identified and endorsed by top crypto influencers, including ClayBro in one of his YouTube videos. With regulatory signals turning more constructive, BTC Bull fits this moment: light enough for new investors, connected enough to big narratives, and structured in a way that rewards those who engage before the crowd arrives. Meme Index If the market’s getting ready to open its doors to wider participation, Meme Index may be one of the easiest ways in. It doesn’t ask users to pick the next breakout token. It builds a rotating set of meme coins with active momentum, offering instant exposure to the pulse of the meme economy without forcing risky bets on individual names. This setup matters more as meme coin launches increase in pace and variety. Every regulatory signal—especially one involving crypto-industry collaboration—adds legitimacy to the space. And as attention returns, meme cycles tend to kick off faster than most investors are ready for. Meme Index simplifies that problem. Its index structure reacts to performance, engagement, and trend movement. That means when social sentiment flips bullish, the strongest tokens rise within the index, and exposure adjusts accordingly. It’s not a lazy tracker—it’s designed to be nimble. And as the market preps for broader access, tokens that ride waves efficiently—without needing to be first or loudest—have a real shot at multiplying in value. With clearer rules potentially coming and meme speculation back in rotation, this might be the lowest-effort, highest-upside meme play available to retail investors right now. Ondo Ondo is often labeled “DeFi meets TradFi,” but that undersells how crucial its role may become if the U.S. continues leaning toward crypto integration rather than crackdown. The project tokenizes traditional assets—like U.S. Treasuries—into on-chain instruments. That makes it one of the most direct bridges between the old world of finance and the permissionless liquidity of blockchain. Now that lawmakers are introducing bills that bring crypto under a clearer regulatory framework, Ondo’s positioning becomes more strategic. It’s not betting on cultural virality or short-term volatility. It’s built for capital that needs compliance, stability, and yield—all three of which institutional investors care deeply about. As tokenization grows, projects like Ondo may not just participate in market growth—they could become essential to it. Their tools make it easier for both sides—DeFi and TradFi—to operate within shared standards. With a price tag well below a dollar—trading at around $0.81 per token—ONDO could definitely be an asset worth including in one’s portfolio. Holders get influence over how the protocol evolves, which matters as regulatory expectations increase. In short, Ondo doesn’t just survive in a regulated environment—it might be one of the few projects that’s truly designed for it. MIND of Pepe If regulation brings structure to crypto, sentiment will drive where the energy flows—and MIND of Pepe is built entirely around that idea. While most meme tokens rely on guessing where the hype is heading, this one’s entire utility is about tracking it in real time. MIND of Pepe uses AI to scan crypto communities across platforms, monitoring conversation volume, engagement trends, and tone shifts. It doesn't try to predict the future—it listens to the present, which in meme cycles is often a more valuable edge. And in a space where the line between retail buzz and actual volume is razor-thin, this sort of insight has real value. What makes it especially timely is the broader shift in tone around crypto. If bills like the Financial Technology Protection Act lay the groundwork for a more regulated but open market, then social sentiment will likely become even more of a leading indicator—especially as retail flows increase. Build. $MIND pic.twitter.com/SIjjY2Ts11 — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) March 29, 2025 The token itself isn’t just a logo. It provides access to the system’s trend-tracking features and positions holders within a project that’s equal parts meme and machine. That blend is rare—and it makes sense now. Solaxy Solaxy doesn’t deal in memes or market noise. It focuses on the pipes—the infrastructure that keeps things flowing when activity spikes. Built as a Layer 2 protocol that facilitates smooth movement between Ethereum and Solana, it solves the problem most users only notice when things break: cross-chain friction. That becomes increasingly relevant when attention returns to the market, especially as regulation begins to offer clearer lanes for participation. The moment capital begins rotating with confidence again, people stop tolerating delays and high gas fees. They want to move quickly, between chains, without second-guessing the tech stack. Solaxy makes that possible. It handles speed, cost, and connectivity, while also offering staking features that reward those who help keep the system strong. It’s not trying to dominate headlines—it’s trying to keep everything else from falling apart when demand explodes. In a market potentially heading toward structural clarity, Solaxy’s value proposition is simple: it works in the background, ensuring every other project has room to operate. And that makes it a token worth holding when the market starts moving with real force again. Conclusion Regulatory clarity doesn’t always spark rallies overnight—but it changes the tone. It signals that crypto is being taken seriously, not sidelined. And in moments like that, smart investors look not at what’s loud, but at what’s early, adaptable, or built to function regardless of the hype cycle. The tokens above aren’t just names—they’re systems, tools, and narratives with room to grow under the spotlight that’s slowly turning back toward this space.

As Bitcoin tightens within this range, historical data suggests market-defining moves could be imminent. The compression phase has repeatedly preceded sharp Bitcoin price shifts, making this a pivotal moment for the asset. With Bitcoin at the center of market speculation, historical patterns hint at a potential breakout. Market Poised For Impact As Bitcoin's (BTC) Realized Volatility Hits Critical Level Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a pivotal phase, with its realized volatility hitting a major compression level, a pattern that has historically signaled significant price movements. The one-week realized volatility recently dropped to 23.42%, a threshold that has preceded substantial market shifts in previous cycles. According to researcher Axel Adler Jr. , Bitcoin has undergone six volatility compressions on the daily timeframe in this cycle, with the seventh unfolding. The Garman-Klass Realized Volatility metric is flashing an alert, indicating that a decisive price move may be imminent. Historical data suggests that similar compression phases resulted in price increases in four out of the past six cases, while two led to downturns. Since realized volatility measures the magnitude of price fluctuations over a specific period, it offers insight into market stability. Bitcoin’s current volatility is nearing multi-year lows , echoing previous periods of market inertia that preceded major breakouts. For example, October and November 2024 saw realized volatility drop to 22.88% and 21.35%, respectively, before Bitcoin made substantial price swings.

Live TV Display Error Goes Viral,https://coingape.com/did-xrp-price-just-hit-21k-live-tv-display-error-goes-viral/,"The recent XRP price glitch on live American TV has created ripples in the crypto community. In an episode of “American Sunrise Early Edition” on Real America’s Voice, the value of XRP soared to a staggering $21,355, marking a 961,936% uptick from its actual price at the moment. Notably, other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano also saw variations in their prices during the live TV program. Though the host, Jake Novak, addressed Bitcoin’s price anomaly, he overlooked the XRP glitch. XRP Price Glitch on Live American TV: Key Details During an episode of American Sunrise Early Edition on Real America’s Voice, the show displayed incorrect prices for major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and XRP, with the values being significantly different from their actual market prices. For instance, the XRP price was displayed as $21,355, up by more than 961,936% from its actual market value of $2.1. Throughout the market outlook segment, the XRP price glitch remained on the screen, fluctuating between $2.22 and $21,355. The community largely responded to the incident, drawing the team’s attention to the error. This incident follows the increasing anticipations of the Ripple lawsuit settlement , driven by the SEC’s recent progressive stance. XRP’s Repeated Price Glitch As highlighted by the community members, it’s not the first time that XRP has experienced a price glitch. Historically, the token has seen dramatic price variations due to system errors. In June 2024, XRP was shown on TradingView at $9,864, a point much higher than its original value. A glitch on Binance presented XRP at $5,791 due to data feed issues in October. In a similar incident, XRP’s value was incorrectly displayed on CoinMarketCap in November 2023, with the platform showing it at $1,919, a significant deviation from its actual market value. Host Addresses Bitcoin Price Anomaly, Overlooks XRP Notably, the technical issue on the American live TV has resulted in incorrect price displays for not just XRP, but several other cryptocurrencies. The episode presented Bitcoin’s price at $43,636, marking a significant drop of around 50% from the original value. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) rose to $6,000, a 156% surge and Solana (SOL) increased to $2,896, up by 1,983%. Dogecoin (DOGE) skyrocketed to $32, a 15,900% increase from $0.22, and Cardano (ADA) increased to $69, a 10,198% rise from $0.67. Addressing the issue, the show’s host, Jake Novak, stated that the “graph had gone a little funky.” However, he only addressed the Bitcoin price glitch, overlooking the issues with other cryptocurrency values, including XRP. How XRP Reacts To the Incident? As of press time, XRP is valued at $2.10, with a notable decline of 5.5% over the past 24 hours. On a weekly and monthly basis, the token has experienced massive dips of 12.9% and 7.3%, respectively. Despite the prevailing negative trend, the XRP price is facing a positives sentiment within the community. This is significantly evident in the 14.5% surge in the trading volume, currently at $4.18 billion. The post Did XRP Price Just Hit $21K?

As we approach the end of Q1 2025, this year hasn’t exactly panned out as many thought it would in the digital assets space. However, if crypto is consistently one thing, it’s unpredictable. You might also like: Crypto was supposed to be an exit—why are we more trapped than ever? | Opinion While the market is down, largely due to global economics outside its control, industry optimism remains high, and there are plenty of reasons to support this sentiment. From the high possibility of a pro-crypto regulatory framework in the United States and the continued expansion of DeFi to strategic cryptocurrency reserves and more AI, the industry is maturing and evolving constantly. While the industry’s natural volatility will remain for the foreseeable future, its maturation is driven by innovation and a stronger, more stable infrastructure. This foundation will allow the industry to focus on addressing challenges and increasing adoption. Despite the industry’s notorious unpredictability, several possible overlooked trends could have a huge impact on the broader ecosystem. Emergence of DeFi regulatory frameworks Regulators have a hard time applying clear rules to DeFi because if a network or protocol isn’t controlled by a single entity, who can the government contact in case of a violation or concern? While DeFi is currently exempt from direct oversight, the US, EU, and UK are exploring ways to legislate this rapidly evolving sector effectively. In the US, the House of Representatives just last week voted to repeal an IRS rule that required DeFi protocols to report their earnings from crypto sales. This step likely indicates that the Trump administration will lean toward a regulatory outline that will attempt to protect investors without disrupting the decentralized and innovative nature of DeFi. It’s unlikely that any comprehensive DeFi regulation will be enacted by the end of the year, but a better understanding of what policies and approaches policymakers may take can be expected. DeFi will likely continue to adopt know-your-customer and anti-money laundering processes, as well as a greater emphasis on solutions like zero-knowledge proofs, which could serve as an effective way to enhance DeFi compliance. This is the ideal type of approach as it balances privacy with the need to maintain KYC and AML compliance. A different kind of TradFi influence Traditional finance and crypto have been increasingly crossing paths as the former now recognizes the latter as a legitimate asset class. TradFi’s steadily increasing interest in digital assets has partially contributed to a growing awareness of the need for better risk mitigation. Portfolio diversification is a central pillar of mitigating financial risk and indexes have historically proven to be a more effective investing tool than actively managed funds. As more retail investors enter the space, crypto indexes like J’JO35, which offers exposure to the top 35 tokens by market capitalization, could become a popular choice due to its track record of steady, long-term growth with minimal effort. While last year saw the introduction of spot ETFs to crypto, 2025 may very well be the year that index investing finally plays a more prominent role in the digital asset ecosystem. AI and crypto wallets AI’s expanding role within crypto has been well documented, from AI trading algorithms and compliance to smart contract optimization and beyond. While the crypto industry has been one of the most aggressive industries in its approach to implementing agentic AI, the next big AI use case in crypto may be the use of voice assistants in crypto wallets. Tether made a splash in February when it announced that it would soon launch a series of AI apps that include an “AI Bitcoin wallet assistant.” This wallet assistant will help users manage transactions, track price changes, and keep funds secure—all via spoken commands. Tether has also introduced an SDK for developers to build customized AI agents for voice-controlled payment solutions. TOMI, a web3 infrastructure project building a privacy-oriented decentralized internet, just recently launched the first AI-powered voice assistant for a web3 wallet. This addition to the TOMI Wallet offers hands-free engagement with digital assets, enabling an intuitive and smoother user experience. With more AI voice command capabilities coming to other crypto wallets, such as GlobalEth’s SimplifAI demo, this development is part of the broader trend to integrate AI to improve the user experience.

In a new interview with Master Ventures founder Kyle Chasse, Hayes says that Bitcoin is likely to print a series of rallies this cycle amid an expansion of the monetary supply. “I think Bitcoin is going to hit a numerically interesting number. Now, obviously, I put a $1 million Bitcoin out there. I hope it hits a $1 million, but maybe it’s like $666,000 or $500,000 or $250,000 – some round number that in the human mind is significant for some arbitrary reason. We are going to hit that level and then we’re going to expect insane things out of the pace of fiat money creation. And at that point, it’s probably time to sell everything.” Hayes also believes that Bitcoin has moved away from its halving-based four-year cycle and instead its price action is driven by the level of fiat liquidity sloshing around the markets. Bitcoin’s halving is an event that slashes the BTC miner reward in half, triggering an imbalance between supply and demand that has previously coincided with rallies. “I think that the four-year Bitcoin halving cycle and sort of the miner profitability and how that swings over time made a lot more sense in terms of a market cycle when Bitcoin was a much smaller asset class… But now that Bitcoin and crypto are a bona fide asset class, they are talked about in every major financial network in the world, every central bank has an opinion on it, whether it’s good or whether it’s bad, you have the leader of the empire of the US talking about Bitcoin and policies… Now I think Bitcoin has transitioned from this sort of technological digital bare asset into the best smoke alarm for fiat liquidity that we have globally. Previously, that role was held by gold. Gold and Bitcoin have some different properties that make them react a little differently to things. And now I think we have a 24/7 market. Anyone with an internet connection can access it, and it’s really just driven [by] fiat liquidity.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,152 at time of writing, down 3.7% in the last 24 hours.

While giants like Notcoin are flexing their 30M user ecosystem and Popcat is going viral with Solana-powered hype, one underdog is climbing the charts with quiet precision and massive potential— Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). As Popcat claws its way up Solana rankings and Notcoin readies its official $NOT token listing, Arctic Pablo Coin is setting itself apart with a deflationary model, unique presale architecture, and jaw-dropping ROI prospects. With over $2 million raised and the project now entering Crystal Cove, its 16th location, Arctic Pablo is starting to turn heads far beyond the meme coin niche. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins—Arctic Pablo Coin, Notcoin, and Popcat—and what makes them the Top New Meme Coins to Join for 2025. Token Burns, Staking Rewards & Explosive ROI: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Dominates the Top New Meme Coins to Join for 2025 Scarcity drives value. And Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has baked this principle into its DNA with a weekly token burn model that permanently destroys unsold tokens during the presale. But that’s not all. At the end of the presale, any remaining unsold tokens will be torched too—leaving a leaner supply and a stronger long-term outlook for early supporters. These burns are transparently recorded on Binance Smart Chain, giving investors peace of mind and traceability. This strategy creates not just scarcity but serious momentum. Add to that a staking mechanism offering a generous 66% APY during the presale and a rewards-based referral system that pays users for growing the community. There’s also a gamified layer—community competitions—where holders can win in APC tokens or USD, deepening user engagement and virality. The no-stage presale model sets Arctic Pablo apart from typical launches. Instead of tiers, the project takes users on a journey across locations—each one ushering in a price jump. And right now, at Crystal Cove, it’s $0.000083 per token. With a listing price of $0.008, that equates to a current ROI potential of over 9552.41%. When it comes to the Top New Meme Coins to Join for 2025 , Arctic Pablo Coin is not just another contender—it’s the conversation starter. Crystal Cove Is Heating Up: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Price Surge Signals Final Entry Point in Top New Meme Coins to Join for 2025 Could Crystal Cove be the last stop before Arctic Pablo Coin takes off? The answer might be yes. Now in its 16th location, this meme-powered adventure is capturing attention with its skyrocketing presale momentum. The current price of $0.000083 offers one of the most attractive entry points in the meme coin presale —but it won’t stay there for long. With each new location, the price climbs, and early adopters see their potential gains grow. Over $2 million has already been raised, proving serious interest in this offbeat yet meticulously crafted project. As Arctic Pablo travels across phases with no warning of when the next location drop will occur, the opportunity to get in before the price jump becomes increasingly slim. The presale is not just a fundraising phase—it’s a living, evolving experience that rewards early movers. And at Crystal Cove, the risk-to-reward ratio is more favorable than ever. For anyone looking to invest in the Top New Meme Coins to Join for 2025, this is the moment that might just define 2025’s biggest ROI story. Notcoin Unleashes Telegram Game Domination Ahead of $NOT Token Launch Notcoin continues to dominate the social crypto sphere, with its Telegram-based click-to-earn game bringing in over 30 million users in record time. As part of the TON ecosystem, the game allows users to earn in-game coins that will soon be converted into real $NOT tokens upon the upcoming mainnet launch. This simple, gamified mechanic has turned Notcoin into a viral hit, generating daily buzz on social platforms and crypto Twitter. With such a huge base of pre-engaged users, the project’s token debut could see a surge of activity once live trading begins. Popcat Rides the Solana Meme Wave With Explosive Trading Volume Popcat has pounced into the spotlight as one of Solana’s most meme-able tokens. Recently achieving a 24-hour trading volume in the tens of millions, Popcat is quickly climbing the ranks with help from viral momentum and Solana’s blazing-fast transaction speeds. The coin’s playful branding, combined with organic community growth, has helped it stick out in an increasingly crowded meme coin scene. As Popcat adds more liquidity and builds out its tokenomics, many eyes are on what the next few weeks could bring. Final Words Meme coins are not just speculative assets anymore—they’re ecosystems, experiences, and movements. Notcoin is building a gamified empire through Telegram. Popcat is sprinting through Solana’s ecosystem with major traction. But it’s Arctic Pablo Coin that stands at the edge of something truly breakout-worthy. With its innovative token burn model, gamified presale structure, and high-earning staking options, APC presents a narrative—and a math-backed ROI—few others can match. As the presale surges forward from Crystal Cove, now is the time to enter before the next location kicks in and the price hikes again. For those scanning the horizon for the Top New Meme Coins to Join for 2025, Arctic Pablo Coin could be the one they’ll wish they hadn’t missed.

In a March 28 X post, Castle Island Ventures partner Nic Carter criticized Ethereum’s current trajectory, arguing that its Layer-2 networks are siphoning value away from the mainnet. He claimed that excessive token creation, accepted by the ETH community, has diluted the network’s investment potential. “The #1 cause of this is greedy ETH L2s siphoning value from the L1 and the social consensus that excess token creation was A-OK,” Carter wrote, adding that Ethereum “died by its own hand” due to token oversupply. His remarks came in response to Lekker Capital founder Quinn Thompson, who declared that Ethereum is “completely dead” as an investment. Thompson argued that while the network still holds utility, it no longer offers an attractive investment case. “A $225 billion market cap network that is seeing declines in transaction activity, user growth, and fees/revenues. There is no investment case here. As a network with utility? Yes. As an investment? Absolutely not,” Thompson stated. Layer-2 Solutions Pulling Value From Ethereum Mainnet The ETH/BTC ratio, which measures Ether’s strength against Bitcoin, recently hit 0.02260—its lowest level in nearly five years, according to TradingView data. At the time of writing, Ether is trading at approximately $1,894, reflecting a 5.34% decline over the past week, per CoinMarketCap data. The situation worsened in September 2024, when Ethereum’s fee revenue collapsed by 99% over a six-month period. Analysts attributed this to L2 networks absorbing transactions and fee revenue without contributing back to the base layer. However, Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran believes that Based Rollups could offer a solution. He argued that these rollups could redirect monetization back to Ethereum’s mainnet by reshaping the incentive structure, potentially reviving its value. Mixed Sentiment on ETH Future Despite the current bearish sentiment, some crypto traders remain optimistic. Pseudonymous traders Doctor Profit and Merlijn The Trader recently called Ethereum “the best opportunity in the market,” expressing bullish long-term views. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered lowered its 2025 ETH price estimate from $10,000 to $4,000—a 60% reduction—citing weaker-than-expected fundamentals.

However, one week later, the firm reversed course. “We will no longer be releasing a USD based algorithmic stable coin,” Cronje said in a March 28 X post. “Completely unrelated, we will be releasing a mathematically bound numerical Dirham which is settled and denominated in USD, which is definitely not a USD based algorithmic stable coin.” The shift in strategy comes shortly after the UAE announced it would launch its digital dirham central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the fourth quarter of 2025. Source: Andre Cronje Khaled Mohamed Balama, governor of the Central Bank of the UAE, said the blockchain-based dirham could enhance financial stability and help combat financial crime. The digital currency will be accepted alongside its physical counterpart in all payment channels, according to a report from the Khaleej Times.

Cronje himself previously admitted to experiencing Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to algorithmic stablecoin due to previous cycles: “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stable coins today, but previous cycle gave me so much PTSD not sure if we should implement.” In May 2022, the $40 billion Terra ecosystem collapsed, erasing tens of billions of dollars of value in a matter of days. Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), had been yielding an over 20% annual percentage yield (APY) on Anchor Protocol prior to its collapse. As UST lost its dollar peg, crashing to a low of around $0.30, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon took to X (then Twitter) to share his rescue plan. At the same time, the value of sister token LUNA — once a top 10 crypto project by market capitalization — plunged over 98% to $0.84. LUNA was trading north of $120 in early April 2022.

To reduce systemic risk, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) bill will prohibit algorithmic stablecoins to avoid another Terra-like failure. Meanwhile, stablecoins are increasingly being used for smaller, everyday payments rather than large transfers, according to CoinFund managing partner David Pakman. “We’ve seen a significant decrease in the size of each stablecoin transaction, which points to the fact that they are being used more as payments and less for large transfers,” Pakman said during Cointelegraph’s Chainreaction live show on X on March 27.

Far away from New York City boiler rooms paralyzed by Wall Street’s echo chambers and groupthink, the Oracle of Omaha ignored newspapers and television news stories. Instead, the world’s most successful investor ignored the noise and spent hours a day reading company financial statements to find signals. Buying and holding corporate stocks that others had overlooked, he proved to have a rare ability for picking huge winners that the rest of the market passed over. Warren Buffett Is Not Afraid of Missing Out on Bitcoin Gains As Buffett’s holdings grew by $18 billion so far this year, he cruised up the Bloomberg Billionaires Index past Bill Gates. Back in the 1990s, the Microsoft founder unseated Buffett as the richest man in the world. Now Warren Buffett himself is not a fan of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. But that’s more about his individual competence than his investing philosophy. He has famously avoided investing in tech companies throughout a career spanning the information technology revolution. He didn’t invest in Apple until 2016, but today it’s his biggest holding. Buffett says he avoided tech investments because he “doesn’t understand” computer companies and succeeds at investing by sticking to what he knows. But Saylor and Keiser Live in Constant FOMO on Bitcoin Michael Saylor is the new Warren Buffett. Like if you agree. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/huD2MDRsxE — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) March 24, 2025 Meanwhile, in just 15 years, Bitcoin’s total market capitalization has grown to surpass Berkshire Hathaway’s in size. Max Keiser, the Oracle of El Salvador, predicted something like this would happen. Another Bitcoin bull, Michael Saylor, has made so much (paper) profit from his BTC investments (north of $10 billion this Mar.), that followers are hailing him as the next Warren Buffett. The following six classic Warren Buffett quotes are considered great advice for any investor, but they are imminently and urgently applicable to Bitcoin’s price . 1. Contrarian Investing and Bitcoin’s Price “I will tell you how to become rich. Close the doors. Be fearful when others are greedy. Be greedy when others are fearful.” “The best chance to deploy capital is when things are going down.” The Bull Score Model, a weighted, multi-signal metric of the market’s “bullishness” or “bearishness” for Bitcoin’s price, dipped to 20 in March. That was its lowest level since Jan. 2023. Many read that as a leading indicator and sell in a mental state of fear, uncertainty, and doubt. But Buffett’s classic wisdom suggests this might be a good time to buy. After all, Jan. 2023’s low Bull Score Model print was a lagging indicator that showed up right after what turned out to be a two-year bottom in Bitcoin’s price and right before a two-year rally, and BTC’s strongest showing yet. Maybe that’s why Bitcoin ETF inflows flipped positive for the past several days. Bitcoin’s most vocal proponents , like Michael Saylor, Robert Kiyosaki, and Kevin O’Leary , contend that it was and remains the ultimate contrarian investment. 2. Discovering Altcoin Gems “You don’t find out who’s been swimming naked until the tide goes out.” Another famous Warren Buffett quote is about how market corrections can be revealing moments for investors. Everyone looks okay in bullish markets, but winners and losers can stick out when they falter. Crypto as well as stock markets tumbled starting on Feb. 19 this year and then began to recover mid-March. During that time, Bitcoin’s price took a spill and then flatlined. Altcoins that plunged during this period were overbought by investors. Meanwhile, coins that surged against heavy market headwinds exhibited fundamental value immune to the broader sentiment. One notable example is the Telegram app cryptocurrency Toncoin. Among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market cap, TON grew the most over that 7-day period— by a massive 37%. The runner up was way behind with 10% in gains for the week. ZetaChain, Cronos, and Bonk were three other notable altcoins that rallied through the market slump. 3. Sure Bets on Bitcoinization #Bitcoin is Digital Gold. pic.twitter.com/ulRRG0L45Y — Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 7, 2023 “Only buy something that you’d be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.” “Opportunities come infrequently. When it rains gold, put out the bucket, not the thimble.” “The biggest thing in making money is time. You don’t have to be particularly smart; you just have to be patient.” These Buffett quotes illustrate his fundamentalist (or “based” as the GenZ crowd would say) approach to investing. While it may seem out of sorts in crypto markets, where waves among altcoins come and go, it may be spot on for the cryptocurrency that everyone calls “digital gold.” That would be Bitcoin. With BTC firmly under the commodities column in the US government, the White House and congressional Republicans ushering in a national stockpile, and Wall Street giants like BlackRock piling up Bitcoin, global Bitcoinization appears to be well underway. Strategy founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor invests this way. He only buys what he’ll never sell, Saylor told Bloomberg in Feb. 2022— and for him, that’s Bitcoin. 4. Crypto Assets With Valuable Use Cases “Price is what you pay, value is what you get.” “Games are won by players who focus on the playing field –- not by those whose eyes are glued to the scoreboard.” In addition to scoping out foul-weather winners among altcoins during market downturns, crypto investors maximize their ROI (return on investment) by researching and selecting currencies that deliver tangible value. This is a cornerstone of Buffett’s famous fundamental or value investing philosophy. The Oracle of Omaha liked to pick stocks by gauging their market value against the actual performance of the underlying business. If he were looking at altcoins today, he might for example, take a closer look at Helium Network after its HNT tokens took a 20% loss in quarter over quarter exchange prices despite a 20% increase in QoQ hotspots, the devices that power its Internet sharing service. That could signal a bargain buy. Other notable altcoins with clear and present use cases are Chainlink, Render, and Filecoin.

It seems so, as XRP’s price has tumbled hard since Brad Garlinghouse’s triumphant announcement last week. Is the hype over, or can something bring back Ripple’s cross-border token? Lawsuit Closure It all started over four years ago, in December 2020, when the US SEC went after Ripple for selling unregistered securities (XRP) for $1.3 billion. The hit against Ripple was immediate as exchanges delisted the token, while former partners went away . The following four years were filled with twists and turns, but the company was actually in the lead, at least according to several court rulings that went its way. Moreover, its top two execs were exonerated. The SEC notched a minor win when Judge Torrest ruled that Ripple has to pay $125 million in penalties, but that was far off the $2 billion the agency asked for, which is why it appealed in 2024. However, that appeal was dropped last week when the company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced on X that the case had essentially ended with the Commission’s decision. Ripple’s CLO confirmed that the firm has dropped its own appeal, which marked the end of the lawsuit. Oh, and the company still needs to make a payment to the SEC, but it’s not $2 billion, not even $125 million – only $50 million. Although the lawsuit’s conclusion is not a landslide victory for Ripple, it sure seems as if the company emerged as the moral winner. So, you would expect a massive surge for XRP, right? No Surge, Just Correction As with all major announcements, XRP reacted well to Garlinghouse’s statement last week and went from $2.3 to $2.6 within minutes. While many anticipated this to be the start of a major rally, the reality is entirely different. XRP lost almost all gains within a day or two and was stuck below $2.5 for a while. However, the market-wide retracement hit the asset hard. As of press time, XRP is down to $2.05, which means that it has lost over 20% of the peak from last week. Its battle with USDT for the third spot in terms of market cap seems lost, as there’s a $25 billion gap between the two now. Moreover, a popular analyst warned recently that XRP could plunge toward $1.2 if the $2 support is broken to the downside, which is now being tested. All in all, the signs point that this was a classic ‘ sell-the-news ‘ event for XRP’s price even though Ripple is winning on multiple fronts. Nevertheless, certain factors could still reverse the asset’s price trajectory in the following months, such as the potential to have its own ETF in the States or Ripple going public. Or, perhaps, those could have already been priced in, and there’s more pain ahead.

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. A 2019 video featured Gary Gensler, former Securities and Exchange Commission chair, referring to Algorand as a great technology and using it as an example when discussing the decentralization of cryptocurrencies. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction.

Its trading volume dropped by 13.48% in 24 hours signaling a waning interest from traders.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO’s bear run is rising, with the fear and greed index showing a fear sentiment among investors. Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications is dropping, with the charts showing its volatility will rise over the short term. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is dropping from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024, the drop could be attributed to the crypto market’s correction, which saw Bitcoin drop below $99,000. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending in 2028. Can Algorand reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending in 2031. Can Algorand reach $20? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $20 in the period ending in 2031. Can algo reach $100 dollars? At $100, Algorand’s market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorancd is highly unlikely to reach $100. Is there a future for Algorand? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. What will Algorand be worth in 2025? For the last month of 2025, ALGO’s price will range between $0.2960 and $0.4313. The average price for the period will be $0.3900. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term. Recent news Enel Group, an Italian green energy company, has partnered with crypto wallet provider Conio to allow fractional ownership of solar panels on the Algorand blockchain.

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.40 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million, while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to Coinmarketcap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.64 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.30 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It now trades at $0.13. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 below the $0.40 mark in January, $0.35 in February, and $0.21 in March.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-29 12:07:54

This news alone should be enough to rally new crypto projects like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . GameStop is Brewing Something Big, Potentially Rallying the Best Altcoins to Buy Soon Rumors about GameStop investing big in Bitcoin have been circulating for a while, with Ryan Cohen ramping up the heat when he announced a $1.3B Bitcoin convertible bond plan . While the news was positive for the crypto-sphere, GameStop’s stocks crashed by 25%, from close to $29 to just above $21 within a day. The crash was attributed to several factors, including the investors’ distrust with the investment. Furthermore, Wedbush analyst, Michael Pachter, claimed that GameStop’s Bitcoin investment is unlikely to produce results similar to those seen in MicroStrategy. The reason being the company’s already overvalued stocks: ‘With GameStop already trading at more than 2x its cash holdings, it is unlikely that its conversion of cash into Bitcoin will drive an even greater premium,’ Pachter stated in a note to his clients. This news came just days after the same GameStop announced adding $BTC as a treasury reserve asset, marking the company’s clearest pro-crypto shift. That being said, GameStop’s post-Bitcoin performance is inconsequential to the crypto market’s response. Whether the company’s stocks explode or implode, the Bitcoin bull is impervious to damage. For this reason, we expect the most promising meme coins to make an impact this year. Let’s look at three of the juiciest prospects. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) Upgrades the Solana Network for Lower Fees Solaxy ($SOLX) is a Layer 2 upgrade for the Solana ecosystem. The project aims to solve some of the core problems with Solana’s infrastructure, mainly its transaction speed, high fees, network congestion, and failed transactions. The Solaxy upgrade plans to bundle transactions for infinite scalability, reduce downtime during network crashes, and support seamless chain activity during congestion hours. Users will also experience lower fees and faster transaction confirmations as the system ticks its roadmap milestones. $SOLX qualifies as a meme coin with real-world utility, harnessing value from both worlds. The token currently sits at $0.001678, with the presale having accumulated over $28M so far. Stakers enjoy an APY of 144%, which is bound to drop as more people join the staking pool. If there ever was a coin that could explode in 2025 worth investing in, Solana’s first L2 is definitely it. 2. Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) Offers Holders Long-term Bitcoin Airdrops Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is currently one of the best altcoins and most intriguing crypto projects around, as it provides investors with Bitcoin airdrops. The meme coin rests on the idea that Bitcoin will evaluate past the $1M-mark and plans to create hype and rally the community to help with that. To that end, the project provides investors with multiple benefits, such as Bitcoin airdrops at key $BTC price milestones ($150K, $200K) and a massive $BTCBULL airdrop when $BTC reaches $250K. You need to keep your $BTCBULL in a Best Wallet account to qualify for the upcoming airdrops. Based on this, Bitcoin Bull Token is more than a meme project; it actually holds utility as a Bitcoin cheerleader, helping the King coin gain value and grow along with it. The presale is currently at $4.2M with a token price of $0.002435 and a staking APY of 99%, so if you’re planning to buy $BTCBULL , now’s the time. Our price prediction shows a potential price of $0.00835 by the year’s end (a 243% growth from the current price). 3. Keyboard Cat ($KEYCAT) Offering Juicy ROI with Intense Chart Performance Keyboard Cat ($KEYCAT) is Charlie Schmidt’s brainchild, based on his beloved cat Fatso, which he recorded ‘playing a piano’ back in 1984. The meme caught on fast and produced a number of copycats (heh) over the years. While it’s purely a meme project, with no real-world utility, Keyboard Cat has endured for decades in the online sphere and more than a year in the crypto market. Not only that, but its chart performance has been on an overall upward trajectory (15.4% lifetime growth) since the beginning, with several noticeable spikes along the way. The biggest one was recorded in November, 2024, when $KEYCAT jumped from $0.005094 to $0.0151 for a massive 196% growth . Another spike is in full effect right now, with the token recording a 38% increase over the past 24 hours. Will GameStop Rally the Crypto Market? If Ryan Cohen decides to follow Kip Herriage’s suggestion of a $2.5B (or more) Bitcoin buy, the crypto market as a whole could explode. GameStop’s interest in Bitcoin is clearly past the talk phase, as the company has taken concrete steps to bring their investment goals to life. This means that we may be closer to a bull run than we think. So, keep an eye on the best upcoming crypto projects like Solaxy ($SOLX) and Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) because good things may be coming. Don’t forget that this is not financial advice.

The 1985-founded Japanese animation studio of Hayao Miyazaki is beautifully transitioning the users’ normal images into Ghibli films’ aesthetics and art styles in a matter of few minutes. However, this new trend has raised the questions on the future of the creative art as it is being exploited freely, without any IP restrictions. With the accelerating trend, there are many users who have questioned and expressed their frustration at this growing narrative, with some called it “depressing.” Notably, this trend has also generated a memecoins frezy in the market with the GHIBLI anime themed Doge surging 4% and the GHIBLI token reaching a market cap of c. $28.3 million within a day. It's profoundly depressing seeing all the Studio Ghibli-styled AI output tacitly being used to promote OpenAI's latest product. Miyazaki famously called AI-produced art ""an insult to life itself""—and this in turn is an insult to one of our greatest-ever animators and artists — Brian Merchant (@bcmerchant) March 26, 2025 Perhaps coming as a saviour in the miserably growing trend, the SBI Group-backed gaming-focused Oasys Blockchain has announced its strategic partnership with AnimeChain. The partnership aims to develop blockchain solutions for intellectual property (IP) protection of anime content in the AI era, particularly against AI-generated content that mimics existing art styles—such as the Ghibli Trend. Though not announcing any direct connection with the Ghibli trend, the arrival of partnership couldn’t be more suitable. Can the partnership provide protection in the times of Ghibli Trend ​ The partnership between Oasys and AnimeChain will strategically work to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content, such as the “Ghibli trend,” by enhancing intellectual property (IP) protection mechanisms. In order to ensure the transparency and legitimacy of the generative AI, Japan-based AnimeChain aims to record the development process of anime using AI on the blockchain. The decentralised approach will provides creators with more control over how their content is used in AI-generated works. Further, Anime Chain in its white paper has highlighted its goal is “to create an environment where quality content can be produced more swiftly, even with limited personnel”. It aims to provide blockchain and AI-powered solutions for the fast production of anime content to prevent potential industry stagnation due to labor shortages in Japan and growing exploitations of creators and artists at the hand of AI. The partnership besides working for streamlining the anime production process, will enable creators to register, track, and authenticate their works on the blockchain. This will help in preventing the unauthorized AI-generated replicas by ensuring verifiable ownership. It will leverage Oasys’ smart contracts for automated licensing with which creators can set conditions for how their work can be used. Further, automated licensing agreements can help in ensuring fair use and compensation for original creators. With AI revolutionizing creative production, IP protection has never been more important. That's why we're partnering with AnimeChain to explore blockchain-powered copyright solutions. Oasys & @anime_chain : Protecting IPs in the AI Era! https://t.co/CdLeIHY1k2 — Oasys Blockchain (@oasyschain) March 28, 2025 How will Oasys help Notably, Oasys provides a high-performance blockchain infrastructure with fast transaction speeds and low latency. This makes it ideal for managing large-scale IP registrations which the AnimeChain is aiming to record. Further, Oasys is backed by prominent gaming and blockchain companies, including SEGA, Ubisoft, and Yield Guild Games, who serve as initial validators for the platform. They also bring experience for the partnership in working with already IP-focused industries. This will provide a robust and secure network for the partnership’s aim while fostering innovation within the industry. Embracing Creativity with Artistic Integrity With blockchain and AI both evolving rapidly, the Oasys-AnimeChain partnership could set a new industry standard for IP security and monetization in digital content. As AI-generated anime gains popularity – exemplified by Ghibli Trend – protecting original creators has never been more crucial. Miyazaki spent his entire life building one of the most expansive and imaginative bodies of work, all so you could rip it off and use it as a filter for your vacation photos. Not into this one bit. Protect artists. — Robbie Shilstone (@shilstone_arts) March 26, 2025 More such efforts must be made in the line to ensure that anime artists and studios can look forward to a more secure, fair, and innovative future in the unprecedented digital era.

The “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author specifically highlighted silver as his top near-term investment pick. “For many, many years I have been recommending people not save ‘fake money’ a.k.a.

He argued that Bitcoin has made it easy for everyone to become rich, but many will miss the opportunity due to this fear of making errors. Kiyosaki suggested that “the FOMO crowd investing in Bitcoin will accelerate into generational wealth” while “the FOMM crowd will wait till Bitcoin passed $200k this year and say ‘Bitcoin is too expensive.'” The financial author encouraged his audience to conduct independent research by following figures who both support and criticize Bitcoin. He suggested following Jeff Booth, Michael Saylor, and Samson Mow. Kiyosaki also emphasized that “the most important financial education is no longer from schools or Wall Street” but is freely available through platforms like YouTube.

With prices inching dangerously close to critical liquidation thresholds around $1,805, analysts warn that a sharper correction could be on the horizon. This downturn places $238 million worth of ETH at risk, as two major MakerDAO whales face potential liquidation. As the market braces for volatility, traders are closely watching whether bulls can defend current levels—or if bears are preparing to force a deeper breakdown. Whales at Risk: $238M ETH Faces Liquidation The latest ETH sell-off is testing the resilience of highly leveraged DeFi positions. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain , two large Ethereum holders on MakerDAO are on the verge of liquidation. Combined, they hold 125,603 ETH, currently valued at $238 million. As Ethereum trades near $1,874, their positions are approaching liquidation triggers at $1,805 and $1,787. The health rate of these vaults—a key indicator of collateral stability—has now dropped to 1.07, raising the likelihood of forced asset sales. As the $ETH price drops, the 125,603 $ETH ($238M) held by these two whales on #Maker is at risk of liquidation again. The health rate has dropped to $1.07, with liquidation prices at $1,805 and $1,787, respectively. https://t.co/0QEJXGq0Lg https://t.co/sDWFBgfGLf pic.twitter.com/iEEDZTg945 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 29, 2025 If ETH falls below these levels, the Maker protocol will automatically liquidate collateral, potentially flooding the market with ETH and triggering a broader wave of sell pressure across DeFi. This scenario could amplify bearish momentum and rattle confidence in leveraged on-chain strategies. Ethereum Price Action Signals Further Weakness Ethereum has broken below its symmetrical triangle support near $1,880, a key level that had held for weeks. The current price action around $1,850 suggests increasing selling pressure. Technical indicators provide little comfort for bulls: Relative Strength Index (RSI) has plunged to 28, signaling extreme oversold conditions. The 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart sits at $1,955, well above current price levels. An ABCD harmonic pattern completed near the recent low, hinting at continuation of the bearish move. If Ethereum breaks decisively below $1,822, the next support zones lie at $1,754 and $1,680. Only a recovery above $1,880 and a close above $1,955 would indicate a meaningful trend reversal. Market Outlook: DeFi Liquidations in Focus The potential liquidation of whale-sized positions highlights a persistent risk in decentralized finance—automated liquidations with no manual stop-losses. While DeFi offers transparency, its rigid mechanics can lead to sharp, sudden moves during periods of volatility. Key Points to Watch: A breakdown below $1,805 could trigger liquidation of 125K ETH. RSI suggests conditions are oversold, but recovery remains uncertain. ETH must reclaim $1,880–$1,955 to regain bullish structure. While oversold readings could prompt a temporary bounce, the looming threat of major liquidations suggests downside risks remain elevated unless sentiment shifts swiftly. BTC Bull: Earn Bitcoin Rewards with the Hottest Crypto Presale BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) is making waves as a community-driven token that automatically rewards holders with real Bitcoin when BTC hits key price milestones. Unlike traditional meme tokens, BTCBULL is built for long-term investors, offering real incentives through airdropped BTC rewards and staking opportunities. Staking & Passive Income Opportunities BTC Bull offers a high-yield staking program with an impressive 119% APY, allowing users to generate passive income. The staking pool has already attracted 882.5 million BTCBULL tokens, highlighting strong community participation.

This downtrend comes as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, addresses the ETH desliting rumor. The founder said the rumor that claims Binance will delist Ethereum is not true. Mockingly, CZ added, “Whoever believes this deserves to be poor.” The crypto market is torn between investors who believe that Bitcoin (BTC) is heading into a bear market and traders who think the second quarter of 2025 will resume the bull run, potentially pushing Bitcoin’s price to new highs. As a result of this uncertainty, Ethereum and other altcoins are suffering, leading to massive losses. Regardless of what crypto investors believe, if BTC price continues to drop lower, ETH’s value will continue to plummet as well. Can price crash below $1,500? Let’s explore key support and resistance level to watch along with Ethereum price prediction and analysis. Ethereum Price Prediction & Analysis After Binance Delisting ETH Rumor Dies Down The monthly or weekly charts for Ethereum shows that the bullish trend is in jeopardy. However, the bulls can still make a comeback if the $1,492 support level or roughly $1,500 barrier is defended. A strong demand around $1,500 that creates a bottom could reignite the bull run for Ethereum price. This forecast for ETH is based purely price action formed on the monthly or weekly. ETH/USDT 1-month chart The short-term outlook for Ethereum price and the bias is revealed when looking at the daily time price opportunity (TPO) chart. This chart tracks the time spent by Ethereum at key levels rather than volume. The price action for ETH between March 10 and 17, created a value area that extends from $1,874 to $1,924. The recent crash in Ethereum was supported by demand in this area. So far, the value area low at $1,874 is holding strong. If the outlook for Bitcoin improves, investors can expect price to bounce and revisit the $2,000 psychological level next. This is the short-term target for next week. From a swing trade perspective, investors can expect the Point of Controls (POCs) at $2,180, $2,286, and $2,362 as the next key take profit levels, assuming the $1,874 support level holds. ETH 1-day TPO chart So, the chances of Ethereum price dropping below $1,500 is slim especially if Bitcoin price halts its south-bound move and sets upa higher low here. Regardless, some expect, BTC to drop to $82K, which could suggest that there is a chance ETH could hit $1,500, but a breakdown of this key level on weekly or month level is highly unlikely. A hopeful outlook for the future is the SEC’s approval of Ethereum ETF staking, which could improve the odds for Ethereum price and potentially spark a bounce to $3K or higher.

Chainlink (LINK) Investor Data Suggests Key Price Zones,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/chainlink/support-or-resistance-chainlink-link-investor-data-suggests-key-price-zones/,"Market prices of Chainlink (LINK) suffered another major decline in the past 24 hours as the general crypto market continued to react negatively to US new international tariffs. Over the last two months, LINK has exhibited a prolonged downtrend losing over 40% of its market value. Amidst this bearish market, popular analytics company Glassnode has highlighted two price cluster levels that have shaped investors’ behavior in this period. Related Reading: 640,000 Chainlink (LINK) Withdrawn From Exchanges In 24 Hours – Bullish Accumulation? Chainlink’s CBD Data Reveals Key Investor Clusters At $14.6 And $16 – What Could This Mean? In a recent post on X, Glassnode shared valuable on-chain insights on the LINK market using Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) – a metric that reveals at what prices investors acquired their assets, thus helping to determine potential resistance or support zones. According to Glassnode, LINK’s data has identified two price levels with high accumulation activity i.e. $16 and $14.6, noting that both price zones feature long-term investors who have remained active since August-October 2024. In analyzing transactions at the $16 price level, Glassnode discovered that investors at this level have shown strategic repositioning by actively accumulating during downtrends. Source: @glassnode on XThis positive development has been observed during a price drop from $29 to $19 in December, a correction to around $18 in February, and most recently as prices reached a new low of $12.70 on March 11. Glassnode explains that these recurring transactions indicate the presence of high-conviction holders at $16.0 with strong long-term confidence in LINK and are thus less likely to sell their holdings. Conversely, LINK holders at $14.6 have shown a less active but more timely accumulation by investors at this price level. Glassnode shows that these investors increased their holdings during key phases such as when LINK traded at $17 and $28 in December, at $25 in January, and on March 15 following a major price gain from $12. These observations also suggest current LINK holders are not fast money allocators but patient and confident of a future price accumulation. Related Reading: Whale Grabs 506 Billion PEPE—Is A Price Explosion Near? What Next For Chainlink? At press time, LINK trades at $14.0 just below the key cluster level at $14.6. The proximity to this accumulation zone indicates the market is at a critical juncture. However, Glassnode data suggests that holders at the $14.6 are not fast money traders and are likely to reinforce their position through another accumulation. If this positive scenario occurs, LINK could reclaim $14.6 and $16 which could serve as important support structures in a potential market rebound.

Bridging Blockchains to the Real World: Chainlink’s Promise Chainlink is a network that helps smart contracts access real-world data. Think of smart contracts as agreements that execute automatically when certain conditions are met. Chainlink connects these contracts to external information, like prices or weather reports, through a network of “oracles.” These oracles fetch data from outside the blockchain and deliver it securely. To ensure accuracy, Chainlink uses a reputation system where data providers are rated based on performance. This system combines on-chain and off-chain processes to make data handling efficient and reliable. In today’s market, Chainlink stands out because it solves a key problem: connecting blockchains to external data sources. As more applications require trustworthy data, Chainlink’s role becomes even more important. The LINK token powers this ecosystem by rewarding those who provide data and securing the network through staking. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, LINK has a clear purpose and utility. With the growing interest in decentralized finance and applications that interact with the real world, Chainlink seems well-positioned. However, as with any technology, it’s wise to stay informed and consider market trends when evaluating its potential. Polkadot: Bridging Blockchains for a Connected Future Polkadot is transforming the way blockchains interact. It’s a decentralized network that allows different blockchains, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, to share information and value without needing a middleman. This means data can flow securely between separate chains. Polkadot uses parachains to boost speed and handle more transactions at once. This makes it faster than both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The network’s token, DOT, lets users take part in decision-making and secure the system by staking. Created by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched in 2020 by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to make blockchains more connected and efficient. In today’s crypto landscape, Polkadot stands out with its innovative technology and strong foundation. Its ability to link different blockchains addresses a key challenge in the industry. While other networks may struggle with slow transactions, Polkadot’s design offers a scalable solution. This aligns with market trends focusing on interoperability and speed. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Polkadot presents a unique approach that could influence the future direction of blockchain development. As the market evolves, technologies like Polkadot may play a significant role in shaping a more connected digital world.

This significant move, made through litigation releases filed March 27 , signals what some consider a change in the regulator’s regulatory strategy. SEC Ends Legal Actions Against Crypto Firms In a simultaneous stipulation, the SEC indicated that the move was made pursuant to regulatory recalibration—not based on the merits of the initial charges. “The Commission’s decision to exercise its discretion and close this pending enforcement action. does not necessarily reflect the Commission’s position in any other case,” the SEC said. Although this move releases the companies from continuous litigation, the announcement was quick to state that it does not establish a precedent for other crypto-related cases ongoing. Political Changes Could Be Behind New Policy The timing of this change is also significant in happening just after Donald Trump’s reelection. Trump has been openly supportive of crypto-friendly policies, which could have been behind the changing attitude of the SEC. Kraken, sued last November 2023 for alleged securities violations, verified the dismissal of the case on March 3. “Happy to close this chapter now,” wrote Kraken Co-CEO Dave Ripley in an email to X. Whether or not there would be the dismissal of the remaining pending cases is uncertain, but analysts expect further deregulation in the coming years. SEC Still Faces Industry Skepticism While the thrown-out cases are a welcome relief for the involved companies, crypto players remain wary. Confidence, most argue, is far from being restored. The crypto industry remains to demand clearer regulation, consistent enforcement, and open communication with regulators. Dismissing lawsuits is a start—but continued progress will depend on how the SEC moves forward from here. If this is the beginning of a more cooperative model, it could be a turning point for U.S. crypto policy.",Blockchain|Sticky|Regulation|SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-29 12:41:18

In 2028, HBAR is predicted to trade at a maximum price of $1.01, with an average price of $0.83. By 2031, HBAR could trade between $2.56 and $3.04, with an average price of $2.63. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) cryptocurrency is one of the altcoins that enjoyed the bullish crypto market of 2021. As a result, traders and investors have since taken a keen interest in the digital coin. Moreover, the Hedera Hashgraph network shows prospects of becoming a force in the blockchain space. Every crypto investor asks: When will HBAR’s price rise again? Despite the overall bear market, the price momentum of the HBAR coin has been somewhat positive. With trading indicators pointing at a possible uptrend and the positive perception of HBAR, we might see a bullish scenario happening sooner: perhaps a retest of its all-time high.

Image Source: Trading view Based on the 1-day chart for Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) on March 29, the asset appears to be under sustained bearish pressure. The price is hovering near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating downward momentum and suggesting oversold conditions. RSI currently reads 36.92, aligning with bearish territory but not yet at extreme levels, implying there could be further room for a decline before a technical rebound. The narrowing Bollinger Bands reflect reduced volatility, often preceding a breakout. Unless the price reclaims support above the 20-day SMA (around $0.189), bearish sentiment may dominate. Traders should remain cautious as no strong reversal signals have emerged yet. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBAR/USD chart . Image Source: Trading view Based on the 4-hour chart for Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), the technical indicators suggest bearish to neutral momentum. The price has dropped below the middle line of the Bollinger Bands and is testing the lower band, signaling downward pressure. The MACD line is slightly below the signal line, indicating fading bullish momentum or early bearish crossover. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power (BoP) is at -0.49, showing sellers currently hold the upper hand. Unless HBAR breaks back above the $0.18 resistance level or shows a reversal pattern, continued consolidation or mild decline may follow. Traders should watch for a volatility breakout. What can you expect from the HBAR price analysis next? Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is currently showing signs of continued bearish pressure. On the 1-day chart, the price is trending downward and hovering near the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting weakness in market sentiment. The RSI is below the midpoint, reflecting a lack of bullish momentum, and there are no clear signals of immediate reversal. On the 4-hour chart, the MACD histogram is slightly negative, while the Balance of Power indicator confirms seller dominance. Unless HBAR reclaims key resistance levels around $0.18, the short-term outlook remains bearish with potential for further consolidation or decline.

Hedera Hashgraph distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which promises higher speed, security, and scalability than traditional blockchain technologies. This positions HBAR as a potentially innovative player in distributed ledger technology, catering to various applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These notable features could spur HBAR to new highs in the coming months and years, making it a profitable investment tool. Will HBAR reach $1? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $1 is possible but depends on several key factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and overall crypto sentiment. HBAR has strong fundamentals with its fast, low-cost transactions and backing from major enterprises. If adoption grows within industries like DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, demand for HBAR could push prices higher. However, competition from other layer-1 blockchains and regulatory factors may slow its growth. A bullish crypto cycle and wider institutional interest would be necessary for HBAR to reach $1. While achievable, sustained utility and investor confidence are crucial for long-term price appreciation. What will HBAR be worth in 2025? By 2025, HBAR is expected to be worth $0.34 How much will HBAR cost in 2030? By 2030, HBAR is expected to be worth $2.10 Can HBAR reach $20? HBAR reaching $20 would require an extraordinary market rally and widespread adoption, making it highly unlikely in the near future. For context, with HBAR’s current circulating supply of around 33 billion tokens, a $20 price would push its market capitalization to $660 billion, placing it among the largest cryptocurrencies, rivaling Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where to buy HBAR? Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $2.23 and $2.65, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.34 by 2025 and $0.50 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support. Recent news/opinion on HBAR Nasdaq has applied to list an ETF holding Hedera’s HBAR token. This follows multiple filings by exchanges and asset managers seeking altcoin-based ETFs. The SEC must approve the listing before trading begins. In November, Canary Capital filed for its Canary HBAR ETF to provide investors exposure to Hedera’s native currency. Hedera Hashgraph price prediction March 2025 The Hedera Hashgraph price prediction for March 2025 suggests a consistent projection, with potential prices ranging from a low of $0.21, an average of around $0.23, to a high of $0.24.

November saw a rebound, with HBAR reaching $0.3012 and $3.34B in trading volume, closing the year near $0.29 after peaking at $0.30 in December.

Out of the many projects on the rise, one coin occupies the position of the clear winner: Ozak AI . The coin raised over $900,000 in just a few days , and experts suggest it's likely to be regarded as the most explosive AI token for 2025. Here is why. The Gold Rush for AI in Crypto Artificial intelligence affects the entire technical world-in the same way, it is not left behind when it comes to blockchain. Several people are already mobilizing amongst the available AI-powered value-driven cryptocurrencies as investors feel these assets would change the existing tradition of data analysis to automation and decentralized AI services. Market analysts have critiqued how AI cryptos could still be the next big narrative during this year's bull run, emphasizing the explosive growth in both DeFi and meme coins. NVIDIA reaches mind-boggling valuations, and AI startups pull in billions; investor sentiment does not seem to prove the contradictions of turning towards highly promising, high-growth AI tokens under such conditions. Ozak AI: Leading the Charge Among the hype, Ozak AI ($OZ) emerges as the important contender for massive gains. Built on a next-gen AI blockchain framework, Ozak AI meshes machine learning with decentralized finance (DeFi), producing real-world applications in data processing, predictive analytics, and AI-driven trading. Ozak AI presale is currently in stage 3, with each token sold at $0.003. The next stage will see a price increase of 400% to $0.005 from the initial price of $0.001. Even though experts say the $OZ token will climb to $1 (a 50,000% ROI) before the end of 2025 due to its planned exchange listing price of $0.05. Features driving investor excitement include: AI-Powered Trading Tools: Ozak AI integrates advanced algorithms to optimize trading strategies giving users the advantages and winning edges in volatile markets. Decentralized AI Marketplace: Users access and monetize their AI models, creating a winner's ecosystem for developers and businesses. Hyper-Deflationary Tokenomics: $OZ becomes more scarce over time, using a built-in burn mechanism that adds value over the long term.

According to our Litecoin price prediction, the LTC price might hit the $500 mark in 2028. However, this rally depends on the future buying interest in the altcoin market.

Despite the recent adjustments and potential peak formation, Litecoin exhibits a robust long-term price trajectory and outlook, indicating a high potential for future growth. If the network continues to witness robust activities and growth, the price might reach $1000 in no time. Recent news/opinion on Litecoin The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accepted Canary Capital’s proposal for a spot Litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF), potentially making it the third cryptocurrency with an ETF in the U.S. after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Pakman also suggested that the rise in capital flowing onchain, combined with growing interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), could further support decentralized finance (DeFi) activity: “If we have a moment this year where ETFs are permitted to provide staking rewards or yield to holders, that unlocks really meaningful uplift in DeFi activity, broadly defined.” Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETP ‘key’ for EU adoption despite low inflow expectations The aggregate stablecoin supply stood at an all-time high of above $208 billion across the five largest stablecoins on March 28, according to Glassnode data. Stablecoins, aggregate supplies. Source: Glassnode “This is the major catalyst that’s been missing for over a decade: a major movement of people’s wealth onchain that brings everyone else on,” added Pakman. The growing stablecoin supply recently surpassed $219 billion and continues to rise, suggesting that the market is “likely still mid-cycle” as opposed to the top of the bull run, according to IntoTheBlock analysts. Elon Musk’s sale of X to xAI just made fraud lawsuit “a lot spicer” Billionaire investor Elon Musk has sold his social media platform X to his AI startup xAI, sparking controversy as it coincides with a US judge rejecting his bid to dismiss a lawsuit tied to the social media platform. The transfer of ownership of X to xAI on March 28 means that the class-action lawsuit against Musk — accusing him of defrauding former Twitter shareholders by delaying the disclosure of his initial investment in the social media platform — has become “a whole lot spicer,” Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran said in a March 28 X post. Source: Grok On the same day that Musk said “xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” a US judge reportedly rejected Musk’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit. Cochran said it has “opened up his AI entity to exposure here too, and it’s a much bigger pie.” Musk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, factoring in $12 billion in debt from the $45 billion valuation. He originally bought X, formerly Twitter, for around $44 billion in April 2022 . US regulators FDIC and CFTC ease crypto restrictions for banks, derivatives The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said in a March 28 letter that institutions under its oversight, including banks, can now engage in crypto-related activities without prior approval . The announcement comes as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that digital asset derivatives wouldn’t be treated differently than any other derivatives. The FDIC letter rescinds a previous instruction under former US President Joe Biden’s administration that required institutions to notify the agency before engaging in crypto-related activities. According to the FDIC’s definition: ”Crypto-related activities include, but are not limited to, acting as crypto-asset custodians; maintaining stablecoin reserves; issuing crypto and other digital assets; acting as market makers or exchange or redemption agents; participating in blockchain- and distributed ledger-based settlement or payment systems, including performing node functions; as well as related activities such as finder activities and lending.” FDIC-supervised institutions should consider associated risks when engaging in crypto-related activities, it said. These risks include market and liquidity risks, operational and cybersecurity risks, consumer protection requirements, and Anti-Money Laundering requirements.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|BCH|ETH|USDT|XRP|MATIC|ZK|ADA|TON|BNB|WLD|SOL|APT|ARB|AVAX|LINK|ASIA|MINING|USDC|FIAT|ARKM|BUSINESS|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-29 13:28:32

With the US Personal Consumption Expenditures releasing the inflation number, the BTC price and rest market is in complete turmoil, but is this just momentary or long lasting? Let’s discuss this. Crypto Market News: February U.S. PCE Inflation Data Hit 2.5% The PCE inflation index is a key metric used by the U.S. Federal Reserve to measure inflation. Higher-than-expected data affects the Fed’s decisions on various monetary policies, so it is an important metric. More importantly, it affects the global financial markets, including the BTC price. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the inflation rate for February was 2.5% , as expected. However, the core PCE (excluding food and energy) came 0.1% higher than the forecast 2.7%, signaling a persistent surge. Experts believe that the rising inflation is not entirely positive news, especially for the crypto market. This could eventually delay the Fed’s interest rate cut decisions. More importantly, they fear that stagflation could set in if inflation remains high. The March FOMC meeting kept the interest rates unchanged , but there’s high anticipation around the next meeting to witness cuts and a Bitcoin price rally. For now, digital assets are in turmoil, declining with the ongoing market downtrend. BTC Price and Crypto Market Crashed With PCE Inflation Data, What’s Next? The cryptocurrency market had already been suffering for weeks amid investors’ bearish sentiments. The US PCE inflation data has brought further volatility as millions have been liquidated in longs, and the total market cap has declined by nearly 3%. In this, the BTC price has declined 3.3%, trading at its lowest point in nearly a week at $82.4k. Along with that, most altcoins are down with the HYPE, TON, FLOKI, and many others being the biggest losers per CoinmarketCap heatmap. As the bears dominate the market, investors fear a further drop, significantly as analysts like Peter Bradnt predict Bitcoin price crash to $65,635. However, the February inflation data is basically neutral to bearish and does not have a long-term impact unless the Fed’s decision intervenes or Donald Trump’s tariff stretches. In addition to these, the rising yield can add downward pressure. Despite the possibility, the long-term Bitcoin price prediction remains bullish, with analysts like Michaël van de Poppe and others foreseeing an upward trend. Additionally, the U.S. Strategy Bitcoin Reserve and SEC’s changing regulatory approach to fuel the rally. Final Thoughts: Crypto and BTC Price to Recover After a Pause The U.S. PCE inflation data has fueled the crypto market’s uncertainty, beginning a short-term downtrend. Amid this turmoil, digital assets like Bitcoin and others are in a crucial zone, either toward an uptrend or crash, This will entirely depend on the investors’ sentiments and macroeconomic trends. The upcoming few days could be challenging for investors due to high uncertainty, but experts believe that a BTC price rebound is imminent.

You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. One left? The narrative The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission appears to have closed almost all of its outstanding crypto-related cases — at least the publicly disclosed ones — in the last two months since Mark Uyeda took over as acting chair of the agency. In many of the court filings, the SEC argued that it needs to pull these cases while the regulator's new crypto task force reassesses how exactly it applies securities laws to digital assets, though in at least some of these cases the SEC is leaving itself no recourse to sue again should it find some cryptos from previously active suits are indeed securities. Why it matters TKTK Breaking it down Ripple : Ripple announced it had reached an agreement with the SEC to drop both the SEC's appeal of a federal judge's 2023 ruling and RIpple's cross-appeal. Ripple will receive back $75 million of the $125 million fine it was assessed by a federal judge. The agreement does not yet appear to be on the public court docket. Coinbase : Coinbase announced last month it had reached an agreement with the SEC to drop the regulator's ongoing case against it. The SEC filed to withdraw the case with prejudice — meaning it cannot bring the same charges again — and a judge signed off on the withdrawal at the end of February. The SEC alleged that Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Sandbox (SAND), Filecoin (FIL), Axie Infinity (AXS), Chiliz (CHZ), Flow (FLOW), Internet Computer (ICP), Near (NEAR), Voyager (VGX), Dash (DASH) and Nexo (NEXO) all appeared to be traded as securities in its initial lawsuit. ConsenSys : The SEC said it would drop its case against ConsenSys over the MetaMask wallet, CEO Joe Lubin said last month, and a joint stipulation dismissing the case with prejudice was filed on March 27. A court docket entry dated March 28 said the civil case was terminated. Kraken : The SEC told Kraken it would drop its case against the exchange alleging it violated securities laws and commingled customer and corporate funds earlier this month. A joint stipulation dismissing the case was filed on March 27, though a judge does not appear to have signed off just yet. Cumberland DRW : The SEC told Cumberland DRW it would drop its case alleging it was acting as an unregistered securities dealer earlier this month. The SEC and Cumberland filed a motion to stay proceedings on March 18, saying ""the parties have agreed in principle to dismiss this litigation with prejudice"" but needed three weeks to work out the details. The judge overseeing the case granted the motion, ordering the parties to file a joint status report by April 8 unless the dismissal filing is on the docket by then. Pulsechain : A federal judge dismissed the SEC's suit against Pulsechain and HEX, saying the agency did not plausibly show that the project targeted U.S. investors and that it had jurisdiction over the case. The SEC has until April 21 to file an amended complaint. Immutable : The SEC told Immutable Labs it closed its investigation into the Web3 gaming firm, it said earlier this week. Yuga Labs : The SEC closed its investigation into Yuga Labs, the NFT firm said earlier this month. Robinhood : The SEC told trading platform Robinhood it closed its investigation into the company, it said late last month. OpenSea : The SEC closed its investigation into OpenSea, the NFT marketplace's CEO said late last month. Uniswap : The SEC closed its investigation into Uniswap Labs, the firm announced last month. Gemini : The SEC closed its investigation into Gemini, co-founder Cameron Winklevoss said last month. Binance : The SEC and Binance (alongside the various affiliated parties/co-defendants) filed to pause the regulator's case for 60 days in early February. The judge overseeing the case paused the case until April 14 , ordering the parties to file a joint status report by then. The SEC alleged commingling violations alongside securities law violations, as well as allowing U.S. persons to trade on the global platform. Tron Foundation : The SEC and the Tron Foundation (alongside the various affiliated parties/co-defendants named) filed to pause the SEC's case for 60 days in late February. The judge overseeing the case granted the motion , which should bring the new deadline to around April 27 (a Sunday). The SEC alleged market manipulation and fraud, alongside securities law-related registration violations. Crypto.com : Crypto.com announced on March 27 that the SEC had closed its case into the crypto exchange and would not take any enforcement action. Trump Media, the company behind Truth Social, is also partnering with the exchange to issue exchange-traded products. Unicoin : Unicoin appears to be the only publicly-disclosed ongoing investigation by the SEC, though its CEO has asked the agency to close that investigation as well. HAWK: On Thursday, Haliey Welch, whose ""HAWK"" token appeared to pump and dump (falling from a $491 million market cap to under $100 million within minutes) when it launched last year, told TMZ that the SEC had closed its investigation into her as well.

Martinez tells his 134,300 followers on the social media platform X that the native token of Berachain ( BERA ), the newly launched crypto project focused on decentralized finance (DeFi), could go up by up to 70% if the altcoin manages to break above a key resistance level. “Berachain is up 65% in the past two weeks and is now testing the upper boundary of this channel. A breakout here could open the gates to $14!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Berachain, whose mainnet was launched early last month, is trading at $8.23 at time of writing. Next up is XRP. According to Martinez, the payments-focused altcoin is currently forming a head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily time frame. A head-and-shoulders pattern is typically considered bearish as it suggests that an asset is unable to sustain its uptrend with a lower high right shoulder. The analyst, however, says that XRP can flip the outlook to bullish if the altcoin rises by around 38% from the current level and crosses above the $3 resistance level. Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that XRP can drop below $1.30 if it takes out support at $2. XRP is trading $2.18 at time of writing. Turning to Sui, Martinez says that the native token of the layer-1 blockchain could appreciate by up to 28% from the current level if the bullish momentum the crypto asset has enjoyed in the recent past continues. “SUI surged 25% after a timely Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential buy signal. If this bullish momentum continues, $2.88 and $3.25 are the next key levels.” Source: Ali Martinez/X TD Sequential is an indicator used in technical analysis to determine potential trend reversal points.

Smart money heads to this $0.025 token with a 65x upside,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/29/are-dogecoin-ethereum-still-hot-tokens-to-buy-smart-money-heads-to-this-0-025-token-with-a-65x-upside/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) have long been favorites among crypto enthusiasts, with DOGE trading at $0.17 and ETH at $1911. However, seasoned investors are now eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM). While DOGE remains a meme-coin favorite and ETH dominates DeFi, smart money often moves early into high-upside opportunities, making MUTM an intriguing contender for those seeking exponential gains. Now Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to grow stronger since its launch. Phase 4 of the presale has already launched giving investors optimism. Over $5.8 million has been accumulated and 7500 holders attracted. New investors purchase MUTM at its current price of $0.025 because the value will reach $0.03 as part of Phase 5. Current investors can achieve a 140% return on investment before the project launch occurs at $0.06. MUTM could hit $3.9 after launch. Mutuum Finance presale surges as investor interest grows Mutuum Finance leads the decentralized lending market through its innovative dual-lending system and it has established itself as a quick-growing collaborative system. The project maintains increasing popularity as 7500 investors put $5.8 million into the presale. During Phase 4 which presents the current trading value of $0.025 investors can expect a 20% price increase in Phase 5 to secure substantial profit potential. Research data indicates that MUTM stands among the most underpriced yet promising DeFi projects set to exceed $1 after its release on the market. Mutuum Finance stands apart for its ability to unite the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models in one system. The P2C model combines USDT liquidity pools that produce passive income for users who benefit from automatic smart contracts used for lending operations. Both P2P and P2C models deliver fundamental DeFi functions to users through their different mechanisms for transacting directly between parties without third-party involvement. Through the blending of these two models, Mutuum Finance enhances security, efficiency, and decentralization, making it a good fit for DeFi investors seeking high-yielding alternatives. The Development of a stable secure environment To demonstrate its focus on stability Mutuum Finance releases a fully secured Ethereum-based stablecoin backed by USD. The stablecoin token stands distinct from algorithmic stablecoins because Mutuum Finance bases it on over-collateralization to provide both risk reduction and long-term trustworthiness. Open financial architectures paired with audited smart contracts alongside this architecture strengthen investor trust by covering all the vulnerabilities found in past DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance implements incentive plans as a method to increase its community reach. By offering a million-dollar giveaway the program will give out 10 thousand dollars worth of MUTM tokens to winners among 10 participants in addition to its innovative referral system that pays users for successful new investor acquisitions. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance obtain both special staking pools and governance rights and VIP access to platform updates which keeps them committed to the platform over the long term. Sustainable tokenomics for long-term growth Mutuum Finance implements controlled token supply restrictions and deflationary mechanics throughout presales to build scarcity in its framework thus boosting the token’s potential value growth. The staking program gives crypto users attractive incentives to remain engaged while ensuring token sustainability during long-term development of the platform. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to hold strong positions in the crypto market, but their growth potential pales in comparison to the emerging gains seen in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over 7,500 investors contributing $5.8 million in the presale, MUTM offers early adopters a potential 65x upside to $3.90. Don’t miss the opportunity, join the Mutuum Finance presale today and secure your stake in this high-growth DeFi project.

Pectra will not only enhance Ethereum’s performance but will also improve the user experience with self-custodial wallets. The upgraded wallets can function similarly to smart wallets, which implement features such as passkey support, chain abstraction, and transaction bundling, which will also remove the need to manually approve tokens prior to swapping them or depositing them into a dApp. This externally owned account (EOA) upgrade is labelled as EIP-7702 and prioritizes flexibility within wallets. The improvement protocol will also introduce features like sponsored transactions, which can create a fee-less transaction environment where a third party, such as the parent dApp, covers the user’s gas fee.

While the spotlight is still focused on a few familiar names, several low-priced tokens are quietly positioning themselves for serious growth—and a few of them might break out before Q3. Among the most promising under-$0.10 contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has captured the attention of early-stage investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) & Pepe (PEPE) Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently saw a strong spike, partly fueled by an 8,400% surge in its burn rate. With supply tightening, its price moved up nearly 15% in just a few days. Pepe (PEPE) also gained momentum after a major wallet added 500 million tokens, hinting at potential upward movement. These tokens continue to generate short-term interest, but when it comes to long-term potential backed by real utility, MUTM is standing out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 4 of its presale, with MUTM priced at $0.025. Over 340 million tokens have already been sold, and the project has raised more than $5.7 million from a growing community of over 7,400 holders. Just recently, the token saw a 25% surge from its previous presale phase, reflecting rising interest and early traction. The next phase will see the price rise to $0.03, making now the most favorable entry point before the next jump. With the launch price confirmed at $0.06, buyers at the current level are entering at less than half the market valuation. Analysts are also projecting a post-launch move toward $0.32, supported by growing demand, the upcoming launch of the platform’s beta version, and a built-in buy-and-distribute model that consistently feeds value back into the market. What makes this growth projection reasonable is the actual utility behind the token. Mutuum isn’t a hype-driven meme coin. It’s a decentralized lending and borrowing platform designed for flexible, user-controlled financial interactions. Whether someone wants to earn yield or borrow against their crypto, the platform gives them the tools to do so—without giving up ownership of their assets. Mutuum supports two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users deposit into a shared pool and earn interest that adjusts based on how much of the pool is being used. It’s a hands-off approach with real-time interest updates. The P2P model, on the other hand, allows users to lend or borrow directly with each other under custom terms. This helps serve both stable and more speculative assets, without mixing them in the same pool. To keep things efficient, the protocol uses mtTokens. These are issued 1:1 when users deposit assets and reflect both the original value and the interest that builds over time. Because mtTokens follow the ERC-20 standard, they can be moved, traded, or used across DeFi platforms, offering flexibility while keeping yield flowing. The upcoming launch of the platform’s beta version will go live around the time of the token’s listing. That means utility won’t just be a future promise—it’ll be live and usable from the beginning. This kind of timing adds credibility to the project and gives early supporters a real reason to stay involved. A full smart contract audit by CertiK is also underway to add an extra layer of assurance. To add more fuel to the presale, Mutuum is running a $100,000 giveaway for 10 winners. The details on how to enter can be found on the project’s official website, giving the community a chance to get involved beyond just investing. While SHIB and PEPE continue to draw headlines, it’s projects like Mutuum Finance that are quietly building for the long term. With a working ecosystem, clear roadmap, and strong early adoption, MUTM isn’t just another cheap token—it’s a second chance to catch a DeFi project before the breakout.

More than three weeks after President Donald Trump’s March 7 executive order outlined plans to use cryptocurrency seized in criminal cases to create a federal Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve, European companies have largely remained silent on the issue. The stagnation may stem from Europe’s complex regulatory regime, according to Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at Brickken, a European real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform. “European corporate adoption remains limited,” Fabrega told Cointelegraph, adding: “This hesitation reflects a deeper structural divide, rooted in regulation, institutional signaling and market maturity. Europe has yet to take a definitive stance on Bitcoin as a reserve asset.” Bitcoin’s economic model favors early adopters, which may pressure more investment firms to consider gaining exposure to BTC. The asset has outperformed most major global assets since Trump’s election despite a recent correction. Asset performance since Trump’s election victory.

These include French banking giant BNP Paribas , Swiss firm 21Shares AG, VanEck Europe, Malta-based Jacobi Asset Management and Austrian fintech firm Bitpanda. A recent Bitpanda survey suggests that European financial institutions may be underestimating crypto investor demand by as much as 30%. Related: Friday’s US inflation report may catalyze a Bitcoin April rally Europe’s “fragmented” regulatory landscape lacks clarity The EU’s slower adoption appears tied to its patchwork of regulations and more conservative investment mandates, analysts at Bitfinex told Cointelegraph. “Europe’s institutional landscape is more fragmented, with regulatory hurdles and conservative investment mandates limiting Bitcoin allocations.” “Additionally, European pension funds and large asset managers have been slower to adopt Bitcoin exposure due to unclear guidelines and risk aversion,” they added. Related: Bitcoin ‘more likely’ to hit $110K before $76.5K — Arthur Hayes Beyond the fragmented regulations, European retail investor appetite and retail participation are generally lower than in the US, according to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo.

The OKX lawsuit alleges that the platform has been functioning without proper registration since 2021. According to the Thailand SEC, OKX has violated the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses (2018) by offering crypto trading services without proper licensing. Significantly, the OKX lawsuit highlights global crypto exchanges’ vulnerability to regulatory challenges and heightened scrutiny. Let’s delve into OKX’s regulatory struggles under the Thailand SEC and its potential implications. OKX Lawsuit: Thailand SEC Strengthens Regulations In a recent development, the Thailand SEC alleged OKX, a top crypto exchange , of offering unregistered crypto trading services. According to the OKX lawsuit, the platform has been actively promoting its services in Thailand via social media, including Telegram, X, and Line OpenChat, without adhering to the licensing rules. As part of the legal action, the Thai SEC filed a criminal complaint against OK operator Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd, and nine individuals connected to the firm. The agency alleged that OKX provided unregistered cryptocurrency services to Thai clients, charging a 0.1% trading fee, thereby mimicking the operations of licensed platforms. Thus, the exchange has reportedly violated the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses, a law that ensures only regulated firms operate in the crypto space. Thai SEC Charges Nine Individuals Reportedly, the Thailand SEC has charged nine individuals linked to OKX. They are alleged of facilitating OKX’s activities by promoting the exchange through various online channels. These charged individuals include Sarun Boonmesrisanga, Nut Joongwong, Kritsana Kritsananuwat, Smithi Charoenmin, Kittithat Benchacharoenpat, Saurawit Sanguanphokai, Akarawath Rujiruangchai, Rachata Chuesaibua, and Varut Vanichayakosol. As per the SEC, these individuals’ promotional activities have significantly contributed to OKX’s user base and market presence. The SEC stated, “These actions constitute assistance or facilitation in operating a digital asset exchange without proper licensing.” In a recent development, the New York Attorney General’s (NYAG) office imposed a $200 million penalty on Galaxy Digital for promoting LUNA tokens. Is OKX Banned in Thailand? Currently, the SEC has forwarded the OKX lawsuit to the Economic Crime Suppression Division (ECD). The division will investigate OKX Thailand’s alleged involvement in illegal trading. If found guilty, the crypto exchange and the involved individuals could face severe penalties under Thai law. It could also impact OKX’s future in Thailand. The regulator cautioned the public about the risks associated with unlicensed digital asset operators. The SEC highlighted that these platforms lack investor protection and may be vulnerable to fraud and other potential threats. This development comes amid the US SEC’s loosened crypto regulations under President Donald Trump. Recently, the SEC dismissed several long-held crypto lawsuits, including Cumberland, Consensys, and Kraken. The US SEC has also dropped its appeal against Ripple, sparking widespread optimism.

The broader cryptocurrency market, represented by the CoinDesk 20 Index ( CD20 ), lost around 3.3% of its value over the period. The sharp drop brings BTC’s performance down 1.7% for the week, while CD20 is down nearly 5%. Over the last 24 hours, over $300 million worth of long positions were liquidated on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, while $38.8 million worth of shorts were liquidated on these platforms, according to CoinGlass data . The drop appears to be part of a wider derisking move among traders, as investors are anticipating the impact of President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs that are set to come into effect on April 2. The move heightened after core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data came in hotter than expected on Friday. Just this week, consumer confidence data dipped further than expected, while the index for future expectations came in at a 12-year low , and well below levels associated with an incoming recession. This confluence of factors has seen investors reduce their exposure to risk assets and triggered a flight to safety. CoinDesk Data’s latest stablecoin report shows that gold-backed cryptocurrencies have benefitted from the risk-off move, as their market capitalization climbed above $1.4 billion in March. Gold-backed cryptocurrencies are, in fact, countering the market’s bearish trend. While the CD20 is down over 3% in the last 24-hour period, tokens including PAXG and XAUT are up 0.7% to over $3,100. These tokens are up more than 18% year-to-date, while BTC is down 12.5% and the CD20 index 28% so far this year.",Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|crypto market,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-29 13:51:25

The criminal complaint was against OKX operator Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd and nine exchange associates. In the complaint filed with the Economic Crime Suppression Division (ECD), the SEC claimed that OKX operating without a license in the country violates the Emergency Decree on Digital Asset Businesses (2018). It stated that the exchange started operating in Thailand in October 2021 and charged 0.1% in transaction fees despite operating without a license. It said: “The OKX activities are liable to be an operation of digital asset exchange business under Section 3 of the Emergency Decree, for which OKX has not obtained a license, in violation of Section 26, and subject to offenses and penalties under Section 66 of the Emergency Decree.” Thailand’s SEC names OKX partners Meanwhile, the regulator also noted that OKX was promoting its unlicensed operations on social media using platforms such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Telegram, YouTube, Discord, and OpenChat. The SEC also identified nine people who helped the exchange promote its services on social media and filed criminal complaints against them, noting that they helped the exchange grow its user base in the country. It noted that their actions also violated the digital assets law. The regulator said: “The actions of these nine individuals increased OKX’s visibility and attracted more users to its services. As a result, their conduct constitutes assisting or facilitating OKX in operating a digital asset exchange without license, in violation of Section 26 of the Emergency Decree.” With the legal action initiated, the regulator is seeking to impose penalties as stipulated under the law against OKX and its promoters. However, the filing is merely the start of the criminal procedure and is not proof of guilt. It is now up to the prosecutors to determine whether they will proceed with the case. The SEC can only monitor the proceedings and cooperate with relevant agencies that handle them. Emergency Decree on Digital Assets Business (Source: Thailand SEC) Nevertheless, if OKX and its promoters are found guilty, they could face serious sanctions. Under the Digital Assets Decree , anyone operating an unlicensed exchange could face between two to five years in prison along with a fine of 200,000 baht ($5,894) to 500,000 baht ($14,737) and 10,000 baht ($295) for each day of default. Thailand’s SEC warns about unlicensed exchanges Meanwhile, the regulator has warned the public and investors about using unlicensed digital assets exchanges in the country. It noted such platforms come with great risk as there is no legal protection for the users, and they could be victims of money laundering and scams. It added that the list of digital asset businesses that can operate in the country is accessible on its website. According to the information on the website , 32 crypto businesses are already licensed to operate, with notable names including Binance and Upbit. Interestingly, this is not the first time Thai authorities have targeted crypto exchanges for operating without licenses. In 2024, they announced plans to block all unlicensed exchanges in the country by submitting their names to the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society. They also filed a similar complaint against Bybit in 2023. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Top altcoins crashed this week | Source: CMC Trump’s reciprocal tariffs Next week, President Donald Trump’s so-called “Liberation Day,” on which he will impose reciprocal tariffs on the top U.S. trading partners, is expected to be the main catalyst for many cryptocurrencies and stocks . The reciprocal tariffs aim to challenge what Trump views as unfair levies on US goods and non-tariff barriers The European Union is reportedly considering concessions, while China plans countermeasures. Economists caution that these tariffs will hurt American manufacturers by raising their costs and affecting their overseas business. As consumer spending and business investments drop, some experts argue that the U.S. faces an elevated risk of a recession. In the March Ag Economists’ Monthly Monitor , for example, 62% of economists say the U.S. general economy will see a recession in 2025. Therefore, on Tuesday, expect Bitcoin and altcoin prices to react to these tariffs. In theory, these assets will likely continue falling when Trump unveils his tariffs. On the other hand, these assets may bounce back since market participants have already priced in the tariffs. They may also rebound should certain countries make deals with the U.S. You might also like: Trump plans White House visit for El Salvador’s pro-Bitcoin Bukele US nonfarm payrolls data The other key catalyst for Bitcoin and altcoin prices will be Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data from the US. Economists polled by Reuters expect the data to show that the economy created 128,000 jobs in March. That’s a big drop from the 151,000 it created a month earlier. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.2%. Historically, crypto and stock prices have reacted to job numbers because of their impact on the Federal Reserve. The Fed is tasked with maintaining stable inflation and low unemployment rates. These numbers come as Wall Street is divided on what to expect from the Fed this year. Some analysts expect it will maintain rates steady this year because of the stubbornly high inflation, while others see it cutting later this year as Trump’s tariffs trigger a recession.

Bitcoin fell to $83,000 while most altcoins hit their weekly lows. This article offers an ADA, PEPE, LINK, and SHIB price prediction after macroeconomic fears saw the crypto market cap shed $160 billion in value within two days. Crypto Market Cap Sheds $160B in 2 Days Data from Tradingview shows that the total crypto market cap has dropped from $2.81 trillion to $2.65 trillion in just two days. At press time, this metric was at its lowest level in more than one week. Besides crypto, Wall Street also fluttered, with the S&P 500 losing $1 trillion in market cap yesterday. This drop follows the release of the US PCE inflation data . As Coingape reported, the recent data revealed that inflation rose to 2.8%, higher than the expected 2.7%. This puts pressure on the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish policy. Additionally, Kobeissi Letter has revealed that the long-term inflation expectations have risen to 4.1%, the highest level since 1993. This will continue to exert downward pressure on the crypto market cap. SHIB Price Prediction as Wedge Breakout Hints At Rally Shiba Inu price today trades at $0.0000126 today with a 5% decline in 24 hours. The daily SHIB price chart shows that the meme coin has broken out of a falling wedge pattern, and reversed to test resistance at the upper trendline. This pattern indicates that the trend is about to flip bullish. If this price pattern holds and buying pressure surges, it will support a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction and fuel gains of as high as 80%. If this happens, Shiba Inu can record more than two times gains. SHIB/USDT: 1-day Chart ADA Technical Analysis Cardano’s price has shed more than 6% of its value in the last 24 hours. This downtrend has caused more than $7M in ADA long liquidations according to Coinglass data. However, unlike the SHIB price prediction, ADA has not flashed any bullish signals. Instead, it has made a bearish breakout from a consolidation channel, indicating there is a risk of a crash to $0.58. The RSI remains below 50, which indicates a bearish momentum. This might cause further declines. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart PEPE Coin Price Prediction The one day price chart for Pepe Coin indicates that a bearish trend is prevailing. Pepe Coin has broken below the lower trendline of an ascending parralel channel, indicating that the trend is shifting from an uptrend to a downtrend. The ADX line is also dropping, further indicating that the bullish momentum has grown weak. This might push PEPE down to $0.0000057. PEPE/USDT: 1-day Chart LINK Technical Analysis Chainlink price trades at $13.65 today with a 4% decline in 24 hours. LINK has been leading the altcoin selloff with an oversold RSI of 29. The AO histogram bars further show that the momentum has shifted to the negative side, which may push LINK price down to $11. LINK/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Conclusion The crypto market cap has dropped by more than $160 billion in the last two days. This drop has caused a massive sell-off across the altcoin market. The SHIB price prediction shows a bullish signal. However, the technical outlook for ADA, PEPE, and LINK shows that bearish trends are prevalent.

The ETF's poor performance is primarily due to expensive futures contracts and high holding costs, creating significant value decay on top of compounding issues. For long-term Bitcoin investment, direct ownership is recommended over BITX. Keep it simple, with negligible holding and trading expenses. One ETF that has performed relatively well at face value over the last couple of years is Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ( BITX ) . Holding it has piggybacked the extraordinary rise in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) since the middle of 2023, on the product's inception. However, returns have not kept pace with the advertised goal of earning DOUBLE the gains of the underlying cryptocurrency, although to be fair, a double in performance ""each day"" is the official target (which it usually fails to achieve on up days). Volatility Shares Website - 2x Bitcoin Strategy, Fund Description, March 28th, 2025 In fact, total returns have only mimicked the equivalent Bitcoin gain over 21 months with a net +202.1% rise vs. Bitcoin's +188% jump. (BITX does pay a sizable dividend, which is included in my figures.) More typically, in other 2x products available to investors, you would have expected the daily rebalance feature to compound gains far better than simply owning the world's main digital cryptocurrency/security. YCharts - BITX vs. Bitcoin, Daily Total Returns, Since June 2023 IPO Again, to paint a picture of how rotten the total returns have been for buy-and-hold investors, BITX has actually declined by -12.3% over the latest 12-month period vs. Bitcoin's substantial +25.6% advance! YCharts - BITX vs. Bitcoin, 12 Months of Daily Total Returns And, if you like big losses in value over the short run, holding BITX over the past three months has been right up your alley. The total return loss of -24.1% has been more than TRIPLE the equivalent Bitcoin decline of -7.5%. YCharts - BITX vs. Bitcoin, 3 Months of Daily Total Returns What Explains The Weak Performance? The main reason for BITX's poor performance is explained by its futures contract holdings. After a boom in Bitcoin, traders and investors are pricing in large premiums for contracts with deliveries in the future. Below is a list of current ETF holdings, which comprises 2 futures contracts trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange [CME], with April and May 2025 dates. Cash as collateral for the futures positioning is also a major holding of the ETF (which is a good thing, earning 4% to 5% annualized yields today). Volatility Shares Website - BITX, Top Holdings, March 28th, 2025 The bad news is the pricing structure to buy and own futures on Bitcoin is quite expensive, as you can see in the table below. This morning the spot Bitcoin is down around -2.1%, but April and May futures are declining by a much larger amount (-2.25% and -2.20% respectively). Then consider 2x Bitcoin Strategy owners have DOUBLE the notational exposure in premium costs to overcome. Effectively, whenever the rollover of capital appears (contracts expire), ETF owners are stuck with another stretched premium bought a few months ahead. So, even flat Bitcoin prices a month or two into the future creates losses for BITX. CME Group - Bitcoin Futures, March 28th, 2025 Reality check: the time premium for futures late in an asset boom is a monster hurdle for BITX trust holders, creating serious decay in value daily. Technical Momentum Fading Another issue I have with BITX in particular is the technical trading momentum pattern. Reviewing the daily chart since its June 2023 IPO, upside buying intensity peaked on most measures in either November (after the national election) or all the way back in March 2024. I have circled in gold, bullish peaks in the 14-day Ease of Movement , 13-day Force Index and traditional Accumulation/Distribution Line . With price back below its 200-day moving average, a serious bear slide could easily play out in the coming months. StockCharts.com - BITX, Daily Price & Volume Changes, Since June 2023 IPO, Author References Final Thoughts I mentioned the ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF ( BITI ) in February here , as the safest way to short Bitcoin, especially in tax-deferred accounts with limits on short sales. Looking at simple performance numbers, owning any short Bitcoin ETF has worked out well since President Trump came to office again on January 20th, 2025. To me this date provided a classic sell-the-news event, after crypto buyers rushed into the marketplace in a frenzy after his November election win (buying the rumor). Promises of a U.S. government crypto reserve may have been fully priced into the market months ago. YCharts - BITX vs. Bitcoin & BITI, Daily Total Returns, Since January 20th, 2025 For those willing to take extra risk, trading through margin accounts, short selling 2x Bitcoin Strategy could put both high futures premiums and a bearish downturn in cryptocurrencies into your pocket. However, I would suggest keeping position sizing small, as Bitcoin has proven extremely volatile with an upward bias over time (defying bears outside of a few dramatic price dumps since 2009). Otherwise, if you are bullish on Bitcoin and desire a long-term holding, I would avoid BITX and stick with direct ownership (with negligible holding expense). The long-term and short-term charts prove the current underlying futures setup, leveraged into double the holding cost of a 1x futures contract, is a huge obstacle to success several years down the road. To boot, this ETF's 1.85% in annual management fees will be something of a drag on performance, the longer you own it. What about the bullish argument to own BITX? You have to believe rip-roaring Bitcoin gains will continue in 2025. While this remains a possibility, the design of the ETF fails to reach its 2x goal for ""long-term"" holders. When an oversized gain in the underlying security/crypto is required to earn any type of profit, investors are swimming hard against an amazing water current. The odds are you will become exhausted and give up on BITX, when a major Bitcoin sell-off hits. For all of these reasons, I am out. I rate 2x Bitcoin Strategy a Sell and Avoid . Thanks for reading.

Dogecoin price analysis shows a highly bearish prediction. DOGE value decreased to $0.169 in the last 24 hours. Overall, the currency lost 5.45% in value today. Technical indicators give out a negative verdict of the current market trends. Whereby, the price charts also depict a bearish trend for the current market scenario. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.576 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.169 over the last 24 hours. DOGE is yet to overcome the strong resistance at the $0.1994 mark. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.308 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by August 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,447.46 DOGE in March; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.468 on December 8, 2024, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.61 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial. Recent news/opinion on Dogecoin On-chain data shows a significant decline in large Dogecoin transactions, likely due to reduced whale activity. Overall, Dogecoin transactions have decreased by 88% as the price falls to the $0.20 range, alongside a lack of recent commentary from pro-Doge billionaire Elon Musk. For more details, read here .

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-29 14:47:00

Why This AI Coin Could Outperform By 30x,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/dogecoin-price-at-risk-of-falling-below-010-why-this-ai-coin-could-outperform-by-30x,"Despite the recent uptrend, DOGE faces growing concerns about dropping below $0.10. Analysts highlight its biggest weakness – its lack of real-world utility. The Dogecoin price is still driven mostly by hype and public figures like Elon Musk or Donald Trump rather than long-term value. This makes it a highly speculative asset, with little to support its growth beyond social media buzz. In contrast, platforms like IntelMarkets are gaining attention for combining strong growth potential with real utility. Built on its own Layer 1 blockchain, IntelMarkets offers advanced AI tools for automated trading, portfolio management, and real-time analysis – giving traders a real edge in the market. While DOGE relies on community hype, INTL provides a clear use case that aligns with serious traders' needs. As investors look for more than memes and volatility, many are shifting focus toward solutions like IntelMarkets. Dogecoin (DOGE) Whales Are Accumulating: Will This Boost the Memecoin’s Performance? DOGE is trading around $0.202 after posting a 4% daily gain, with growing whale activity providing key support. According to Ali Martinez, large holders have added 200 million DOGE to their wallets over the past two weeks. This signals renewed confidence in Dogecoin’s price despite ongoing market uncertainty. This accumulation follows a breakout from a descending wedge pattern, as the Dogecoin price rebounded from a key support level at $0.17. The next major resistance lies at $0.242; a successful move above it could pave the way for further gains. However, the Dogecoin price must hold above its breakout zone to sustain this rally and build on the current momentum. Still, on-chain metrics paint a more cautious picture. Daily active addresses remain low at just 31,212, with fewer than 9,000 transactions recorded – highlighting that the Dogecoin price surge appears to be driven more by speculation than actual network usage. This disconnect has prompted concerns over the rally’s durability, with some investors warning that DOGE could retrace back toward $0.10 if fundamentals don’t improve. IntelMarkets Crashes the $12 Million Presale Mark with AI-Driven Revolution IntelMarkets is rewriting crypto trading rules by blending artificial intelligence with decentralised finance, targeting the $270 billion crypto-trading market. With features like self-learning bots trained on over 100,000 data points and automated trade execution, the platform offers a powerful solution for high-frequency traders and institutions seeking to maximise profits while reducing manual effort. This cutting-edge approach has quickly made IntelMarkets’ native token , INTL, a favourite among investors. The project raised over $12 million from 170k+ traders in just ten presale rounds, setting a new benchmark for the largest AI-powered presale in 2025. The excitement is well justified – INTL is priced at just $0.0916. Unlike the bearish Dogecoin price action, many analysts are projecting a potential surge of up to 30x once INTL lands on two or three major exchanges. Investors have also noticed the project’s team, including MIT, Renaissance Technologies, and OpenAI experts. IntelMarkets is built with utility in mind, unlike hype-driven meme coins such as DOGE. Its AI tools could deliver real-time trade signals, automated portfolio management, and deep market insight, giving even inexperienced traders the potential to become consistently profitable. With up to 1,000x leverage and access to a wide range of asset classes, the platform empowers users at every level to trade smarter and faster. As the demand for AI-based trading solutions grows, IntelMarkets is emerging as one of the most talked-about ICOs of the year – offering both innovation and serious upside potential. Closing Thoughts Currently trading at $0.0916, INTL is gaining serious momentum and could soon cement its position among the top 100 crypto projects if the current trajectory holds. As the AI narrative continues to dominate the market, projects without meaningful AI integration risk fading into irrelevance. This shift in investor focus is already reflected in Dogecoin’s price action. Once a leading memecoin, DOGE is now facing increased bearish pressure, with many analysts and investors predicting a potential 50% drop that could push it down to the $0.10 level. The contrast highlights a broader market transition – where hype alone no longer holds as much weight, and real utility, like that offered by AI-driven platforms such as IntelMarkets, is taking center stage.

The combined market cap has lost 2.82% to $2.68 trillion, which suggests the selloff might deepen more. With the mix of bullish news in the trailing 7-day period, the question among analysts remains what is behind the latest slump. What Is Behind Crypto Market Crash? Since the inauguration of President Donald Trump, the broader digital currency ecosystem has witnessed positive backing. As reported earlier by CoinGape, President Trump granted full pardon to Arthur Hayes , and other BitMEX co-founders Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed. While this news is localized to the beneficiaries, it generally signals the positive shift in White House’ perception of the industry. Despite these updates, the crypto market is still reeling with losses. The same Trump administration’s trade policies have continued to weigh down investor sentiment. The April 2 reciprocal tariff timeline has placed investors on the edge. These tariffs and trade wars have ushered in economic uncertainties and potential inflation drag. With the Federal Reserve keeping rates unchanged, the impact of inflation may force traditional firms to adjust their positions. This in turn impact the crypto market sentiment overall. Bitcoin and Altcoin Performance Review As of writing, the price of BTC has lost its $83,000 support and currently trading at $82,476.30 per data from CoinMarketCap . The top coin has fallen by 2.43% in 24 hours and has extended its Year-to-Date (YTD) losses to 12.5%. Top altcoins have also lost their positions with Ethereum down 2.25% to $1,846. XRP has fallen by more than 3% to $2.115, while Cardano has shed off 3.92% to $0.6721. The altcoin response has seen Dogecoin forming a wedge pattern in what may serve as a make-it-or-break-it switch for the memecoin. While it appears as though many of these top assets are bottoming out, their correlations with Bitcoin may extend their overall drawdow. What Next for the Crypto Market? Thus far this year, top coins like Bitcoin have often showcased resilience in the face of massive sell-off and crypto liquidations. Although the current price floor for Bitcoin remain undefined, with analysts keeping an eye on the $82,000 floor. The digital currency has not breached this level in close to two weeks. While legendary trader Peter Brandt agrees BTC price may fall to $65,635 , this bearish projection may be averted if the $82,500 support holds through the weekend. Altcoins may likely boost their price recovery by relying on BTC breakout and their internal fundamental updates.

While gold has long served humanity as a reliable store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty, Bitcoin’s rise as a modern-day store of value has triggered debates about Bitcoin potentially overtaking the lustrous metal. With Bitcoin’s market cap currently standing at $1.6 trillion, representing a tiny fraction of gold’s $20.7 trillion market cap, the question arises: Can Bitcoin surpass gold in market cap due to its impressive growth pace? Why Bitcoin Surpassing Gold Is Very Possible Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, has shared his belief that Bitcoin, the world’s oldest and largest digital asset, will eventually overtake gold’s total market capitalization. While Timmer stressed that Bitcoin could achieve the huge feat, he acknowledged that the flipping would not happen anytime soon. The Fidelity exec noted that the price of gold has appreciated at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% since the 1970s. According to his analysis, if gold continues growing at the same rate and Bitcoin follows either the S-curve trajectory of internet adoption or the power law curve, the apex crypto could usurp the yellow metal a decade or two from now. Timmer further suggests that gold could potentially transcend its historical CAGR of 8% if BTC grows at the rate proposed by either of the two aforementioned models. In this case, gold will still be ahead of Bitcoin. “So, my guess is that gold will always be Bitcoin’s quieter older sibling,” he explained. Bitcoin Adoption Among Nation-States Meanwhile, developments signal a growing trend among nations considering Bitcoin as part of their strategic financial strategy. El Salvador’s audacious decision in 2021 to make Bitcoin legal tender and create a national reserve of the cryptocurrency sparked a debate worldwide on the future of reserve assets. As of March 29, El Salvador held 6.13K BTC, valued at around $512 million, despite recently signing an anti-BTC deal with the IMF. The Nayib Bukele-led country seeks to leverage Bitcoin’s potential to bolster its economy. In the U.S., President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this month to create a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” The reserve and stockpile will initially use cryptocurrency seized in government criminal and civil cases, but the reserve won’t sell the stashed BTC and will use “budget-neutral” ways to boost its size, while tokens from the stockpile could be sold. US Senator Cynthia Lummis’ newly reintroduced BITCOIN Act will allow the government to potentially hold over 1 million Bitcoin as part of its newly established reserve. That said, the increasing institutional interest and growing adoption could play a key role in propelling its price higher. While its difficult to predict the exact price at which Bitcoin will dethrone gold, the journey towards that milestone promises to be a fascinating one, with enormous implications for the future of finance.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Fidelity Investments,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-29 14:55:19

SOL price drops and trades at $139 on Thursday, correcting from $139 and marking a 0.36% decline in the last 24 hours. The daily trade volume dropped by 2.46% to hit $3.04 billion. A decline in both price and volume signals an impending trend reversal in the token, likely a loss of interest from market participants amidst recent developments and macroeconomic factors. The Solana ETF buzz is also fading in the current session as investors flock to a new AI-driven platform with a larger upside potential and smaller investment cost. Experts claim it can become the next Solana on the bull market soon! SOL Price Analysis: Solana ETF Buzz Fails To Hold Bulls SOL price has been on a steady upward trajectory since Friday, crossing the 20-day SMA and reaching a high of $147. This uptrend was due to news about the approval of the Solana ETFs. However, it lost momentum as it neared the $150 mark, indicating sellers are active at upper levels, and the Solana ETF buzz faded. SOL price started the previous week on a bullish note but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping to $125. However, sentiment changed on Wednesday as markets rallied. As a result, SOL price rallied over 8% and settled at $135. SOL lost momentum on Thursday, allowing sellers to take over. As a result, the SOL price plunged nearly 6% and settled at $127. Solana ETF and futures did not have any major impact on the Solana price actions. Price action remained muted on Friday and Saturday as SOL price registered marginal increases and settled at $128. Solana ETF news continued to push the token higher on Sunday, rising 3.44% to move past the 20-day SMA and settle at $132. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL price rallied over 6% to cross $140 and settle at $141. Buyers retained control on Tuesday, allowing SOL price to register an increase of 1.94% and settle at $143. However, selling pressure returned on Wednesday, and the SOL price fell over 4%, slipping below $140 and settling at $137. The current session sees SOL price marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control and the Solana ETF buzz fades again.

The ADA situation is typical of the crypto market conditions. Analysts await a definite direction for the crypto market. A crypto analyst used Cardano (ADA) price action to illustrate the broader crypto market’s conflicting signals currently. According to “cryptorecruitr” on X (formerly Twitter), ADA’s chart suggests a possible short-term decline. However, the longer-term perspective still presents a potentially bullish outlook. https://twitter.com/cryptorecruitr/status/1905665250285777326 Short vs. Long-Term: Can Both ADA Outlooks Be Valid? The analyst argued both short-term bearish and long-term bullish projections can hold validity simultaneously for traders. An individual’s decisions, they noted, depend on personal strategy and preferred timeframe. The analysis concluded both scenarios reflected possibilities for significant price movement. This means traders positioning for either direction might eventually be proven right, depending on how the market resolves from its current state.

While ETH’s growth is steady, newer projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding strong bullish momentum, positioning itself as top performers for explosive growth in the coming months. The project is in phase 4 of its presale priced at $0.025. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $5.7 million with over 7400 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 5, the price will jump 20% to $0.03. MUTM could be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. MUTM is predicted to hit $7.8 after the launch, a 13000% return. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. Mutuum Finance is rapidly generating buzz in the DeFi community with its game-changing lending solutions. Despite being in presale, it has already surpassed more than $5.7 million in funding and has amassed nearly 7400 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With the Phase 4 price at $0.025 and with an impending 20% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits could be 140%, and for the next bull cycle, projections see the leap over $7.8. A Secure and Sustainable DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance will introduce a stablecoin on Ethereum keeping it fully backed by collateral to maintain its USD-peg. The fixed collateral system used in this model requires users to maintain over-collateralization thus reducing the risk of liquidations. Mutuum Finance implements open financial traceability and complete smart contract audit procedures which fortifies investor trust by correcting the flaws observed in alternative DeFi lending systems. Investors should consider Mutuum Finance as a stable long-term investment because of its unrelenting commitment to security and sustainability. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives The first people who join Mutuum Finance gain multiple bonuses that include a $100,000 prize giveaway which distributes $10,000 in MUTM tokens to each of 10 winners. The community expansion strengthens through referral programs which offer compensation to users who attract new investors. The early backers of Mutuum Finance achieve unique advantages that include priority access to new staking pools and governance decision-making power as well as advance information about platform enhancements. The advantages of joining Mutuum Finance in its early stages both increase initial user engagement and improve the continued commitment of token holders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents itself as an attractive investment opportunity for those who want early access to high rise potential. The project demonstrates unwavering strength through its 7,400 investor base that raised $5.7 million. During Phase 5 Mutuum Finance will increase its price from $0.025 to $0.03 which creates a short time window for investors to maximize their returns until reaching the target launch price of $0.06 to achieve a 140% increase. You should take advantage of the current chance to lock in your spot in a decentralized finance sector which is experiencing rapid expansion. Do not delay your participation in the Mutuum Finance presale since the next price increase is approaching.

The Ethereum Virtual Machine has become the go-to platform for developers, with the largest ecosystem and tooling. As DeFi matures, however, it’s worth asking: Is Ethereum the best foundation for the future of financial innovation? Well, the answer might just be Bitcoin. With nearly $6 billion in total value locked as of March 2025, Bitcoin’s decentralization, liquidity and resilience position it as the natural home for the next era of onchain finance, and while Ethereum’s flexibility has enabled an explosion of experimentation, that same flexibility has come with trade-offs. From vulnerabilities in smart contracts we’ve seen in big-name hacks to ongoing debates around scalability, Ethereum’s experimental ethos has left cracks in its foundation. By contrast, Bitcoin offers a solid, battle-tested infrastructure where DeFi can flourish sustainably and cross the chasm from degens into mainstream adoption. Ethereum’s contribution and limitations Ethereum was responsible for pioneering what we know to be DeFi today. This innovation and development served as a testing ground for what Bitcoin is capable of and can ultimately achieve. Its programmability has empowered developers to create everything from automated lending platforms to sophisticated derivatives. These products exist solely because of Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. With that flexibility came serious trade-offs, and we’ve seen them play out in real-time. The DAO hack in 2016 drained $50 million and nearly killed Ethereum in its infancy. The 2022 Wormhole exploit cost $325 million in recent years, and the Ronin Bridge hack took $620 million. These weren’t just bad luck — they’re the predictable result of Ethereum’s open-ended programmability. Smart contracts are powerful, but they’re also complex. Complexity breeds vulnerability. Solidity simply wasn’t designed with security as the primary consideration. Recent: Ethereum researcher pitches solution to fix centralization woes, eliminate MEV At the same time, Ethereum’s scaling challenges have made it increasingly inaccessible. Network congestion and gas fees soaring to hundreds of dollars during peak periods have effectively locked out average users. Seasoned users will be very well accustomed to the eye-watering gas fees required just to make basic swaps during times of high network congestion. Layer-2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum have made great progress, but they fragment liquidity and introduce their own trust assumptions. This isn’t to say Ethereum is failing. It’s not. As DeFi matures beyond its experimental phase and becomes more mainstream in global finance, we need to ask whether it makes sense to keep building on this foundation or to consider a more resilient alternative. Why Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s design philosophy is radically different. It isn’t a platform for unlimited experimentation; it’s a fortress of stability. Its conservative development ethos and proof-of-work consensus make Bitcoin the most secure blockchain in existence. This security translates into trust — a critical ingredient for DeFi applications handling billions of dollars in value. Liquidity is another advantage Bitcoin offers. With a market capitalization that dwarfs Ether’s ( ETH ), Bitcoin ( BTC ) is the most liquid cryptocurrency, making it an ideal base layer for DeFi. The rise of technologies like Bitcoin’s Lightning Network and sidechains like Spiderchain are already unlocking Bitcoin’s potential for smart contracts, offering the programmability developers need without sacrificing security or scalability. Not all Bitcoin projects are created equal Many so-called Bitcoin L2s and sidechains claim to be “Bitcoin native,” offering applications the promise of leveraging Bitcoin’s intrinsic security properties. Let’s set the record straight: Many aren’t truly Bitcoin-native. Without pointing fingers, these projects often rely on custodial multisig setups, bridge Bitcoin to Ethereum or another chain, and then build rollups on top. While there’s nothing inherently wrong with this approach, and there will be use cases that work with this set of trust assumptions, it’s not the same as being natively built on Bitcoin. True Bitcoin L2s are designed directly on Bitcoin, tapping into its liquidity, security and resilience — qualities that have withstood the test of time. If we want to expand DeFi capabilities, we must build them on Bitcoin. It’s a straightforward ask, but one worth reiterating as we see major players exploring paths that may not fully align with Bitcoin’s potential. The path forward The debate shouldn’t be framed as Ethereum versus Bitcoin. That’s a false binary. Ethereum’s innovation-first approach has been crucial in proving what’s possible, and it remains an essential hub of DeFi experimentation. Bitcoin offers something Ethereum doesn’t: a foundation that has already earned the trust of the broader financial world. Users shouldn’t have to choose between security and functionality. Bitcoin’s resilience is combined with sophisticated financial tools similar to those pioneered by Ethereum. Some of the most exciting work happening now is at this intersection. For DeFi to fulfill its promise of creating a fair, open and inclusive financial system, it must move beyond its experimental phase. It must be secure enough that average people can use it without fear of losing everything to an exploit. It needs liquidity deep enough to support real-world financial activity. And it requires the kind of institutional trust that only Bitcoin has achieved.

The company has gathered $11.4 billion in cash to distribute to thousands of parties affected by its 2022 bankruptcy, with the first payments to major creditors set for May 30. These include institutional investors and firms that held crypto on FTX’s platform. Smaller creditors with claims below the $50,000 mark have already begun receiving distributions. FTX’s collapse left a financial crater and a trail of frustrated creditors—many of whom expected to be repaid in crypto, not dollars. Since the bankruptcy, the price of bitcoin has more than quadrupled, intensifying frustrations among those waiting for their assets back. The task of unwinding FTX’s balance sheet has been slowed by a large number of claims, many of them reportedly questionable. Andrew Dietderich, a bankruptcy attorney for the firm, told the court that FTX has received “27 quintillion” claims, Blloomberg reported, many of which are duplicates or outright fraudulent. Interest payments are compounding the urgency. While FTX earns only a modest return on its cash, legitimate creditors are entitled to 9% interest annually on unpaid claims. The longer it takes to pay, the more the company could owe.

The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.7. Zhao plans on using Binance Thailand to distribute the funds but may consider other third parties to get the job done. Changpeng Zhao is the co-founder of the major crypto exchange, Binance . On March 28, at approximately 1:20 pm local time, the earthquake struck, with the strike zone being just 10 miles from Mandalay, a major city in Myanmar. The death rate is expected to rise, with injuries already numbering over 1000 at this early time. Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s junta chief, asked for help from anyone who could give it to aid in the recovery effort. Zhao reasoned that he would distribute the funds using Binance platforms if he could not find a decent on-chain donation platform. The earthquake caused widespread devastation, including floods and serious damage to infrastructure. Binance staff will oversee the distribution of funds so that the money is utilised well. Zhao has become more involved with charitable donations, positively contributing to people’s lives and showing how crypto can be used for practical applications. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) also applies to crypto businesses, but with the added benefit of the blockchain industry. This should not be a surprise because crypto is a new form of money. Further, acting responsibly instills trust with customers and business partners, demonstrating why others can trust your company. Countries such as China, India, America, Singapore, and Malaysia have already stepped in to provide support. Further, organisations like the Singapore Red Cross have started giving relief efforts. International organisations must collaborate during a natural disaster so that their efforts are utilised to the best of their abilities. Zhao’s lightning-fast response, donating 1,000 BNB to Myanmar and Thailand, establishes Binance as a key driver of relief efforts regarding major disasters. Zhao’s interest in philanthropic activities shows that the Binance exchange is interested in global events and has a vision of running its business well. A breakout in price may occur at the $620 level, while a drop may occur if the price breaks the $610 level. A price rising above $640 may indicate a serious pump in price and further long-term highs.",Cryptocurrency|News|Binance|Changpeng Zhao|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,BNB|EXCHANGE|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-29 15:01:34

Along with an overall crypto revival, there has been a revival in the meme coin sector as well. This is a welcome event because memes took several major hits in February and have taken a beating in the trading charts since then. The current revival has pushed DOGE’s growth by over 15% in the past week, and this is including several correction phases. The current Dogecoin price is $0.19, and there are expectations that it could cross the $0.22 price range. Many DOGE holders are known for their smart selection of potential winners, and the news that several DOGE whales are accumulating IntelMarkets tokens has made investors take notice. IntelMarkets is an ICO project currently in stage 10 of its presale and has already delivered 800% gains through its ICO and is poised to deliver more gains once it launches. Dogecoin Price Gains Boosted By Official DOGE Reserve Along with the growth in the Dogecoin price that is based on market momentum and investor sentiment, DOGE is also getting a boost through its technical developments. The latest of these is the launch of the Official DOGE Reserve by the DOGE Foundation. This project has been launched to improve DOGE’s practical utility and develop it as a payment method for mainstream use. This initiative is being run by what is called the House of DOGE. HoD is the new corporate division of the Dogecoin Foundation. There has been significant progress as the House of DOGE has picked up 10 million DOGE to support the reserve. This has also boosted the Dogecoin price by reducing supply. Along with these internal developments, Dogecoin’s price is also getting support from the addition of DOGE to Interactive Brokers trading options. This makes it easier to trade in DOGE. Many DOGE whales are ready for further developments in Dogecoin’s price, and smart traders have included IntelMarkets in their investment portfolios for its high returns. IntelMarkets AI Trading Bots Assess 100,000 Data Points While Dogecoin’s price continues to deliver gains, other investors are getting excited about the IntelMarkets AI tools. With AI and blockchain becoming more interconnected, the INTL presale is attracting many investors. IntelMarkets’ portfolio of features includes high-tech AI robots that have incredible speed in assessing the markets to identify clear and profitable trading opportunities. IntelMarkets (INTL) AI trading robots can process and analyze over 100,000 data points and are designed with self-learning abilities to train themselves and give users an edge over the shifting crypto market dynamics. The platform uses a data analysis feature known as the Intell-Array Multichannel Analysis. This helps analyze large data and easily find the best trading opportunities in the market. The platform also offers users a dual-chain architecture as it is compatible with the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. Traders on IntelMarkets can make even bigger trades with its 1,000x leverage on some assets. According to trading experts, these unique features and high user interest will push IntelMarkets’ value to exponential gains when it launches, and its success can be gauged from the high demand for its presale tokens. Conclusion The primary reason that IntelMarkets is becoming so popular with DOGE holders is its strong platform fundamentals. The platform offers a system designed to provide high monthly income structures with capital gains through its advanced trading bot. As one of the most promising new ICOs, it has plenty of room for growth and could replicate the growth of Dogecoin’s price. A token costs just $0.09 in the tenth ICO stage. Since debuting, over $12 million has been raised in early funding, and the price has soared 800%. Both DOGE whales and other traders are shifting to IntelMarkets’ $0.09 INTL token for its strong gain potential.

BTC crashed to $83,000 from this week’s high of $89,000. This article explains why BTC and other altcoins like Pi Network, Jasmy, VeChain, and Quant (QNT) prices have crashed. Altcoins like Pi Network, Jasmy, VeChain, and Quant have crashed Bitcoin and other altcoins have pulled back in the past few days. Quant, a popular player in the tokenization industry, crashed by over 10% in the last seven days. It has now dropped by over 56% from its highest level in November and is hovering at its lowest level since October. Pi Network, a popular tap-to-earn token, has slumped to a low of $0.7840, its lowest level since February 23rd. It has slumped by 75% from its all-time high. VeChain price has slumped to $0.023, down by over 71% from its November highs. In the past few days, other top laggards are altcoins like PancakeSwap, Hyperliquid, Kaspa, Lido DAO, and XRP. Fear and greed index in red The first main reason why these altcoins have slumped is that investors are highly fearful about the state of the market. Data by CNN Money shows that the fear and greed index has slumped to the extreme fear zone of 22. Similarly, the crypto fear and greed index tracked by CoinMarketCap has plunged to 25. Historically, Bitcoin and other altcoins slump when investors are fearful. This fear is coming from three key areas: Bitcoin’s bearish patterns, the US recession, and Federal Reserve’s actions. Bitcoin price formed bearish patterns The first main reason why altcoins like Pi Network, VeChain, and Quant have plunged is that Bitcoin is showing bearish signs. It has formed a rising wedge pattern, a popular bearish continuation sign. Bitcoin also formed a double-top pattern at $108,500, a notable situation since this is one of the most bearish signs in the market. Further, it formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages flipped each other. These patterns point to a further Bitcoin downtrend over time. Most altcoins plunge when Bitcoin is not doing well. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Read more: Bitcoin eyes $74K drop as CRO and FORM outperform with weekly gains Donald Trump Liberation Day tariffs The other main reason for the ongoing crypto crash is the rising fear about Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs. He has already provided the market with hints of what will come with his 25% tariff on autos . Trump has said that he will implement substantially higher tariffs on goods coming from countries in Europe, Asia, and South America. The risk is that these tariffs may trigger a recession in the United States and other countries. This recession will come from the slowing consumer and business investments in the country. This week’s data showed consumer confidence has plummeted by 17 points in the last three months. Flailing consumer confidence often leads to weak spending, which is the biggest part of the American economy. Federal Reserve actions Altcoins like VeChain, Quant, Jasmy, Pi Network, and Shiba Inu have plunged because of the uncertainties of what the Federal Reserve will do when the US sinks into a stagflation. Stagflation is a period when an economy is shrinking while inflation is rising. Data released this week showed that the headline and core Personal Consumption Index (PCE) remained significantly above the Fed’s target of 2.0% in February. Analysts anticipate that the Fed will maintain a hawkish tone in the coming months, and then start cutting later this year. Cryptocurrency prices underperform the market when the Fed is hawkish.

Hayes, Delo, Reed, and Gregory Dwyer — BitMEX’s first employee — were indicted by U.S. authorities in 2020 for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Hayes, who was then the exchange’s CEO, was forced to resign due to the legal complications. The reasons for President Trump’s pardon remain unclear as of press time, as the three individuals had already been sentenced to a combination of probation or home detention. The court also mandated each to pay a $10 million civil monetary penalty as part of a civil case with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Earlier this year, BitMEX was hit with a further $100 million fine after ending its lengthy legal tussle related to anti-money laundering violations. President Trump’s Crypto-Related Pardons Since assuming office on January 20, President Trump has issued a slew of contentious federal pardons, including to Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht , who is fundamentally tied to Bitcoin’s early history. Ulbricht was 11 years into a harsh sentence of double life in prison plus 40 years, with no possibility of parole. Reports have revealed that the disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years behind bars for his role in misusing user funds, is campaigning for a potential pardon from President Trump. It was also alleged that Binance co-founder and ex-CEO Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, who also served four months in prison last year, becoming the richest person to ever go to prison in the U.S , had also sought a pardon from President Trump. However, CZ quickly denied the reports that he was angling for his own pardon.",Cryptocurrency|News|BitMEX|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BNB|BTC|COMMODITY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-29 15:11:42

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that the price of Bitcoin dropped from a high of $87,500 on March 28 to an intra-day low of $81,900 on March 29. BTC/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Bitcoin’s price drop coincides with a marketwide drawdown fueled by uncertainties over Trump’s trade tariffs and poor economic data. The ensuing sell-off in stocks has left market participants wondering how much deeper the drawdown can go. Bitcoin wipes out liquidity in tumble to $81,000 BTC continued mounting losses on March 29, down 3% over the last 24 hours to trade just above $82,000. Key points: BTC price fell as low as $81,983 on Bitstamp, wiping out all the gains from earlier this week. This came as US inflation data came in hotter than expected . The February US Personal Consumption Expenditures ( PCE ) Index reading showed inflation quickening — in contrast to the January print . While the month-on-month and year-on-year PCE tally met market expectations of 0.3% and 2.5%, respectively, their core PCE equivalents were both 0.1% higher than anticipated. The implementation of broad-scale US tariffs next week—the so-called Liberation Day on April 2—also compounded investor concerns across markets . 24-hour crypto market liquidations hit $338 million, per data from monitoring resource CoinGlass.

This suggests that Bitcoin’s price might drop further to sweep the liquidity within this range before staging a sustained recovery. BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap (screenshot).

With major short liquidation levels sitting above $88,000, the analyst said that Bitcoin could be experiencing a classic weekend correction with a possible reversal next week. “Typical weekend dump with next week’s reversal? At least, this is a possible scenario.” Related: Bitcoin price falls toward range lows, but data shows ‘whales going wild right now’ Bitcoin bear flag hints at $62,000 From a technical perspective, BTC’s price decline on March 29 is part of its prevailing bear flag pattern. Key points: A bear flag suggests a continuation of the bearish momentum, with sellers taking control. A temporary consolidation (flag) formed near $88,000, indicating a failed breakout attempt. Bitcoin broke below key support levels, including the lower boundary of the flag at $85,800 at the 200-day simple moving average (SMA).

Founder of MN Capital, Michael van de Poppe, argued that Bitcoin will likely some more downward momentum as the trend remains lower. He adds that the price could retest the lows at $76,600 “before going back upward.” It seems to be vital that we're seeing some more downwards momentum on the markets for #Bitcoin .

The price has fluctuated between $124.67 and $131.29, signaling consolidation within a critical range. Investors and traders are closely watching for SOL’s next decisive move . Technical Breakdown Across Time Frames Short-Term (Intraday Outlook) SOL is consolidating between $120 (support) and $144 (resistance). A breakout from this zone could determine the next price direction. Medium-Term (Daily Chart Analysis) SOL has been in a downtrend, losing 6.67% in the past month.

However, the premier cryptocurrency experienced a steep correction on Friday, March 28, following the latest February core inflation data. With the price of BTC now hovering beneath $84,000, panic seems to be growing in the market as investors fear further correction for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data show the critical support levels for the Bitcoin price. Is BTC At Risk Of A Fall To $71,000? In a recent post on the X platform, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode explained the recent investor behavior and how it could impact the Bitcoin price action over the next few days. This evaluation is based on the cost basis distribution data of investors around the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Face $14 Billion Options Expiry—Market Impact Ahead? According to Glassnode, the cost basis distribution data reflects the total Bitcoin supply held by addresses with an average cost basis within specific price buckets. As observed in the chart below, the heat map (color intensity) represents the magnitude of BTC supply in a price zone. Source: @glassnode on XGlassnode data shows that a significant percentage of traders purchased roughly 15,000 BTC at the $78,000 level on March 10 before selling at the recent $87,000 local top. Following this latest round of redistribution, the BTC supply at the $78,000 level is now thin, weakening the support cushion. It is worth noting, though, that the next crucial support levels lie around $84,100, $82,090, and $80,920, where investors purchased 40,000 BTC, 50,000 BTC, and 20,000 BTC, respectively. However, the Bitcoin price could be at risk of a deep correction if it loses these levels. In case of a deeper correction, $78,000 might not offer a strong enough cushion for the flagship cryptocurrency following the recent sell-off by investors previously holding at the level. Glassnode data shows that the Bitcoin price could fall to as low as $74,000, the next significant support level after $80,000. The on-chain analytics platform highlighted $74,000 (where investors bought 49,000 BTC) and $71,000 (where investors bought 41,000 BTC) as the next support levels should the Bitcoin price fall beneath $80,000. “These levels reflect conviction-driven accumulation zones that could absorb additional downside pressure,” Glassnode added. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $83,800, reflecting an almost 4% decline in the past 24 hours.

On‑Chain Data Explains",https://bitzo.com/2025/03/when-can-we-expect-a-rebound-for-solana-ethereum-and-xrp-after-the-correction-onchain-data-explains,"Solana , Ethereum , and XRP have recently experienced a correction. Investors and enthusiasts are eager to know when these cryptocurrencies might rebound. On-chain data offers insights into potential timelines and factors influencing their future performance. Discover which coins show signs of growth. Solana Market: Downtrend Remains with Key Support in View SOL experienced a decline of 6.22% over the last month and a loss of 19.91% in the past six months. The asset also faced a weekly drop of 1.11%, indicating persistent seller pressure. Price movements have been volatile, as the coin struggles to establish a solid upward trajectory. Recent performance highlights a market that is cautious and reactive to shifting buyer sentiment. Currently, SOL trades between $104 and $213.04. The nearest resistance levels are at $277.85 and $386.39, while support is identified at $60.77. The bearish sentiment dominates the market, with no clear long-term trend visible. Traders might look for opportunities to engage when a breakout occurs or when a strong price bounce from support is evident. Ethereum Experiences Bearish Pressure with Significant Declines Ethereum prices dropped 19.44% in the past month and 29.14% over the last six months. Such declines and reduced momentum indicate persistent bearish pressure and cautious investor sentiment. The trend has remained downward, with short-term setbacks impacting the overall market positioning and leading to a lack of confidence among traders. Currently, Ethereum trades between $1766 and $3020.96. Immediate support is at $1294.44, while resistance lies around $3803.76, with a second resistance at $5058.42. Bearish signals prevail, marked by negative momentum and a sub-40 RSI. Trading strategies may involve short positions near resistance or waiting for price stability around key support levels before making moves. XRP: Six-Month Surge Amid Recent Pullback and Key Price Levels XRP dropped 2.69% over the past month while surging 233.49% in the last six months. This reflects a period of short-term weakness amid a strong recovery over the longer term. The substantial six-month gain indicates renewed investor interest and resilience during volatile market conditions. The current price range is between $1.60 and $2.88, with resistance at $3.61 and support at $1.06. Bearish signals from a negative momentum indicator suggest market caution. No clear trend is visible, making it sensible to consider trades that test support levels or aim for a break above resistance toward $4.89. Conclusion The recent correction in the crypto market has affected SOL , ETH , and XRP . On-chain data suggests signs of potential rebounds. Key metrics indicate strengthened network activity for these coins. SOL shows increased transactions and active addresses. ETH’s upcoming updates could drive renewed interest. XRP benefits from growing transaction volumes and legal developments. These factors point to possible recovery for SOL, ETH, and XRP.

Whales appear to be preparing themselves for this decline as on-chain data reveals that these large addresses are selling SOL. Solana Price Risks 50% Crash From Triangle Pattern Solana price trades at $126 today after a 3% decline in 24 hours. This marks the altcoin’s lowest level in two weeks as bearish trends prevail across the broader crypto market due to a massive selloff from traders because of fears of spiking US inflation . This decline has caused more than $12M in total SOL liquidations, with over 90% of the liquidated positions being from long traders. This scenario has created concerns from traders, with popular analyst Ali Charts sharing a bearish Solana price prediction that it is headed for a crash towards $60. In his analysis, trader Ali noted that Solana price had formed an ascending triangle pattern. The most crucial support level for SOL in this pattern is $125. If this altcoin drops below this support level, it could trigger a 50% decline toward $60 and push SOL toward a multi-month low. SOL/USD: 1-day Chart At the same time, Crypto Patel observed that Solana has confirmed a downtrend after it dropped below a critical demand zone. Patel urged traders to book partial profits on SOL and adjust their stop-loss to the break-even point to avoid recording more losses. Whales Dump SOL as DEX Volumes Hit 6-Month Low The recent decline in Solana price has stirred whale selling activity. Data from Lookonchain shows that one whale address has unstaked 60,289 SOL valued at $7.67M, suggesting that these large addresses are bearish on the price and anticipate that the SOL will plunge. Whales are also likely selling because of concerns that Solana price might soon drop below the $100 price level and reach a one-year low. However, reduced network activity might also be keeping large addresses on edge. According to data from DeFiLlama, the DEX volumes on the Solana network recently dropped to the lowest point in six months. At press time, SOL had recorded $14B in weekly DEX volumes, which is a massive drop from the peak of $97 billion posted in January 2025 when Solana price rallied . As the DeFi activity falls alongside the price, it will reduce the level of market confidence in Solana, which could accelerate the ongoing selling activity. This highlights bearish headwinds that will likely force Solana price to lose the psychological level of $100 and plunge towards $60.

With the meme coin world bursting at the seams, crypto watchers are closely eyeing some major players turning heads this week. SPX6900 is stirring chatter on social platforms with its humorous yet market-savvy tokenomics, while Act I: The AI Prophecy continues to tease something revolutionary with every new on-chain move. But all eyes are increasingly drawn to the Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) presale — now deep into its 16th phase at Crystal Cove — where the price still sits at just $0.000083. With over $2 million already raised and no traditional staged model, Arctic Pablo’s geo-presale model has ignited a fresh wave of interest from early adopters. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Act I: The AI Prophecy, and SPX6900 — with a particular spotlight on why Arctic Pablo is emerging as one of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy This Week. Weekly Token Burns Make Arctic Pablo Coin One of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy This Week A core driver of Arctic Pablo Coin’s momentum is its aggressive token burn strategy. Designed with deflationary economics in mind, this mechanism permanently removes unsold tokens from circulation every single week during the presale. Unlike projects that simply promise scarcity, Arctic Pablo delivers it transparently — all burns are recorded directly on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). That’s not all. Tokens left over after the presale will also be burned, cementing scarcity and locking in potential for post-launch value spikes. This ongoing weekly reduction in supply, paired with a fixed supply model, positions Arctic Pablo Coin as one of the Best New Meme Coins to Buy This Week — especially for those tracking early token metrics and long-term value plays. The value proposition doesn’t end there. Arctic Pablo Coin incentivizes staking with an eye-catching APY of 66% during presale — a feature few meme coins are offering in this phase. Add in referral rewards and community competitions, and what you have is a project not just built for growth but one that gives back to its early supporters in real time. Crystal Cove Awaits: Arctic Pablo’s Presale Heats Up at $0.000083 — Best New Meme Coins to Buy This Week Arctic Pablo Coin’s unique presale model sets it apart from nearly every other meme coin on the market. Instead of traditional stages, it follows a location-based journey. Right now, APC has reached Crystal Cove, the 16th checkpoint in its world-spanning adventure — and the excitement is electric. At this phase, each $APC is priced at just $0.000083 — a jaw-dropping figure when considering the launch price is locked in at $0.008. That’s a potential ROI of 9552.41% from today’s price point. More than $2 million has already poured into the meme coin presale, and the price jumps with every new location reached. Crystal Cove won’t last forever. Once APC moves on, the entry price increases again, and this moment — this exact stage — could be the last true low-price window available. There’s no slowing down either.

Onchain data shared by cryptocurrency analytics firm Santiment shows an unusual spike in whale activity in the Immutable X (IMX) altcoin. According to analysts, when large wallets increase their transfers in a cryptocurrency, it could indicate a period of accumulation. Related News: Cryptocurrency Statement from China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) Official Santiment data shows that crypto whale wallets holding at least 100,000 IMX tokens have amassed a total of 4.55 million IMX over the past three months. However, the IMX price continues to trend downward. The token’s price has fallen by 19% in the last month, while the decline rate in the last year has been 80%. IMX, which is listed on major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Upbit and Coinbase, has a market value of approximately $1 billion at the time of writing. The token, which has a large user base especially in South Korea, has the theme of Web3 games, which were once very popular. *This is not investment advice.

Deaton wants the SEC to make the report public to encourage transparency, especially since the SEC’s approach to regulating crypto remains under scrutiny. In a recent post on X , Deaton demanded that the SEC make public the internal discussions revolving around Hinman’s statement that led to the investigations. He insists that the report will provide investors and the community with clarity on whether Ethereum was favored over other digital assets like XRP. John Deaton pushes SEC to release the Hinman report In 2018, William Hinman (a former SEC official) stated that Ethereum (ETH) was not a security. This comment greatly influenced how the SEC classified various cryptocurrencies as securities, and it also favored Ethereum over other assets, like XRP, which didn’t get the same public clarification. Instead of the SEC providing clear guidelines for classifying crypto, it used Hinman’s statement as a basis to sue XRP’s parent company, Ripple, for trading XRP as an unlicensed security. The crypto community rallied behind XRP, accusing the SEC of playing favorites and subjecting other digital assets to stricter regulations. John Deaton has been at the forefront of fighting for the release of the IG report following the lawsuit against XRP after Hinman’s speech. His complaints resulted from an investigation that revealed Hinman’s connections to the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, which proves a conflict of interest in the SEC’s decision. SEC faces growing pressure over crypto regulations Deaton believes that the SEC’s failure to release the reports, despite repeated requests from the public, questions the agency’s integrity and impartiality in its selection process. He even called out SEC officials Paul Atkins , Mark Uyeda, and Hester Peirce to push for releasing this report because they previously campaigned for transparency in the crypto space. Deaton says that if the report confirms Hinman’s comments had something to do with the SEC’s lawsuit against XRP and its decision regarding other digital assets, the agency would have to re-examine and restructure its entire regulatory process. The SEC still hasn’t released the IG report despite increasing public pressure, which only serves to attract more criticism from investors, lawmakers, and industry leaders. Watchdog groups that monitor government agencies, businesses, and public institutions to ensure transparency, accountability, and ethical behavior have also found discrepancies in Hinman’s comments. Empower Oversight identified a possible breach of the federal law “18 USC 208” that prohibits government officials from participating in matters that interest them financially.

However, an analyst says the stablecoin will make its debut on exchanges as early as April 1, baring any delays to stablecoin regulation in the US. Expert Says USD1 Stablecoin Will List On April 1 Pseudonymous crypto analyst xHuai.eth took to X to predict a potential listing date for WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin. According to the analyst, the USD1 stablecoin may be available for trading as early as April 1 in line with industry conventions. The analsyt disclosed that stablecoins are typically listed on exchanges within days of the annnouncement. WLFI announced the launch of the USD1 stablecoin on March 25 issued on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. xHuai.eth disclosed that stablecoin listings on exchanges hinge on the completion of necessary technical steps. From the announcement, tapping Ehtereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Bitgo for custodial service indicates a completion of the technical steps. Furthermore, xHuai.eth says that WLFI will be pressured to speed up listing processes to compete with USDT and USDC. “With the announcement on March 25, the timeframe of March 31 to April 5 is reasonable,” said xHuai.eth. “April 1 is the most feasible date if there are no delays.” Stablecoin Regulations May Affect The Listing Process According to xHuai.eth’s analysis, incoming stablecoin regulation in the US will play a role in the USD1 stablecoin listing. The WLFI has previously mentioned that the launch on exchanges hinges on “regulatory approval” for stablecoins. The US is hurtling toward stablecoin regulations with the GENIUS Act and STABLE Act piquing the interest of the White House. With authorities keen on expediting the passage of regulations, xHuai.eth argues the WLFI will move to list the USD1 stablecoin. However, a delay in the regulatory process could lead to listing in late April, a scenario that xHuai.eth sees as unlikely. Authorities expect stablecoin regulation to go live in the US within two months driven by full support from the executive arm. Following the release of the full draft of the STABLE Act, Sonic Labs is abandoning plans for an algorithmic stablecoin. Other issuers are positioning themselves to spearhead the government plans to maintain the dollar’s supremacy using stablecoins.

Hint XRP Member!,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-sec-could-delay-its-announcement-until-august-7-hint-xrp-member/,"The post XRP News: SEC Could Delay Its Announcement Until August 7? Hint XRP Member! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The long-running legal fight between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing its final chapter . With both sides dropping their respective appeals, attention has now turned to what comes next. However, a new claim from an XRP community member suggests that the SEC won’t make any official announcement on the case until August 7, raising questions about a potential delay. Is a Settlement Really Happening? Ripple’s legal chief, Stuart Alderoty, has hinted that all necessary paperwork for a settlement has already been prepared. The next step, however, lies in the hands of the SEC Commission, which is expected to vote on the matter within the next 30 days. Once that vote is complete, the SEC will move to lift the injunction imposed on Ripple. If Ripple complies with the process, Judge Analisa Torres will then sign off on the motion, officially closing the case. Will the SEC Remains Silent Until August 7? Adding more fuel to the speculation, an XRP supporter named Brett recently made a bold claim on social media. He stated that the SEC would not make any official announcement on the lawsuit until August 7, citing a court document as his source. His post quickly gained traction, with some in the community seeing it as a significant development. However, not everyone agreed. Many pointed out that the document he referenced was from last year, casting doubt on its relevance to the current situation. Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel even dismissed the claim outright, calling it “stupid and wrong.” This conflicting information has left the XRP community divided on what to believe. Lawyer dropping by to say: this is stupid and wrong. You’re welcome! — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) March 28, 2025 No Official Announcement From the SEC Although both the SEC and Ripple have withdrawn their appeals, the agency has yet to make an official announcement, leading to speculation that the case may already be settled. However, legal complexities could be causing a delay. Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett suggested that the SEC might be waiting to ask Judge Torres to remove the injunction—a step that is different from how other cases have been handled. For now, XRP holders are eagerly waiting for clarity, with hopes that the lawsuit’s resolution will bring long-awaited regulatory certainty to Ripple and its token.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 15:55:19

At the moment, SHIB is trading at the $0.000012 support level. With the loss of 77 million SHIB, the coin has been making a symmetrical triangle pattern. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are also under a price drop and significant liquidations. Shiba Inu Price Forms Symmetrical Triangle as Market Corrects The crypto analyst highlights that the Shiba Inu price is currently in the middle of building a symmetrical triangle pattern, signifying a breakout. This technical formation indicates that cryptocurrency is in a consolidation period and has undergone some market corrections in recent times. The price of SHIB has been oscillating within a contracting range, suggesting a huge price movement is imminent. SHIB is being shown by the analyst to be placed in a strong buy zone. As such, it was anticipated by analysts that its price could rise as high as 0. 0023 over the near term, a realization of some 17X. SHIB Price: 77M SHIB Sold at Loss, Signaling Market Shift The recent surge of the 30 day MVRV ratio above zero for SHIB seems to hint at increased demand from investors. Transitioning to this shift, and increased confidence in that fact has resulted in a quick price rebound. The MVRV ratio measures market prices and the price at which tokens were last moved, and becomes positive on crossing into positive territory, indicating positive sentiment. Also on March 20, 77.64 million SHIB was sold as a cause of a loss, which means that the assets were taken away from weak hands and transferred to stronger ones. Ownership shift often results in price stability, and in the most favorable cases, the emergence of long-term growth, where more engaged token owners stack, creating a positive space for long-term price movement. How Low Will SHIB Price Go? The latest SHIB price stands at $0.00001280, showing a modest 3% decrease in the past 24 hours. The meme coin movement appears to be consolidating within a descending channel pattern, which is visible on the daily chart. The SHIB is encountering strong resistance around $0.000013, with an immediate support level found at $0.00001280. This range has been pivotal, as the price has recently bounced off this support area multiple times. If the Shiba Inu price prediction breaks below the $0.00001250 level, a deeper pullback toward the $0.000012 support could be expected. If the crypto sell market increases, the SHIB price could decrease to $0.00001 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 36.37 and below the neutral as this may suggest weakness The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line is below the signal line so bearish momentum is likely in the near term. Source: TradingView If SHIB manages to break to the upside, the first level of resistance would be at $0.00001300, which has been a key price point. If the price surpasses this level, the next resistance could be at $0.00001350, followed by $0.00001400. A successful break above these levels would suggest a shift toward a more bullish trend.

Further, the presale, which launched just 8 days ago, has already raised $5.4 million and attracted over 7,200 holders to date. Now at Phase 3, tokens are valued at $0.02 — a number which will jump 25% to $0.025 when Phase 4 starts. As over 95% of Phase 3 tokens have been claimed, urgency is building among buyers looking to cash in before the next price surge. MUTM will list at $0.06, which means a potential immediate profit for the Phase 3 investors of 200%. Predictions also indicate it will rise to $3 by 2025, thanks to Mutuum Finance’s structured tokenomics and its innovative form of DeFi through lending. Presale Momentum Builds The instant sell out of Phase 3 signals a spike in confidence in Mutuum Finance ’s ecosystem. Its decentralized lending framework, allowing users to borrow assets against overcollateralized deposits, is being compared to established DeFi protocols. MUTM has real utility such as interest-generating mtTokens, p2p lending options, and a buy-and-distribute mechanism to redirect platform revenue back into the token via buybacks. The repurchased tokens are then distributed to stakers, establishing repeating demand that reflects long-term value stability. As it now stands, these early token adopters now not only position themselves to profit from an almost imminent 25% price increase, but also from the anticipated listing spree. Calculating the Path to $3 Tokenomics clearly outline a growth plan. The tiered nature of the presale ensures each stage sees a gradual price increase, with the token making its exchange debut at $0.06 — representing 3x the current Phase 3 investment. After its launch, analysts use Mutuum Finance’s profit-driven buy pressure and growing customer base as reasons for continued appreciation. If adoption continues to trend with projections, MUTM could break $3 in 2025, yielding a 14,900% return from Phase 3 price. This path resonated with the most successful DeFi projects which elegantly unite utility and scarcity but Mutuum Finance’s unique selling point comes from the transferability of mtTokens and a collateralized stablecoin that is currently in development. Building Blocks for Continued Growth Mutuum Finance Deserves the Attention with its Stringent Security Protocols Its smart contracts are being audited by Certik and results should soon be published on official social channels. The transparency calms investors who are wary of vulnerabilities in newer projects. Arranging a $100k giveaway for presale participants also increase the engagement, encouraging users to purchase more tokens and further increase the community size. Its dual-similarity appeal—to lenders seeking yield, as well as a subset of borrowers able to access liquidity without liquidating any assets—encapsulates its multi-pronged function in DeFi. MUTM’s rise to $3 is contingent on increased adoption of its platform and the overall crypto market backdrop, market analysts note. But supply squeeze that mechanisms like, built-in sell pressure reduction mechanisms like staking rewards and locked collateral could push the price up even more. It is likely that early adopters who bought in at $0.02 will be holding an asset worth 150x that value 2 years from now based on user acquisition and product rollouts — And it will if it is being built on solid foundations. The strong presale numbers and prudent token allocation mean Mutuum Finance looks well positioned for longevity. Although the $3 price target is bold, the intersection of deflationary tokenomics, real-world utility and audited security frameworks makes its case stronger. With Phase 3 filling up fast the opportunity to get tokens at below $0.025 is now almost gone. For investors assessing high-risk, high-reward avenues, MUTM’s presale is a strategic entry into a platform built to reward your participation long past the current wave of hype. Stay Updated and Act Swiftly Audit announcement will be through Mutuum Finance’s official channels, as well as presale announcements. Phase 3 allocation is slowly running out, and putting it off means missing out on the last chance to buy below $0.025.

Kalshi's legal team argued that the contracts fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and, therefore, cannot be regulated by state-level authorities. The team also contends that the cease and desist orders fail to recognize that Kalshi's event contracts are two-sided markets that trade as swaps as opposed to the sports-betting book model where the house controls the market. Kalshi co-founder Tarek Mansour said: ""Prediction markets are a critical innovation of the 21st century, and like all innovations, they are initially misunderstood. We are proud to be the company that has pioneered this technology and stand ready to defend it once again in a court of law.” Additionally, the Nevada Gaming Control Board sent Kalshi a cease and desist order for its election contracts, which a United States judge ruled were legal in September 2024 — allowing the contracts to trade freely in the US .

Ripple ( XRP ), like other altcoins, has crashed as concerns about the state of the U.S. economy and President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Data released on Friday showed that inflation rose in February while consumer spending slowed. This report came a few days after the Conference Board said consumer confidence dropped in March. The consumer confidence figure pushed Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody’s , to warn that recession odds were rising. These risks have led to panic among the stock and crypto markets. The U.S. stock market crashed, with the top three indices, Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500, falling by over 2%.

For example, Ripple entered a deal with Chipper Cash , a popular fintech company in Africa that will now use its technology to handle transactions. Ripple also received a money transmitter license in New York in January, and this week, it received a license from the United Arab Emirates. The recent decision by the SEC to end its lawsuit against Ripple Labs has also led to more deal-making. In an interview with Fox’s Maria Bartiromo , Brad Garlinghouse said that more American companies were willing to partner with the company. Ripple’s goal is to disrupt the 50-year-old model by SWIFT, which handles over $150 trillion in cash each year. It aims to connect banks and money transfer companies globally and provide them with a faster and cheaper alternative. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the XRP price has crashed in the past few months. It peaked at $3.40 in January and has now plunged to $2.31. The risk is that the coin has formed a head and shoulders pattern whose neckline is at $1.96. Its shoulders are at $3, while the head is at $3.40. H&S is one of the riskiest patterns in technical analysis. Don't shoot the messenger.

Therefore, a drop below the key support at $1.9515 will point to more downside, potentially to $1. This support is the 50% Fibonacci Retracement point and also the neckline of the H&S pattern. A drop to $1 would signify a 53% crash from the current level.

Meanwhile, on March 29, 2024, blockchain-based on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain posted on X (formerly Twitter) that an OG PEPE holder—an early investor in the meme coin—has dumped billions of tokens, raising concerns about a significant price decline. Crypto Whale Dumps 150 Billion PEPE In a post on X, Lookonchain noted that amid this market decline, a whale sold 150 billion PEPE tokens worth $1.14 million on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. The post further mentioned that, so far, this whale has sold 1.02 trillion PEPE meme coins for $6.66 million, making a total profit of $10.3 million, equivalent to 4,718x.

Meanwhile, during the same period, its trading volume dropped by 25%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. PEPE Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, PEPE appears bearish after a massive price decline. The meme coin’s four-hour chart reveals that PEPE has been moving in an ascending channel pattern, but with the recent price drop, it has breached the lower boundary of the channel and closed a daily candle below that level.

The decision comes as stablecoin regulations tighten in the US, thus, the company is shifting its focus to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) dirham. Sonic Labs’ Sudden U-Turn Just a week after hinting at launching a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin with an annual percentage rate (APR) of up to 23%, Sonic Labs has now dropped the plan. Co-founder Andre Cronje confirmed this in a post on X, citing regulatory concerns. We will no longer be releasing a USD based algorithmic stable coin. Completely unrelated, we will be releasing a mathematically bound numerical Dirham which is settled and denominated in USD, which is definitely not a USD based algorithmic stable coin. https://t.co/NlLsT5IqoE — Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) March 28, 2025 Instead, the company is working on a “mathematically bound numerical Dirham” that will be settled and denominated in USD. However, Cronje insists this is “definitely not a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin.” The timing of this move aligns with the UAE’s plans to launch its blockchain-based digital dirham in late 2025. Khaled Mohamed Balama, governor of the UAE Central Bank, believes this initiative will strengthen financial stability and curb financial crime. The digital dirham will function alongside physical cash, expanding its use in payment channels. Algorithmic Stablecoins Still Face Scrutiny Sonic’s reversal follows skepticism surrounding algorithmic stablecoins, especially after Terra’s infamous collapse in 2022. The $40 billion crash of Terra’s UST stablecoin wiped out billions in investor funds, triggering global concerns about such assets. Cronje himself had expressed doubts about algorithmic stablecoins in the past, citing personal stress from their risks. “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stablecoins today,” he once said, “but previous cycles gave me PTSD.” The European Union has already banned algorithmic stablecoins under its MiCA regulations to prevent another Terra-like disaster. The US is also moving in that direction. Stablecoin Regulations Loom in the US The US government is actively working on stablecoin regulations through the GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act. Both bills mandate a 1:1 reserve ratio and avoid algorithmic models altogether. Authorities aim to finalize regulations within two months, with major issuers like Tether, Circle, and Ripple positioning themselves to play a central role. Therefore, Sonic Labs is choosing to adapt rather than face uncertain regulatory challenges in the US.",News,EN,0,0,FIAT|BUSINESS|LUNA|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 16:31:15

The cryptocurrency market remains volatile, and VET’s price action suggests continued bearish pressure across different timeframes. Daily Chart Analysis: Bearish Momentum Persists On the daily chart, VET continues to struggle below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Both indicators are sloping downward, reinforcing a bearish outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains within the neutral 30-70 range, indicating that neither buyers nor sellers hold a dominant position. However, unless VET reclaims key resistance at $0.025, further downside remains likely. Weekly Chart: Long-Term Resistance Holding Strong Zooming out to the weekly timeframe, VET exhibits a similar bearish structure. The 50-week and 200-week moving averages have been trending downward, signaling long-term weakness. These levels act as strong resistance, preventing any substantial price recovery. If VET fails to break above $0.026 in the coming weeks, continued bearish pressure could push the price toward the $0.020 support level. 4-Hour Chart: Short-Term Selling Pressure On the 4-hour chart, VET remains under short-term selling pressure. The 50-period moving average is declining, and the RSI has dipped below the neutral zone, approaching oversold conditions . While this suggests a possible short-term bounce, there are no clear reversal signals yet. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price Prediction for the Next 8 Hours In the short term, VET is expected to fluctuate between $0.0225 and $0.0235. If the price manages to break above $0.0235, a move toward $0.025 is possible. However, failure to hold support at $0.0225 could lead to further declines, potentially testing the $0.0218 level. VeChain’s price action remains bearish across all major timeframes , with key resistance levels limiting upward momentum. Traders should watch for any breakout above $0.025 for potential bullish confirmation. Until then, VET is likely to experience further consolidation or downside movement.

As market conditions remain highly volatile, XRP’s latest price movements have left traders questioning the next phase for the digital asset. #XRP – Is Crashing Run for yourself : pic.twitter.com/9FSIHPaDq0 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 28, 2025 Market Overview and XRP’s Decline As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.11, exhibiting an 11.25% decline over the week. The asset has experienced a sharp downturn, reflecting broader instability in the cryptocurrency market. After previously showing signs of bullish momentum, the asset has succumbed to increased selling pressure, with prices dropping below key support levels. Analysts have pointed to several factors contributing to this decline, including macroeconomic uncertainties, shifting investor sentiment, and technical indicators signaling weakness. Analyzing the Technical Landscape Technical analysts have noted that XRP is currently trading near critical support zones. If the price fails to hold at these levels, further declines could be imminent. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates oversold conditions, suggesting that while the downtrend is strong, a potential bounce may be on the horizon. Additionally, moving averages and Fibonacci retracement levels are being closely monitored to determine the next potential reversal points. Market Sentiment and Investor Reactions The broader crypto market has also seen fluctuations, with Bitcoin , Ethereum , and other major altcoins experiencing mixed movements. XRP’s decline may partly stem from profit-taking, regulatory concerns, or market-wide corrections. However, long-term supporters remain optimistic, citing XRP’s strong fundamentals, real-world use cases, and ongoing institutional adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for XRP? While EGRAG Crypto’s warning reflects the current bearish sentiment , seasoned investors understand that volatility is inherent in crypto markets. The key focus now is whether XRP can reclaim lost ground and establish a new upward trajectory. As traders brace for potential reversals, all eyes are on upcoming support and resistance levels that could determine the asset’s next major move. In the coming days, market participants will closely watch XRP’s price action for signs of stabilization or further breakdown. Whether this downturn is a short-term shakeout or part of a larger trend shift remains to be seen. As always, investors should stay informed, exercise caution, and approach market movements with a strategic mindset.

But according to Samson Mow , this breakdown is a “bear trap”—a fakeout designed to flush out weak hands before a larger move higher. Mow remains firm on his $1 million BTC target, arguing the recent sell-off doesn’t reflect fundamentals. Bitcoin still holds a $1.64 trillion market cap, with 19.84 million BTC in circulation. Two words: bear trap. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) March 28, 2025 While Mow sees upside ahead, charts tell a different story. BTC has broken below a symmetrical triangle, with the former support at $83,650 now acting as resistance. Bitcoin Technical Setup Signals Caution The recent breakdown from the symmetrical triangle pattern has turned $83,650 into a key resistance zone, stalling any immediate rebound. A bearish engulfing candle under this level signals continued selling pressure. Current Price : $82,516.97 24H Volume : $19.93B Resistance Levels : $83,650, $85,231, $86,841 Support Levels : $82,000, $81,278, $79,990 50 EMA : $85,231 (above current price) RSI (14) : 27.63 (oversold) The RSI remains oversold, but without bullish divergence, offering no clear sign of reversal. A breakdown through the triple bottom around $83,000 further weakens the structure, placing $81,278 and $79,990 in view. Volume near current levels is also subdued, reflecting a lack of strong buyer support. What Comes Next for Bitcoin? The key question is whether this is the trap Mow describes, or the start of a broader correction. Broader sentiment is mixed, with macroeconomic pressure and tight liquidity weighing on high-risk assets. A confirmed reclaim of $83,650, followed by a breakout above the 50 EMA at $85,231, would be an early signal of bullish recovery. Otherwise, continued failure at current levels risks a slide below $80,000. Key Signals to Monitor: Break and close above $83,650 RSI divergence or recovery above 30 Trading volume increase on bounce attempts Support holding at $81,278 or $79,990 Until these conditions are met, Bitcoin remains vulnerable. Whether Samson Mow’s call plays out will depend on how markets respond in the days ahead.

The FBI says more than 2,000 complaints have been filed at the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) in the last year, reporting fake texts about unpaid highway tolls. These “smishing” attacks – combining SMS and phishing – trick users into clicking links that mimic state toll services. The messages urge immediate payment to avoid fees using statements like, “We’ve noticed an outstanding toll amount of $12.51 on your record.” The goal is to convince users to hand over their debit and credit card information, and victims who click the links risk losing both their money and personal data. Cybercrime expert Michael Skiba tells CNBC he believes the actual scale of the attack is “astronomical”, with current reporting from victims representing a small slice of those who are truly affected. The FBI says the scam shifts from state to state and advises people to report suspicious texts to www.ic3.gov , including the sender’s number and link. Authorities also urge users to verify toll debts through official channels and avoid clicking unknown links to protect their finances.

The upgrade introduces fully on-chain validation for asset delisting. This follows after a $6 million exploit, where a whale forced a short squeeze of the JELLY memecoin, which led to the exchange delisting the memecoin. Hyperliquid introduces fully on-chain validation before asset delisting In a post on X, Hyperliquid revealed that it has upgraded its blockchain, introducing fully on-chain validator voting for asset delisting. This development enables a quorum of validator stakes to autonomously trigger asset removals directly on-chain without the need for off-chain coordination. Hyperliquid said the move is a show of its commitment to enhancing decentralized governance within its ecosystem, following the backlash it got after delisting the JELLY memecoin.​ Hyperliquid said “As a demonstration of the primitive, the Hyper Foundation validators 2-5 will vote to delist MYRO perps around 13:00 UTC on March 29. Hyper Foundation validator 1 will abstain from voting until delegations to initial Delegation Program participants are complete,” adding that validators will likely close votes off-chain for clarity. However, the Hyper Foundation does not speak for them. On March 26, 2025, Hyperliquid experienced a high-profile trading manipulation involving the memecoin JELLY. A trader exploited the platform’s liquidation mechanisms by strategically opening both long and short positions. The manipulation resulted in significant exposure for the Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) vault. In response, the perp DEX shut down the market, closing the price of the token at about $0.0095, turning the potential loss into over $700,000 profit. Hyperliquid addresses centralization concerns The exchange has faced criticism from the crypto community for how it handled the JELLY incident. Earlier in March, the exchange took action against leveraged trading, increasing margin requirements after the HLP lost several millions of dollars in a large Ether liquidation event. Even that move dropped user confidence in its claim of decentralization. Hyperliquid has faced criticism in the past over centralization concerns. Members of the crypto community have highlighted several issues such as limited transparency, restricted participation, and API access limitations. Also, Hyperliquid controls 81% of the staked HYPE tokens, which the community sees as evidence of centralization. The CEO of Bitget, Gracy Chen, wrote, “The way it handled the $JELLY incident was immature, unethical, and unprofessional, triggering user losses and casting serious doubts over its integrity,” adding that it could become FTX 2.0. Blockchain analyst ZackXBT also questioned its governance, pointing out inconsistencies in the platform’s intervention strategies. He noted that while Hyperliquid acted swiftly during the JELLY incident, it had previously claimed its inability to address other significant issues, doubting its commitment to decentralization. Hyperliquid acknowledged the event and said affected users will be reimbursed. “Technical improvements will be made, and the network will grow stronger as a result of lessons learned,” it added. The incident led to the exchange’s native crypto HYPE experiencing an 11% price drop. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

This time, Schiff stated that Bitcoin’s status as digital gold is being exposed and suggested that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plans may not work out as planned. Peter Schiff Criticizes Bitcoin’s Status As Digital Gold In an X post , Peter Schiff stated that the false narrative that Bitcoin is digital gold is being exposed. He remarked that BTC’s growth is slowing as inflation rises and stagflation fears spread. The economist added that tariff uncertainty is adding to the pressure on financial markets. Schiff, who is a gold proponent, took out time to praise the asset, alluding to the fact that it continues to hit record highs even as the Bitcoin price crashes. He then suggested that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve might not work out as planned. The Bitcoin critic also recently described the US Strategic Reserve as a crypto scam, which is misleading Americans. Peter Schiff blamed Trump for promoting Bitcoin and crypto-related projects. He argued that his influence could result in more Americans losing money. Interestingly, Schiff had previously admitted that he understood the rationale for a Bitcoin Reserve. He added that he doesn’t agree with it, although he gets it. The economist stated that the US has a gold reserve and that BTC is digital gold, which is better than analog gold. Meanwhile, in another post, he questioned why Bitcoin, as digital gold, is falling when the “real gold” is hitting record highs almost every day. BTC Could Rebound Soon Amid Peter Schiff’s statements, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that the Bitcoin price could rebound soon. He revealed that BTC’s sell-side ratio just dropped to 0.086%. The analyst added that in the last two years, levels beyond 0.1% have signaled major price rebounds. Long-term Bitcoin holders continue to accumulate amid this crypto market downtrend. In another post, Martinez revealed that holders have moved 650 Bitcoin worth over $55 million in the last few hours. Institutional holders like MicroStrategy also continue to accumulate. Saylor’s company recently acquired 6,911 BTC for $584 million.

Solana ( SOL ) dropped to $127 on Saturday, down by 15% from its highest point this week. It has dropped to its lowest level since March 2021. The decline happened as most Solana meme coins crashed, erasing most of the gains made earlier this week. Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) crashed by 15% on Saturday, while popular tokens like Popcat ( POPCAT ), ai16z ( AI16Z ), and Bonk ( BONK ) fell by over 10%. The market cap of all Solana meme coins tracked by over 10% to $7.2 billion. This drop means that these tokens have erased over $18 billion in value in the last few days. Third-party data shows that crypto traders bought the Solana meme coin rally earlier this week. According to DeFi Llama , Solana’s DEX volume soared by 60% in the last seven days to over $3 billion. This volume was higher than Ethereum ( ETH ) and BSC, which handled $11.35 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. It was the first time in weeks that Solana’s DEX protocols did better than the two. Most of Solana’s DEX volume came from Pump, which handled over $2.8 billion worth of transactions. It beat other popular DEX networks like Orca, Meteora, Raydium, and Lifinity, which have long had a big market share. Solana had some other positive news this week. The most notable one was that Blackrock, the biggest asset manager globally, expanded BUIDL , its money market fund, to the network. This is a notable development since BUIDL’s assets have surged to over $1.86 billion .

Most recently, it has formed a bearish flag pattern, which is made up of a tall vertical line and a rectangle. Solana also formed a death cross pattern on March 4 as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages flipped each other while pointing downwards. Therefore, a combination of a death cross and a bearish flag points to a strong breakdown, potentially to $100. For this to happen, it will need to plunge below the support at $120, where it has failed to drop below several times since April last year.

The federal banking regulator rescinded a previous rule requiring supervised banks to send notifications if they wanted to get involved in digital assets. Now, the FDIC says its member institutions can conduct crypto activities as long as they “adequately manage the associated risks.” FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill says the change represents the regulator “turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years.” “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards.” Numerous crypto stakeholders in recent years accused the FDIC of facilitating “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” an alleged attempt by Biden Administration government regulators to stifle the digital asset industry. Coinbase, for example, has been using the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to uncover instances of the FDIC asking banks to freeze crypto services, known as “pause letters.” Last month, the FDIC released redacted documents related to its supervision of crypto-related activities, which include pause letters sent to 24 banks.

With 8 million XRP moved in a single transaction, speculation is mounting about the asset’s next big move. This level of accumulation by large-scale investors, commonly referred to as “whales”, often indicates growing confidence in a potential price surge. Whales are scooping $XRP like it's Black Friday. 8 million just moved in one bite You feel that rumble? Yeah… it’s not an earthquake, it’s accumulation time pic.twitter.com/TMTQWuRv9z — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) March 28, 2025 Whale Activity and Market Impact Whales play a crucial role in shaping market dynamics, and their trading behavior can offer valuable insights into future price trends. Large purchases of XRP suggest strategic accumulation, a pattern often observed before major price breakouts. When institutional or high-net-worth investors begin acquiring significant amounts of an asset, it typically signals underlying strength, as these players do not engage in short-term speculation but rather in long-term positioning. Blockchain data has confirmed that a substantial movement of XRP occurred, reinforcing the notion that deep-pocketed investors are positioning themselves ahead of a potential price shift. The significance of such accumulation cannot be overlooked, especially in a market driven by sentiment and liquidity trends. XRP’s Current Market Position At the time of writing, XRP is navigating through a critical phase. Technical indicators suggest that while volatility persists, the asset remains in a consolidation zone, awaiting its next decisive move. Recent bullish developments, such as increasing trading volumes and on-chain activity, further support the argument that a breakout could be imminent. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, XRP has remained a focal point in the crypto space due to its expanding utility in cross-border payments and institutional adoption. These fundamental strengths, combined with the latest whale accumulation, reinforce a bullish outlook for the asset. What Lies Ahead for XRP? Historically, significant whale movements precede major price trends . Whether XRP is gearing up for a rally or merely experiencing a redistribution phase remains to be seen. However, the growing interest from large investors suggests that market participants should closely monitor upcoming price levels and resistance zones. With increasing adoption, ongoing whale accumulation, and favorable technical patterns, XRP’s trajectory appears promising. As the market continues to evolve, traders and investors should remain vigilant, keeping an eye on key developments that could further solidify XRP’s position as a leading digital asset. For now, all signs point to a strong accumulation phase—an indication that the next major move could be just around the corner.

Trading volume on the platform falls by over 75% amid meme coin market slowdown. The platform faces additional challenges with fraud concerns, security breaches, and legal issues. Pump.fun, a platform central to Solana’s meme coin boom last year, continues to see sharp declines in protocol fee revenue and overall trading volume. Current data reveals a stark difference from its peak activity earlier in 2025. As of March 28, Pump.fun’s protocol fee revenue stands at $1.2 million, according to data from DefiLlama. This is a significant drop from January, when the revenue was $7.07 million. Specifically, this marks an 83% decline from the all-time high in just three months. While this marks a slight improvement from a low near $671k reported just last week, the steep decline highlights a significant contraction in user activity. The platform now faces considerable loss in both revenue and market presence within the Solana meme coin ecosystem.

After raising an impressive $209 million in less than 10 months, the blockchain is setting its sights on a $600 million goal—one that goes far beyond capital to focus on lasting infrastructure, community, and education. With the release of Keynote 3, BlockDAG proves that its ambitions are rooted in real-world development, not just hype. The spotlight wasn’t on flashy promises; it was on concrete progress and a roadmap designed to last far beyond the mainnet launch. Building the $600M Vision: Empowering Developers What sets BlockDAG apart from many other Layer 1 projects is its clear dedication to building a robust, sustainable ecosystem. Rather than focusing purely on presale numbers, BlockDAG is doubling down on developer engagement to ensure long-term adoption post-launch. Keynote 3 introduced several initiatives designed to support developers at every stage of their journey: BlockDAG Academy Developer Grant Program Global Hackathon Series Dr. Maurice Herlihy, an academic advisor to the project, explained that the BlockDAG Academy isn’t just about learning the basics—it’s designed to offer developers a deep understanding of blockchain’s core principles. “Our goal is to empower builders with both the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ behind smart contracts, token creation, and decentralized apps,” he shared. The Academy is structured into three levels—beginner, intermediate, and advanced—to accommodate anyone from new students to experienced developers. This will ensure that a wide range of talent can come on board and contribute to BlockDAG’s success. Empowering Developers to Shape the Future The emphasis on developer education is complemented by BlockDAG’s Developer Grant Program , which will provide financial support and guidance for teams working on decentralized apps, infrastructure, and other projects within the ecosystem. Whether it’s building a DeFi protocol or an AI-powered NFT platform, BlockDAG aims to support a variety of projects that will enhance the network’s utility. To further drive adoption, the project has introduced the BlockDAG Ambassador Program , inviting community leaders and tech experts to run meetups, share resources, and help others build on the blockchain. A standout feature from the keynote was the Global Hackathon Series , which offers up to $100,000 in funding for each event. This initiative is about more than just finding great ideas—it’s about creating a global network of developers who can help make BlockDAG the most developer-friendly Layer 1 blockchain. “The future of Web3 will not be shaped by just one team; it will be defined by a whole ecosystem,” said Senior Advisor Steven Clarke-Martin. This ecosystem-first approach is what makes BlockDAG’s $600M vision seem achievable. It’s not just about revenue growth—it’s about building sustainable value and utility. Growing Stronger, Driven by Real Community The strength of BlockDAG’s momentum isn’t just in its technology; it’s powered by an active and rapidly expanding community. In Keynote 3, CEO Antony Turner highlighted the impressive community metrics that showcase real engagement: 170,000+ holders worldwide 800,000+ users mining on the X1 App 400,000+ Tap Miner signups, with 100K+ active daily players A global community across 100+ countries “This is perhaps our greatest achievement—our community’s growth is real and organic,” Turner emphasized. Unlike many crypto projects that rely on flashy marketing, BlockDAG’s community is not only holding tokens but also actively participating in testing, game play, and spreading the word. This organic adoption plays a crucial role in the blockchain’s long-term success. Additionally, over 16,600 ASIC miners have been sold, which will help secure BlockDAG’s Proof-of-Work-based consensus. These miners aren’t hypothetical—they are being delivered and integrated globally, contributing to the blockchain’s decentralized network. Confident Progress on the Path to $600M Keynote 3 wasn’t filled with lofty predictions. Instead, it was a demonstration of actual progress. The Beta Testnet V1 is already live, with mainnet launch on the horizon, and exchange listings are being finalized. Each new presale batch continues to see increased demand, and the project’s roadmap toward $600 million is becoming more of a reality by the day. “We’re not just dreaming about the future; we’re building it with intention and focus,” CEO Turner stated in his closing remarks. BlockDAG’s third keynote signified a turning point. The days of hype are over. Now, it’s all about execution—and that’s what’s catching the attention of developers and investors alike. For those waiting on the sidelines, the presale’s Batch 27 is live, and the race toward the $600 million milestone is well underway.

This Layer 1 blockchain, powered by a unique Hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work architecture, has raised an impressive $209 million in less than 10 months. With the release of Keynote 3, the project’s strength is more evident than ever. With over 19 billion BDAG coins sold, more than 800,000 active X1 App users, and 170,000+ holders, BlockDAG is no longer just an idea—it’s a thriving, in-demand Layer 1 blockchain. As the mainnet launch approaches, it’s becoming one of the most sought-after projects in the blockchain world. Keynote 3 Showed Real Progress, Not Just Future Plans Unlike many Layer 1 projects that delay their releases for years, BlockDAG used Keynote 3 to show it’s already ahead of schedule. “We’re not here to talk about slow improvements. What you’ll see today is the result of months of hard work—a giant leap forward in scalability, decentralization, and security,” said CEO Antony Turner during his keynote. Keynote 3 included the official launch of the Beta Testnet V1, which has already processed over 1.2 million transactions through 100+ active community nodes. This testnet isn’t just a demonstration; it’s fully functional, with multiple blocks being confirmed simultaneously through BlockDAG’s unique Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. This architecture eliminates the bottlenecks that slow down traditional blockchains, allowing for faster transactions while maintaining Proof-of-Work security. Importantly, everything presented at Keynote 3 is either already live or being rolled out regularly. Some of the key features introduced include: A revamped blockchain explorer with more detailed capabilities A tool for creating tokens and NFTs WASM compatibility for advanced smart contracts Account abstraction for a safer and simpler user experience Early decentralized applications (dApps) for users to interact with All of these tools are already available or being launched in weekly updates, offering real value to users right now, not just in the distant future. Security Built for the Enterprise As BlockDAG approaches its mainnet launch, security remains a top priority. In his section of the keynote, Chief Security Officer Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj emphasized the importance of robust protection: “A blockchain’s strength is directly tied to its security. That’s why we’ve designed BlockDAG with cutting-edge cryptographic protections and a decentralized consensus mechanism that eliminates common vulnerabilities.” BlockDAG’s security isn’t just theoretical. The network has undergone extensive stress testing and auditing from top-tier firms like Certik and Halborn. Additionally, the project’s infrastructure is backed by secure treasury management and a Proof-of-Work model that’s already proven to be effective in other blockchains. Why Everyone Wants In Before the Price Skyrockets Currently in Batch 27, the BlockDAG token is priced at $0.0248, up from its initial price of $0.001. That’s a 2,380% increase for early buyers, and the momentum only continues to build. More than 16,600 mining devices (X30 and X100 models) have already been sold, with deliveries expected soon. These miners will help create a decentralized, hardware-based consensus layer for the network. Alongside this, BlockDAG has achieved viral success with its X1 App, now used by over 800,000 people. The app’s widespread adoption highlights the growing reach of the project. Additionally, the Tap Miner game has attracted more than 400,000 signups, showing that both crypto enthusiasts and casual users are joining in. “BlockDAG is not about promises—it’s about building the future now,” said CEO Turner. The mainnet launch is expected to include: Full support for decentralized finance (DeFi), including swaps, staking, and lending A range of token creation tools and NFT deployment features Governance rollout Listings on over 10 major exchanges This means that the token won’t be launching into an empty ecosystem—it will debut into a fully functional, ready-to-go network. BlockDAG: The Layer 1 to Watch and Join BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 wasn’t filled with empty hype—it was proof of a project that’s already up and running, scaling, and attracting a growing global community. “We’re more than just a project; we’re pioneers building a new decentralized era,” Turner concluded. For those looking to get in on the next major Layer 1 blockchain before it explodes in value, the window is closing fast. With the $209M raised and a target of $600M on the horizon, BlockDAG is on track to make real waves in the blockchain world.

Amid this decline, however, some see opportunity, with one popular analyst identifying an interesting reversal pattern that could turn the tide to bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin And Ethereum Face $14 Billion Options Expiry—Market Impact Ahead? Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern Appears On XRP Chart XRP has extended its decline run from $2.47 into the past 24 hours. Particulary, XRP is currently down by 13.8% in the past three days and now looks like it could easily break below $2.10. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto took to social media platform X to highlight what he called a “most probably inverse head and shoulders” pattern currently unfolding on XRP’s daily timeframe. The pattern, which has been developing since early March, is now in the final stages of forming the second shoulder. As such, this phase might still see further short-term downside, as XRP potentially dips again to complete the structure of the second shoulder before a breakout rally. If confirmed, the inverse head and shoulders would lead to a strong bullish reversal, which is going to be significant given XRP’s recent price retracement. According to Egrag Crypto, the measured move from the completion of this formation could send the price to a price range between $3.7 and $3.9. Analyst Says XRP Could Reach All-Time High In 90 To 120 Days The inverse head and shoulder analysis is part of a bullish outlook that suggests that the XRP price can reach a new all-time high within the next 90 to 120 days. This prediction, also made by Egrag Crypto, is based on a recurring pattern observed in XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) across past bull markets. He pointed out that during the 2017 and 2021 cycles, the RSI indicator on XRP exhibited two distinct peaks, with the second peak coming between 90 to 120 days after the first peak. The second RSI peak in 2017 occurred about 120 days after the first peak. A similar scenario occurred in 2021, although the interval between the first and second RSI highs was shorter at just 90 days. This trend sets the stage for a historic surge that could align with the breakout from the current inverse head and shoulders setup. So far in this cycle, XRP has already completed its first RSI peak, reaching as high as 85.17 toward the end of 2024. Following that, the RSI has been on a long cooldown phase, dipping to a low of 65. At the time of writing, the RSI sits around 66, and a bounce is expected from here, which is to peak sometime around June.

If the trend plays out again within the next 90 to 120 days, XRP’s RSI could peak again around June. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.12, down by 4.7% in the past 24 hours.

According to a Form 8-K and a new prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), MARA entered into an at-the-market (ATM) equity program with a group of investment banks including Barclays, BMO Capital Markets, BTIG, Cantor Fitzgerald, and others. The proceeds of the offering, which will see brokers selling shares of the miner from time to time, will be used mainly for the acquisition of bitcoin in the open market. ""We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,"" MARA said in its prospectus. This new fresh stock sales plan follows a previous ATM offering that targeted up to $1.5 billion for the miner. MARA has adopted Michael Saylor's strategy of raising funds through equity and convertible bond offerings and buying bitcoin in the open market. The miner now holds 46,376 BTC in its treasury, making it the second-largest bitcoin stash among publicly traded companies, behind Strategy’s 506,137 BTC. The plan to buy bitcoin in the open market was adopted by the miner last year, even though a miner can theoretically mine bitcoin at a discount to the spot price. The industry became challenging after last year's halving cut mining rewards by half, squeezing profit margins on the back of rising costs. This made buying bitcoin in the open market, alongside mining, a relatively better strategy for the miners.

At press time, ETH is trading near $1,821, recording a price decline of over 2.50% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume dropped by 35%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, the recent price drop has brought ETH to a make-or-break level, which will determine the asset’s price movement in the coming days. Source: Trading View On the daily timeframe, ETH appears to be forming a double-bottom price action pattern with support at the $1,820 level. Based on recent price momentum, if the asset holds above $1,820, there is a strong possibility of an upside rally, with the price potentially surging 17% to reach the $2,100 level in the future. On the other hand, if ETH’s price continues to fall and breaches this support level, closing a daily candle below $1,800, there is a strong possibility that the asset could drop by 15% to reach the $1,550 level in the future.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 17:03:03

The co-founders are Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed. Prosecutors accused the co-founders of effectively running the BitMEX exchange as a money laundering platform and that its purported withdrawal from the US market was a sham. Trump Pardons BitMEX Founders US President Donald Trump has pardoned three co-founders of the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange and a fourth former high-level employee. The founders, including Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, along with former head of business development Gregory Dwyer had pleaded guilty to one count of violating the Bank Secrecy Act in 2022 and were mandated to pay $30 million in civil fines. The three also received criminal sentences and probation. Authorities also alleged BitMEX did not effectively use its anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) measures. Trump issued the pardons on Thursday, over three months after BitMEX was sentenced to pay a fine of $100 million for violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to establish and maintain anti-money laundering and know-your-customer programs. BitMEX Founders Thank Trump Hayes thanked Trump for the pardon, tweeting, “Thank you, POTUS.” Delo also issued a statement stating that the pardon vindicates their position and that the US Department of Justice wrongfully targeted the exchange and its founders. “The US Department of Justice wrongfully targeted BitMEX and its co-founders. This full and unconditional pardon by President Trump is a vindication of the position we have always held – that BitMEX, my co-founders, and I should never have been charged with a criminal offense through an obscure, antiquated law.” Delo also alleged that BitMEX was wrongfully made an example of for political reasons and was used to send out inconsistent regulatory signals. “As the most successful crypto exchange of its kind, we were wrongfully made to serve as an example, sacrificed for political reasons, and used to send inconsistent regulatory signals. I’m sincerely grateful to the President for granting this pardon to me and my co-founders. A legal wrong has been righted today, and despite the distress I have been through over the past few years, I’m pleased to have cleared my name and to be able to continue my life and philanthropic work without the burden of an unfounded conviction.” The Case Against BitMEX BitMEX was founded in 2014. Prosecutors alleged that executives were aware that the exchange was required to implement strict AML and KYC protocols because it served customers in the US. However, it ignored and flouted these requirements, requiring customers to only provide an email address to access BitMEX’s services. The Manhattan US Attorney’s Office, in a statement released in January, had said, “Indeed, senior executives each knew that customers residing in the U.S. continued to access BitMEX’s trading platform through at least in or about 2018 and that BitMEX policies nominally in place to prevent such trading were toothless or easily overridden to serve BitMEX’s bottom line goal of obtaining revenue through the U.S. market without regard to U.S. criminal laws.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

History of BitMEX's legal troubles Since taking office on January 20, Trump has signed a number of federal pardons, including more than 1 500 people charged in connection with the January 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol, as well as Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who has spent more than 11 years in prison. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for misusing client funds, was also reportedly trying to get close to Trump and Republicans to get a pardon. U.S. authorities presented charges of violating the Bank Secrecy Act to Case, Reed and Hayes in 2020. As a result, Hayes, who was serving as the head of BitMEX, withdrew from his position. Financial implications for the company The reasons for the pardon remain unclear, as the three BitMEX co-founders have already been sentenced to a combination of house arrest and probation in 2022. They were also ordered to pay $30 million in fines as part of a civil case with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The exchange's legal proceedings with U.S. authorities included an agreement to pay $100 million in fines to both the CFTC and the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in 2021.

Investors have until April 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET to submit claims through claims.terra.money . Late submissions will not be considered, meaning those who miss the deadline forfeit their right to any recovery, according to a Medium post .

Notably, assets with less than $100 in on-chain liquidity and certain others—like Terra 2.0's Luna—will not qualify. Claimants must also submit proof of ownership. The preferred method is read-only API keys from exchanges, which the administrator considers more reliable than screenshots or manually uploaded documents. The post adds that those using manual evidence may face extended review periods or risk their claims being denied altogether. Once filed, claims will be reviewed and verified. Initial decisions will be shared within 90 days after the deadline and approved claims will be eligible for pro rata distributions once processing concludes.

With new projects launching almost weekly and older giants making unexpected comebacks, the crypto space can feel like a minefield. Cardano and Litecoin have been around long enough to earn trust, and both have dropped big updates recently. But there’s a new name creeping into every conversation: Qubetics ($TICS). And it’s not just a hype wave—it’s doing something those OGs haven’t pulled off. Qubetics is stepping into the ring not as a copycat, but as a full-on game-changer. While Cardano and Litecoin made massive progress in scalability and payments, Qubetics is diving deep into real-world utility with its decentralized VPN solution. This isn’t some “maybe useful later” tech—it’s solving problems right now. Add to that a super hyped and rapidly moving Qubetics presale, and it’s starting to look like 2025’s top crypto performer might not be the coin you already hold. And yep, if you’re hunting for the best crypto presale to jump in before the next price bump, this one’s worth a serious look. Qubetics VPN: The Real-Life Use Case Pushing It as a Top Crypto Performer There’s nothing theoretical about Qubetics’ vision—this one’s got real teeth. The platform isn’t just another layer-1 blockchain trying to be “faster and cheaper.” Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, fusing multiple blockchains into one sleek ecosystem. But the real kicker? Its Decentralized VPN (dVPN) application is about to completely change how both individuals and businesses access the internet. Think about this: traditional VPNs are run by centralized companies that can easily track, log, or restrict what people do online. For journalists, activists, remote workers, or literally anyone in a country with censorship, that’s a massive risk. Qubetics dVPN flips that on its head. Built on a peer-to-peer network without a central authority, it gives users true control, privacy, and secure access—no middlemen, no snoops, no limits. It’s powered by blockchain, which means all traffic data is fully encrypted, anonymous, and untraceable. This isn’t just for the crypto-savvy crowd—this is for anyone who’s done with the creepy data tracking. Small businesses are another group that’ll benefit big. Imagine a freelance design studio with team members across the globe. Instead of paying for multiple centralized VPNs, they could all use the Qubetics dVPN and keep operations secure without worrying about surveillance or geo-blocks. Same goes for remote developers and crypto startups—they get high-level privacy, incentivized sharing of bandwidth, and full control over their data flow. Qubetics even rewards users providing bandwidth with TICS tokens, turning internet sharing into a passive income stream. It’s this kind of utility that pushes Qubetics ahead as a real top crypto performer —not just another name on a chart, but a tool people will actually use. Qubetics Presale and ROI Breakdown: The Top Crypto Performer With Life-Changing Numbers Here’s where things get wild. Qubetics is currently in its 27th presale stage, priced at $0.1300. The stage ends every Sunday at 12 AM, and with each new round, there’s a guaranteed 10% price hike. That’s right—each week, early adopters are literally watching their value grow without doing a thing. So far, over $15.5 million has already been raised, 504 million $TICS tokens sold, and 23,900+ token holders are riding this wave. This isn’t just a buzz—it’s serious traction. This is where the title “top crypto performer” starts to really mean something. Let’s break it down with actual numbers. Say someone slides in with just $200 at the current stage. That gives them around 1,538 tokens. Now, if $TICS hits $1 post-presale (which isn’t wild given current adoption), that $200 turns into $1,538—a solid 669.13% ROI. If it climbs to $5, that’s $7,690. At $6, that’s $9,228. But if the mainnet launch pushes it to $10 (which is very plausible for a fully working ecosystem), that same $200 turns into $15,380. And if Qubetics hits $15—which people in the community are openly speculating—that $200 flips into a life-altering $23,070. That’s a 11,437% ROI for anyone doing the math. This level of potential is exactly why the Qubetics presale is being tagged as the best crypto presale right now. And since each stage lasts just 7 days with scheduled price jumps, it adds urgency without even trying. Early adopters aren’t just buying tokens—they’re getting in before each price gate closes. That’s a powerful motivator. The hype? It’s not empty. The fundamentals, the tech, the rollout—all of it’s setting Qubetics apart as a serious top crypto performer in 2025. Cardano’s Smart Contract Upgrades and Growing Enterprise Partnerships Cardano is no stranger to innovation. Known for its research-first approach and peer-reviewed structure, it’s finally delivering some major ecosystem updates that are catching attention again. Its recent upgrades to Plutus—the smart contract language used on Cardano—have made developing on the network faster, more efficient, and less clunky. That’s a big win for builders and might be the thing that gives Cardano its long-awaited DeFi boost. What’s really standing out now is Cardano’s push into enterprise-grade partnerships. More projects are using its eco-friendly proof-of-stake consensus to create real-world apps, from supply chain tracking to academic credential verification. Plus, the Mithril protocol is helping Cardano speed up its syncing times while lowering the resource requirements for nodes, which is great news for scaling. With more DApps launching and ADA seeing better integration with wallets and exchanges, it’s clear that Cardano isn’t just coasting on reputation anymore. It’s rebuilding momentum in 2025 and holding its own as a top crypto performer, especially for those who value long-term development over flashiness. Litecoin’s Newfound Utility Through Privacy and Payments Litecoin has always been the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” but 2025 is shaping up to be its breakout year. After integrating the MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB), Litecoin added optional privacy features to its blockchain. This was a game-changer, making LTC more appealing for those who want a blend of transparency and privacy, something Bitcoin doesn’t fully offer. That update alone gave Litecoin a fresh identity, especially among users looking for solid privacy without diving into anonymous tokens. Beyond that, Litecoin’s low transaction fees and fast processing times continue to make it a top choice for payments. It’s now integrated into more point-of-sale systems, and payment apps are expanding LTC support. That, combined with its steady presence on nearly every major exchange, has kept Litecoin relevant—even competitive. While it may not offer flashy innovations like some newer tokens, its sheer utility, active user base, and proven reliability secure its place among the top crypto performers to watch in 2025. Conclusion: Which Top Crypto Performer Really Wins in 2025? All three projects bring serious strengths to the table. Cardano is finally firing on all cylinders, driving smart contract innovation and growing enterprise appeal. Litecoin stays true to its roots but keeps evolving—its privacy upgrade and seamless payment support make it a quiet powerhouse. But Qubetics? It’s a whole different energy. With a real-world VPN application people can actually use, a mainnet coming in Q2 2025, and a presale that’s already pulled over $15.5 million, it’s not just making noise—it’s solving problems. The decentralized internet dream isn’t just talk with Qubetics. And when looking at that insane ROI potential, it’s easy to see why it’s stealing the spotlight as the top crypto performer for this cycle. For anyone looking to join this crypto presale before another 10% price jump hits, the clock’s ticking fast.

This drop was particularly concerning for bulls, as gold surged to a record high at the same time, undermining Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative. However, many experts argue that a Bitcoin rally is imminent as multiple governments take steps to avert an economic crisis. The ongoing global trade war and spending cuts by the US government are considered temporary setbacks. An apparent silver lining is the expectation that additional liquidity is expected to flow into the markets, which could boost risk-on assets. Analysts believe Bitcoin is well-positioned to benefit from this broader macroeconomic shift. Source: Mihaimihale Take, for example, Mihaimihale, an X social platform user who argued that tax cuts and lower interest rates are necessary to “kickstart” the economy, particularly since the previous year’s growth was “propped up” by government spending, which proved unsustainable. The less favorable macroeconomic environment pushed gold to a record high of $3,087 on March 28, while the US dollar weakened against a basket of foreign currencies, with the DXY Index dropping to 104 from 107.40 a month earlier. Additionally, the $93 million in net outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on March 28 further weighed on sentiment, as traders acknowledged that even institutional investors are susceptible to selling amid rising recession risks. US inflation slows amid economic recession fears The market currently assigns a 50% probability that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to 4% or lower by July 30, up from 46% a month earlier, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Implied rates for Fed Funds on July 30. Source: CME FedWatch The crypto market is presently in a “withdrawal phase,” according to Alexandre Vasarhelyi, the founding partner at B2V Crypto. Vasarhelyi noted that recent major announcements, such as the US strategic Bitcoin reserve executive order mark progress in the metric that matters the most: adoption. Vasarhelyi said real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is a promising trend, but he believes its impact remains limited. “BlackRock’s billion-dollar BUIDL fund is a step forward, but it’s insignificant compared to the $100 trillion bond market.” Vasarhelyi added: “Whether Bitcoin’s floor is $77,000 or $65,000 matters little; the story is early-stage growth.” Gold decouples from stocks, bonds and Bitcoin Experienced traders view a 10% stock market correction as routine. However, some anticipate a decline in “policy uncertainty” by early April, which would reduce the likelihood of a recession or bear market. Source: WarrenPies Warren Pies, founder of 3F Research, expects the US administration to soften its stance on tariffs, which could stabilize investor sentiment. This shift may help the S&P 500 stay above its March 13 low of 5,505. However, market volatility remains a factor as economic conditions evolve. Related: Bitcoin price falls toward range lows, but data shows ‘whales going wild right now’ For some, the fact that gold decoupled from the stock market while Bitcoin succumbed to “extreme fear” is evidence that the digital gold thesis was flawed. However, more experienced investors, including Vasarhelyi, argue that Bitcoin’s weak performance reflects its early-stage adoption rather than a failure of its fundamental qualities. Vasarhelyi said, “Legislative shifts pave the way for user-friendly products, trading some of crypto’s flexibility for mainstream appeal. My take is adoption will accelerate, but 2025 remains a foundation year, not a tipping point.” Analysts view the recent Bitcoin correction as a reaction to recession fears and the temporary tariff war. However, they expect these factors to trigger expansionist measures from central banks, ultimately creating a favorable environment for risk-on assets, including Bitcoin.

The network continues to be troubled by network issues and controversies while seemingly stuck in a bearish trend. Its BBTrend remained negative for 12 straight sessions, and while its RSI may have bounced back slightly from oversold territory, it continues to hover below the neutral 50 level. Pi is still under high selling pressure per its RSI and BBTrend figures Shortly after the Pi network announced its integration with Telegram’s crypto wallet, the token spiked by almost 1%. However, the price surge did not last long, and the token went back into its downward spiral. Many analysts had projected that the token would gain momentum after integrating with Telegram and expanding its reach to the messaging platform’s 1 billion monthly active users. However, the token is still under heavy selling pressure, with no signs of improvement. So far, the token has sunk by more than 61% in the past month, and its BBTrend is negative, currently at -22.34. The token’s BBTrend has also been negative since March 16 and reached a new low of -41 on March 21, showing buyers are losing control of the market. Typically, a negative BBTrend signals selling pressure, and the further away from zero the figure moves, the higher the pressure. The network, however, saw its Relative Strength Index (RSI) rise to 40.45 from 23.8 in just a few days. Its RSI recovery does hint at a reduction in overselling pressure; nonetheless, the RSI is still below 50, showing that the token’s buying pressure is still low. Pi network denied all scam accusations The Pi network has yet to fully shake off the scam accusations, with investors still widely cautious about the token. The network, however, recently addressed the scam concerns, denying all accusations made against it. Bybit Exchange CEO Ben Zhou once publicly stated that his firm would not list the Pi token, calling it a scam. Cyber Capital founder and Chief Investment Officer Justin Bons also commented , “PI is a straight-up scam! Offering an “MLM” based “mining” scheme on mobile is a gimmick, as it does not contribute to consensus! PI is an investment scam.” Pi has, however, defended itself, claiming some people impersonated the network and engaged with exchanges like Bybit to ask for listings. It even explained that its referral program is cost-free and is only one level deep between the referrer and the referred. Additionally, the network insisted that the program would provide a 25% bonus to both the referrer and the referred as long as they are mining simultaneously.

He believes that government-issued money is losing value over time and calls it a poor way to save wealth. Instead, he encouraged people to focus on alternative assets like Bitcoin (BTC), gold and silver. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Silver’s Value Will Soar Among all the assets he recommends, Kiyosaki is particularly optimistic about silver in the short term. He believes the precious metal is undervalued and expects its price to rise in the coming years. Last April, amidst market turmoil, staunch Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff argued that Silver is now Gold 2.0 . He urged people to shift focus from Bitcoin to the precious metal. Currently, Silver is trading at around $35 an ounce, but Kiyosaki predicts it could reach $70 before the end of the year. Kiyosaki believes it may even climb to $200 an ounce in the next year or two. He also pointed out that silver is still affordable for most people. The author warned, however, that this may not be the case for long, encouraging people to take advantage of the current price before it becomes too expensive. Bitcoin and the Fear of Making Mistakes Kiyosaki, a big supporter of Bitcoin, sees the leading cryptocurrency as one of the greatest opportunities to build wealth and hedge against inflation . However, he asserted that many people miss out due to fear. In a recent post shared on X, Kiyosaki explained that some investors fear missing out (FOMO). However, he highlighted an even bigger problem: the fear of making mistakes (FOMM). He noted that fear stops many people from taking action, even when they see Bitcoin’s value rising. Kiyosaki expects Bitcoin to reach $200,000 this year, but he predicts that those who hesitate will later say it has become too expensive. Meanwhile, those who invest early will build generational wealth. Kiyosaki Urges People To Learn from the Right Financial Experts Robert Kiyosaki urges people to educate themselves about Bitcoin and other investments. He advises his followers to listen to both Bitcoin supporters and critics to make informed decisions. He recommends following industry experts like Michael Saylor, Jeff Booth, and Samson Mow. He argued that the most valuable financial education no longer comes from schools or traditional institutions. He encourages people to seek knowledge from free sources like YouTube, where they can learn from experienced experts who share their insights. Kiyosaki’s message is clear: traditional money is losing value due to inflation, and people must take control of their financial future.

The flagship currency plunged below $85,000 late on Friday, wiping out its weekly gains as selling pressure threatened to overwhelm buyers. BTC is down almost 3% and is trading around $82,800. BTC and the broader crypto market’s drop coincided with a sell-off in the US stock market due to poor economic data. Crypto-focused stocks also suffered heavy losses. Bitcoin Could Drop To $72,000 Due To Macro Liquidity Concerns Bitcoin (BTC) made a strong start to the week, surging to an intraday high of $88,839 on Monday. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level as selling pressure intensified. Bearish sentiment has intensified over the past few days, with BTC plunging below $85,000, giving up gains made during the week. BTC’s rejection occurred at the cusp of its descending trendline and at the upper range of its ascending channel pattern. An analysis from Capital Flows indicated that BTC could correct to $72,000 if liquidity conditions remain unchanged. According to the analysis Bitcoin is exhibiting a greater convergence with traditional risk assets. However, it remains at the periphery of the risk curve, implying that for capital to flow back into BTC , investors must shift their mindset from focusing on less risky assets to riskier assets like crypto. “Broadly speaking right now, the macro liquidity backdrop is neutral. Rates have come down marginally, but the carry trade continues to create risk for assets.” However, other analysts have pointed out that a rise in the Global M2 supply could trigger a BTC rally. The Global Liquidity Chart, which monitors M2 growth from central banks, has historically formed a correlation with Bitcoin’s price movements. According to Colin Talks Crypto, a predictive correlation between M2 supply and BTC suggests the flagship cryptocurrency could rally around May 1. However, the difference between macro liquidity and global M2 growth is that M2 measures total money supply, while macro liquidity indicates the ease at which capital can flow into risk assets. Crypto-Related Stocks Plunge Shares of Mara Holdings (MARA), Strategy (MSTR), and several other crypto-related companies plunged as the price of Bitcoin registered a substantial decline on Friday. MARA fell over 9%, while MSTR registered a drop of 10%. Coinbase (COIN) also registered a significant decline, falling 7%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin slipped below $85,000 as selling pressure intensified. Ethereum (ETH) and other cryptocurrencies also registered notable declines. Stocks related to the crypto industry often follow Bitcoin higher or lower. The crypto market and stocks fell on Friday after the latest inflation and consumer sentiment data numbers raised concerns about the economy. Nintendo Could Leverage $14B In Cash To Invest In Bitcoin According to market predictions, Nintendo may use Bitcoin on its balance sheet after GameStop announced its plans to invest in the asset. The company holds over $14.8 billion in cash, allowing the firm to implement a Bitcoin strategy. GameStop recently grabbed headlines after announcing plans to invest in Bitcoin. GameStop stock surged over 11% following the news, indicating that publicly traded organizations are increasingly interested in Bitcoin adoption. Nintendo’s substantial cash reserves could allow the company to implement Bitcoin strategies similar to GameStop. Analysts predict Bitcoin adoption could lead to better stock market results and introduce new portfolio assets for the company. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Hopes for a market recovery dissipated on Friday as a market-wide rout erased all gains made earlier this week. BTC plunged below $85,000 and is struggling to stay above $82,000. BTC’s substantial drop coincided with a major sell-off in US stocks after poor economic numbers and inflation data spooked markets. As a result, the S&P 500 dropped 2% while Nasdaq shed almost 3%. Crypto stocks also registered significant losses, with Strategy (MSTR) falling 10% and Coinbase (COIN) shedding nearly 8%. The February PCE report showed a 2.5% year-over-year increase in the price index, with core inflation sitting at 2.8%, slightly above expectations. Meanwhile, consumer spending registered a rise of 0.4%. However, inflation-adjusted figures indicate minimal growth, suggesting potential headwinds for growth. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve of Atlanta’s GDPNow Model projects a 2.8% contraction in the US economy in the first quarter. BTC registered a substantial increase on Wednesday, moving past the 20 and 200-day SMAs. However, it lost momentum on Thursday, slipping below the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $84,215. Price action remained bearish on Friday and Saturday as BTC registered marginal declines and settled at $83,822. However, sentiment changed on Sunday as bullish sentiment returned. As a result, BTC rose almost 3%, moving past the 20 and 200-day SMAs and settling at $86,116. BTC surged to an intraday high of $88,839 as it started the week on a bullish note. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $87,523, ultimately registering an increase of 1.63%. Source: TradingView However, it lost momentum on Tuesday after encountering selling pressure and volatility. As a result, the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $87,417. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC slipped below $87,000 and settled at $86,942. The price registered a marginal increase on Thursday to reclaim $87,000 and settle at $87,236. However, markets turned bearish on Friday, driven by a sell-off in the traditional markets. As a result, BTC dropped over 3%, slipping below the 200-day SMA and $85,000 to settle at $84,422. The current session sees BTC down over 2%, falling below the 20-day SMA and trading around $82,632. If sellers retain control, the price could drop to $80,000. A break below this level could drag BTC towards $75,000. The MACD indicates a bearish tilt while the RSI is below the neutral zone, indicating that bears have the upper hand.

According to the analyst, XRP’s measured move suggests a potential price target in the range of $3.70 to $3.90. However, reaching the upper end of this channel will depend on key support and resistance levels holding firm. #XRP I H&S (UPDATE) – Key Levels: Current Measured Move: We maintain our target range of $3.70-$3.90. The likelihood of reaching the upper end of the channel is significant, provided certain conditions are met. Key Levels to Watch: We should not close a daily candle below… https://t.co/p7Mqk0hrOp pic.twitter.com/KCzQcRotkM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 29, 2025 Key Price Levels and Market Sentiment For XRP to sustain its bullish trajectory, certain price levels must be closely monitored. The most critical threshold is the $2 mark. EGRAG Crypto warns that a daily close below this level could trigger a fair value gap, leading to a temporary wick. However, the expectation is that XRP would rebound quickly to maintain its bullish momentum. Another major level to watch is $2.65, which must be flipped into strong support for XRP to sustain upward pressure. If this milestone is achieved, the next target would be breaking through the mid-channel resistance at $3.00 . A confirmed close above this level would indicate increasing strength in XRP’s price action, setting the stage for a rally toward the critical $3.20–$3.40 range. The Path to a Potential Breakout Should XRP successfully hold above the $3.20–$3.40 range, bullish sentiment could accelerate, pushing the asset toward an upper target of $4.60. However, EGRAG Crypto cautions that reaching this level and subsequently showing signs of weakness could indicate a distribution phase. This would align with a well-known market structure, the distribution schematic #1, which typically precedes a corrective move. The timeline for this setup remains in play until April 20, meaning traders should pay close attention to XRP’s price behavior in the coming weeks. If the current inverse head and shoulders formation plays out as expected, XRP could be on the brink of a significant breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Context and Investor Implications The broader cryptocurrency market dynamics will also play a role in determining whether XRP can achieve these ambitious price targets. Factors such as Bitcoin’s performance, regulatory developments, and institutional interest in digital assets will all contribute to XRP’s ability to sustain upward momentum. For investors and traders, the outlined price levels offer a roadmap for potential entry and exit points. A close above $3.00 would reinforce bullish confidence, while failure to hold $2.00 could raise cautionary signals. As EGRAG Crypto continues to provide updates, market participants should remain vigilant and adjust their strategies accordingly. With XRP’s chart structure aligning with historical bullish patterns, the coming weeks could prove pivotal in defining the asset’s mid-term trajectory.

The proposed legislation includes the Strategic Digital Assets Reserve Bill (SB 1373) and the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025), which is expected to position Arizona as the first state to create a strategic digital asset reserve. Arizona’s Digital Asset Legislation SB 1373 seeks to create a reserve fund composed of digital assets seized during criminal investigations. Such a move would allow the state treasurer to manage the assets. This fund would be capped at a 10% annual investment rate, with the added provision that assets may be loaned to enhance returns, so long as the transactions do not introduce undue risk. On the other hand, SB 1025 focuses specifically on Bitcoin and proposes that the Arizona Treasury and the state’s retirement system be permitted to invest up to 10% of available funds into the cryptocurrency. This bill also includes a clause to secure any BTC investments in a segregated account within a potential federal Bitcoin reserve. The 33-27 Republican majority in Arizona’s House of Representatives increases the likelihood that the two bills will pass. However, uncertainty exists as they require the approval of Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat known for her frequent vetoes. In 2024, Hobbs vetoed 22% of legislation, the highest rate among all state governors, raising questions about whether these bills will garner her support. Similar efforts in other states include Texas’ Senate passing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill (SB-21) on March 6 with a 25-5 vote, though it still needs to clear the House and gain the governor’s signature. Meanwhile, Utah’s recent Bitcoin legislation excluded the creation of a strategic reserve, while Oklahoma’s HB1203 Bitcoin Reserve Bill passed the House on March 25 by a 77-15 vote. Kentucky Gov Signs “Bitcoin Rights” Bill Into Law Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has officially signed the “Bitcoin Rights” bill into law, providing legal protection for cryptocurrency users. The measure, House Bill 701, safeguards the right to self-custody, run a crypto node, and use digital assets without fear of discrimination. The bill was introduced by Rep. Adam Bowling in February this year and passed the state House and Senate with unanimous support before being signed by Beshear on March 24.

42596794,https://invezz.com/?p=2643560,1743269400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Renowned trader who called Ethereum (ETH) under $5 is now backing this trending $0.025 DeFi altcoin,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/29/renowned-trader-who-called-ethereum-eth-under-5-is-now-backing-this-trending-0-025-defi-altcoin/,"A crypto trader, who accurately predicted Ethereum’s success while it was still at $5, has turned his attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a trending DeFi altcoin currently priced at $0.025 in its fourth presale phase. Since its inception, the project has raised $5.8 million from over 7,500 investors, confirming a near exponential period of demand as Phase 4 gains momentum. As the 5th stage is set to raise the price of MUTM by 20% to $0.03, early buyers are able to lock in quick profits before the eventual token listing at $0.06 — a 140% increase from MUTM’s current value. High demand following presale momentum Mutuum Finance ‘s presale structure is driving urgency among its investors. Each phase gradually increases the token’s price, the scheme creating a competition to obtain positions before the next increase. The $0.025 entry point during Phase 4 represents one of the last opportunities to secure lower prices before we start the ascent to $0.03. This ascent is hardly surprising, with historical data indicating that preceding phases were booked out extremely rapidly. Phase 1 wiped off the map in a matter of hours after investors came to realize this project’s asymmetric risk-reward ratio. And analysts tracking the presale currently, say that with MUTM set for $0.06 upon exchange launch, today’s buyers could wake up with returns through 140% — a figure designed directly through the tokenomics. In addition to the listing price, projections call for a potential rise to $3.50 by late 2025, underpinned by Mutuum Finance’s revenue sharing buyback system and expanding utility. This is an astonishing 13,900% return for early investors in Phase 4, dwarfing returns in almost all recent DeFi products. A mechanics-driven approach to real-world sustainability growth Unlike meme coins that relied on hype (and crashed when that hype died down), Mutuum Finance also brought real financial utility to the table with its decentralized lending and borrowing platform. Users deposit assets such as ETH or stablecoins, obtaining mtTokens (egmtETH) with interest accrual, which can be traded or pledged across DeFi platforms. Borrowers provide over-collateralized loans through this mechanism, stabilizing the system and creating an insatiable demand for the MUTM token. An additional peer-to-peer lending feature allows for direct negotiation of assets without standard pools, such as meme coins. This flexibility attracts a diverse set of participants, from risk-averse lenders to niche borrowers, reinforcing MUTM as a liquidity backbone. Making subscribers want more — reinvesting revenue Mutuum Finance’s buy-and-distribute model uses platform fees to buy back MUTM tokens, which are distributed to mtToken stakers. This mechanism not only rewards long-term holders but also instills relentless buy pressure and insulates the token from volatile sell-off. A $100,000 presale giveaway—$10,000 to ten separate individuals—is also part of the strategy, encouraging early investment and creating a sense of community. Security is also a top priority, with a Certik smart contract audit being finalized by the team. Results will be announced through official channels soon, providing another layer of trust for more risk-averse investors looking to buy Mutuum Finance. Aiming ahead of the DeFi explosion With the closing of Phase 4, so too goes the phase for locking in $0.025 MUTM. Competitor speculation cannot compete with the project’s structured tokenomics, real-world applications, and aggressive buybacks. Retail and institutional interest is building with the trader who predicted Ethereum’s rise now backing MUTM. Mutuum Finance is not just riding the trends, but it’s the type of competition redefining DeFi Infrastructure. MUTM’s presale provides an exceptional gateway for investors looking for innovative projects that also generate profits.

While ADA remains a strong project with a dedicated ecosystem, some investors are looking for the next big opportunity at a lower entry price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently attracts more than 7400 holders with its Phase 4 value of $0.025 though the entire platform presents nearly $5.7 million worth of investment. In the forthcoming phase MUTM will undergo a 20% price increase to achieve a new valuation of $0.03. FOMO has caused most investors to purchase MUTM ahead of its price hike. The price of Mutuum Finance tokens will reach $0.06 during launch which means that investors who join at Phase 4 will experience a 140% profit. Cardano’s Legacy and the Search for the Next Big Crypto Cardano (ADA), now priced at $0.71, has built a strong reputation for its research-driven development and smart contract capabilities. Despite reaching an all-time high of $3.10 in 2021, ADA has struggled to regain that momentum, with some investors growing impatient with its slow progress. However, its legacy as a high-potential blockchain remains intact, making it a benchmark for emerging projects. As traders look for the next ADA-like opportunity, lower-priced alternatives such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.025 are catching attention, promising early-stage growth potential similar to ADA’s early days. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) utilizes investor sentiment changes by focusing on straightforward DeFi lending models which drive its growth. Investors only have limited time during Phase 4 to purchase MUTM tokens at $0.025 before the tokens rise in value to $0.03 during the subsequent phase. The 140% estimated profit for strategic MUTM investors will happen when the platform launches on exchanges for $0.06 while supported by well-founded tokenomics. A large number of investors have participated in funding MUTM to surpass $5.7 million demonstrating market demand for platforms that connect lending facilities with growth prospects. The automated Buy-and-Distribute mechanism of MUTM’s ecosystem constantly acquires tokens from the market then releases them to stakers during scheduled distribution periods. The model maintains regular market purchases which stands out as a rare phenomenon against the general volatile and speculative market character. Innovative Growth Strategy Mutuum Finance establishes its unique identity by creating the mtToken system to represent investments made through ETH and DAI as well as other deposited assets. The interest-accumulating mtTokens enable users to earn money without sacrificing full fund accessibility. The lending platform collects participant funds through its pool system which provides varying APY returns to depositors and extends borrowing options to asset collateralized users. An optimized security measure in the platform manages effective loan-to-collateral ratios by requiring users to provide $7,000 ETH for access to $5,000 USDT. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents itself as an attractive investment opportunity for those who want early access to high rise potential. The project demonstrates unwavering strength through its 7,400 investor base that raised $5.7 million. During Phase 5 Mutuum Finance will increase its price from $0.025 to $0.03 which creates a short time window for investors to maximize their returns until reaching the target launch price of $0.06 to achieve a 140% increase. You should take advantage of the current chance to lock in your spot in a decentralized finance sector which is experiencing rapid expansion. Do not delay your participation in the Mutuum Finance presale since the next price increase is approaching.

While an official confirmation is yet to come to light, the El Salvador leader posted a cheeky response to a tweet signifying his intention to visit the American leader. In his post , Bukele mentioned that he would be honored to visit, noting that he will come with several cans of Diet Coke, a beverage that Trump prefers. If it is eventually confirmed, the meeting will mark Bukele as the first Western Hemisphere leader to visit Donald Trump at the White House under this current administration, fueling speculation about a closer relationship between the two pro-Bitcoin leaders. I’ll be bringing several cans of Diet Coke. https://t.co/fuBAJDqXes — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) March 28, 2025 Bukele was replying to an initial post that mentioned that he is expected to visit the United States next month, mentioning that he is an ally of the country. “JUST IN: President Trump will be hosting El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House next month. El Salvador has proven to be one of our BEST allies, taking in HUNDREDS of deported Tren de Aragua gang members to imprison. @nayibbukele deserves this recognition more than ANY other world leader,” the post said. El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele fuels United States visit speculation El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele has enjoyed quite the relationship with the United States leader since the latter’s re-election and subsequent return to the White House. According to reports, both parties spoke after the inauguration, with Trump later thanking Buekele publicly, commending his “understanding of this horrible situation” regarding the border issues. Meanwhile, the possible visit is coming after El Salvador agreed to accept the deported Venezuelan gang members from the United States. The gang members were initially deported to their country of origin, but the plane transporting them was not cleared to land, leading to a furious Trump threatening tariffs on the country. The individuals are now being held at El Salvador’s high-security Terrorism Confinement Center, which was visited by the US Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem recently. President Bukele has seen his administration earn both international praise and criticism following its tough stance on crime. The tough approach is indeed working in the country, eliminating gangs while turning the country from one of the most violent to one of the safest in Latin America. Speculation grows following news of Bukele’s White House meeting Meanwhile, speculation has been growing over the likely topics that the duo may go over during the meeting, with many predicting that Bitcoin could be one of the talking points. Both Trump and Bukele have proved to be admirers of Bitcoin, but with a slightly different approach. Bukele has been ramping up his purchase of Bitcoin over the last few months after he pledged to buy at least one Bitcoin per day. While a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seems to have reduced the pace, the El Salvador leader is still committed to the digital asset. Trump, on the other hand, spent his first tenure opposing the technology but has now warmly embraced the industry, even floating his token. The United States president recently signed an executive order for the creation of a United States crypto reserve that would include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and some other digital assets. While the reserve has not been approved, the United States is planning to top it up with digital assets seized from criminal activities and persons, instead of an outright purchase. While it remains to be seen what the topic of discussion might be between both parties, it is safe to say that Bitcoin might be a topic worth discussing. While the actions of Trump had been predicted to boost the value and appeal of the token, the token has been in bearish water lately. The token was initially pumped in November after Trump was announced as the president, crossing the $100,000 mark in the months that followed. However, it has declined since then, presently trading around $82,333 as of press time. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

According to Lookonchain’s update, one of the memecoin’s whales has initiated a massive selloff. This selloff has further compounded the bearish outlook of the token, further dampening the outlook around the memecoin. PEPE Whale Selloff, Key Implications Per the Lookonchain update on X , the PEPE OG sold 150,000,000,000 tokens worth over $1.14 million in early trading. The analytics platform noted that this OG entered the PEPE market earlier. The whale reportedly spent only $2,184 to buy 1.5 trillion PEPE, valued at over $43 million at the peak. This whale has sold off 1.02 trillion PEPE thus far for $6.66 million. Onchain records show he still has 493 billion PEPE of the original stash. This leftover is worth $3.64 million, representing a total profit of $10.3 million or 4,718x. A $PEPE OG sold 150B $PEPE($1.14M) again 5 hours ago.

He sold 1.02T $PEPE for $6.66M, leaving 493B $PEPE ($3.64M), with a total profit of $10.3M(4,718x). https://t.co/tyzLr10sGj pic.twitter.com/FD6fFpyqCi — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 29, 2025 Whales selling off an asset is typically not a vote of confidence for the digital currency. This selloff is not uncommon to memecoins, and for PEPE, this may further dampen the negative outlook of the token. PEPE Coin Price Outlook Earlier this week, CoinGape reported a 500 billion PEPE accumulation by a whale, a move that many hoped could push the price up. However, the reverse is the case as Pepe Coin price is currently trading for $0.0000073, down 5.57% in past 24 hours. Despite the broader market downturn, PEPE has come off as one of the biggest losers overall. Per the current setup, the token moved from a 24-hour high of $0.00000787 to its current price. While the token has maintained a marginal growth of 0.54% in the past 7-days, it has registered a 62% drawdown Year-to-Date (YTD). It remains unknown how the current PEPE Coin outlook will play out. However, a halt in whale selloffs and a shift in the broader memecoin market fundamentals might fuel its recovery. Crypto Market and Memecoin Rebound The broader crypto market is down today , facing negative pressures from the economic uncertainty in the broader financial market. Bitcoin has continued to weigh the altcoins down, explaining the PEPE-correlated selloff. Assets in the memecoin market, like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, have also been down 5.58% and 3.3% in the past 24 hours. With the weekend volatility, top assets might see more price drawdowns overall. Analysts are optimistic about BTC’s future recovery, which can have a ripple effect on the broader market.

All digital assets experienced a market correction because of this recent development across the crypto market. Bitcoin trades below $83k and Ethereum exists below $1,800 in the current market situation. The current global crypto market cap reaches $2.68 trillion although it has declined by a total of 1.82% throughout the last day. Trading activities experienced a substantial decline as market liquidity decreased to a 30% drop resulting in $62.18 billion volume. Bitcoin dominance rises to 61% as investors demonstrate a reserved market sentiment across the crypto market . A nationwide market downturn has been caused by stock market variants and decreased customer optimism that resulted in crypto liquidations totaling $450 million. XRP XRP has seen a 12% drop in just 48 hours, making it the worst-performing major cryptocurrency this week, despite Ripple’s victory over the SEC. The cryptocurrencies price, particularly XRP’s, has been on a downward trend. A crypto analyst noted that if XRP manages to break above $3, it could invalidate the current head-and-shoulders pattern, potentially turning the outlook bullish for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (BTC) The Bitcoin market suffered a substantial price decrease in recent 24 hours which pushed its value below $83,000. Since recent height at $90,000 the leading Cryptocurrency has started to decline in price. The most recent BTC market information reveals its status at $82,324 while showing a decline of 2% during one day. Crypto analyst AlI noted Bitcoin’s significant indicator, which shows that its sell-side ratio has dropped down to 0.086%. Previous price recovery signals have emerged when the sell-side ratio dipped below 0.1%. The persisting bearish pressure would likely lead Bitcoin to fall briefly to $80,000 in the forthcoming period. The BTC price could increase to $90,000 provided the bulls eventually recapture dominance from bears. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum prices faced a major drop during the past day resulting in values falling beneath $1,900 due to market-wide selling pressure. Within this period $136.21 million worth of liquidations occurred because of the price decline. ETH price trades at a downward price movement while market participants continue to predict it will reachthe $2,000 mark. Ethereum may reach its key support region at $1,800 if its bearish movement keeps going down. A whale made an impactful purchase of 3,195 ETH which amounted to $5.97 million at the token rate of $1,868.

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00005302 to $0.0000606. In 2031, we expect Bonk price to record a maximum price of $0.00009847 with an average price of $0.00009468. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Cryptocurrency lost up to 8.61% of its value. BONK prices target the next resistance at $0.00001454. On March 29, 2025, Bonk price analysis revealed a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency. Its value dropped to $0.00001136 in the last 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency lost 8.61% today. This marks unfavorable conditions for the investors as the cryptocurrency fell rapidly. Bonk 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of Bonk coin confirmed a bearish trend for the currency. BONK/USD value dropped to $0.00001136 over the last 24 hours. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify rising bearish pressure. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines volatility. This distance is reducing, leading to a decreasing volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $0.00001454. Whereby, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.00000908. BONK/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is hovering within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has reduced to 40.98. The steep bearish slope on the RSI graph reflects an unbalanced trading setup. If the selling activities continue to intensify, the RSI value will drop below the 40 threshold. BONK /USD 4-hour price chart analysis The four-hour price analysis confirmed a bearish trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value deteriorated to $0.00001134 in the past four hours. However, the rising volatility levels indicate a higher chance of reversal soon. The Bollinger bands are widening as volatility levels rise. This rise in volatility suggests higher market unpredictability. The upper Bollinger band has shifted to $0.00001523 indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to a $0.00001100 low, securing the support. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator has entered the oversold region. The ongoing downside has resulted in a significant loss. Its value has shrunk to index 29.80 over the last few hours. The bears have been consecutively securing victories since the early hours.

Coin value has depreciated to $0.00001136 low in the last 24 hours. Side by side, the cryptocurrency lost up to 8.61% of its value through the day. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to reflect a bearish overview of the market. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a huge surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.00009847, which is approximately 7.9 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value decreased to $0.000001136. Today’s decreasing pressure triggered a notable descent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.00001640. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2028. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2029. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.00009847 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price. Recent news/opinion on Bonk BONK said in a post that it burned two trillion twenty-five billion BONK tokens, which equals $35,066,115. Burning is a process for permanently removing tokens from circulation to maintain or increase the value of the remaining tokens and fight inflation.

Three names are lighting up the radar— Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), GALA, and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Each brings a wildly different vision, but they all pack serious potential for ROI-hungry investors looking for the best crypto to invest in. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Best Crypto to Invest for a Legendary Ride & Explosive ROI If there’s one meme coin on track to melt faces and snowbanks alike, it’s Arctic Pablo Coin. This ain’t your average dog-themed pump-and-dump. Arctic Pablo spins an irresistible story—a rogue adventurer on a snowmobile chasing ancient relics hidden across frozen lands. Each presale location marks a new realm in this quest, turning every phase into a collectible moment of crypto folklore. At its core, Arctic Pablo Coin is about more than narrative. It’s built on Binance Smart Chain (BEP20), accepts BNB, ETH, BTC, USDT, SOLANA, and XRP, and integrates robust deflationary tokenomics. Every week, unsold tokens are burned, making the remaining supply scarcer and more valuable. This isn’t just hype—it’s math. With a total supply of 221.2 billion APC, the team has locked down a visionary allocation: 50% for public presale, 15% for staking, and only 5% to the team (vested for a year). The transparency screams long-term vision, not short-term rug. Arctic Pablo has officially arrived at Crystal Cove, its 16th location, and with a current presale price of $0.000083, things are heating up faster than a volcano in the arctic. Over $2 million has already been raised, and the coin’s trajectory suggests a listing price of $0.008. That’s a 9552.41% return for early backers. If someone tosses in just $500 today, that translates into 6,024,095 APCs, a monstrous $48,192.76 post-launch. Talk about turning a snowflake into a blizzard of gains. Unlike most coins, there are no “stages” here. It’s all about locations. Pablo’s movement mirrors an explorer’s path, and the thrill is in being part of the expedition. Don’t wait until the snowmobile disappears into the horizon—because the further Arctic Pablo rides, the higher the cost to hop aboard. It is the best crypto to invest in 2025. GALA: Powering the Web3 Entertainment Takeover Now let’s talk GALA, the token fueling the Web3 entertainment revolution. While Arctic Pablo brings adventure and mythical storytelling, GALA comes in hot with its hands on everything from gaming to music to film. It’s a fully loaded entertainment hub aiming to cut out the Web2 middlemen and give creators and users direct power. Backed by Gala Games, the ecosystem includes titles like Mirandus and Spider Tanks, where the players fully own in-game assets and NFTs. GALA is making it mainstream in a world where digital ownership is becoming the new flex. This play-to-earn approach allows users to generate income while enjoying immersive gameplay, one reason why gamers and crypto bros alike are watching GALA closely. Still, for those who believe Web3 entertainment is the future, GALA is one of the best cryptos to invest for a diversified bag. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): Reinventing the Web with Serious Tech Muscle Here’s where things get real nerdy—in a good way. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) isn’t out here for memes or games. It’s on a mission to decentralize the entire internet. Created by Dfinity Foundation, ICP allows developers to host websites, apps, and services on the blockchain, without needing Big Tech’s cloud infrastructure. ICP uses its own consensus mechanism—Chain Key Technology—and boasts some of the fastest finality times in the industry. It’s secure, scalable, and constantly evolving. Major apps like OpenChat, ICLighthouse, and even a decentralized version of TikTok-style apps are being developed on its network. So, is it one of the best cryptos to invest right now? It depends on the strategy. ICP might not deliver meme coin moonshots like Arctic Pablo, but it’s a strong play for those who believe in the decentralised future of the web. It’s tech-driven, institutionally respected, and holds solid long-term credibility. Final Thoughts: Why Arctic Pablo Tops the List of Best Crypto to Invest Right Now Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin is the clear frontrunner in this trio. While GALA pushes forward with Web3 entertainment and ICP rewrites the internet’s backend, Arctic Pablo is stirring up the most explosive combo—narrative, deflationary tokenomics, and ROI heat. Don’t just watch from the sidelines. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now and ride the snowmobile to the land of the riches. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs Q1: What makes Arctic Pablo the best crypto to invest in 2025? Arctic Pablo blends an immersive myth-driven presale with deflationary tokenomics, 66% APY staking, and over 9552% ROI potential, making it a unique and high-reward meme coin. Q2: How does GALA compare to Arctic Pablo Coin regarding investment? With solid tech, GALA offers Web3 gaming exposure, but Arctic Pablo’s ROI and deflationary model offer much higher short-term growth potential. Q3: Is Internet Computer Protocol still worth investing in? Yes, ICP is a long-term hold for Web3 believers, but it lacks the explosive gains and community-driven momentum Arctic Pablo currently provides.

42597525,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702418,1743272407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42597525.jpeg,EU officials warn against ‘tit-for-tat’ retaliatory tariffs against the US,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/eu-officials-against-retaliatory-tariffs/,"Unions in Ireland, France, and the rest of Europe are urging Brussels to remove food and drink items from the list of retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. The EU has planned to impose 50% tariffs on bourbon whiskey after the U.S. announced a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum. U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to respond with 200% tariffs on European drinks, including wine, champagne, and whiskey. Bloc leaders worry about dangerous cycle of revenge French, Italian, and Irish officials have objected to the EU’s plan. Jack Chambers, Ireland’s public expenditure minister, warned against “retaliatory and tit-for-tat measures that could worsen a trade dispute.” Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni told the Financial Times that the EU should talk with the U.S. about its high duties. “There are big differences in the single goods,” she said. “That’s what we have to work on to find a good, common solution.” Her agriculture minister, Francesco Lollobrigida, echoed that sentiment, saying, “We fear any further burden that will create more difficult conditions [for wine exports]. But we aren’t terrified.” Officials and industry representatives are also calling for a delay in final decisions, hoping to open the door to negotiations. Paris pressed the Commission to postpone its measures from April 1 to mid-April, hoping to gain more time for talks. However, officials in Brussels say the effort to negotiate has not progressed much. This week, Trump went beyond his original steps by adding 25% tariffs on cars. He declared April 2 “Liberation Day,” with plans for sweeping tariffs on all goods, on top of those already in place. The EU’s top negotiator told colleagues that this might force the EU to pay at least 20% overall. The Commission’s response is a package of tariffs on €26bn of U.S. imports, which is set for approval by member states to take effect on April 12. Some EU industries are calling for exemptions due to trade risks When the Commission released its proposal, it also provided a 99-page list of possible targets, ranging from soybeans to personal care goods. Companies and governments were given until March 26 to file objections. Peter Burke, Ireland’s trade minister, said that the Irish government has “made our concerns clearly known to the EU including in relation to the dairy and spirit drinks sectors.” He said the bloc is “open to fine-tuning its rebalancing measures” to protect the interests of producers, exporters, and consumers. Europe’s spirits lobby is pushing to exempt bourbon. The EU timber sector wants wood dropped from the list, fearing it could harm its trade. Meanwhile, Copa-Cogeca, representing farmers, wants soybeans removed from the final retaliation list, saying it is essential to animal feed products. A spokesperson explained, “Agrifood sector should be kept out of the scope of the retaliation or any disputes that don’t concern it.” Diplomats note that the Commission holds strong influence since member states would need a weighted majority to block its plan. One European diplomat said, “It’s not surprising that governments are doing this — they are standing up for their interests. But I am confident that there is going to be a strong package from the Commission that will be approved. If we block this then we are screwed — and member states know that.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

ADA’s Potential Path To Recovery,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-to-0-77-adas-potential-path/,"The Cardano price has been on a slow roll lately, falling out of its $0.7 – $0.8 range over the past week. However, a crypto analyst has emerged with a bullish projection, expecting the altcoin to recover in the coming days. How ADA Price Can Reclaim $0.77 In a video posted on the X platform, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an exciting analysis of the Cardano price, putting forward a short-term target for the altcoin. According to the online pundit, the ADA token is trading at a critical support level and could be on its way to $0.77 over the next few days. This bullish projection is based on the formation of a horizontal channel pattern for the ADA price on the 3-hour timeframe. This channel is characterized by two major boundaries with at least four contact points, including two connecting lows and two connecting swing highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Hits 300-Week MA For The Second Time Ever, Here’s What Happened In 2022 Typically, the upper boundary where the pivot highs form represents the resistance for the asset’s price while the lower channel trendline acts as the support cushion. A sell signal goes off when the asset’s price hits the top of the horizontal channel, while traders tend to buy when the price is at the channel’s lower boundary. According to Martinez, the Cardano price has fallen into a horizontal channel since mid-March, trading within the $0.69 – $0.77 range. As shown in the chart below, the price of ADA is hovering around the support cushion (the lower boundary) at the $0.69 level. Using the earlier logic, the Cardano token seems to be at a perfect buying spot, with the price currently at the channel’s lower trendline. Typically, when the asset’s price is at the bottom of the channel, it tends to bounce back toward the upper trendline. Martinez noted that if the $0.69 support level holds, the Cardano price could make a bullish run toward the $0.77 mark. This rebound toward the upper boundary would represent an over 12% move from the current price point. Cardano Price Overview As of this writing, the price of ADA stands at around $0.685, reflecting an over 2% decline in the past 24 hours. While the altcoin seemed to be recovering nicely early in the week, it has witnessed a deep retracement toward its March lows. According to data from CoinGecko, the Cardano price is down by nearly 4% in the past week.

The price is moving 12% higher to $0.00001303, once more drawing the attention of traders. Speculators point that Shiba Inu (SHIB) has the potential to keep blooming and appreciate 200% in the upcoming weeks. It could happen historically — Shiba Inu (SHIB) hauled on a 150% rally over the six weeks previous. However, while SHIB’s outlooks create excitement, another token is silently positioning itself for greater returns. The DeFi lending minting project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also outperformed expectations. Mutuum Finance has entered phase 4 of its presale as tokens are priced at $0.025. Over $5.7 million have been raised and more than 7400 holders have joined. However, the real opportunity lies far beyond the presale. As the initial listing price of $0.06 for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ensured early adopters could make a 140% profit at launch. After listing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) projected to hit $1.50, which makes the most bullish Shiba Inu (SHIB) predictions look ridiculously small. Short-Term Outlook for Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) bounce back is driven by whales, with large transactions soaring 72%. In 24 hours analysts point to a path to $0.00002485 if Shiba Inu (SHIB) buying pressure continues. Fibonacci projections also suggest a possible long-term target for Shiba Inu (SHIB) around $0.00007380. Nonetheless, Shiba Inu (SHIB) still subject to volatility. Shiba Inu (SHIB) cyclical corrections and dependence on general market sentiment transform it into a highly speculative high-return play. Mutuum Finance is an interesting alternative for investors who appreciate more stable growth. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Powerhouse Mutuum Finance’s presale Phase 4 is already live, with more than 7,400 holders onboard. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project’s lending model with mtTokens and overcollateralized loans offers real utility as opposed to that of meme coins which depend on hype. A supportive buy-and-distribute mechanism stabilizes long-term Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demand and contributes to price growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investors looking to buy-in now at $0.025 will instantly benefit from a 20% Phase 5 price hike. It is simple math: invest $1,000 today and it becomes $1,200 after the phase shift. At launch, that same Mutuum Finance (MUTM) investment could become worth $2400 — a 2.4X increase. If Mutuum Finance (MUTM) conservative post-launch targets of $1.50, those joining the mission early could receive returns of over 7,400%. Why Speculative Plays Are No Match for Mutuum Finance That said, while SHIB’s 200% rally would make holders of the speculative token leap for joy, the structured appreciation of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a lot less risk of unexpected mood swings. Tokenomics of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token. This works in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) favour, as its smart contracts are currently subject to a Certik audit — a layer of security that is unusual at this stage of a project. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project’s emphasis on sustainable DeFi solutions — P2P lending, for example, and dynamically adjustable interest rates — however distinguishes it from tokens that hope to benefit only from the next viral trend. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows promise with its bullish chart formation and potential 200% rally, its speculative nature leaves investors vulnerable to volatility. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a structured and sustainable path to massive gains, with real DeFi utility driving its value. With over 7,400 holders and $5.7 million raised, the presale at $0.025 presents a rare opportunity before the next price jump to $0.03. Early adopters stand to benefit from a projected 7,400% return if MUTM reaches its $1.50 target. Don’t miss your chance, secure your MUTM tokens now and position yourself for DeFi’s next major breakout.

The ugly price action was further exacerbated by U.S. President Donald Trump’s newly levied reciprocal tariffs, which applied a 25% tariff to all vehicles manufactured outside America. The chances for a relief Bitcoin rally are quickly diminishing as traders await April 2, the day Trump has tagged “Liberation Day,” where broad-scale tariffs are expected to be announced. Nonetheless, Bitcoin OG Arthur Hayes remains optimistic that BTC is likely to rocket to a stratospheric figure before reaching the current market cycle peak. Bitcoin On Course For Barnstorming Rally Bitcoin is a bargain at current levels as a market-wide rout obliterated virtually all gains from earlier this week, but upside price predictions remain firmly on the agenda. Speaking to Master Ventures founder Kyle Chasse, BitMEX co-founder and former CEO Arthur Hayes suggested that Bitcoin is likely to experience a steady uptrend amid an increase in the monetary supply. “I think Bitcoin is going to hit a numerically interesting number. Now, obviously, I put a $1 million Bitcoin out there. I hope it hits a million, but maybe it’s like $666,000 or $500,000 or $250,000 — some round number that in the human mind is significant for some arbitrary reason,” Hayes postulated. “We are going to hit that level, and then we’re going to expect insane things out of the pace of fiat money creation. And at that point, it’s probably time to sell everything.” Hayes also thinks that the historic four-year cycle driven by the Bitcoin halving is now less pronounced due to crypto’s maturation as “a bona fide asset class.” Instead, Bitcoin’s price action is now steered by the fiat liquidity levels moving around the markets. The Bitcoin halving is a quadrennial event that reduces miners’ rewards in half, causing a supply shock that has previously heralded parabolic rallies. The April 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the Bitcoin network’s block reward to 3.125 BTC per block. Notably, Bitcoin has matured so much that the leader of the world’s biggest economy is even talking about the asset. US President Donald Trump’s recent signing of an executive order to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve is one of the factors that has potentially distorted the four-year market cycle. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump regime have also legitimized crypto in the eyes of institutional investors, which should usher in new capital flows and decrease the volatility of digital assets. “Now I think Bitcoin has transitioned from this sort of technological digital bare asset into the best smoke alarm for fiat liquidity that we have globally. Previously, that role was held by gold. And now I think we have a 24/7 market. Anyone with an internet connection can access it, and it’s really driven by fiat liquidity.” Hayes continued. Bitcoin’s price is currently down 24.3% from its all-time high of over $108,786 recorded on Jan. 20.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Arthur Hayes|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-29 18:31:15

Decoding Their X Post,https://coingape.com/is-burger-king-teasing-crypto-launch-decoding-their-x-post/,"Burger King is joining ranks with other leading brands to dabble in digital assets, hinting at a coin launch. According to a post on micro-blogging platform X, the fast-food chain may be inching toward the launch of Burger Coin. Burger King Hints At Burger Koin Launch Global fast-food chain Burger King has hinted at the potential launch of a cryptocurrency, joining the league of brands with native digital assets. The UK arm of the fast-food chain teased Burger Koin in an X post , seeking community opinion for the coin. “Shall we make a crypto burger coin called Burger Koin?” wrote Burger King on X. The tweet has triggered widespread reaction across the cryptoverse, fuelling speculation for an imminent launch. Burger King’s tweet comes in the middle of a jarring market correction , with assets shedding their values. While the tweet did not share further details, pundits are speculating over the direction of Burger Koin. A majority of analysts say Burger King’s crypto will come retrofitted with utility for holders. Burger Koin may be used for governance use cases, allowing holders to vote on new recipes while offering discounts and staking functionalities. Since the tweet went live, several copycat tokens have garnered steam in the absence of further statements by the fast-food chain Burger Koin May Operate As A Memecoin Chances are that Burger King’s Burger Koin may take the form of a memecoin if the fast-food chain proceeds to launch. Pundits say that a memecoin with a streak of utility will be the best option for Burger Coin, given its vibrant community. The recent declaration by the US SEC that memecoins are not securities may play a role in Burger King’s choice. Back in 2017, the Russian arm of the fast-food chain launched WhooperCoin as a part of a loyalty program for customers. Burger King is no stranger to digital assets as it partnered with Robinhood to give out Dogecoin (DOGE) via sweepstakes. The fast-food chain has dabbled with NFTs after its brush with memecoins. Despite their soaring popularity Cathie Woods says memecoins will be worthless in the future since they have no intrinsic value. The post Is Burger King Teasing Crypto Launch?

While traditional markets wobble, investors are rushing into meme coins for their potential upside, community power, and viral energy. But with thousands of coins floating around, which ones are worth your dollars? In this exclusive listicle, we’re diving into the best new meme coins to invest in right now—featuring the high-voltage BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the squirrel that’s taking over crypto Twitter (PNUT), crowd-favorite BRETT, iconic POPCAT, and the redemption arc of SLERF. Whether you’re looking to score gains, stake for yield, or get in early on the next big presale, this lineup has you covered. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Double Your Tokens, Triple Your Gains, and Ride the 2900% Wave Ever felt like you always miss the dip? BTFD was made for you. This isn’t just another meme coin presale —it’s a full-stack crypto project built on Ethereum with serious real-world utility, a fully live P2E game (launched January 1, 2025), and a staking program that dishes out 90% APY. But what’s got the Bulls stampeding? The presale. BTFD is now in Stage 15, priced at $0.0002 per coin, and just one stage away from launch, where the listing price is locked in at $0.0006. That’s a straight-up 3x gain just for being early. But here’s where it gets wild—the moon price target sits at $0.006, representing a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI if you ape in now. Let’s break it down with real numbers: If you throw $6,500 into BTFD today at $0.0002, you’ll snag 32.5 million coins. Use the LAUNCH100 bonus code before March 30, and you double that haul—65 million coins in total. If the price hits $0.0006, that bag is worth $39,000. And if it moons to $0.006? That’s $390,000. Insane. And you’re not just holding—BTFD’s got game rewards, staking compounding, and a Referral Program that pays you 10% in BTFD tokens if you hit the monthly top 20. This isn’t just a coin—it’s an ecosystem rewarding smart investors, gamers, and community builders. Now for the cherry on top: BTFD launched a one-time 100% bonus code—LAUNCH100—that DOUBLES your tokens, but it expires March 30. Here’s how to grab it: Claim Your LAUNCH100 Bonus in 5 Steps: Head over to the BTFD Presale Platform Click “Connect Wallet” and choose MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Enter bonus code LAUNCH100 in the field and hit apply. Type how many BTFD tokens you want to buy. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction. Pro tip: Type the code in ALL CAPS or it won’t work.

Because it’s not just hype—it’s got working products, a proven roadmap, and a once-in-a-lifetime presale moment that could set up life-changing gains for early movers. 2. Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) Peanut isn’t just another furry meme—this Solana-based token has become a fan-favorite in the DeFi crowd for its wild branding and clever utility integrations. PNUT is gaining traction in meme-friendly DEX platforms and offering exclusive NFT airdrops to active holders. Its community-led governance approach and low barrier to entry are appealing to Gen Z investors who value control and memetic power. Why is PNUT one of the best new meme coins to invest in right now? Because it’s uniting entertainment and DeFi in a way that feels fresh, sticky, and scalable across Web3. 3. Brett (BRETT) BRETT is proving it’s no joke on Ethereum. With a current market cap of around $355 million, analysts say it’s still undervalued compared to its version on Base. BRETT was once a $2 billion cap coin, and insiders believe it could revisit that territory if sentiment turns bullish. Its strong branding, meme appeal, and wide exchange listings make it a legit contender in the top-tier meme coin arena. Why is BRETT here among the top new meme coins?

Popcat (POPCAT) POPCAT is the silent killer in the meme coin race. It’s known for its viral appeal and simple yet unforgettable mascot—those clicky cat memes that exploded across the internet?

What earned POPCAT a spot on this hot list? It has cultural firepower, a growing use case in gaming, and a low-cap entry point that still leaves plenty of runway. 5. SLERF (SLERF) SLERF had one of the wildest launches ever—a $10 million accidental presale burn, followed by a meteoric rise to $750 million market cap. Now, it’s bouncing back as one of the most volatile-yet-rewarding meme plays in the Solana space. The dev publicly owned the mistake, and the community rallied. Today, SLERF thrives off transparency, raw humor, and high-speed trading action. Why is SLERF one of the best meme coins to invest in right now?

New York Attorney General Letitia James alleges Terra founder Do Kwon recruited Galaxy Digital to purchase LUNA tokens and advocate for his project in the West. James says the investment firm, which did not admit or deny the AG’s allegations, bought 18.5 million Luna from Terraform Labs in October 2020 at $0.22 per token, a nearly 30% discount to the asset’s then-market price of $0.31. “As Michael Novogratz, Galaxy’s founder and chief executive officer, later said, Galaxy helped ‘kickstart’ interest in Luna through its marketing efforts. Galaxy began posting about Luna and Terraform on social media in November 2020, and Luna’s price and trading volume rose. On March 26th, 2021, when Luna was trading around $18 per token, Novogratz posted on social media that he would get a Luna tattoo if Luna’s price reached $100. Luna hit $100.84 on December 24th, 2021, and on January 4th, 2022, Novogratz publicly unveiled his Luna tattoo on social media. But while Novogratz posted pictures of his tattoo and expressed his Luna bullishness to the public, Galaxy sold millions of tokens into the market at many multiples of its initial cost without disclosing that it was selling.” James notes that Galaxy Digital had almost completely exited its LUNA position by the time the Terra ecosystem imploded in May 2022. Kwon was arrested in Montenegro in 2023 while attempting to board a flight to Dubai using a fake Costa Rican passport. The South Korean software engineer is facing fraud charges in both the United States and his native country, but Montenegrin authorities decided to extradite him to the US in December. Kwon faces a maximum penalty of 130 years in prison, and his trial is currently scheduled for January 2026.

According to vendors at this year’s Mining Disrupt conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, people are now actively purchasing machines to mine the digital asset. While the conference is heavily focused on the Bitcoin mining business, because it is headlined by major publicly traded firms and backed by President Trump, coins like DOGE and Litecoin were also central to discussions because of their proof-of-work nature, which allows miners to actively earn mining rewards for supporting the chains. Dubbed as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk’s favorite digital asset, Dogecoin was launched as a joke in 2013, and now well over 10 years, the asset continues to go strong, remaining prominent in the market. However, there is now a serious business of mining the asset presently ongoing among small business and even some investors. Dogecoin mining is on the rise as businesses get involved Sometimes, the machines used to mine some PoW digital assets often mine them at the same time, which is called “merged mining,” a move that allows them to boost their earnings. Vendors mentioned that miners from all places, from solo miners to public companies are actively interested in mining to earn a little bit of extra cash. The head of business development at ElphaPex, Payne Cong, mentioned that mining these assets helps miners maximize their revenue. According to Alan Martinez from hardware maker JSBIT, miners could potentially earn about $750 per month mining DOGE using the silent machines. Big companies are also interested in the machines, reflecting the growing interest in generating revenue through the token. “We’re talking with large firms—listed on the Nasdaq—who are interested,” he added. According to data from CoinWarz, miners are currently mining Dogecoin and can make profits of up to $5.83 per day on the digital asset with one machine. Meanwhile, mining Bitcoin on one machine will see the operator earn rewards of about $9.41 per day. A snapshot showing Dogecoin profits per day. Source: CoinWarz According to public American miner BIT Mining in December, DOGE was a bigger cash cow for the company than the leading digital asset. Mining Bitcoin is getting increasingly hard for smaller miners as its difficulty increases and its price continues to drop. Musk’s influence on DOGE and the path to the future Dogecoin gained a big following after Tesla boss Elon Musk started to talk about the coin on X. The EV maker CEO, who now advises the United States president under, coincidentally DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency), praised the token and its team, helping it gain value at different times. Before then, the token had started as a joke between two engineers in 2013 before it started to gain substantial value. In a recent post, Musk praised the coin’s tokenomics, noting that its uncapped supply with 10,000 new coins minted every minute makes it good as a currency ahead of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is regarded as digital gold, its limited supply has made many see it as a store of value rather than an asset that can be used for everyday purchases like cash. Meanwhile, Martinez mentioned that Dogecoin mining is currently being carried out by small businesses, with major big-time miners still not serious about going all-in on mining digital assets. He mentioned a coffee shop chain which he said was mining the asset at six of its sites, noting that they treat it like a side hustle, taking advantage of the heat recapture. “Don’t turn on your heater—turn on your miner,” he said of DOGE mining’s additional benefits.

BTC’s recent price action has been subpar, indicating that it is facing strong resistance levels that have all but reversed its near four-month bull run. Smart investors are broadening their horizons and shifting their focus to high-growth altcoins that offer a higher upside. One altcoin rapidly garnering attention is RCO Finance (RCOF) , an AI crypto offering AI-powered investment tools, real-world asset integration and an advanced DeFi ecosystem. Predicted to be on the verge of a massive 554x surge, could this altcoin be the next breakout star? Bitcoin Price Resistance: What’s Holding BTC Back?

After reaching a new all-time high of $109,114 in January, the Bitcoin price has dropped to about $88,000, a 19.35% drop. This has caused concerns among investors, prompting them to look for more agile, high-growth alternatives. Bitcoin has faced notable resistance at various price levels, most between $80,000 and $85,000. Despite periods of upward momentum, the Bitcoin price has failed to maintain these gains. Metrics such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggest that BTC is overbought, leading to pullbacks. The Bitcoin price is also facing resistance due to macroeconomic influences. High interest rates and inflation have reduced market liquidity, making risk-on assets like Bitcoin less attractive. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainties such as trade tensions and economic instability have created an environment of uncertainty, discouraging large-scale investments in volatile assets like Bitcoin. With a high market cap and extensive adoption, Bitcoin remains a long-term investment rather than a fast-growing asset. Many traders seeking rapid returns are now diversifying into smaller-cap cryptos like RCO Finance, which are building momentum for explosive price action.

Ethereum Whale Suffers Huge Loss Onchain data shared by The Data Nerd reveals that a crypto whale accumulated 2,140 ETH worth $7.13 million at an average price of $3,331 some three months ago. The interesting point is that this whale deposited these ETHs, currently worth $4.06 million, to Binance in his transaction today and probably sold them. Related News: Binance Makes Swift Statement on Hacker Who Claimed to Have Stolen 100 Thousand People's Cryptocurrency Exchange Login Info If he had sold, this crypto whale would have lost approximately $3.08 million, meaning he would have lost 43% of his investment. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at its lowest levels in a year. The world's largest altcoin has lost 20% of its value in the last month. Unlike many other altcoins, ETH, which failed to break the all-time high price record in the last bull cycle, is currently trading at $1,816, 62% lower than its record high. *This is not investment advice.

42600268,https://invezz.com/?p=2643561,1743275700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Dogecoin price prediction: can DOGE make a new high in 2025? Have experts found the next DOGE?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/29/dogecoin-price-prediction-can-doge-make-a-new-high-in-2025-have-experts-found-the-next-doge/,"Dogecoin’s price up 42% in recent weeks, rallying from $0.1432 to $0.20 as bullish technical formations and whale activity spark hope of a historic breakout. DOGE is on its course to break all-time high, some analysts are even predicting it to hit anywhere from $0.80 to $6.00 in 2025. The bullishness comes after Dogecoin broke above a three-month-old downtrend-line, a development that has historically paved the way for parabolic price action. In the meantime, whales have purchased 200 million DOGE tokens in the past two weeks after pumping $2.14 billion into the asset. This FOMO is exacerbated by the House of Doge’s recent purchase of 10 million DOGE for its reserve, further offsetting momentum and positioning the meme coin towards a possible parabolic growth. The growing force behind Mutuum Finance presale While Dogecoin is grabbing all the headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly emerging as a player with the potential for exponential growth. The project has this presale raised $5,800,000 across four rounds and gained 7,500 holders through its structured lending model and buy-pressure mechanics. MUTM tokens currently cost $0.025 in phase four, providing immediate upside: the next stage will increase prices by 20% to $0.03, locking in a 140% return when MUTM tokens launch. While the tokenomics guarantees a listing price of $0.06, all other projections are targeting post-launch price action at between $1.50 and $5.00 as adoption of the platform takes off. An alternative to meme coin volatility Dogecoin’s rally relies on market sentiment, Mutuum Finance stakes its value in decentralized lending utilities. By merging DeFi innovation with real-world financial applications, the platform allows users to borrow against overcollateralized assets or receive interest through liquidity pools. Its mtTokens — interest-bearing representations of deposited assets — generate passive income streams, while a buy-and-distribute system funnels platform revenue into MUTM purchases and maintains demand. Smart money sees the asymmetry: tokens at $0.025 today mean an upside of 2,300% if projections for post-launch are met. Audits build confidence Mutuum Finance’s development team is in the last stages of conducting a Certik audit of its smart contracts, a move that adds a level of credibility in a market reluctant to vulnerabilities. The project prioritizes security and results will be shared through formal channels upon completion. As phase four is filling fast, the time left to get in at current pricing is closing. Now, not only does this let the people participating today lock in short-term profits before the next price increase, but it positions for long-term growth as the lending ecosystem of the platform launches. Despite Dogecoin’s technical breakout and increased whale accumulation reflecting its potential, such reliance on speculation generates volatility. Mutuum Finance, on the other hand, combines DeFi utility with a presale model that has been purposefully engineered to systematically reward early adopters. With phase four rising fast, the project’s progress can be likened to the early phase opportunities of what became established tokens. For investors looking for more strategic exposure beyond the meme coin space, MUTM’s presale presents a unique alignment of low entry levels and high-growth predictions. Will Dogecoin regain its crown? The opinions of analysts are still divided, while Mutuum Finance has already proven measurable demand. As the project mints 7,500 holders and counting, the presale success appears to predicate a trend towards sites that combine innovation with investor-perks. With the crypto market maturing, opportunities such as phase four of MUTM—where risk balances out to quantifiable upside—are few and far between. Lock in your spot before phase five kicks off Mutuum Finance’s presale marches on and each phase brings more urgency. At $0.025 the price is now in its last tier before another price increase and as such it is the best time to act. Head to Mutuum Finance’s official site to join before phase four sells out — and get into position for gains that outstrip even the most bullish Dogecoin projections.

With just 2 days left until BTFD Coin’s LAUNCH100 bonus ends, investors are racing against time to lock in double tokens at a fire-sale price of $0.0002. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is wobbling with recent dips, and Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) is catching major traction in what could be a breakout rally. Meme coins have always danced to their own beat—sometimes silly, sometimes explosive, but never boring. From Shiba to PEPE, the genre’s become a billion-dollar movement. Now, BTFD Coin is poised to lead the next generation with real utility: a live Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards up to 90% APY, and a raging bull community backing its explosive presale. It’s not just another meme coin—it’s a meme coin on a mission. BTFD Coin: Last Chance to Grab the 100% Bonus Before March 30 What if $8,000 could become $240,000… or even $480,000? At $0.0002 per token, investors are loading up on BTFD Coin during Stage 15 of its meme coin presale . But here’s where things get wild—the LAUNCH100 bonus. Use this code before March 30 and get double the tokens. That’s right. An $8,000 buy nets 40 million tokens… but with LAUNCH100, you walk away with 80 million. When the coin hits its moon price of $0.006 after launch, those tokens could be worth a jaw-dropping $480,000. That’s a 2900% ROI potential—and exactly why BTFD is being called the best crypto to buy now by a growing crowd of bullish investors. The best crypto to buy now isn’t always the most hyped—it’s the one with the most upside. The BTFD Coin meme coin presale has already raised over $6.43 million, with more than 11,600 holders and 72 billion tokens sold. This isn’t some stealth move—it’s a full-on stampede. BTFD is offering long-term firepower with its live P2E game (launched Jan 1, 2025), 90% APY staking, and a referral program that’s actually worth something. Let’s talk about that referral power. If you’re a community builder or just have a few crypto-curious friends, BTFD lets you earn 10% of what your referrals buy—as long as you’re in the monthly top 20. Your friends? They get an extra 10% in tokens. It’s all part of why BTFD is quickly becoming the best crypto to buy now for anyone serious about stacking early gains before launch. So, how do you get in? Connect your MetaMask or Trust Wallet to the presale page , load it with ETH, BNB, or USDT, and enter LAUNCH100 as your bonus code. Enter your amount, hit “Buy,” and let the double token magic happen. Once the presale wraps, your tokens will be ready to stake. No drama—just bulls running at full speed. Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW): Climbing Charts with Feline Fire Cat in a Dog’s World is quickly becoming one of the most compelling meme coin stories of 2025. It’s not just another feline-inspired asset—MEW brings lore, branding, and a vision. Launched in March 2024, MEW blew up the “cat coin” sector by pulling a $900 million market cap in days. And it’s still purring. Currently trading at $0.002297, MEW is down 14.34% in the last 24 hours, but don’t let that fool you—it’s up 20.75% over the past week. That’s the type of volatility meme traders love to catch on the upswing. Volume has dipped recently, but many investors view it as a temporary lull before another push higher. The narrative here is compelling. MEW is a digital underdog—or rather, undercat—fighting against the “dog-dominated” world of SHIBEX and its cronies. It’s storytelling mixed with strategy, and it’s resonating with younger investors hungry for projects that blend culture with coins. While not in presale like BTFD, MEW’s rally shows that narrative coins are still dominating headlines. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme King Feels the Pressure Dogecoin, the OG of meme coins, continues to show why it’s a cultural icon. Currently priced at $0.1809, it’s down 8.01% in the last 24 hours, but still up 8.50% over the last seven days. DOGE might not be new, but it still gets attention—especially when meme coins are surging. DOGE was never just about price charts. It was always about community—and Elon Musk tweets. Forked from Litecoin back in 2013, DOGE was designed to be a fun, tipping-friendly crypto. Fast-forward to today, and it’s accepted by dozens of merchants, mentioned in pop culture, and sits as a symbol of how far meme coins can go. But in a market chasing speed, staking rewards, and bonus codes like BTFD’s LAUNCH100, DOGE might be cruising rather than charging. Still, its ability to bounce back after dips and maintain relevance makes it a staple in any meme coin discussion. It’s that reliable friend who always shows up—just maybe not as fast as the new bull. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is creating some serious heat right now—and for good reason. Its 100% LAUNCH100 bonus offer ends March 30, and with over $6.43M already raised, there’s not much time left to join the bulls. The presale momentum, the projected 2900% ROI, and a stacked feature list—live P2E game, referral program, staking, and a loyal base—make BTFD the best crypto to buy now. Dogecoin remains a cornerstone in the meme coin universe, and MEW is writing its own chapter in meme lore. But the project with the biggest short-term upside? That’s clearly BTFD Coin. Investors ready to own the dip and ride the moonwave know where to look. Join the BTFD Coin presale now —before the LAUNCH100 bonus disappears forever. FAQs What is the best crypto to buy now for 2025? BTFD Coin is gaining traction as the best crypto to buy now thanks to its low entry price, 100% bonus offer ending March 30, and a projected 2900% ROI. How does BTFD Coin’s referral program work? By using your unique referral code, you can earn 10% of your referrals’ purchases and give them an extra 10% in BTFD tokens. Top 20 referrers get the rewards. Is Cat in a Dog’s World a good short-term investment? MEW has shown solid weekly gains and a compelling narrative, making it an attractive pick for those looking to catch meme coin momentum.

In an interview with Cointelegraph, the analyst said that while a recession is not probable, a recession and the current macroeconomic uncertainty will create an environment where risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies suffer. Puckrin said: ""Trump and his advisors have said they have not completely dismissed the recession, which means it is definitely possible, but right now, I would not say it is probable, but the odds have climbed a lot."" The analyst added that US President Donald Trump is not actively attempting to engineer a recession , but that the things the Trump administration is doing, including cutting federal jobs and spending to balance the budget can lead to recessions as a side effect. Macroeconomic uncertainty is the primary cause of the recent decline in the US Dollar Index (DXY), as investors shift capital to better opportunities in European capital markets and seek an escape from the economic uncertainty currently plaguing US markets, Puckrin told Cointelegraph. The DXY, which tracks the strength of the US dollar, took a nosedive in March 2025. Source: TradingView Related: Timeline: How Trump tariffs dragged Bitcoin below $80K Trade war fears drag the price of Bitcoin down President Trump's tariffs on US trading partners sent a shockwave through the crypto markets, leading to a steep decline in altcoin prices and a 24% correction in Bitcoin's ( BTC ) price from the Jan. 20 high of over $109,000. The tariffs and fears of a prolonged trade war also reoriented market sentiment toward extreme fear — a sharp contrast from the euphoric highs felt after the re-election of Donald Trump in the United States in November 2025 and the January 20 inauguration. The price of Bitcoin has been struggling amid the trade war headlines and is currently trading below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Source: TradingView According to Nansen research analyst Nicolai Sondergaard, crypto markets will feel the pressure of tariffs until April 2025. If countries can successfully negotiate an end to the tariffs or the Trump administration softens its stance then markets will recover, the analyst added. 10x Research founder Markus Thielen recently said that BTC formed a price bottom in March 2025, as US President Donald Trump softened the rhetoric around trade tariffs — signaling a potential price reversal.

Starting with Bank of America, head of metals research Michael Widmer says that while the precious gold may witness a short-term pullback after hitting a new record high of $3,085, he predicts the precious metal will soar toward his long-term target of $3,500, reports Bloomberg. Widmer says his bullish stance is supported by China’s recent move that allows insurance firms to invest in the precious metal. According to Widmer, China’s new program could spark a new wave of accumulation to the tune of 300 tons of gold. Meanwhile, Citi’s global head of commodities, Max Layton, believes that gold can surge to as high as $3,500 if the US economy falls short of anticipated growth. “In our base case, gold prices are expected to reach $3,200 per ounce over the next couple of months, and then potentially up as high as $3,500 an ounce, if we are in more of a concerning US growth environment than what we have in our base case.” Analysts at Goldman Sachs are also bullish on gold, predicting that the precious metal can climb higher than $3,100 as long as America’s policy direction remains undefined. “Because US policy uncertainty may support investor demand, and because we believe that central bank gold buying will remain structurally higher.” While the banks are upbeat about gold, JPMorgan and UBS are leaning bearish on the US stock market. Analysts at JPMorgan warn that the S&P 500 could go through deeper pullbacks if investors sniff a potential structural shift. Specifically, analysts say that the correction is likely 33% complete if the high-interest rate environment leads to an economic downturn. UBS chief strategist Bhanu Baweja is also bearish on the US stock market, noting that American consumers are “visibly tiring.” Baweja predicts that the S&P 500 could drop to as low as 5,300 as employment expectations, spending outlook and consumer confidence all show early signs of trouble.

Kaspa , Worldcoin , and Toncoin are among the biggest losers. As these cryptocurrencies plunge, investors are left wondering just how deep the decline will go. This article examines whether there's a recovery in sight and which coins might be poised for a rebound. Kaspa: Price History and Key Technical Levels in Focus Kaspa experienced notable price fluctuations, ranging from $0.058 to $0.115. Over the past month, it fell by approximately 23%, while in six months, the decline reached about 59%. A weekly drop of around 15% highlights the selling pressure on the coin. This performance reflects significant volatility and a loss of buyer confidence, indicating a challenging market environment for the asset. Currently, Kaspa is trading between $0.058 and $0.115, with resistance noted at $0.15 and support around $0.04, along with a secondary resistance at $0.21. Bears dominate the market, as technical indicators reveal weak momentum and low oscillator counts, indicating no clear upward trend. Traders might consider waiting for stabilization at support for a potential bounce or look for short opportunities if the price does not reclaim key resistance levels. Worldcoin Price Trends and Key Levels Shape a Cautious Outlook Worldcoin saw a 26.79% drop over the past month and a 60.23% decline over the last six months, outlining a period marked by heavy losses. The coin’s steady fall reflects persistent bearish pressure without intermittent rebounds. The significant downturn over both time frames points to a market grappling with uncertainty, with traders witnessing repeated dips that signal an overall negative sentiment and underline the need for careful strategy adjustments. The current price is holding between $0.78 and $1.62, with resistance near $2.13 and support at $0.46, along with a secondary resistance at $2.98. Bears appear to have the upper hand, though no strong trend is clear. Short-term trading could target moves near the resistance levels, while caution suggests buying closer to support with tight stop-loss orders. Toncoin: Short-Term Gains Clash with Long-Term Weakness A one-month gain of 7.2% alongside a weekly increase of 4.63% contrasts sharply with a six-month decline of 35.8%. Recent price increases indicate a touch of renewed buyer optimism, while the steep longer-term decrease points to ongoing challenges. The performance highlights a market with brief periods of bullish activity within an overarching downturn. Toncoin currently trades between $2.53 and $4.52, facing immediate resistance near $5.72, with a secondary level at $7.71. Solid support is identified at $1.72. The balance between buyers and sellers keeps the price within this confined range. The RSI reading at 56.54 indicates a slight bullish tendency. Traders might consider buying near support and taking profits as the price approaches resistance levels. Conclusion Kaspa , Worldcoin , and Toncoin face ongoing challenges. Market conditions are harsh, and it is hard to predict how much further they might decline. Each has unique problems and varying levels of investor confidence. Kaspa struggles with adoption issues. Worldcoin faces regulatory concerns. Toncoin fights against poor market sentiment. Recovery is uncertain and largely dependent on market shifts and external influences. Investors should stay informed as the situation unfolds. Possible rebounds will depend on improvements in their use cases and investor trust.

Investors turned cautious amid concerns over President Trump’s upcoming tariffs scheduled for April 2 along with stronger-than-expected core PCE data. With Bitcoin facing rising selling pressure below $85,000, it’s on track for its worst quarter since 2018, allowing analysts to speculate whether it might finish March below the critical $80,000 level. Bitcoin to Face Worst Q1 Since 2018 Bitcoin’s price has sharply declined over the past several hours. According to Coinglass data, nearly $90.56 million in BTC positions were liquidated, including $79.3 million from buyers and about $11.25 million from sellers. This recent price drop places Bitcoin on track for its worst Q1 performance since 2018. Data from CoinGlass indicates Bitcoin fell roughly 11.86% in Q1 2025, slightly worse than the 10.83% loss in Q1 2020, though far from the drastic 49.7% decline seen in Q1 2018. Bitcoin’s open interest has declined by roughly 4.5% in the past 24 hours, moving closer to a low of around $54 billion. The drop in open interest indicates declining trading activity among BTC traders, which may result in decreased volatility and more cautious market behavior in the short term. Additionally, the long/short ratio has experienced a noticeable decline, currently standing at 0.6051. This metric reveals that approximately 62.3% of traders are now betting on a further price decrease for Bitcoin, whereas only around 38% are hopeful about a potential rebound. Overall, these figures point to an increasing bearish sentiment among traders. Also read: Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Breaks After 10-Day Surge Adding to bearish sentiment, Bitcoin ETFs experienced notable outflows, possibly pushing BTC closer to the $80K level. Fidelity’s FBTC fund alone saw $93.16 million in outflows on Friday, ending a 10-day streak of inflows—the longest this year. Notably, FBTC had received $97.14 million of inflows just the previous day, as per SoSoValue. Trading volume across all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs increased slightly on Friday, totaling around $2.22 billion. What’s Next for BTC Price? Bitcoin has recently experienced increased selling pressure, causing its price to fall below significant Fibonacci support levels and reaching a low of around $81,644. At present, Bitcoin trades near $82,289, down approximately 1.7% over the past 24 hours. Sellers are actively holding the crucial resistance at $85,000, aiming to keep the price from bouncing back. Despite this, buyers remain determined and appear prepared for another push to reclaim this key level. If buyers manage to regain the $85,000 level, market sentiment could shift positively, potentially paving the way for further upward momentum toward the next major resistance near $90,000. However, if buyers are unsuccessful in overcoming this critical barrier, Bitcoin could face increased selling pressure, possibly dragging the price back toward the support zone between $80,000 and $78,000.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 19:38:46

Its initial coin offering has already raised over $11 million, sparking curiosity and buzz. Investors are wondering if this could be the next big player in the market. The excitement is building as the project gains momentum and attention. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner”s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.003333 Next Stage: $0.005 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $10 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Solana”s SOL: The Fast Lane of Blockchain Innovation Solana is making waves in the world of blockchain. It offers a speedy platform for building decentralized apps, known as dapps. Unlike some competitors like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana focuses on scalability without using sharding or extra layers. This means it can handle many transactions quickly and smoothly. Developers can use different programming languages to create on Solana, making it flexible and accessible. The SOL coin is at the heart of Solana”s ecosystem. It”s used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. With its high capacity and fast speeds, Solana aims to attract both developers and investors. In the current market, where speed and scalability are crucial, SOL stands out. It offers potential for hosting products and services that need high activity. While the crypto market is always changing, Solana”s focus on performance sets it apart from others. Shiba Inu: The Meme Coin Turning into a DeFi Contender Shiba Inu (SHIB), inspired by Dogecoin, is gaining attention in the cryptocurrency world. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, making it part of a vast and versatile ecosystem. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous creator Ryoshi, SHIB started with a staggering supply of one quadrillion tokens. In a surprising move, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. He donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and “burned” 40% of the total supply, actions that raised SHIB”s profile considerably. SHIB”s integration with Ethereum allows for more than just being a meme coin. Projects like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and plans for a future NFT platform showcase its potential for broader utility. These developments position SHIB in line with current market trends, where decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs are gaining popularity. Compared to other meme-inspired tokens, SHIB offers functionalities that may appeal to those interested in the evolving crypto landscape. In the present market cycle, as investors look for coins with practical use cases, SHIB”s ongoing projects and active community make it a cryptocurrency to watch. Conclusion With its unique blend of sports and meme culture, XYZ aims to surpass SHIB and SOL, becoming a cultural icon with potential massive growth.

42600212,https://coingape.com/?p=246670,1743277639,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Marathon Digital Launches $2B Stock Sale for More Bitcoin Purchase,https://coingape.com/marathon-digital-launches-2b-stock-sale-for-more-bitcoin-purchase/,"Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has announced the launch of a $2 billion at-the-market (ATM) stock offering to fund its strategy of acquiring more Bitcoin. The company, one of the largest Bitcoin miners in the U.S., plans to raise the capital through the sale of shares, with proceeds primarily aimed at increasing its Bitcoin holdings. The move follows the company’s previous successful offering, which raised $1.4 billion to support similar goals. Marathon Digital $2B Stock Sale To Buy Bitcoin MARA’s new equity program incorporates the selling of shares using a number of transactions facilitated by several investment firms such as Barclays and BMO Capital Market. The use of the proceeds is as follows with 40% to be used to purchase more Bitcoins, 35% for general corporate purposes and the remaining 25% for working capital. The Bitcoin purchase plan is in line with the firm’s overall objective of establishing a long-term foothold in the digital commodities sector. The new offering comes after a period of expansion of the holding of Bitcoins by the company. Currently, the company possesses 46,376 BTC, which makes it the second biggest holder of BTC among the number of listed firms. This decision is consistent with Marathon Digital Hope’s strategy to increase its Bitcoin holdings because it needs more capital following the challenging conditions in the mining industry. Strategy to Boost Bitcoin Holdings Marathon Digital has followed a similar model to another major firm, MicroStrategy, which sought funds for the purpose of acquiring Bitcoin. The company has migrated from the past method of mining and using its own generated bitcoins to buying the bitcoins through issuing of equity offerings and convertible bonds. As the company is still making solid profits from mining, buying more coins directly in the market creates another channel to expand the company’s offerings. The company’s past success with Bitcoin acquisition is evident. In 2024, Marathon Digital increased its holdings from 13,726 BTC to the current 46,376 BTC, demonstrating the company’s ability to scale its Bitcoin assets significantly. This aggressive expansion has positioned MARA as a major player in the digital asset space. Economic Challenges and Strategic Adjustments Marathon Digital’s approach comes at a time when the Bitcoin mining industry faces several economic hurdles. Rising energy costs and the recent halving of Bitcoin rewards have made traditional mining operations less profitable. By diversifying into direct Bitcoin purchases, Marathon is adjusting to the shifting dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, ensuring its continued growth despite the pressures on its mining business. The company’s decision to raise funds through equity offerings also addresses the ongoing need for capital to maintain and expand its operations. Despite these financial strategies, Bitcoin’s volatility remains a factor in the company’s long-term plans, with its future performance closely tied to the price of the digital currency. Strong Liquidity and Market Position Marathon Digital’s strong liquidity position remains a key aspect of its financial health. The company’s latest stock offering is a part of its broader strategy to manage its resources effectively and capitalize on market opportunities. Its current ratio of 4.94 indicates that the company is well-positioned to meet short-term obligations, which is essential as it navigates the fluctuating cryptocurrency market. However, not everyone supports this approach. Renowned economist Peter Schiff has been vocal in his criticism of companies like MARA and MicroStrategy for their strategies of purchasing Bitcoin. Schiff, a Bitcoin critic, recently dismissed the idea of acquiring Bitcoin as a viable long-term business model, calling those who invest in the cryptocurrency “fools.” The post Marathon Digital Launches $2B Stock Sale for More Bitcoin Purchase appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|MARA|Maratho Digital,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-29 19:47:19

It Seems Another Altcoin Has Gained Investors’ Attention,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/are-ethereum-eth-and-tron-trx-the-best-cryptos-to-buy-in-2025-it-seems-another-altcoin-has-gained-investors-attention/,"Ethereum (ETH) and Tron (TRX) are the focal points of crypto-market dialogue, but out there are indicators the investor intention is suddenly changing. Ethereum Reclaims $2,000 But Faces Headwinds An astounding 65 million ETH owned by 21,460 addresses between $2,213 and $2,584 forms an extremely impressive supply wall. Nascent user engagement undermines its network effect, throwing doubt on durable growth. Tron, on the other hand, is finding it difficult to surpass the $0.25 resistance with the technical indicators showing signs of a possible trend reversal. In this environment, however, there is a new contender, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is flying under the radar in its upcoming presale. Ethereum’s Uphill Battle Ethereum maintains an appearance of strength above $2,000 despite fundamental issues hiding beneath the surface. User activity levels who took a plunge based on the -35.87% decrease in daily active addresses show evidence of low engagement. ETH’s ability to advance faces severe risk due to this market sell-off. The $2,213 to $2,584 holding concentration level functions as a supply barrier that may initiate sales if market prices reach this specific range. The crypto market analysis shows ETH remains confined to a price pattern that descends downward. A falling trendline breach remains the condition for avoiding a price drop below $1,850 until the upper barrier cracks. In the current scenario Ethereum follows a path of careful measures which reduces its appeal as a purchase for the year 2025. Tron’s Resistance Woes Tron had a hard time crossing the $0.25 barrier. The coin rose by 10% from recent local lows but runs into heavy resistance at this level. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator is weak, supporting the notion that the rally is unconvincing. Liquidation heatmaps also give us information about $0.25 being critical where for price potential reversals. With Relative Strength Index (RSI) sitting at a neutral 50, there is no clearly-defined momentum for TRX. Its near-term outlook is also murky unless it manages to break above $0.25 convincingly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Solution To DeFi Lending ETH and TRX are facing woes, but one asset is making strides: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project has presale funding of $5.7 million, with Phase 4 launching at $0.025 per token. Those who stake towards the next phase will watch their price surge 20% to $0.03 while those who got in early can relish instant profits. MUTM is set to list at $0.06 at launch, a 140% return from the current phase. Targets post launch already have higher upside, ranging from between $1 to $5 as predicted by its lending model and buy-pressure mechanics. Mutuum Finance is characterized by real-world utility Its noncustodial lending platform lets users earn passive income with mtTokens that rise in value as interest builds. Again, the project’s buy-and-distribution system also drives demand on relaying platform revenue back into the market to buy up MUTM tokens, creating consistent selling pressure. Security is a key focus, with a Certik audit in progress to confirm the reliability of smart contracts. A Limited-Time Opportunity The next phase will have a considerably higher buy-in. As the presale progresses, early investors can make a large return. MUTM is a high-potential asset with its structured tokenomics, practical DeFi applications, and aggressive post-launch targets. If Ethereum and Tron are too challenging, Mutuum Finance is a better choice. Given its presale success and innovative model, it has all the qualities needed to excel beyond established cryptos by 2025. For those eager to get in early, time is of the essence , Phase 4 will not run forever. As Ethereum (ETH) and Tron (TRX) face resistance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surges. Its presale has raised $5.7M, with Phase 4 at $0.025 before rising to $0.03. Early investors gain 2.4x before its $0.06 listing. With a Certik audit, buy-and-distribute mechanics, and mtToken utility, MUTM has strong fundamentals. Predictions place its value between $1 and $5 post-launch.

According to a new report by CNBC, Trump pardoned Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed on Thursday, nearly three years after they pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act by willfully failing to establish adequate anti-money laundering protocols. At the time, prosecutors accused the trio of operating BitMEX as if it were a “money laundering platform,” as instead of implementing typical Know Your Customer (KYC) verification standards, which are a set of regulations designed to certify a customer’s identity as a means of preventing crime. “From approximately 2014 through 2020, BitMEX allowed customers to access its platform and conduct derivative trading without appropriate customer due diligence – collecting only an email address and failing to verify customer identity.” Hayes, Delo and Reed received sentences of probation and were forced to pay tens of millions of dollars worth of fines. In July of last year, BitMEX itself – which was founded about a decade earlier – pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act as well. At the time, U.S. Attorney Damien Williams said that the crypto exchange’s antics were a danger to the US financial system. Said Williams, “BitMEX opened itself up as a vehicle for large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion schemes, posing a serious threat to the integrity of the financial system. [This] guilty plea indicates again the need for cryptocurrency companies to comply with US law if they take advantage of the US market.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Aave proved this early on by rolling out real DeFi lending. Cronos gained momentum through its deep connection with Crypto.com’s app and user base. Both succeeded by putting working products in people’s hands. Now BlockDAG is pushing that idea even further. Instead of waiting until mainnet, it’s put its Beta Testnet live for everyone to explore. That means users, developers, and buyers can test the network, offer feedback, and interact with the system before the official launch. In a market where seeing is believing, this move is giving BlockDAG a head start on trust. Aave: Leading the Charge in DeFi Lending Since launching in 2020, Aave has been one of the major forces behind DeFi adoption. It offered something simple but powerful—borrow and lend crypto without going through banks or middlemen. Users deposit tokens into liquidity pools to earn interest, and borrowers access those funds with smart contracts. Over time, Aave introduced features like flash loans, support for multiple chains, and new governance tools. By mid-2024, the platform had more than $11 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL)—a number that signals strong and steady usage. At one point in early 2025, AAVE reached nearly $400, thanks in part to backing from firms like World Liberty Financial. As of March 26, 2025, AAVE is trading at $188.72, with a market cap of around $2.85 billion. It’s clear that early users who trusted the protocol’s vision have seen real returns. Aave has delivered value by staying focused on what users need—and showing up with working tools. Cronos: Connecting Crypto.com with the DeFi World Launched by Crypto.com in November 2021, Cronos was built to bridge centralized services and the growing world of DeFi. It’s fast, inexpensive to use, and tightly integrated with the Crypto.com app, making it easy for users to transition from traditional finance into Web3. That accessibility helped Cronos rise quickly. By early 2025, the network had over 1 million users and supported more than 500 decentralized apps. As of March 26, 2025, CRO trades at $0.105981 with a market cap of nearly $2.82 billion. Looking ahead, analysts see CRO’s price fluctuating between $0.070 and $0.2644 this year—a wide range that shows both risk and opportunity. For early backers, the returns have varied. Some locked in gains during price spikes; others faced volatility. But what’s clear is that Cronos continues to play a key role in Crypto.com’s long-term vision of simplifying DeFi access. BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet Gives Buyers Something to See BlockDAG’s decision to launch a public Beta Testnet ahead of mainnet isn’t just about transparency—it’s about confidence. In an industry full of big claims and long timelines, giving people something real to explore sets a different tone. And with 2x the speed of its earlier alpha phase, plus tools like a no-code token/NFT builder and live dApps, BlockDAG is already showing its tech in action. That’s resonating with the market. Buyers aren’t just reading about BlockDAG—they’re watching it evolve in real time. The project has already raised $209 million in its ongoing presale, now in batch 27 with coins priced at $0.0248. Over 19 billion coins have been sold so far, and early adopters from batch 1 have seen a 2,380% return. There’s also a focus on real engagement. Weekly token vesting encourages people to interact with the network—and stress-test it under realistic conditions. Rather than wait to impress after mainnet, BlockDAG is welcoming scrutiny now. And that openness is helping build trust. Showing Results Before the Launch Aave earned its place with working DeFi tools. Cronos did it through reach and integration. Now BlockDAG is following a similar path—by giving users access before asking for hype. Its Beta Testnet isn’t a teaser; it’s a functioning platform meant to be explored and refined in the open. Instead of waiting for a polished mainnet, BlockDAG is saying: here’s what we’ve got—take a look, break it, build with it. That signals real intent. In a market where big promises often fall short, this kind of transparency might be exactly what users and buyers have been waiting for.

The platform had initially harboured plans to launch a US dollar pegged algorithmic stablecoin, but has now opted to instead develop an alternative that will be denominated in the United Arab Emirates dirham. The Sonic Labs co-founder had initially confirmed that the company was working on the dollar-pegged stablecoin, noting that the token would include an annual percentage rate (APR) of up to 23%. “POC looks good. Yielding > 200% APR @ 10m tvl, around 23.5% APR @ 100m, steady at around 4.9% at 1bn+. Will scale up and get the team for a full release,” Cronje said at the time. However, a week later, Cronje announced a change in the course, noting that the company would no longer be going ahead with the move, while announcing a different course of action. Sonic Labs announces shift to UAE dirham alternative In an X post on Friday, the Sonic Labs co-founder gave insight into the new kind of stablecoin the company is looking into. “We will no longer be releasing a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin. Completely unrelated, we will be releasing a mathematically bound numerical Dirham which is settled and denominated in USD, which is definitely not a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin,” his post on X read. We will no longer be releasing a USD based algorithmic stable coin. Completely unrelated, we will be releasing a mathematically bound numerical Dirham which is settled and denominated in USD, which is definitely not a USD based algorithmic stable coin. https://t.co/NlLsT5IqoE — Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) March 28, 2025 The shift in development is coming after the United Arab Emirates (UAE) announced the launch of its digital dirham central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the fourth quarter of 2025. Governor of the Central Bank of the UAE, Khaled Mohamed Balama, mentioned that the dirham will be based on a blockchain, enhance financial stability, and help combat financial crime. According to a report by Khaleej Times, the digital currency will be accepted alongside the physical currency across all payment channels. It’s also worth mentioning that there have been several criticisms from the crypto community over Sonic Labs’ plans to launch the algorithmic stablecoin. The model has been frowned upon in the crypto community since the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in 2022. Cronje also admitted to experiencing Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to algorithmic stablecoin. “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stablecoins today, but the previous cycle gave me so much PTSD, not sure if we should implement it,” Cronje said in a previous post. Terra ecosystem collapse and the need for caution The Terra ecosystem collapsed in 2022, erasing tens of billions of dollars in days. The platform’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), had been yielding over 20% worth of annual percentage yield (APY) on Anchor Protocol before the collapse. After the UST lost its peg, the token crashed seriously, stopping at around $0.30 at one point. After the depeg, Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon took to X to share his rescue plan while urging investors to be calm. During the same period, the platform’s native token, LUNA, which was in the top 10 crypto projects according to market capitalization, also lost 98% of its value, dropping to $0.84. As of early April 2022, the LUNA token had been trading at around $120. The collapse of the algorithmic stablecoin company sent shockwaves among investors, other firms, and lawmakers. Meanwhile, the European Union has come up with its Markets in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) regulation bill that will prohibit algorithmic stablecoins to avoid another catastrophic failure like Terra. CoinFund managing partner David Pakman has noted that stablecoins are now increasingly used for smaller and everyday payments, instead of large transfers. “We’ve seen a significant decrease in the size of each stablecoin transaction, which points to the fact that they are being used more as payments and less for large transfers,” Pakman said.

Bank of America Global Research says that Generation Z (those born roughly between 1997 to 2012) will become the “largest and richest generation by approximately 2035.” A large part of the growth in wealth will occur over the coming years. Between 2023 and 2040, Gen Z’s wealth is projected to skyrocket by around 720%, according to Bank of America. “It looks like Generation Z (Gen Z) is on the cusp of making its mark on the global economy. Not only is this group expected to be the largest cohort of the global population over the next 10 years at approximately 30%, but their income is also expected to surge. In roughly the next five years, Gen Z will have globally amassed $36 trillion in income and that figure is expected to surge to $74 trillion by around 2040.2 Consider that in 2023 it was just $9 trillion.” Within the Bank of America, credit and debit card data shows that growth in Gen Z’s spending per household is stronger than the overall population. And in general, Gen Z possesses “higher discretionary and necessity spending growth than the average consumer.” “Beyond income levels, Gen Z could also see the largest increase in spending. By 2030, their global spending is expected to reach $12.6 trillion compared to $2.7 trillion as of 2024. Thus, it’s likely they will be among the most disruptive generations to economies, markets and social systems. Whether it’s due to changing diets or reduced alcohol consumption or saving and housing, Gen Z will redefine what it means to be a US consumer.” While Bank of America says that Gen Zs are facing increasingly difficult labor market conditions, data shows that the emerging demographic group is witnessing higher wage growth compared to other generations. “In fact, using Bank of America deposit account data, we found wage growth for Gen Z was up nearly 8% year-on-year in February – the most among all generations – and about twice as high as the overall median. Part of this is because Gen Z job seekers largely are entering the labor market for the first time compared to other generations.” The economic prospects of Gen Z could be further by boosted by the Great Wealth Transfer, according to Bank of America. “BofA Global Research has noted that a huge transfer of wealth is expected as Baby Boomers pass down assets to younger generations, meaning that Gen Z and Millennials are increasingly likely to be making key spending and saving decisions.” The report on Gen Z’s wealth prospects was based on aggregated and anonymized transaction data from the Bank of America.

After showing signs of recovery, ETH faced strong selling pressure at this key level, preventing a sustained breakout and disappointing bullish traders who were hoping for further upside. Its inability to push past this resistance suggests that bears are still in control, keeping Ethereum’s price under pressure. With the momentum fading and the market sentiment turning cautious, traders are now closely watching key support zones to determine the next move. Bearish Pressure Mounts: What’s Next For Ethereum? Ethereum is facing increasing downside pressure as its latest recovery attempt was rejected at the $2,160 resistance level. The failed breakout has reinforced bearish sentiment, with key technical indicators signaling weakness. If buyers fail to step in, ETH could be at risk of deeper declines in the near term. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes Major Resistance At $2,100 As Analyst Reveals Bullish Price Range One of the major warning signs is weak volume during the recovery attempt. A strong breakout typically requires significant buying interest, but Ethereum’s rally lacked momentum, making it easier for sellers to regain control. This lack of conviction from bulls suggests that the upside move was not sustainable, allowing bears to push prices lower. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has broken down, moving below key thresholds that indicate weakening bullish strength. The current declining RSI shows that buying pressure is fading, making it difficult for Ethereum to build upward momentum. If the RSI continues trending downward, it could further confirm a prolonged bearish phase. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has also turned negative, with a breakdown below the signal line and a widening gap between the MACD and its moving average. This crossover indicates that bearish momentum is accelerating, reducing the chances of an immediate recovery. When combined with other bearish signals, the MACD breakdown further supports the case for a continued downside. Looking ahead, ETH may retest key support zones. However, a strong bounce from lower levels could offer bulls another chance to regain lost ground. For now, the charts suggest that Ethereum remains vulnerable to further declines. Support Levels To Watch: Can Bulls Prevent Further Decline? With attention now turning to key support levels, the first major support to watch is around $1,523, a level that previously acted as a short-term demand zone. If Ethereum holds above this area, it might provide bulls with a foundation for another rebound attempt. However, a break below this level could signal growing bearish dominance, increasing the risk of deeper losses. Related Reading: Ethereum Rally Incoming? Analyst Predicts Breakout Beyond $2,100 Below $1,523, the next key support lies at $902, aligning with previous price reactions and acting as a psychological level for traders.

Known as Bitcoin Jesus for his early advocacy of Bitcoin, Ver faces up to 109 years in prison on tax charges, including allegations of evading $48 million in taxes. Despite renouncing his U.S. citizenship in 2014 to avoid prosecution, Ver’s legal troubles resurfaced when he was arrested in Spain in 2024. But following the president’s earlier pardons of figures like Ulbricht and BitMEX co-founders, observers wonder whether Ver’s would catch a break. Is a pardon on the way, or will Ver’s legal troubles continue? Read on for a closer look. Table of Contents Crypto cronies Ver’s past The legal fight Will Bitcoin Jesus be pardoned? Crypto cronies After Trump embraced cryptocurrency, many crypto leaders rallied to support him by donating funds to his inauguration and hobnobbing at galas. Trump also , which industry brass celebrated. In return, Trump signed an order to stockpile tokens and swiftly acted in favor of the industry. Under Trump-appointed SEC chair Mark Uyeda, investigations into several cryptocurrency companies, including Immutable, Crypto.com, Ripple, and Coinbase, were dismissed. In a notable move on Thursday, March 27, Trump pardoned BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, who had pleaded guilty to federal charges related to money laundering and regulatory violations. The trio was convicted for failing to implement anti-money laundering measures at BitMEX, which prosecutors had labeled a “money laundering platform.” Reed had also violated the Bank Secrecy Act and paid a $10 million fine. But under Trump, it seems all is forgiven. This has sparked speculation on whether Ver, a prominent figure in the crypto world, could also receive the same courtesy. Ver, a Silicon Valley native with a libertarian streak, was deeply involved in the early days of cryptocurrency, investing in companies like Kraken, Ripple, and Blockchain.com. In 2017, Ver hyped Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) as more suitable for everyday payments. Roger Ver was there for me when I was down and needed help. Now Roger needs our support. No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes. Let him pay the tax (if any) and be done with it. #FreeRoger pic.twitter.com/flP573hm0N — Ross Ulbricht (@RealRossU) February 20, 2025 Ver’s past In 2000, by the age of 20, Ver began to participate in libertarian party debates. During these debates, he made critical statements about the agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, calling them “murderers” and referencing their involvement in the scandalous Waco Siege in which dozens of children were killed in a standoff between FBI and ATF agents and Branch Davidian cult followers. Ver didn’t know that ATF agents were present during these debates. In the 2000s, Ver became involved in e-commerce. On top of tech enterprises, Ver was selling firecrackers on eBay. After selling unlicensed firecrackers in 2001, he was charged and spent 10 months in prison. The fact that he was locked in jail instead of being fined or notified about the necessity of obtaining a license led Ver to think that the case was politically motivated and that his criticism of ATF was the real reason behind his prosecution. Without fear of further persecution, Ver left the U.S. after his post-prison probation ended. By 2011, Ver learned about Bitcoin and became one of its first investors. He also advocated for Bitcoin long before it went mainstream, with multi-million investments and national leaders talking about its importance for the future of their countries. The key points of Ver’s advocacy for Bitcoin were the financial freedom of individuals and the stopping of government and banks from interfering in people’s lives. The legal fight Since February 2014, Ver has been a citizen of Saint Kitts and Nevis. He claims that he had to renounce his U.S. citizenship after long-lasting targeting from the U.S. government. In April 2024, he was indicted and arrested in Spain on charges of U.S. tax evasion and mail fraud. Ver is accused of dodging $48 million in taxes after earning up to half a billion dollars through cryptocurrencies.

Allegedly , he sold his bitcoins in 2017 without notifying the financial attorneys. Ver clarifies that three charges of mail fraud (combined, punishable by 19 years behind bars) are based on the three letters with his tax returns he sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Ver denies he committed crimes such as tax evasion and mail fraud. He insists he was doing his best to comply with the nascent Bitcoin taxation rules, and that his prosecution was politically motivated. In December, he began his legal fight against the prosecution, denying all the charges. He filed a motion to dismiss charges, but the government rejected it in January. Ver’s legal team challenged an exit tax as “an unconstitutional burden on the fundamental right to expatriate.” For people like Ver, who have substantial amounts of low-liquidity assets, the exit tax may be prohibitive. The government suggests Ver is a fugitive. He disagrees with this status as he doesn’t hide and didn’t commit crimes for which he is judged while living in the U.S. On March 1, Ethereum’s Buterin published an X post arguing that the exit tax doesn’t exist in most other countries and called it the “tax-by-citizenship” and “extreme.” In addition, Buterin mentioned that the IRS obtained some of the information by intimidating Ver’s lawyers. The Ethereum founder added: “Genuine good faith mistakes should be treated by giving the actor the opportunity to pay back taxes if needed with interest and penalties, not with prosecution.” Going to prison for the rest of your life over non-violent tax offenses is absurd. The case against Roger seems very politically motivated; like with @RealRossU , there have been plenty of people and corporations who have been accused of far worse and yet faced sentences far… https://t.co/7G3zDkn2F2 — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) March 1, 2025 Will Bitcoin Jesus be pardoned? Trump promised to pardon Ross Ulbricht if get elected. Ulbricht, the man behind the Silk Road marketplace charged for money laundering and drug trafficking, is an important figure in the history of Bitcoin as his marketplace drove Bitcoin’s adoption. After the inauguration, Trump indeed pardoned Ulbricht to much acclaim. Soon, various crypto advocates began to urge Trump to pardon Roger Ver. On Jan. 21, 2025, following the pardon of Ross Ulbricht, an X influencer using the moniker Rothmus published a short post calling for the pardon of Ver to which Elon Musk replied : “will inquire.” This reply gave the community hope for the pardon of Bitcoin Jesus. https://twitter.com/Rothmus/status/1881536312710402268 On March 17, Marla Maples, Trump’s ex-wife, took to X to share a touching video where people who met Ver tell their stories of his generosity. It is not clear, though, if the POTUS paid attention to this post. Sharing more re the call to dismiss the prosecution against Roger Ver @PamBondi @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump @Davewarrington https://t.co/BckQwEXBW6 — marla maples (@itsmarlamaples) March 16, 2025 The hope for a pardon of Ver was seriously undermined on Jan. 26, when Elon Musk suddenly, via an X post, stated that Ver would not be pardoned because he gave up his U.S. citizenship. Roger Ver gave up his US citizenship. No pardon for Ver. Membership has its privileges. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 26, 2025 The statement drew much criticism, as Musk is not an elected official and cannot decide who to pardon and who not to. He is, however, Trump’s advisor and was a major donor to his “MAGA” campaign. More than that, the POTUS is not prohibited from pardoning non-U.S. citizens. Finally, many commented that Ver had to renounce his citizenship under pressure from ATF and a U.S. prison sentence. I missed this tweet. Another time I will publicly criticize Elon, hopefully for his own benefit. Because this is a terrible and wildly ignorant ""hot take"". 1) You don't need to be a citizen to get a pardon. 2) Ver was a citizen and specifically renounced his U.S. citizenship in… — Viva Frei (@thevivafrei) January 27, 2025 A few hours after Musk’s tweet, Ver took X to post a video in which he briefly explained why he was prosecuted and asked Trump for a pardon. In the video, Ver stated that he is American and that renouncing his citizenship was one of the “hardest and saddest decisions [he] ever made.” Mr. President, I am an American, and I need your help. Only you, with your commitment to justice, can save me @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/WhVTZ1M1GB — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 26, 2025 After Ulbricht, Hayes, Delo, and Reed received presidential pardons, others, including Angela McArdle, who currently serves as Chair of the national Libertarian Party, called for freeing Ver as well. “Let’s pray Roger Ver is next!” she declared on Friday. Let's pray Roger Ver is next! https://t.co/q2j4d6YryN — Angela McArdle (@RealAngelaMc) March 28, 2025 It remains to be seen whether Musk made skeptical comments over the possibility of Ver’s clemency on Trump’s behalf or if it was only his view of the situation. At last check Saturday, Trump hasn’t commented on Ver’s situation.
