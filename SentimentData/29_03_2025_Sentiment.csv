According to reports from the Khaleej Times , the CBDC will feature high security, tokenization, and smart contract integration, enabling instant settlements and multi-party transactions.

Additionally, the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has developed an integrated Digital Dirham platform and wallet, enabling retail, wholesale, and cross-border transactions. Stablecoin Adoption in the UAE The UAE’s journey toward a digital currency began in June 2024 with the rollout of a stablecoin regulatory framework , establishing licensing guidelines for Dirham-backed stablecoins . This triggered several major initiatives, including a push from Tether to issue an AED-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. On February 24, Circle received official authorization from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) to recognize and operate stablecoins, USDC and EURC, within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). However, as a sovereign-backed digital currency, the Digital Dirham stands to provide a higher level of security, regulatory oversight, and monetary authority than privately issued tokens. CBUAE governor Khaled Mohamed Balama claims the initiative will “substantially enhance financial stability, inclusion, resilience, and combatting financial crime” Long term, Blamam anticipates that Digital Dirham will “enable the development of innovative digital products, services, and new business models while reducing cost and increasing access to international markets.” A CBDC stands to see considerable adoption in the UAE, ranking first among the world’s “most crypto-obsessed countries” in 2025 , with a crypto ownership rate of 25.3%. Global Push for CBDCs The UAE is currently in the testing phase of its Digital Dirham, joining 43 other countries running pilot programs for their own Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Most notably, the European Central Bank is conducting a multi-year trial of the Digital Euro . Countries’ progress towards CBDCs. Source: CBDC Tracker . The UK is on track to establish its own regulatory framework for stablecoins by 2026, as outlined in a crypto roadmap published by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Most recently, US lawmakers proposed the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act on March 26 to advance stablecoin regulation.

Representatives of the London-based algorithmic market maker requested a meeting with the SEC Crypto Task Force on March 12, and got it on March 28. The request came through a letter from Morrison Cohen LLP’s crypto partner Jason Gottlieb to the task force chair Hester Peirce. The SEC did not specify who was in attendance from Wintermute’s side, but the request said that co-founders Evgeny Gaevoy and Marina Gurevich would be available in Washington on the day the meeting was held. The letter had a clearcut agenda England-based Wintermute’s letter referenced Peirce’s request for information (RFI) titled “There Must Be Some Way Out of Here” with irony, saying that many non-U.S. companies are looking for a way in. Wintermute observed: “To date, Wintermute has avoided opening an office in the United States, primarily out of fear of the previous administration’s arbitrary and capricious enforcement regime, but also because the rules and regulations for liquidity provision in the United States were incredibly unclear, leaving good actors outside the U.S. reticent to enter the U.S. markets.” Gaevoy disclosed plans in a Bloomberg interview in February for Wintermute would open a U.S. office. The SEC acknowledged that Wintermute’s questions were discussed in the meeting between them, but it did not disclose the results of those discussions. The letter suggested a ten-point agenda for the meeting that addressed four of Peirce’s questions in her RFI, jurisdictional issues, market-making best practices and “How the Commission can advance these best practices within the scope of its statutory remit.” The SEC is changing So, the sides presumably spoke about determining the security status of crypto assets, trading and market structure challenges to providing liquidity to tokenized securities, order execution obligations and monitoring crypto markets using open-source data. Furthermore, the letter wanted the sides to address why the definition of dealer in the 1934 Exchange Act does not apply to liquidity providers in crypto and whether the SEC has the authority to challenge market manipulation. The firm watched the SEC suit against Cumberland DRW closely, the letter said. That firm was sued for allegedly selling unregistered securities. The definition of a dealer was one of the points the SEC used in that case. The suit was filed in October and dismissed on March 4. Cumberland claimed that it had been in talks with the SEC for five years when the suit was filed. Peirce’s RFI/statement “There Must Be Some Way Out of Here” was released on Feb. 25 and posed 48 questions across ten topics. “Greater crypto clarity requires the public’s input,” Peirce wrote. The task force itself was announced on Jan. 21 to help the commission with registration, regulation, disclosure and similar issues. “To date, the SEC has relied primarily on enforcement actions to regulate crypto retroactively and reactively,” the agency admitted in the announcement of the new task force. Acting chair of the SEC Mark Uyeda has promised to change the SEC’s methods, after the industry claimed for years that it was being treated unfairly and arbitrarily by the agency.

42556063,https://cryptonews.com/?p=345950,1743202784,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/42556063.jpeg,Telegram Embraces Pi Network – Can It Reverse the Downtrend?,https://cryptonews.com/news/telegram-embraces-pi-network-can-it-reverse-the-downtrend/,"Pi has gone up by nearly 1% and it is currently defying the market’s overall downturn after the token was integrated with the official crypto wallet of the instant messaging platform Telegram. This could be a pivotal moment for this blockchain project as PI will now be easily accessible to Telegram’s 1 billion monthly active users (MAUs). The Pi community expects that, once the market regains its strength, this announcement could help reverse the downtrend that PI has experienced since its mainnet became publicly accessible in February this year. However, top crypto exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Coinbase have refused to list the token as Pi has failed to pass their requirements for layer-one blockchains. Since the public mainnet went live, the market value of the project has dropped by two-thirds from its peak of around $18 billion. However, Pi is still the 24th largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $5.6 billion. PI Stalls as Telegram Support News Fails to Excite the Market The hourly chart shows that Pi sellers took a breather yesterday and managed to push the price above its upper trend line. However, the market quickly rejected that move once it hit the $0.90 level and it has already dropped by nearly 8% from that level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits below the signal line, indicating that bears still have the upper hand despite a recent uptick in Pi’s price. Additionally, the price has formed a lower high at the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, suggesting the recent rally may be losing steam and that another drop could be on the horizon. However, the MACD tells a different story—negative momentum has been steadily fading, hinting that a potential shift in sentiment may be underway. Given these conflicting indicators, traders will need to wait for a clearer signal before confirming whether Pi’s price will continue higher or resume its downtrend. The key resistance to watch remains at $0.87; a decisive break above this level would suggest a continuation of the uptrend. Conversely, a drop below $0.81 would confirm a bearish reversal and could open the door for a retest of $0.70 in the near term. While Pi’s post-launch price action has been underwhelming, early traction from MIND of Pepe (MIND) during its presale suggests strong upside potential for the AI agent coin once it hits exchanges. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Raises $7.7M to Launch its Powerful AI Agent Just a month and a half after its presale event kicked off, MIND of Pepe (MIND) has managed to raise more than $7.7 million for its AI agent. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme, this AI agent will take over social media platforms like X by storm. MIND of Pepe is designed to engage in meaningful conversations with high-profile X accounts to discuss topics associated with meme coins and the crypto market. Throughout these interactions. MIND of Pepe will collect insightful information that it will pass on to token holders so they can better navigate these challenging market conditions and profit from the most appealing opportunities in the meme coin space. To invest in $MIND, simply head to the MIND of Pepe website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to make your investment.

Starting as a presale less than a year ago, it has quickly become a leading decentralized Layer 1 project. With $208 million secured in under 10 months without venture capital support, BlockDAG’s swift ascent is grounded not only in excitement but also in reliability, consistent outcomes, and a flawlessly executed roadmap. With the mainnet launch approaching and a community approaching one million, BlockDAG is delivering on its commitments and setting new standards for what early supporters of cryptocurrency initiatives can anticipate. The Presale That Caught Everyone’s Eye BlockDAG’s presale was more than just funding—it was a revolution. The project gained early traction by shunning venture capital influence and unclear promises, presenting a clear and achievable vision instead. At a time when many crypto projects promise more than they deliver, BlockDAG has changed the narrative. This approach drew an enthusiastic response, enabling a swift raise of $208 million. This funding was not just money—it represented a global endorsement of BlockDAG’s vision for a scalable, secure, and decentralized future. As CEO Antony Turner stated, “This funding is not just money—it’s the driving force behind innovation, growth, and the next wave of blockchain technology.” Indeed, these resources have been pivotal in developing a solid infrastructure, including core protocol development, team expansion, and forming major partnerships with entities like Inter Milan and UFC. Each step demonstrates BlockDAG’s commitment to enduring, impactful change in the blockchain domain. Groundbreaking Technology in Action BlockDAG stands out not merely for its fundraising or its buzz but for its groundbreaking technology. From its inception, the team has adopted a hybrid architecture that combines the rapidity and scalability of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with the robust security and decentralization features of Proof-of-Work (PoW). CTO Jeremy Harkness highlighted, “Our hybrid consensus mechanism merges the best of both domains… we are essentially rewriting the playbook.” This fusion facilitates concurrent transaction processing, significantly lowering fees and easing network congestion while ensuring top-tier security. Moreover, BlockDAG has focused on making its technology accessible to all. The introduction of the X1 Miner App and the TG Tap Miner Game has welcomed over a million newcomers to the ecosystem, including many who had never before engaged with cryptocurrency. Mining has shifted from a niche activity for technological insiders to an accessible tap-and-earn model available via Telegram and mobile devices. This approach to user engagement through gaming has transformed the scene—over 400,000 users engage with TG Tap Miner daily, and upwards of 750,000 utilize the X1 App for mining. BlockDAG demonstrates that involvement in the crypto world isn’t limited to developers or traditional miners. The advancements continue beyond mere applications and technological features. The Beta Testnet V1 has been launched, delivering enhanced performance, improved explorers, and even tools that allow users to create tokens and NFTs without coding skills. This isn’t just a demonstration; it’s an interactive platform where users can experiment with genuine features before the mainnet launch, complete with weekly incentives. Additionally, the initial batches of BlockDAG’s ASIC hardware miners—the X30 and X100 —are being distributed to early users, with expectations to deploy nearly 10,000 units before the mainnet’s official release. This represents real progress, not just promises. Precision and Trust Shape the Future As BlockDAG approaches its mainnet debut later this year, the excitement is palpable. The initial launch will support at least 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), with plans to expand capacity to 15,000 TPS post-launch. From the outset, it will offer DeFi applications including staking, lending, swaps, and cross-chain bridges, complemented by governance tools that enhance community involvement. Yet, this is merely the start. The vision for BlockDAG extends beyond the initial launch. Efforts are underway to cultivate a robust developer community through initiatives like grants, worldwide hackathons, and a forthcoming bug bounty program. The BlockDAG Academy is equipping a new generation of Web3 developers, offering courses that cover everything from basic principles to complex smart contract programming. Aiming to support over 1,000 decentralized applications by 2026 in diverse fields such as finance, gaming, identity, and healthcare, BlockDAG is committed to sustained growth. Security is also a critical focus. The blockchain has been rigorously audited by both Certik and Halborn, and its architecture incorporates Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and DAG-based parallel processing to guarantee robustness and continuous service. As Chief Security Officer Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj puts it, “Security is not just a feature—it is the foundation of our entire platform.” From Vision to Reality in a Single Year BlockDAG’s evolution from an under-the-radar presale to a soon-to-launch mainnet leader showcases the power of reliable execution. In an industry often mired in empty promises and speculation, BlockDAG has chosen a path of integrity—consistently developing, delivering, and expanding. Featuring a novel hybrid DAG + PoW architecture, comprehensive adoption tools, and educational initiatives, it’s evident that BlockDAG is not just riding the crypto trend. It is actively forging the future of decentralized systems. With the mainnet release imminent, BlockDAG has already demonstrated that it’s not merely dreaming of what’s next—it’s actively constructing it.

This surging confidence signals a seismic shift in the XRP landscape, amplifying anticipation within digital asset markets. XRP ETF Speculation Heats Up As Regulatory Landscape Evolves The crypto market is buzzing with anticipation as Polymarket bettors have assigned an 85% probability to approving an XRP ETF in 2025. If these market predictions hold, this could mark a transformative moment for XRP , opening the floodgates for institutional capital and reshaping its role in the broader financial ecosystem. The Polymarket bettors’ growing confidence in an XRP ETF approval follows the success of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which have significantly boosted liquidity and institutional participation in the crypto space. As regulatory clarity around digital assets improves, many analysts believe that altcoins like XRP could be next in line for ETF approval. Given its unique positioning as a bridge currency for cross-border payments and Ripple’s ongoing engagement with financial institutions, an XRP ETF could bring unprecedented exposure to the asset. A key factor driving Polymarket bettors’ speculation is the evolving regulatory landscape. Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC provided a clearer framework for XRP’s classification, reducing uncertainty around its legal status. If the SEC continues to approve ETFs beyond Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) , XRP is a strong contender, given its utility, liquidity, and market demand. An XRP ETF approval would have far-reaching implications for the token’s price and adoption. Institutional investors who have previously hesitated due to regulatory concerns may enter the market, increasing liquidity and potentially driving up prices. Moreover, a regulated XRP ETF would simplify access for mainstream investors, reinforcing its legitimacy as a digital asset.

XRP ETF Speculation Gains Momentum As Investors Eye WallitIQ (WLTQ) For High-Yield Opportunities Polymarket bettors continue to drive attention toward the XRP ETF narrative, fueling expectations for a 2025 approval. As regulatory winds shift, XRP finds itself at the epicenter of ETF speculation, with Polymarket bettors reinforcing bullish sentiment. The prospect of an XRP ETF remains a focal point for institutional players, signaling a potential market inflection.

As the story notes, Pepe has experienced some notable peaks in the past. Its entire market value was $1.6 billion in 2023. It reached an even greater $11 billion in December 2024. These whales may be feeling more confident as a result of their previous performance. More People Are Holding Pepe The number of people holding the meme coin has also gone up recently. Reports indicate that 542 new Pepe holders appeared in March 2025. While the number of people holding Pepe for a long time has decreased, the fact that new investors are coming in, combined with the whales’ buying activity, suggests there might be some renewed interest in the coin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Set For 10x Surge? Elon Musk’s Anime X Post Sparks Hype Some believe that this whale buying frenzy may be signaling that the price of Pepe may rise once more. They recall the way the price skyrocketed earlier, driven by internet hype. The only question is if this is just a temporary rise in price, or if Pepe may again experience a big spike like last time. It’s worth remembering that cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins such as Pepe, can be extremely volatile. What the big investors do may at times provide a clue as to where the market is heading, but it isn’t a promise. People need to exercise caution and carry out their own research before doing anything about buying or selling.

BlockDAG is changing that. With the introduction of the X1 Miner App and powerful ASIC miners like the X30 and X100, BlockDAG (BDAG) is democratizing profitable mining, making it fun and accessible for the average person. Whether you’re mining on your smartphone or using a user-friendly ASIC device at home, BlockDAG’s strategy is paving the way for widespread adoption in the cryptocurrency sphere. Welcome to the future of mining—effortless, social, and incredibly rewarding. Mobile Mining Made Easy with the X1 App At the core of BlockDAG’s mining revolution is the highly acclaimed X1 Miner App , which has attracted over 750,000 users globally. This app enables any smartphone to become a mining hub without consuming excessive battery or necessitating costly equipment. Featuring a gamified experience, daily rewards for engagement, and a straightforward interface, the X1 App eliminates the complexities that have traditionally barred ordinary people from mining. Antony Turner, the CEO of BlockDAG, highlighted the app’s impact during Keynote 3: “To date, we have over 750,000 users mining, earning, and engaging with us.” These figures are testament to the app’s success. By making mining a simple tap-and-earn activity accessible right from your pocket, BlockDAG has simplified the entry into the mining domain. More than just user-friendly—it’s about making financial engagement in blockchain technology available to those who were previously excluded. Whether you are a student, a stay-at-home parent, or just starting to explore, mining with BlockDAG is now as straightforward as using a fitness app or playing a game on your phone. TG Tap Miner on Telegram Transforms Mining into Social Gaming BlockDAG has revolutionized mining by blending it with social networking via TG Tap Miner , a play-to-earn game on Telegram that has quickly become a sensation. With over 400,000 registrations and 100,000 active players daily, TG Tap Miner combines fun with genuine rewards, turning mining into a shared and engaging pursuit. Instead of a lone, technical activity, BlockDAG has made mining a collective experience. Gamers mine virtual assets, complete tasks, and earn real BDAG coins, all within one of the most popular messaging apps. This approach shifts away from the traditional view of mining as an isolated operation with loud machines in secluded spaces. Now, it’s about fun, sharing, and integration into daily digital activities. BlockDAG is not merely adding a gaming layer to mining; it is transforming perceptions by melding enjoyment with economic opportunities, inviting newcomers without the need for deep technical knowledge or significant financial outlay. Unveiling the X30 & X100 ASIC Miners: High-Efficiency Mining Made Simple While focusing on mobile-driven growth, BlockDAG also caters to the dedicated users with the X30 and X100 ASIC miners. Designed specifically for BlockDAG’s hybrid consensus mechanism that merges a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with Proof-of-Work (PoW), these devices deliver top-tier performance suited to BlockDAG’s scalable system, supporting simultaneous block validations while maintaining network safety and decentralization. Antony Turner, during Keynote 3, revealed that nearly 10,000 ASIC miners are set to be distributed prior to the mainnet launch: “We have begun shipping our initial batch of miners to early adopters… By the time our mainnet is operational, we will have delivered around 10,000 ASIC miners to our community.” These units are built for energy efficiency and simplicity, allowing anyone to begin mining quickly after unboxing. This approach prioritizes accessibility, redefining the miner’s role in 2025. The X30 and X100 are not just equipment—they are gateways to a burgeoning ecosystem where all users can engage with and benefit from blockchain technology. Together with the mobile tools, these ASIC miners position BlockDAG as the only network providing a comprehensive mining experience for both casual users and dedicated enthusiasts. The New Era of Inclusive Mining with BlockDAG BlockDAG is demonstrating that crypto mining doesn’t need to be exclusive, costly, or complex. With the X1 Miner App and TG Tap Miner game lowering entry barriers for casual users, and the X30/X100 ASIC machines enabling high-performance mining at home, BlockDAG is establishing a diverse ecosystem accessible to all. By merging modern technology with user-friendliness, BlockDAG isn’t just participating in blockchain’s evolution—it’s leading it. As the mainnet launch nears and user adoption grows, it’s evident that BlockDAG is pushing mining into the mainstream, making the future of blockchain more inclusive than ever.

But this time, it’s not just about internet laughs and viral tweets—today’s leading meme coins are offering actual use cases, long-term plans, and economic models that reward holding. The game has changed, and the next wave of meme tokens is playing to win. One project that’s blazing ahead is Dragoin ($DDGN) . As others are still warming up, Dragoin is making serious progress through its structured presale, active community, and upcoming decentralization. If you’re on the hunt for the best long-term meme coin to buy in Q2 2025 , this one demands your attention. Alongside it, Cheems and MEMEX are also gaining traction, each with a different strategy for growth. Dragoin Is Gearing Up for a Major Q2 Breakout Dragoin isn’t following the typical meme coin script. It’s rewriting it. Built on Ethereum, Dragoin brings something rare to the space: a live, interactive game hosted directly on Telegram. Players hatch, train, and battle dragons—and earn $DDGN tokens while doing it. This isn’t just another hold-and-hope coin. It gets users involved from day one. And then there’s the presale: split across 25 phases, each with a small price bump, encouraging early buying while maintaining a steady pace. Half of the total 200 billion $DDGN tokens are locked into this presale—and whatever doesn’t sell in each round gets permanently burned. This burn mechanic is huge. It reduces supply as demand grows, especially with the global game launch planned for Q2. While other meme coins flood the market with tokens, Dragoin is tightening the flow and building a loyal base—two forces that could drive long-term gains. Once the presale wraps up, Dragoin goes full community mode. The team will renounce control of the smart contract, leaving the project fully decentralized. That’s a big deal in a space where many tokens still operate with central oversight. With staking, referrals, airdrops, and big exchange listings lined up for Q2 and Q3, Dragoin has all the elements for a major run. It’s got the memes, the mechanics, and the market energy. This isn’t just hype—it’s built to fly. Cheems Tries a Comeback With Fresh Features Cheems has been around for a while—and it’s still got bite. The beloved “doge with a lisp” meme is now pivoting in a more purposeful direction. In Q2, Cheems is rolling out staking rewards and charitable partnerships aimed at giving it a more serious edge. What’s keeping it alive is the fan base. Through contests, community events, and creator tie-ins, Cheems still rallies its supporters. But the big question is whether nostalgia can carry it through this more competitive cycle. With investors demanding more than just memes, Cheems needs to show it can innovate. For now, it may offer quick upside—but its long-term power will depend on what comes next. MEMEX Offers an “All-in-One” Meme Investment MEMEX is doing something different—combining multiple meme coins into one token. Think of it as a meme coin index fund. For those who want exposure to the meme market without tracking every trend, MEMEX offers a simplified route. Its dynamic rebalancing and algorithmic tracking take the guesswork out of investing. You don’t have to jump from token to token—MEMEX does that for you. While it might not have the viral punch of Dragoin or the fan love of Cheems, it gives investors a balanced, lower-risk way to ride the meme wave. MEMEX is ideal for those who want in on the action but don’t want to bet everything on a single coin. Meme Coins With Real Utility Are Set to Dominate Q2 Q2 is shaping up to favor meme coins that actually do something. As the crypto market welcomes fresh liquidity and an influx of new users, tokens with built-in use cases, community control, and strong roadmaps are taking center stage. Dragoin checks every box. It’s got a presale that fuels excitement, a burn model that cuts supply, and a game that drives demand. It’s not asking you to just hold—it’s asking you to play, earn, and grow with it. Cheems is fighting to evolve, and MEMEX brings safety through diversification. But when it comes to the best long-term meme coin to buy in Q2 2025 , Dragoin is the frontrunner. The stages are filling fast, the game is coming soon, and the buzz is only growing louder. Get ready—Dragoin could be the meme coin breakout of the year.

The transaction was announced on Friday, and Elon posted on X that the two companies’ futures are now “intertwined.” The value of xAI in the deal was set at $80 billion, and both companies are now under the same structure. The move combines the infrastructure, user data, compute power, and software teams behind each business. “Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,” Elon wrote on Friday. “X is the digital town square where more than 600M active users go to find the real-time source of ground truth and, in the last two years, has been transformed into one of the most efficient companies in the world, positioning it to deliver scalable future growth.” Musk connects X and xAI to expand control The merger brings together two private companies that were already overlapping. Elon said the combination would “unlock immense potential” by joining xAI’s advanced AI capability with X’s massive reach. The two were already linked through Grok, the chatbot developed by xAI that’s available inside X. Elon bought Twitter for $44 billion at the end of 2022, after months of legal threats, court battles, and chaotic filings. He cut staff aggressively, scrapped content moderation systems, killed ad partnerships, and renamed the company X. He later brought in Linda Yaccarino, formerly an ad exec, as CEO. On Friday, Linda posted, “The future could not be brighter.” xAI was launched less than two years ago with a goal to “understand the true nature of the universe.” But the company’s real function has been trying to compete with OpenAI, the company Elon helped co-found in 2015. He left OpenAI after disagreements over its direction, and since then, has taken aim at CEO Sam Altman both online and in court. Grok, Colossus, and government power moves Since its launch, xAI has focused on large language models and generative AI tools. It has been positioning itself as a rival to OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Meta, and other companies with billion-dollar AI divisions. Grok, the chatbot Elon launched inside X, was developed by xAI and built using real-time access to X’s user data. Last year, xAI was valued at around $50 billion during a funding round. In early 2025, Bloomberg reported that the company was trying to raise money at a $75 billion valuation. For comparison, OpenAI was near closing a raise that would push its value to $260 billion, and rival Anthropic was just valued at $61.5 billion. While running Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and X, Elon has also taken up a new job in Washington with D.O.G.E after donating $270 million to Donald Trump and Republican campaigns during the 2024 election. This isn’t the first time Elon has merged two of his own companies. In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity, a solar company founded by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive, in a $2.6 billion deal. At the time, Elon was chairman of the board at both companies. Shareholders sued, accusing him of using Tesla’s money to save a failing company he was personally tied to. The case dragged on for years, with accusations that the SolarCity deal violated fiduciary duty and benefited Elon more than Tesla shareholders. But a Delaware court ruled in favor of Elon and let the deal go through without requiring him to pay anything back to Tesla. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Public forums and expert reviews may reshape enforcement methods. Lawmakers push for clearer guidelines on stablecoins and digital assets. Internal debates reveal evolving priorities in oversight. Global tax ideas could alter market behavior. U.S. crypto regulation developments accelerated this week as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) scheduled new public roundtables and Congress introduced a stablecoin bill to address mounting calls for regulatory clarity. This edition of Weekly Crypto Regulation News Roundup also covers Ripple’s settlement with the SEC, a split vote on a high-profile enforcement case involving Elon Musk, and a proposal in the UK to tax crypto transactions. Here’s a breakdown of this week’s key developments. SEC to Host Four Additional Crypto Roundtables In a move toward increased public engagement, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force announced plans to host four additional public roundtables in Washington, D.C., this spring. U.S. lawmakers have introduced the STABLE Act, seeking to formalize stablecoin regulation with clearer transparency and oversight rules. Companion bills like the GENIUS Act also advance. #StablecoinRegulation #USCrypto https://t.co/W9S9aN51T5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 27, 2025 The initiative seeks to collect industry input on digital asset regulation and promote more transparent dialogue between regulators and crypto stakeholders. The decision follows criticism that the SEC has leaned too heavily on enforcement actions without providing clear compliance guidance. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda, who formed the Crypto Task Force in January, stated that the agency intends to “draw clear regulatory lines, provide realistic paths to registration, craft sensible disclosure frameworks, and deploy enforcement resources judiciously.” The scheduled roundtables indicate the SEC could be shifting toward a more collaborative approach to crypto oversight, a notable change from its previous enforcement-first posture. SEC Launches Crypto 2.0 Task Force for Enhanced Oversight Alongside its public outreach, the SEC also introduced a new enforcement initiative: Crypto 2.0. SEC’s Crypto 2.0 Task Force targets on-chain and off-chain transactions, aiming to enforce compliance and protect investors in the digital asset space. #CryptoRegulation #SEC https://t.co/0aH1lqLZc1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 24, 2025 This effort includes the formation of a Presidential Task Force on Cryptocurrency, which seeks to increase oversight of both on-chain and off-chain digital asset transactions. A central focus is to apply the same trade reporting standards used in traditional securities to crypto activity, particularly off-chain trades. To support this, the SEC is building a Digital Asset Reporting and Tracking System (DART) to monitor crypto transactions across various platforms. By improving transparency in digital asset ownership and boosting compliance, the agency appears to be strengthening its position on regulating the sector. While the SEC sharpened its focus on digital asset enforcement, Congress also moved forward on the legislative front. Stablecoin Rules Advance as Congress Introduces STABLE Act On March 26, Representatives Bryan Steil and French Hill brought forward the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act. U.S. lawmakers have introduced the STABLE Act, seeking to formalize stablecoin regulation with clearer transparency and oversight rules. Companion bills like the GENIUS Act also advance. #StablecoinRegulation #USCrypto https://t.co/W9S9aN51T5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 27, 2025 The bill would create a clear regulatory framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, requiring issuers to follow strict financial rules, maintain transparent records, and uphold consumer protections. This push comes amid heightened scrutiny over the systemic risks of unregulated stablecoins. With stablecoins playing a role in payments and remittances, lawmakers are emphasizing the need for oversight to reduce financial instability. The bipartisan support behind the STABLE Act suggests it could become a foundation for broader digital asset legislation. Ripple Settlement and SEC Division Mark Key Enforcement Shifts In related crypto regulation news, Ripple reached a settlement with the SEC , ending a years-long legal dispute. @Ripple settles with the @SECGov , agreeing to pay a $50M penalty and dropping its cross-appeal, marking the near conclusion of a long-standing lawsuit. #SEC #Crypto #Ripple https://t.co/txqDDCnn0G — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 25, 2025 The company agreed to pay a $50 million penalty and will withdraw its cross-appeal in the ongoing XRP lawsuit. Originally facing a $125 million penalty, Ripple’s reduced fine marks a more favorable outcome. The SEC also intends to lift an injunction blocking Ripple from selling XRP to institutional investors, signaling that the case may soon conclude. Meanwhile, in a separate high-profile matter, Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda was reportedly the only commissioner to vote against suing Elon Musk over delayed disclosures related to stock purchases in X. Acting Chair of the SEC, Mark Uyeda, allegedly was the only commissioner who voted against suing Elon Musk earlier this month. #MarkUyeda #ElonMusk https://t.co/FynEouEeRv — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 24, 2025 According to a Reuters report, the SEC’s five-member commission held a closed-door vote, with four commissioners supporting legal action. Uyeda’s dissent highlights internal divisions within the agency and may reflect a broader shift toward a more measured enforcement strategy—especially as Uyeda continues reshaping the SEC’s crypto oversight policies. UK Considers Stamp Duty on Crypto Transactions Outside the U.S., regulatory discussions also continued in the United Kingdom. Lisa Gordon, Chair of UK investment bank Cavendish, suggested that a stamp duty be applied to cryptocurrency transactions. Gordon, who has held non-executive roles at major financial institutions, warned that the increase in crypto investments among British citizens raised concerns. She argued that taxing crypto trades could help direct retail investment toward shares and other traditional assets. The suggestion comes as the UK government continues shaping its crypto regulatory framework and could influence future digital asset tax policy. With global regulators taking new steps, the coming months will shape how digital asset policies develop.

He is also open to negotiations that could potentially reduce the new taxes planned for next week, yet he does not expect deals before April 2. Trump told reporters , “I’m certainly open to that, if we can do something, we can get something for it,” Still, he warned that any agreement would happen “probably after” the tariffs take effect, adding that the United States has “been taken advantage of for 40 years, maybe more.” Trump plans to unveil his reciprocal tariff program on Wednesday. He says it will include strong measures to match other countries’ trade barriers and boost U.S. manufacturing. S Specific details remain unclear, with conflicting statements on whether the new tariffs will replace or add to existing taxes on targeted goods. This week, he announced a 25 percent duty on automobiles on top of any country-specific levies. The president suggested that pharmaceutical imports would be next. “It’ll be a certain number that will be enough to get the drugs and the pharmaceutical companies to bring in their product into our country. We never want to have to rely on other countries for that, like we did in Covid,” Trump said. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

On-chain data shows a decrease in Bitcoin demand, with short-term holders experiencing losses while long-term holders take profits. GameStop follows Strategy's lead by adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves. BTC/USD is in a bearish trend, with key support levels around 82133, 80000, and 78197 and resistance levels at 88000, 90000, and 91804. By Zain Vawda Bitcoin prices had been enjoying a relatively calm week with modest gains before a selloff today that is threatening support at the 85000 handle. The recent optimism in the market has quickly disappeared as selling picks up again. Shaken by renewed market swings and economic uncertainty, many are selling their investments, which could extend the current market downturn. Is another period of tariff induced volatility ahead? Tuesday's K33 Research report, ""Ahead of the Curve,"" noted that the market is currently calm but could become more volatile as it reacts to new tariff announcements. The report says this calm might last until April 2, when the U.S. President Donald Trump is set to announce major reciprocal tariffs. This announcement could become a big market event, sparking activity in both crypto and traditional markets, similar to the big moves seen after Canadian and Mexican tariff news earlier this year. If Trump softens his approach, markets might go up. If he stays unclear, both buyers and sellers could face volatility. If he takes a tough stance, markets could drop sharply, like they have after past tariff announcements. BTC/USD vs Tariff Headlines Source: K33 Research “In a back-and-forth situation, the market could look like it did in February and early March, when tariffs were the main focus. The US economy is still strong but is expected to slow down because of tariffs — a risk that most economists have already factored in,” says an analyst from K33. On Wednesday, President Trump announced a 25% tariff on car imports starting April 3, along with the long-awaited tariffs on the US’ biggest trade partners. “If these countries retaliate, it could bring more uncertainty to an already unstable global trade situation,” says an analyst from QCP Capital. It will be interesting to gauge the reaction of crypto markets to tariffs imposed on April 2. One wonders whether the market will react in a similar vein as in the past. Other factors such as demand and supply might play a role as well. Glassnode - The week on-chain - Demand side wanes Demand is still fairly low right now, with Bitcoin's price moving up and down within a new trading range around $85k. One way to measure demand is by looking at the amount of profit and loss investors are locking in. This helps us understand the selling activity happening in spot markets. We can understand this through two main ideas: Capital Inflows: This happens when new money enters the market, with a buyer paying more for a coin than what the seller originally paid (creating a realized profit). Capital Destruction: This happens when someone sells at a loss (realized loss), and a new buyer gets the coin for less than its original price. This metric shows the difference between the price a seller is willing to accept and the price a buyer is willing to pay. Currently, the total realized profit and loss has dropped significantly since the $109k peak, falling from $3.4B to $508M (-85%). This is similar to levels seen during the 2024 accumulation phase when Bitcoin was between $50k and $70k (which is a good sign), indicating similar demand. Most of the losses are coming from Short-Term Holders, who are newer buyers and more likely to have bought at higher prices. The recent unpredictable and volatile market has been tough for these new investors. On the other hand, most of the profits are being taken by Long-Term Holders, who have been in the market longer and are still in a profitable position. Source: Glassnode Short-Term Holders are currently facing significant unrealized losses (paper losses), some of the largest in this cycle. However, these losses are still within the higher range of what’s been seen in most past bull markets. This means that while investors are feeling noticeable financial pressure, it’s not unusual or unexpected for a bull market trend. GameStop follows Strategy, Sayler approves This week, GameStop (GME), a US video game retailer, announced on Tuesday that it has updated its investment policy to include Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves. The following day, the company shared plans to raise $1.3 billion by offering senior convertible notes with 0% interest to private investors. GameStop is following the lead of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) or Strategy as they are now called, which recently bought 6,911 BTC for $584.1 million. Strategy now holds 506,137 BTC, purchased for $33.7 billion at an average price of $66,608 per Bitcoin, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. This move is part of a growing trend of companies adopting Bitcoin, encouraged by US President Donald Trump’s recent executive order to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve using government-held tokens. As of February 1, GameStop has $4.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. ETF flows Bitcoin ETF flows have remained steady since mid-March with spot Bitcoin ETFs having seen consistent inflows. Over the past two weeks inflows have reached nearly 1 billion dollars. This also comes as Gold ETF flows have recently surpassed Bitcoin ETF flows. To read more about this, read: Gold Price Outlook: ETF Flows, Central Bank Buying, and XAU/USD Price Targets . Is this the start of a broader market shift and risks continue to rise in global markets and money managers look to reduce risk exposure? Technical analysis - BTC/USD Bitcoin USD (BTC/USD) from a technical standpoint on the daily timeframe remains in a bearish trend. A daily candle close above the 90000 handle will be needed for a change in structure and this remains some distance away at present. As things stand, Bitcoin has slipped below the 200-day MA and the 85000 handle, if the daily candle closes below both it could signal further downside. Looking at the bigger picture and the longer the price remains within the range of 78000-90000 when a breakout finally occurs it could be an aggressive one. The fundamentals may still support further upside but the uncertainties presented by the geopolitical situation and tariff impact may continue to keep BTC/USD on the back foot.

Enter Qubetics (TICS), a fast-rising project positioned to disrupt how the internet works with decentralized virtual private network (dVPN) capabilities. At the heart of this movement is the ongoing Qubetics presale , which has been quietly gaining massive traction. Priced now at just $0.1300, with earlier phases already gone, the countdown is on. With every new stage comes a 10% price hike, and each stage only lasts seven days. This isn’t hype — it’s how markets work when demand rises and access tightens. Qubetics doesn’t just fit the mold of the Top Crypto Assets , it’s on track to redefine it. Qubetics dVPN Presale: Don’t Miss What You Missed Before Qubetics had a moment — and you probably missed it. In its earliest whitelist phase, the project offered zero-upfront investment opportunities. Those who signed up early received exclusive notifications and access to the presale at just $0.01. That phase is long gone, as are the early sub-$0.05 rounds. And yet, the door hasn’t closed. The project is now in its 27th presale stage with a price of $0.1300. Each round brings a 10% jump. But here’s the kicker — compared to future value projections, it’s still a bargain. For example, a $2,000 purchase of $TICS at $0.1300 nets about 15,384 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s $15,384 — a 669% return. At $5, it becomes $76,920, and at $10, an astounding $153,840. With projections up to $15 per token, that could become $230,760. This is why Qubetics is being flagged as the best crypto presale right now. But what makes Qubetics special isn’t just numbers. It’s the tech. The core feature setting it apart is the decentralized VPN (dVPN) network. In an age of rising data surveillance and government restrictions, privacy is no longer optional — it’s survival. Qubetics’ dVPN lets users across the globe bypass censorship, browse securely, and share bandwidth — all while earning rewards. Imagine a freelance journalist in a high-censorship region using Qubetics to access open-source content and communicate with peers safely. Or a remote team in a restricted country using Qubetics dVPN to ensure their project tools stay accessible, without compromise. For regular users, it’s the chance to control online privacy while monetizing unused internet bandwidth. For businesses, it’s a way to operate across borders securely. And for developers, the QubeQode IDE simplifies building on-chain apps with dVPN integration. The project is more than a presale — it’s a movement for secure, decentralized internet usage. The Qubetics mainnet is slated to launch in Q2 2025, adding a ticking clock to the opportunity. With over $15.5 million raised, 504 million tokens sold, and more than 23,900 token holders, this isn’t early anymore — but it’s not too late. Qubetics isn’t just one of the Top Crypto Assets , it’s the one that might erase the regret of every past crypto miss. Injective: The Missed ICO That Still Haunts Injective Protocol was one of those projects that slipped through the fingers of many who didn’t take the early signal seriously. When it first launched its ICO in late 2020, most were skeptical. The idea of a fully decentralized finance (DeFi) layer with cross-chain trading capabilities was ambitious — and maybe even ahead of its time. But Injective wasn’t just big talk. It delivered. Those who got in early watched as the protocol expanded rapidly. Backed by heavyweight names and offering zero gas fees, lightning-fast speeds, and a unique order book model, Injective quickly carved out its niche in the DeFi space. Projects started building on it. Data showed trading volumes rising. Use cases kept evolving, and price charts followed. And then came the regret. The kind that hits when it’s already too late. Many who dismissed Injective’s potential are still watching from the sidelines as the project continues to push forward. The ship didn’t just sail — it left the dock, hit top speed, and hasn’t looked back. Yet despite the growth, it serves as a reminder that the best time to move on a project is when it still looks early and undervalued. That’s why new names like Qubetics are turning heads — they’re not just promising, they’re still accessible. Injective taught a hard lesson. Don’t wait for a token to moon before recognizing its utility. That moment comes and goes in a blink. Instead, spotting projects with scalable, real-world solutions and early-stage pricing — like Qubetics — is the strategy seasoned participants now pursue. The Injective ICO is over. But the Qubetics presale is still open. Conclusion: Make the Move Before It’s Another “Could Have” Missing Injective was painful for many, but the lesson wasn’t wasted. Today, Qubetics offers that elusive second chance. The project is real, the use case is urgent, and the window is still open. The Qubetics presale, now in stage 27, is an early adopter’s opportunity that combines accessible pricing with powerful upside. With the mainnet just months away, and the decentralized VPN narrative heating up globally, hesitation might just cost more than before. Among the top crypto assets to watch in 2025, Qubetics has not only earned its place — it’s claiming it with authority. The numbers speak for themselves, and the application speaks for the future of internet freedom. Those still waiting are likely the same ones who missed Binance, missed Injective, and are on track to miss this. Don’t let this be another regret. Time is ticking. Join this crypto presale before the price jumps again — because the next phase is never as cheap as this one.

However, Bitcoin’s price is trading down from its peak price above $109,000, raising concerns about whether the firm should pursue more buys. While price fluctuations are common, Strategy’s average acquisition price has jumped to $66,000, and the firm still relies on equities and convertible notes to make purchases. Some analysts even hinted that the firm could just be one moderate token price fall away from trouble. Thompson argues that Strategy may not have to sell Bitcoin to add more collateral Strategy raised billions through equity sales and convertible debt to buy most of its BTC holdings. However, in its most recent purchases, the company opted to raise funds through preferred stock, a type of equity offering investors dividends. However, the company’s growing debt and aggressive token purchases have some analysts wondering about its fate. Contrary to some, Quincy Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, argued that it’s very unlikely for Stategy to find itself in a situation where it has to sell its BTC holdings to give lenders more collateral in case of a drastic price drop. He explained that the firm would likely refinance debt for convertible notes instead of paying them off immediately, and in the case of preferred stock, they don’t have to repay any part of it. Since the firm has not listed its Bitcoin holdings for its loans, it’s less likely to end up like failed crypto firms and projects such as Genesis and Three Arrows Capital. Nevertheless, Strategy still needs to be careful that it does not issue more equity than the market can handle. Thompson argued similarly, saying that if the firm cannot pay dividends with its cash flow, it could be forced to issue more shares, which would ultimately affect the stock price. He added, “But it’s no different than what he’s doing already. Every time the retail bids it up, he wrecks the stock price by issuing more shares. In the future, he will have to do that, and the flows might not go into Bitcoin. They might go to repay these debtors, and it will hurt the share price.” Thompson says Strategy may need to issue more shares to settle the due interests The Bitcoin-focused company also needs to pay 8% dividends on STRK, 10% dividends on STRF, and a 0.4% interest rate on its convertible bonds. Meanwhile, the firm’s software business is bringing in few returns, so the company could struggle to pay off the dividends. According to Thompson, Strategy should continue issuing MSTR stock to pay all the pending interest. He even claimed the stock could trade at a discount to avoid having to issue more shares. However, he did warn that if the discount would grow to 20% or 30%, shareholders would most likely ask for the discount closure. He even suggested that to increase shareholder value, the number one option would be to sell Bitcoin and buy stock. He also touched on the company’s issues with its ETFs, saying they have been “obliterated”. Surprisingly, these ETFs are still in high demand despite the stock’s losses. Moreover, the popularity of ETFs has only helped aggravate constant buying pressure for MSTR. Though widely amazed by ETFs’ potential and importance, Thompson believes they are unreliable when making 10-year predictions of the asset’s price. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The relocation follows unsanctioned media actions and evolving legal filings. Changes may affect his interaction with legal teams and appeal tactics. Authorities appear to use the case to reassess custody oversight practices. Disgraced FTX fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried has been moved out of New York federal prison after spending nearly two years behind bars in the Big Apple, federal prison records show. SBF Transferred Out Of NYC According to prison records , Bankman-Fried has been transported from Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY to the Federal Transfer Center in Oklahoma City, OK. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that guards awoke Bankman-Fried at 3 a.m. on Wednesday before he was transferred to the holding facility. While no specific reason was given for Bankman-Fried’s transfer, the one-time “king of crypto” had been sent to solitary confinement earlier this month from an unauthorized interview with Tucker Carlson. Sam Bankman-Fried just did an interview behind bars at MDC Brooklyn where he shared a unit with P Diddy. pic.twitter.com/FWfJ9QAxh2 — Tiffany Fong (@TiffanyFong_) March 6, 2025 The FTX founder has been in prison since August 2023 when Judge Lewis Kaplan revoked his bail after he leaked excerpts of his ex-girlfriend Caroline Ellison’s diary to the New York Times, citing potential witness tampering. The former Alameda Research CEO, who was in an on-again off-again relationship with Bankman-Fried until early 2022, was largely considered the prosecution’s star witness against the crypto kingpin. Bankman-Fried was found guilty on all charges in November of 2023 for orchestrating the massive crypto scheme that saw investors drained of over $8 billion. SBF Associates Face The Music Bankman-Fried was ultimately sentenced to 25 years behind bars and subsequently ordered to pay an over $11 billion fine. “He knew it was wrong,” Kaplan said during Bankman-Fried’s sentencing in March 2024. “He knew it was criminal. He regrets making a bad bet against the likelihood of getting caught – and he’s not going to admit a thing.” Meanwhile, Ellison was sentenced to two years in federal prison for her role in the crypto exchange’s collapse . FTX co-founder Gary Wang and the exchange’s director of engineering Nishad Singh both were sentenced to time served by Kaplan, effectively avoiding jail time altogether. All three cooperated with the federal government in hopes of getting a lesser sentence and testified against their one-time boss. It is unclear where Bankman-Fried is being transferred, though it looks like his future facility will be much closer to his hometown of Stanford, CA.

If you’re holding Maple Finance’s MPL token on Coinbase, you need to pay close attention. Coinbase Exchange has just dropped a bombshell announcement via X (formerly Twitter): they will not be supporting the migration of MPL to the new SYRUP token. This means if you want to keep your assets safe and sound, you’ve got a crucial task on your to-do list before April 30th. Why is Coinbase Not Supporting the MPL to SYRUP Migration? Coinbase’s decision might leave some users scratching their heads. While they haven’t explicitly detailed the reasons behind this move, it’s not uncommon for exchanges to selectively support token migrations based on various factors. These can include technical complexities, regulatory considerations, or simply strategic business decisions. For MPL holders who prefer the convenience of centralized exchanges, this news definitely throws a wrench in the works. According to Coinbase’s official announcement on X, the message is clear and concise: “Coinbase Exchange will not support the Maple Finance (MPL) to SYRUP token migration. MPL holders must convert their MPL to SYRUP by April 30, 2024, via Maple’s official portal or a self-custodial wallet (e.g. Coinbase Wallet). Failure to migrate may result in asset loss.” Let’s break down what this urgent announcement really means for you, especially if you’re holding MPL on Coinbase. Understanding the MPL to SYRUP Migration: What’s the Buzz? So, what exactly is this MPL to SYRUP migration all about? Maple Finance, a decentralized corporate credit marketplace, is upgrading its token from MPL to SYRUP. This isn’t just a cosmetic change; it’s a significant upgrade aimed at enhancing the utility and functionality of the token within the Maple ecosystem. Token migrations are a fairly common occurrence in the crypto world, often undertaken to improve tokenomics, security, or to introduce new features. Think of it like upgrading your software to a newer, more efficient version. In this case, SYRUP is designed to be a more potent and versatile token compared to MPL. Maple Finance likely believes this upgrade will benefit their community in the long run by fostering a stronger and more dynamic ecosystem. Here’s a simplified look at why such migrations happen: Enhanced Functionality: New tokens can introduce improved features, governance mechanisms, or utility within the platform. Tokenomics Upgrade: Migrations can be used to adjust token supply, distribution models, or incentive structures for better economic alignment. Technological Advancements: Sometimes, a migration is necessary to leverage newer blockchain technologies or address limitations in the older token structure. Maple Finance’s Mandate: Migrate or Risk Crypto Asset Loss Now, let’s get to the crucial part: crypto asset loss . Coinbase’s announcement explicitly warns about the potential for asset loss if MPL holders fail to migrate. This isn’t just a scare tactic; it’s a real risk. After the April 30th deadline, the MPL token will likely become obsolete within the Maple Finance ecosystem. Maple Finance has provided clear instructions for users to migrate their MPL tokens. You have two primary pathways: Maple’s Official Portal: This is the direct route recommended by Maple Finance. You’ll need to connect your wallet to their portal and follow the migration steps. This is generally the most straightforward method if you are comfortable using DeFi platforms. Self-Custodial Wallet (e.g., Coinbase Wallet): Even though Coinbase Exchange isn’t supporting the migration directly, Coinbase Wallet (a separate self-custodial wallet) can be used. This option gives you full control over your private keys and allows you to interact with decentralized applications like Maple’s migration portal. Other self-custodial wallets like MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc., would also work. Key Dates and Actions: Action Deadline Method Migrate MPL to SYRUP April 30, 2024 Maple’s Official Portal or Self-Custodial Wallet Coinbase Exchange Support for MPL to SYRUP None Not Supported Potential Consequence of Inaction After April 30, 2024 Asset Loss (MPL tokens may become unusable) Step-by-Step Guide: Navigating Your Token Migration Feeling a bit overwhelmed? Don’t worry, migrating your tokens isn’t rocket science. Here’s a simplified step-by-step guide to help you through the process: Identify Your MPL Holdings: First, confirm where your MPL tokens are held. If they are on Coinbase Exchange, you’ll need to withdraw them to a self-custodial wallet like Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask. Choose Your Migration Method: Decide whether you’ll use Maple’s official portal or connect via a self-custodial wallet. For most users, Maple’s portal is likely the easiest route. Visit Maple Finance’s Migration Portal: Go to the official migration portal provided by Maple Finance. Always double-check the URL to ensure you are on the legitimate site and avoid phishing scams. Connect Your Wallet: Connect the wallet holding your MPL tokens to the migration portal. Follow the instructions to authorize the connection. Initiate the Migration: Within the portal, you should find clear instructions on how to swap your MPL for SYRUP. Typically, this involves approving a transaction and confirming the swap. Verify the Migration: After the transaction is confirmed, check your wallet to ensure you have received the SYRUP tokens and that your MPL balance has been reduced accordingly. Don’t Delay: Time is Running Out for MPL Holders! The clock is ticking! With the April 30th deadline looming, MPL holders on Coinbase need to act swiftly. Procrastination could lead to the unfortunate scenario of asset loss , and nobody wants that. Take a few minutes today to understand the migration process and plan your next steps. While Coinbase’s decision might seem inconvenient, remember that navigating the crypto space often requires users to be proactive and adaptable. Token migrations are part of the evolving nature of blockchain projects, and staying informed is key to safeguarding your investments. Key Takeaways for Navigating Token Migrations in Crypto This situation with token migration highlights some important lessons for all crypto users: Stay Informed: Regularly check official announcements from exchanges and project teams regarding your holdings. Social media platforms like X, project websites, and official blogs are crucial sources of information. Understand Token Migration Risks: Be aware that token migrations are sometimes necessary but always come with deadlines. Failing to act can indeed result in losing access to your assets. Embrace Self-Custody: While centralized exchanges offer convenience, self-custodial wallets provide greater control and flexibility, especially when dealing with token migrations or interacting with DeFi platforms. Act Promptly: When a token migration is announced, don’t delay. Understand the process, set reminders, and complete the migration well before the deadline to avoid any last-minute hassles or potential issues. In Conclusion: Secure Your Assets – Migrate MPL to SYRUP Now! The message is loud and clear: if you hold MPL tokens and want to transition to SYRUP, you need to take action before April 30th. Coinbase Exchange won’t be handling the migration for you, so it’s up to you to use Maple’s official portal or a self-custodial wallet to complete the swap. Don’t let the deadline pass you by and risk losing your assets. Take control, migrate your MPL to SYRUP, and continue your journey in the ever-evolving world of crypto with confidence!

42553777,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144421,1743205251,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Shift? Paul Atkins Poised to Rewrite SEC Crypto Regulation Rulebook,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/atkins-rewrite-sec-crypto-rules/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation! What if the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. was about to undergo a seismic shift? That’s the prediction from none other than former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) internet enforcement chief, John Reed Stark. He suggests that if Paul Atkins is confirmed as the next SEC chair , we could witness a complete overhaul of the agency’s crypto regulation playbook. Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts, because change might be on the horizon! Is a New Era of Crypto Regulation Dawning with Paul Atkins? According to a report by DL News, Stark anticipates that Atkins, should he take the helm as SEC chair , will likely dismantle the policies that crypto firms have been navigating under the leadership of the previous chair, Gary Gensler . This isn’t just a minor tweak; Stark suggests we could be looking at a complete reversal of course. Imagine a regulatory environment that looks drastically different from what we’ve become accustomed to – that’s the potential scale of change being discussed. But what exactly does this “overhaul” entail? Let’s break down what Stark is predicting: Policy Reversal: Atkins is expected to undo the regulatory approach adopted by Gary Gensler , which many in the crypto industry felt was overly aggressive and enforcement-heavy. This could mean a move away from regulation by enforcement and towards clearer, more proactive guidelines. Unprecedented Reforms: Stark boldly predicts that Atkins might introduce up to 12 completely new reforms within his first 100 days in office. That’s a whirlwind of potential activity, suggesting a rapid and decisive approach to reshaping crypto regulation . Fairness and Transparency: Despite being critical of Atkins’ perceived pro-crypto stance, Stark acknowledges him as an “honorable individual” who would prioritize fairness and transparency in his leadership. This is a crucial point, suggesting that even with significant changes, the process will be conducted with integrity. What Could These 12 Reforms in 100 Days Look Like? While Stark hasn’t detailed the exact 12 reforms, we can speculate on the areas where Atkins might focus his attention based on common criticisms of the current crypto regulation framework and the general sentiment within the crypto industry: Potential Reform Area Possible Changes Industry Impact Security vs. Utility Token Classifications Establish clearer guidelines and potentially a safe harbor for utility tokens to avoid them being automatically classified as securities. Could foster innovation and reduce legal uncertainty for token projects. Regulation of Crypto Exchanges Develop a more tailored regulatory framework specifically for crypto exchanges, potentially differentiating between centralized and decentralized platforms. Could lead to more exchanges operating within the U.S. and increased market access. Clarity on DeFi Regulation Provide guidance on how existing securities laws apply (or don’t apply) to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Could unlock DeFi innovation and bring more projects into regulatory compliance. Digital Asset Custody Rules Re-evaluate and potentially simplify custody rules to make it easier for institutions to hold and manage digital assets. Could encourage greater institutional investment in crypto. Enforcement Priorities Shift focus from broad enforcement actions to providing clearer guidance and working collaboratively with crypto firms to achieve compliance. Could improve the relationship between regulators and the crypto industry and reduce fear of over-regulation. These are just hypothetical examples, of course. The actual reforms could be different, but the core idea is that Atkins might aim to create a more business-friendly and innovation-supportive regulatory environment for crypto firms compared to the approach under Gary Gensler . Gary Gensler ‘s Legacy vs. Atkins’ Potential Approach The contrast between Gary Gensler and Paul Atkins is quite stark (pun intended!). Gensler’s tenure at the SEC was marked by a perceived crackdown on the crypto industry, with numerous enforcement actions and a strong stance that many cryptocurrencies are securities. This approach, while aimed at investor protection, was criticized by some in the industry for stifling innovation and creating regulatory uncertainty. On the other hand, Atkins is viewed as potentially more industry-friendly. His background and past statements suggest a belief in a less interventionist approach, favoring clearer rules and guidance over aggressive enforcement from the outset. This difference in philosophy could lead to a significant change in the way the SEC interacts with crypto firms . What are the Potential Benefits of an Atkins-Led SEC for Crypto? If Stark’s predictions come to fruition and Atkins does indeed rewrite the crypto regulation rulebook, what could be the potential upsides for the cryptocurrency space? Increased Clarity and Reduced Uncertainty: Clearer regulations would provide crypto firms with a more solid foundation to operate, innovate, and grow within the U.S. market. This clarity could attract more investment and development. Boost to Innovation: A less restrictive and more supportive regulatory environment could unleash a wave of innovation in the crypto and blockchain space. Companies might feel more comfortable launching new projects and services in the U.S. Improved Industry-Regulator Relations: A shift towards collaboration and guidance could foster a more positive and productive relationship between the SEC and the crypto industry, moving away from the adversarial tone that sometimes characterized the Gensler era. Attracting Global Crypto Businesses: A more favorable regulatory climate in the U.S. could attract crypto firms from around the world, positioning the country as a hub for digital asset innovation. Are There Any Potential Downsides or Challenges? While the prospect of a more crypto-friendly SEC chair might sound appealing to many in the industry, it’s important to consider potential challenges or concerns: Investor Protection Concerns: A perceived loosening of regulations could raise concerns about investor protection. It’s crucial that any new framework still safeguards investors from fraud and scams, which are unfortunately prevalent in the crypto space. Regulatory Arbitrage: If the U.S. becomes significantly more lenient than other jurisdictions, it could lead to regulatory arbitrage, where crypto firms flock to the U.S. to avoid stricter rules elsewhere. This could create international regulatory challenges. Potential for Market Volatility: Major regulatory shifts can sometimes lead to market volatility as the industry adjusts to the new landscape. Smooth and well-communicated transitions are essential. Balancing Innovation and Regulation: The key challenge for Atkins, if confirmed, will be to strike the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring adequate investor protection and market integrity. This is a delicate act. Actionable Insights: Staying Ahead of the Curve For anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space – whether you’re an investor, a developer, or running a crypto firm – staying informed about these potential regulatory changes is crucial. Here are some actionable steps: Follow Regulatory Developments: Keep a close eye on news and announcements from the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Track the progress of Atkins’ potential nomination and confirmation. Engage with Industry Associations: Organizations like the Blockchain Association and Coin Center often provide updates and analysis on regulatory matters. Seek Legal Counsel: If you’re operating a crypto firm , consult with legal experts to understand how potential regulatory changes might impact your business and ensure compliance. Prepare for Change: Regardless of the specifics of any new regulations, be prepared for potential shifts in the regulatory landscape and adapt your strategies accordingly. Conclusion: A Potential Turning Point for Crypto Regulation? The possibility of Paul Atkins becoming the next SEC chair and potentially rewriting the crypto regulation rulebook is a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry. While John Reed Stark’s predictions are just that – predictions – they highlight the potential for a major shift in the SEC’s approach. Whether this shift will be a revolutionary step forward for crypto innovation or present new challenges remains to be seen.

Now, this deep-pocketed investor has made a significant move, transferring a whopping 1,700 ETH, valued at $3.18 million, to the popular Binance exchange. This sudden activity after years of hibernation raises a lot of questions. What’s behind this massive crypto whale movement ? Could it signal a shift in market dynamics, or is it simply one whale making waves? Let’s dive into the details of this fascinating on-chain event. Ethereum ICO Whale Movement: A Deep Dive into the Transaction The crypto world is always watching for signs of significant shifts, and the recent Ethereum ICO whale movement certainly qualifies. According to data from the blockchain analytics firm Nansen, highlighted by Onchain Lens on X (formerly Twitter), this particular wallet has been inactive for seven years. Imagine holding onto a digital asset for that long without making a single move! The wallet’s origins are particularly noteworthy – it received its initial ETH stash directly from the Genesis block, essentially day one of the Ethereum network. This connection to the very beginning of Ethereum adds another layer of intrigue to the whale’s actions. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key details: Whale Status: Ethereum ICO Participant (Early Investor) Asset Moved: 1,700 ETH Value of Transfer: $3.18 million (approximately) Destination: Binance Exchange Inactivity Period: Seven Years Wallet Origin: Ethereum Genesis Block Remaining Holdings: 3,300 ETH in cold storage (66% of total original holdings) Why ETH to Binance After Seven Years? Decoding the Whale’s Motives The big question on everyone’s mind is: why now? Why move such a significant amount of ETH to Binance after all this time? While we can only speculate, there are several potential reasons behind this ETH to Binance transfer: Profit Taking: After seven years, the value of ETH has appreciated enormously since the ICO. This could be a strategic move to take profits, especially given market fluctuations. Portfolio Diversification: The whale might be looking to diversify their crypto portfolio by selling ETH and investing in other assets available on Binance. Trading Opportunities: Binance offers a wide range of trading pairs and financial products. The whale might be moving ETH to the exchange to engage in active trading or explore DeFi opportunities. Liquidation for Fiat: While less likely given the crypto-native nature of an ICO participant, there’s a possibility the whale intends to convert the ETH to fiat currency for real-world expenses or investments. Strategic Rebalancing: Maintaining a specific portfolio balance is crucial for large holders. This transfer could be part of a larger strategy to rebalance their crypto holdings. It’s important to remember that this is just one transaction from a wallet that still holds a substantial amount of ETH. The fact that 66% of the original holdings remain in cold storage suggests a long-term belief in Ethereum’s potential. Impact on Ethereum Price and Market Sentiment Any significant crypto whale movement can potentially influence market sentiment and even Ethereum price . While a $3.18 million transfer is considerable, it’s crucial to put it into perspective within the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Here’s how such a move can impact the market: Potential Impact Description Short-Term Price Volatility Large sell orders originating from the whale’s transferred ETH could create temporary downward pressure on Ethereum price , especially if executed quickly on Binance. Market Sentiment Shift News of a long-dormant whale becoming active can create uncertainty in the market. Some investors might interpret it as a lack of long-term confidence, potentially triggering minor sell-offs. Increased Trading Volume The whale’s activity and the ensuing market reaction can lead to increased trading volume for ETH on Binance and other exchanges. Limited Long-Term Impact Given the overall size and liquidity of the Ethereum market, a single whale’s $3.18 million transfer is unlikely to cause a sustained, major shift in Ethereum price or long-term market trends. However, the psychological impact of such events should not be underestimated. Traders and investors often react to whale movements as potential indicators of market direction, even if the actual fundamental impact is limited. Crypto Long-Term Holders: The Sleeping Giants of the Market This Ethereum ICO whale story highlights the significant role of crypto long-term holders in the market. These are individuals and entities who acquired cryptocurrencies early on and have held onto them through market cycles, often for years. Their holdings represent a substantial portion of the total cryptocurrency supply, and their actions can have considerable implications. Key characteristics of crypto long-term holders: Strong Belief in Crypto’s Potential: They often possess a deep conviction in the long-term value proposition of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Hodling Mentality: They are known for their “hodling” strategy – holding onto their assets despite market volatility, rather than actively trading. Significant Market Influence: Due to the size of their holdings, their buying or selling activity can create ripples in the market. Potential Source of Liquidity: As long-term holders become active, they can inject liquidity into the market, especially if they choose to sell or trade their assets. Historical Market Insights: Their actions offer valuable insights into the behavior of early crypto adopters and how market dynamics have evolved over time. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? The awakening of this Ethereum ICO whale is a compelling reminder of the early days of crypto and the massive wealth accumulation that occurred during the initial boom. As these early investors, the crypto long-term holders , start to move their assets, it introduces a new layer of complexity and potential volatility to the market. Will this be a one-off event, or could it signal a broader trend of dormant whales becoming active? Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Keep an eye on blockchain analytics platforms to track whale movements and understand potential market signals. Stay Informed About Market Sentiment: Pay attention to news and social media discussions surrounding whale activity to gauge market reactions. Consider Long-Term Trends: While whale movements can cause short-term fluctuations, focus on the fundamental long-term trends driving the crypto market. Manage Risk Wisely: Be prepared for potential volatility and manage your risk accordingly, especially when large transactions occur. Remember Crypto’s History: Events like this remind us of the cyclical nature of crypto markets and the importance of understanding market history. Conclusion: The Whale’s Wake and Crypto’s Unpredictable Seas The sudden activity of this Ethereum ICO whale is a captivating story within the ever-evolving narrative of cryptocurrency. It’s a potent reminder that the crypto market is not just about algorithms and code; it’s also about the human element – the early believers, the long-term holders, and the often unpredictable actions of significant players. As we watch the ripples from this $3.18 million ETH transfer spread through the crypto seas, one thing is clear: the world of digital assets remains as dynamic, intriguing, and full of surprises as ever. Keep your eyes on the blockchain, because in crypto, the sleeping giants can awaken at any moment, changing the landscape with a single move.

A thorough examination forecasts returns of around 1,000% based on a $1,000 investment in FloppyPepe (FPPE) alongside Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), while Solana and Ethereum are likely to get a boost in the tail end of 2025. Unlike Ethereum and Solana, FloppyPepe aims to achieve unprecedented feats with AI, making overseas competing rivals the underlying reason for this analysis’s bullish prediction. Ethereum (ETH): Gradual Growth, No Sprinting Expected The current rate of ETH is around $2,075, trading at a $4,868 market cap as of March 25, 2025. While ETH displays gradual increments, it would still need more optimistic 6k-12k predictions on the market . At the same time, ETH also showed signs of overcoming the free-restraining spark competition and slow DeFi exposure. With a $3,333.33 target, ETH needs 1.6x without too much struggle. Solana (SOL): FloppyPepe’s Whimsical Leverage Attracts More Attention But Is Still A Strong Contender In The Market Solana is currently at $139. It has shown recent gains as well—gaining an all-time high of $294 in January 2025 shows its volatility. Price predictions include the range of $142 to a bullish $520-$690. Trading corrections alongside validator reward concerns brings risk towards Solana’s growing market share in smart contracts. The need for these risks to be diminished is crucial for estimated predictions. Its growing market share in smart contracts and potential ETF approval are definitely positives. FloppyPepe’s potential makes Sol’s need for $3,333.33 and a 2.1x increase pale in comparison. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Artificial Intelligence Behind 10x Returns FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents the most significant opportunity for exponential growth, especially with its presale price of $0.0000002. All eyes are already on the project due to its AI-powered meme tools, deflationary tokenomics, and community focus. Predictions say FloppyPepe can allow up to a 930% surge or reach the astonishing predicted 100x return. The low entry price offers significant potential, which sets FloppyPepe apart from traditional meme coins. Risks are of course encountered but rewards are said to be unmatched. For these claims, FloppyPepe needs a 10,000x increase to aim towards the target of $3,333.33, which directly contradicts the project’s innovative appeal but strong community support. The 10x Reality Check: FloppyPepe’s Potential to Redefine Returns For an investment of $333.33 to yield a return of $10,000, it necessitates a hefty growth to $3,333.33. ETH: 1.6x increase required. SOL: 2.1x increase required. FPPE: 10,000x growth required. FloppyPepe stands out among ETH and SOL in terms of potential; alongside offering growth, it serves as the key to achieving the 10x goal. FloppyPepe: A High-Risk, High-Reward Opportunity In case these additional risks do not extract a toll, this portfolio is set to FloppyPepe’s scorching success. While ETH and SOL are considered the safer options, FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents itself as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity due to its AI innovation and robust community support. With presale Pepe coin , investors need to tread carefully due to the volume of risk that comes hand in hand with it. Contrary to that, FloppyPepe’s quirky take, while being backed by a strong community, renders it an appealing option for those wishing for unique return strategies. While careful reasoning with risk and placing bets on the right angle is vital, it is equally essential to highlight that the power FloppyPepe brings to crypto return ceiling is remarkable.

Binance Launchpool, which lets users stake coins to farm new assets, says its 66th project will be GUN, the official token of the GUNZ blockchain, which was built by developer Gunzilla Games. The chain currently powers Gunzilla’s Extraction Royale game “Off The Grid” and its infiltration game “Technocore.” Gunzilla says in the project’s whitepaper that the chain was “purpose-built for AAA web3 gaming.” “Originally created to support a community-driven economy for Gunzilla’s flagship title, Off The Grid (OTG), GUNZ has evolved into a full-featured platform offering blockchain-native infrastructure essential for modern game development.” Between March 28th and 31st, Binance users can lock their BNB , the crypto exchange platform’s native asset, as well as the stablecoins First Digital USD ( FDUSD ) and USDC , to receive GUN airdrops. The top global crypto exchange then plans to list the asset on March 31st. Binance will attach a seed tag to GUN, which the exchange applies to lower-liquidity projects that may exhibit higher volatility compared to other listed tokens. Binance requires users who own assets with seed tags to pass quizzes every 90 days to ensure they’re aware of the risks before trading the tokens.

This next phase was confirmed in Keynote 3, where the team shared a clear message. The launch isn’t being rushed—it’s part of a focused plan. When the network goes live later this year, it will introduce better performance and usability than most Layer 1 chains offer at launch. CEO Antony Turner shared that this moment marks the shift from idea to working network. According to him, everything from the early presale to the growing global community has led up to this. “This is not just a milestone,” Turner said. “This is the moment BlockDAG becomes a complete, working ecosystem.” BlockDAG’s Big Leap: Mainnet Set to Revolutionize Crypto in 2025 While some projects delay key releases, BlockDAG has been steady with its updates. Now, the biggest moment is locked in—mainnet goes live in 2025. But it’s not just about launching. It’s about getting it right. The team is focused on building real infrastructure, hitting real performance levels, and creating tools that people will actually use. “We’re improving speed, reliability, and safety while giving developers early support to build a strong dApp network,” Turner said. Every piece of the system—explorer, tools, oracles, and indexing—is being developed to make sure the network is ready from day one. Starts at 2,000 TPS—and That’s Just the Beginning From the very start, BlockDAG will handle 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). That number alone puts it far ahead of many chains that launched before it. But the bigger goal is 15,000 TPS within the first two years. This is possible thanks to a hybrid setup that uses both Proof-of-Work and a DAG-based method for processing. Instead of waiting for each block, the system allows multiple transactions to be confirmed at the same time. That means faster service, more volume, and stronger support for apps. As Jeremy Harkness explained during Keynote 3: “This is not your regular blockchain setup—we’re changing the basic structure of how things work.” Launching with DeFi, EVM Tools, and Real Use Many projects launch with very few tools and grow slowly. BlockDAG is taking a different path. It will include several major features right from the start: Built-in DeFi features like swaps, stablecoins, and lending EVM compatibility for Ethereum-based dApps Token creators that don’t require any coding Full account abstraction for easier wallet control and recovery All of this is native to the chain, so there’s no need for third-party fixes or workarounds. Users can start building and transacting from day one. Turner shared that the focus is on usefulness: “Our goal is to launch with tools people can use, not just talk about.” Miners Are Already Shipping The network’s strength will come from thousands of miners that are already being sent out. BlockDAG has started shipping its X30 and X100 devices to early buyers. “We’ve officially begun sending out the first batch of miners,” Turner confirmed. Before the mainnet even launches, nearly 10,000 mining units will be running around the world. These miners are tuned for BlockDAG’s hybrid system. They’re energy-efficient and can be used in homes or larger setups. Unlike sharp halving events, BlockDAG’s reward system reduces gradually. That means more predictable returns for miners and token holders. Strong Security and Community-Led Growth Security has been one of the project’s main goals. It has completed audits by Halborn and Certik, and its token vesting contract has passed all checks. The team also uses multi-party treasury tools to manage funds safely. Community members will also help shape the future of the network. A decentralized decision system is being built to let users propose ideas, vote, and guide the project’s future direction. “Our holders will help decide how we move forward,” the team shared. This launch isn’t just technical—it’s about growing with input from the people using the network. What’s Coming Next? Mainnet is only the start. After launch, BlockDAG’s roadmap includes: Supporting over 1,000 dApps by 2026 Expanding into areas like gaming, identity, and artificial intelligence Boosting TPS even further with new research Running global events, hackathons, and educational programs As Harkness put it: “We’re not just meeting a deadline—we’re laying the groundwork for something much bigger.” And Turner ended the keynote with a hint at what’s next: “Keep an eye out for our next announcement—wait, did I say Keynote? I meant LaunchNote!” Final Words BlockDAG is on track to deliver one of the most complete Layer 1 releases in crypto. With 2,000 TPS planned at launch, a goal of 15,000 TPS, DeFi tools, EVM support, and miners already being deployed, this isn’t just another blockchain project. It’s the real beginning. And with the “Launchnote” around the corner, this is the moment it all starts.

Still, a major challenge remains: scalability. Older blockchains often face trade-offs between speed, decentralization, and safety. Processing delays, costly gas fees during traffic spikes, and low throughput continue to frustrate developers and users searching for better solutions. That’s where BlockDAG (BDAG) steps in—a new Layer 1 project that merges Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture with the security of Proof-of-Work (PoW). This isn’t just a simple upgrade—it rethinks the entire structure of how decentralized networks can run. Parallel Processing Unlocks Better Performance What powers BlockDAG’s big leap is its DAG foundation. Instead of using a slow, linear chain where each block waits its turn, this setup confirms many blocks at once. Think of traffic moving in multiple lanes instead of a single-file jam. This new approach greatly increases how much data the system can handle and cuts delays. During Keynote 3, CTO Jeremy Harkness summed it up well: “Imagine if transactions didn’t have to wait in a long queue, one after another. With our parallel processing, multiple blocks are confirmed simultaneously.” It’s already more than theory—Beta Testnet V1 now runs twice as fast as the earlier version, and the mainnet aims to reach 2,000 transactions per second, later scaling to 15,000. The impact of this tech goes beyond numbers. Faster confirmations improve dApps, especially in fields like finance, gaming, and live communication. Cheaper fees come from better handling of high-volume activity. Because DAG can scale side-by-side, BlockDAG plans to host over 1,000 dApps by 2026. Security Still Comes First with PoW While DAG gives BlockDAG the speed, it doesn’t forget about safety. PoW stays part of its system by design. Many projects moved away from PoW to save energy, but BlockDAG shows that you don’t have to pick between power and protection. The PoW part makes users prove they’ve done real work to add blocks, which guards against data tampering. Jeremy Harkness explained, “The Proof-of-Work element ensures our data remains immutable, while the DAG structure scales our capacity exponentially.” Extra safety measures are in place too. Certik and Halborn are doing full audits. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) keeps treasury and user funds protected. BlockDAG also runs the GhostDAG protocol, which cuts down on discarded blocks and helps prevent attacks on the network. Put together, these elements create not just a faster system, but one that’s secure enough to support finance, games, ID platforms, and more. Tools for Builders and Real Use Cases BlockDAG’s setup isn’t just a tech improvement—it’s a push for wide use. The dual-engine model of DAG + PoW powers everything in the BlockDAG network, from its mobile mining tools to its dApp services. Already, over 750,000 users mine through the X1 App, and more than 100,000 play Tap Miner on Telegram every day. These figures show real traction, built on simple, fun tools that make getting into crypto easy. Builders also get solid tools to create with. Features like the coin and NFT Wizard help users make assets with no coding. There are testnet rewards and upcoming hackathons offering six-figure prizes—fueling a space for serious projects to grow. As Maurice Herlihy shared, “Our program goes beyond simply showing you which buttons to press—it provides you with the essential principles and insights needed to safely and confidently harness BlockDAG’s transformative potential.” Whether someone is launching a finance tool or building social-based governance apps, BlockDAG makes sure it can be done fast, cheap, and safely. Why BlockDAG is The Future of the Blockchain Industry BlockDAG isn’t just another project hoping to get noticed—it’s a full rethink of what decentralized systems should look like today. The combo of DAG’s speed and PoW’s strength solves the old three-way problem of scale, speed, and safety. It can do more at once, cut costs, and keep data secure—all while building a strong user and builder base. As the 2025 mainnet launch draws closer, BlockDAG is on track to lead the next wave of decentralized apps. Instead of following trends, it’s laying the path ahead.

The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has just dropped a significant update, potentially opening doors for banks to dive deeper into the realm of digital assets. This vital guidance from the FDIC could mark a turning point in how traditional financial institutions interact with cryptocurrencies. Are you ready to explore what this means for the future of finance and crypto adoption? Decoding the FDIC Crypto Guidance: What Does it Mean for Banks Crypto Activities? In a recent announcement that has sent ripples through both the banking and cryptocurrency sectors, the FDIC has clarified its stance on banks engaging in crypto-related activities. According to a statement published on their official website, institutions regulated by the FDIC now have a clearer pathway to participate in the burgeoning crypto space. The key takeaway? Banks can now engage in permitted cryptocurrency activities without needing to seek prior approval from the FDIC. This is a significant shift from previous uncertainties and could signal a more welcoming regulatory environment for crypto within traditional finance. Here’s a breakdown of what this new FDIC Crypto Guidance entails: Clarity on Permissible Activities: The guidance provides a framework for banks to understand what types of crypto activities are considered permissible. While the specifics of these “permitted activities” will likely be further defined in subsequent communications and individual bank evaluations, this initial guidance offers a crucial starting point. No Prior Approval Needed (For Permitted Activities): Perhaps the most impactful aspect is the statement that banks do not need to seek prior approval from the FDIC for engaging in these permitted activities. This streamlines the process and reduces bureaucratic hurdles that may have previously deterred banks from exploring crypto. Focus on Safety and Soundness: It’s important to note that while the FDIC is providing a green light for banks crypto activities , they are still emphasizing the importance of safety and soundness. Banks will still be expected to operate in a manner that protects depositors and the financial system. This suggests a balanced approach – encouraging innovation while maintaining regulatory oversight. Why is Abolishing Customer Reputation Risk a Win for Crypto Regulation and Innovation? In a move that many in the crypto industry are celebrating, the FDIC also recently abolished the customer reputation risk assessment criteria for banks. This criterion had been a point of contention and criticism, often viewed as a tool that could be used to stifle the growth and development of the cryptocurrency industry. Let’s understand why removing this criterion is significant for crypto regulation and innovation: Eliminating Subjectivity: The “customer reputation risk” criterion was inherently subjective and vaguely defined. This lack of clarity could lead to inconsistent application and potentially discriminatory practices against businesses or sectors perceived as “risky,” including the cryptocurrency industry. Leveling the Playing Field: By removing this criterion, the FDIC is arguably leveling the playing field for crypto businesses seeking banking services. It reduces the potential for banks to deny services based on perceived reputational risks associated with the crypto industry, rather than focusing on objective risk assessments. Encouraging Innovation: The abolition of this criterion can be seen as a signal that regulators are becoming more receptive to innovation within the financial sector. It suggests a move away from potentially biased or outdated perceptions of the crypto industry and towards a more pragmatic and objective approach to risk assessment.

This initial rally was fuelled by bullish catalysts, including the announcement by Trump-backed WLFI to launch a stablecoin on Ethereum and BNB Chain , as well as the successful deployment of the Pectra upgrade. Ethereum Price Action | ETHUSD However, the landscape shifted dramatically following President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs, which sparked widespread losses across financial markets. Ethereum was among the hardest hit, with its price plunging 6% to trade as low as $1,870 on Friday. As of press time, ETH price had recovered slightly to $1,895. The accompanying rise in trading volumes suggests that Ethereum could face additional selling pressure in the coming sessions. Ethereum Bulls Suffer Largest Losses Amid $450M Market Liquidations Ethereum’s spot market performance positioned it as the hardest-hit asset, leading total liquidations in the past 24 hours. Data from the derivatives markets indicates that many over-leveraged bullish traders were caught off guard. According to Coinglass , total crypto liquidations reached $449.89 million, with Ethereum alone accounting for $136.21 million—the highest among all cryptocurrencies. This underscores the heightened volatility and risk associated with leveraged trading in the current market environment.

Institutions must report crypto activity, preserving monitoring without pre-approval. The update reflects regulatory practice aligning traditional banking with digital trends. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued new guidance this week that cleared the way for supervised banks in the United States to engage in crypto-related activities without seeking prior approval, signaling a shift in its regulatory stance. Outlined in Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-2025) , the policy rescinded a 2022 requirement that banks notify the FDIC before starting any crypto-related operations. The change is part of a broader reexamination of how federal agencies treat digital assets in the banking sector. FDIC Updates Crypto Oversight: Notification Still Required, Approval Dropped FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill said the new guidance marked a departure from the more restrictive policies implemented over the past three years. “I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto- and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards,” Hill stated. Under the revised policy , FDIC-supervised banks are now allowed to pursue crypto-related services, provided they manage associated risks and comply with existing regulations on safety and soundness. BREAKING: The FDIC says institutions & banks can engage in crypto activities without prior approval BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/DbcrDXqqeB — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) March 28, 2025 While prior approval is no longer necessary, banks must still notify the FDIC if they are already involved in or intend to pursue crypto activities. The agency will then review the submitted information and may provide feedback or further supervision. Still, the agency remains cautious. The FDIC stated that while it recognizes ongoing developments in financial services, crypto-related activities continue to pose risks — including those tied to market volatility, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering compliance. The agency also confirmed it will continue collaborating with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets and other banking regulators to refine its oversight of digital asset activities across the financial system. Wider Regulatory Context and Coordination This change comes amid growing calls for federal banking regulators to provide clearer guidance on crypto integration. The FDIC said it would work with other federal agencies to revise outdated interagency statements related to digital assets and banking. Although the new stance reduces regulatory friction, oversight remains in place. Banks must still demonstrate that they can conduct crypto-related operations safely while protecting customers and complying with legal standards. FDIC Reconsiders Crypto Restrictions Following Industry Pushback For years, U.S. banks that experimented with crypto services encountered regulatory obstacles. Some reportedly received informal warnings instructing them to pause activities such as digital asset custody and tokenized deposits. Industry figures referred to these efforts as part of “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” — an alleged campaign to restrict lawful crypto services through opaque enforcement rather than public rulemaking. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill cited over 20 instances where banks were discouraged from offering crypto services without any formal regulatory process. Hill called for a reevaluation of how rules like the Bank Secrecy Act are applied, warning against their misuse to deny lawful banking access. In response to both internal reviews and external pressure, the FDIC now appears to be taking a more open position. Recent discussions suggest growing interest in blockchain-based infrastructure and tokenized deposits. The agency has also removed “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision — a change that follows the Senate Banking Committee’s passage of the Fair Access to Banking Act (FIRM Act). The move aligns with a similar decision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and may signal a more consistent approach across federal banking agencies. Crypto commentators, including David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, welcomed the decision. Big win for crypto: @FDICgov is following @USOCC 's lead in removing “reputational risk” as a factor in bank supervision. “Reputational risk” may sound good in theory, but it was defined as “the potential that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices,… https://t.co/IAtw5JnykS — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 25, 2025 Advocates say it may help establish a more transparent regulatory environment for banks engaged in lawful digital asset services. With this shift from the FDIC, banks now face fewer procedural obstacles when entering the crypto space — though regulatory compliance and sound risk management remain mandatory. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How could banks refine risk controls in crypto operations under this new approach? Banks adopt integrated risk management by merging traditional controls with new digital safeguards. Frequent system audits, stress evaluations, and data analysis routines help maintain secure crypto frameworks. How might banks protect customers amid evolving crypto oversight? Institutions combine digital safety steps with usual methods to secure transactions. Regular internal reviews and data checks work to lower risks, keeping operations compliant with established practices. What future adjustments could shape digital banking trends? Regulators might adjust crypto rules prompting banks to upgrade digital systems and risk controls. This shift pushes banks to enhance their digital practices while ensuring secure, compliant operations.

OpenAI just dropped a bombshell in the world of AI image generation. ChatGPT, your go-to chatbot, has leveled up its visual game with a brand-new image generator. Remember those charming Studio Ghibli-esque images flooding your feeds? That’s just the tip of the iceberg. But beyond the artistic flair, the real story lies in OpenAI’s surprising decision to loosen its grip on content moderation . Let’s dive deep into what this means for the future of AI and digital content. Why is OpenAI Relaxing ChatGPT’s Image Safeguards? For a long time, ChatGPT played it safe, refusing prompts that ventured into controversial territory. Public figures? Hateful symbols? Certain racial features? Forbidden! But this week, the script flipped. OpenAI announced a significant shift, moving away from blanket bans to a more nuanced approach. According to Joanne Jang, OpenAI’s model behavior lead, it’s all about “embracing humility” and adapting as they learn. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental change in how OpenAI views its role in controlling AI-generated content. Here’s a breakdown of the key policy updates: Public Figures Welcome: No more AI image generator vetoes for Donald Trump, Elon Musk, or your favorite (or not-so-favorite) celebrity. OpenAI is stepping back from deciding who’s image-worthy. Hateful Symbols in Context: Swastikas and similar symbols are now permissible for educational or neutral purposes, as long as they don’t promote extremism. Context is king! Nuance in ‘Offensive’ Content: Requests about physical characteristics (like “make eyes more Asian”) are no longer automatically rejected. ChatGPT aims for precision, not blanket refusals. The Impact of Uncensoring ChatGPT’s AI Image Generator This policy evolution has significant implications, both positive and potentially risky. Let’s explore: Potential Benefits: Increased User Freedom: Users gain more control over content creation, fostering creativity and diverse perspectives. Enhanced Realism and Utility: For tasks like historical visualization or educational materials, depicting real-world figures and symbols becomes crucial. Pushing AI Boundaries: By tackling sensitive topics, OpenAI is actively learning and refining its models in complex ethical landscapes. Potential Challenges: Misinformation and Deepfakes: Looser restrictions could open doors for malicious use, including creating deceptive images of public figures. Offensive Content Proliferation: While contextual, allowing hateful symbols risks normalizing or trivializing them, especially if context is misinterpreted. Ethical Minefield: Navigating the line between free expression and harmful content is incredibly complex and requires constant vigilance. ChatGPT’s New Image Capabilities: Beyond Content Policy It’s not just about content moderation; the underlying generative AI technology in ChatGPT’s image generator has received a serious upgrade. Early users are raving about: Studio Ghibli Magic: The viral sensation is real! ChatGPT excels at creating images in specific artistic styles. Improved Image Editing: Refining and tweaking generated images is now smoother and more effective. Text Rendering Prowess: Getting AI to accurately render text in images has been a hurdle, but ChatGPT shows significant progress. Spatial Reasoning: The AI demonstrates a better understanding of spatial relationships within images, leading to more coherent and realistic compositions. However, it’s not a complete free-for-all. ChatGPT still maintains safeguards, particularly around child safety, and continues to restrict mimicking living individual artists’ styles. This raises ongoing questions about AI copyright and fair use, especially concerning training datasets. Remember the debate about using copyrighted works to train AI? It’s far from settled. Navigating the AI Content Moderation Minefield OpenAI’s move comes amidst a broader “culture war” around content moderation in AI. Google’s Gemini faced backlash for biased image generation, and political scrutiny is intensifying. Republican Congressman Jim Jordan even questioned tech giants about potential censorship collusion. OpenAI insists its changes are about user empowerment and technological maturity, not politics. But timing is everything. With potential regulatory shifts under a new administration, relaxing guardrails now could be strategically advantageous. Major platforms like Meta and X are also leaning towards less restrictive content policies. The industry seems to be collectively recalibrating its approach to online content. While viral Studio Ghibli memes are fun, the long-term impact of these policy shifts on AI ethics and societal implications remains to be seen. Can ChatGPT walk the tightrope between free expression and responsible AI? Only time will tell. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for AI Content OpenAI’s decision to peel back ChatGPT’s safeguards is a bold, perhaps even risky, move. It signals a significant shift in the AI landscape, prioritizing user freedom and pushing the boundaries of what AI can create. While the immediate effects are captivating – think stunning AI art and viral trends – the deeper implications for content moderation, ethical AI development, and the potential for misuse are crucial conversations we need to have. This is a pivotal moment, and the path OpenAI forges will undoubtedly influence the future of AI and its role in our digital world.

A Golden Pocket is a key Fibonacci retracement area that is often used to identify potential support and resistance levels. It represents a complete trend reversal for a cryptocurrency and a possibility of an aggressive uptrend. The TradingView analyst has revealed that XRP’s current Golden Pocket aligns with an imbalance zone, an area of unfilled liquidity where prices typically revisit before resuming movement. In the chart, XRP’s Golden Pocket sits between the 0.618 – 0.65 Fibonacci retracement level — a well-known area where the price usually finds strong support before continuing the trend. Historically, XRP has reacted twice from this key level, indicating that buyers have been actively defending this area. TehThomas has predicted that as long as the XRP price can hold above the key Fibonacci retracement level, which also acts as a critical resistance, the cryptocurrency’s bullish structure will remain unchanged. Additionally, XRP could be primed for a massive rally toward the 0.618 Fibonacci extension level, which corresponds with the upper boundary of the Ascending Channel. If this bullish momentum continues, it means that the analyst expects the XRP price to see a rally to a target between the $2.8 to – $2.9 range. This represents a 29% price increase from XRP’s current price of $2.2. Short-Term Resistance Could Trigger Decline TehThomas’s bullish outlook for the XRP price, the TradingView analyst noted that the 1-hour time frame presents short-term resistance, which could lead to a significant pullback before the next leg up. XRP recently faced a rejection at the imbalance zone, indicating that sellers are increasing activity at this level. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Loses Over $3 Billion In 3 Months Amid Market Turmoil Previously, when the price struggled to break the imbalance zone, it highlighted a lack of liquidity to sustain a continued uptrend. A repeat of this could result in a retracement toward the Golden Pocket in the 4-hour timeframe. Notably, a confirmed breakout from the 1-hour imbalance timeframe could reinforce XRP’s bullish momentum, supporting its projected move toward upper levels of the Ascending Channel. However, a failure could shift this bullish structure, leading to a deeper correction toward lower support levels.

Are we witnessing a shift in power? Renowned research and brokerage firm Bernstein has ignited a fascinating debate, suggesting that Robinhood crypto , the platform known for democratizing finance, is strategically positioned for more robust growth than crypto giant Coinbase. This bold prediction hinges on Robinhood’s superior product pipeline and a crypto strategy that analysts believe is built for scalability and wider appeal. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing analysis and explore what it means for the future of crypto investing. Why Bernstein is Betting Big on Robinhood Crypto Bernstein analysts have painted a compelling picture, likening Robinhood to “Schwab elite banking, but for everyone.” This powerful analogy speaks volumes about Robinhood’s potential. But what exactly fuels this bullish outlook on Robinhood crypto ? Scalable Revenue Lines: Bernstein emphasizes Robinhood’s diverse and scalable revenue streams. Unlike Coinbase, which heavily relies on trading fees, Robinhood has cultivated multiple avenues for growth. This diversification provides a buffer against market volatility and positions them for long-term sustainability. Bullish Crypto Strategy: The analysts are particularly impressed with Robinhood’s proactive and forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency. They see Robinhood’s crypto strategy as more adaptable and growth-oriented compared to Coinbase’s. Accessibility and User Experience: Robinhood has always prioritized user-friendliness and accessibility. This “for everyone” ethos resonates deeply with a broad audience, potentially attracting a larger pool of crypto investors, especially as crypto adoption continues to expand beyond early adopters. Potential Beneficiary of Pro-Crypto Policies: The report highlights a crucial external factor: the potential impact of a pro-crypto political landscape, particularly under a hypothetical U.S. President Trump administration. Traditional fintech platforms like Robinhood are poised to be significant beneficiaries of policies that foster crypto innovation and adoption. Coinbase Competition: Is Margin Pressure a Real Threat? While Bernstein is optimistic about Robinhood, their analysis presents a contrasting view of Coinbase. The report suggests that Coinbase faces a more challenging landscape, particularly regarding Coinbase competition and margin pressure. Why the concern? Investor Uncertainty: Bernstein notes that Coinbase is “harder to understand” for investors. This perceived complexity might stem from its more specialized focus on crypto trading and its reliance on transaction fees, which can be volatile and subject to market fluctuations. Rising Competition: The crypto exchange market is becoming increasingly crowded. New players are emerging, and traditional financial institutions are entering the space, intensifying the Coinbase competition . This heightened competition could squeeze margins and impact profitability. Margin Pressure Concerns: With increased competition comes pressure on fees and margins. If Coinbase needs to lower its fees to remain competitive, it could impact its revenue and profitability, leading to margin pressure. It’s important to note that Bernstein’s analysis isn’t necessarily negative on Coinbase’s long-term prospects, but rather highlights potential headwinds and suggests that Robinhood is currently better positioned for accelerated growth within the current market dynamics. The Trump Card: How Pro-Crypto Policies Could Reshape the Landscape The political climate plays a significant role in the cryptocurrency industry. DL News reported that Bernstein’s bullish outlook on Robinhood is partly tied to the potential for a more favorable regulatory environment under a pro-crypto stance, particularly associated with former U.S. President Trump. How could this impact the fintech crypto space? Benefiting Traditional Fintechs: Pro-crypto policies could pave the way for traditional fintech companies like Robinhood to further integrate and expand their crypto offerings. This could include clearer regulatory guidelines, reduced compliance burdens, and increased institutional adoption of crypto assets. Mainstream Adoption Catalyst: A supportive regulatory environment can boost mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. As governments become more accepting and create clearer frameworks, it can instill confidence in both retail and institutional investors, driving growth for the entire crypto ecosystem. Innovation and Growth: Reduced regulatory uncertainty can foster innovation within the fintech crypto sector. Companies will be more inclined to invest in new crypto products and services, knowing the regulatory landscape is becoming more predictable and supportive. Navigating the Crypto Investment Landscape: Key Takeaways The Bernstein analysis offers valuable insights for anyone involved in or observing the cryptocurrency market. What are the actionable takeaways from this report, especially regarding crypto investment strategies? Key Insight Actionable Implication Robinhood’s diversified revenue and user-friendly approach are seen as strengths. Consider Robinhood’s potential for long-term growth in the crypto space. Investors might find it appealing for broader market exposure beyond just crypto trading. Coinbase faces increasing competition and potential margin pressure. Monitor Coinbase’s strategies to navigate competition and maintain profitability. Investors should be aware of potential volatility due to market pressures. Pro-crypto policies could benefit traditional fintechs. Keep an eye on regulatory developments and political shifts that could impact the crypto and fintech sectors. Favorable policies could be a significant growth catalyst. The Future of Crypto Exchanges: A Glimpse into Tomorrow Bernstein’s perspective provides a fascinating lens through which to view the future of cryptocurrency exchanges. The analysis suggests a potential paradigm shift where platforms with broader appeal, diversified revenue streams, and proactive crypto strategies, like Robinhood, could emerge as dominant players. While Coinbase remains a significant force, the increasing crypto investment landscape and competitive pressures require constant adaptation and innovation. Ultimately, the crypto exchange arena is dynamic and constantly evolving. The insights from Bernstein’s analysis are a crucial piece of the puzzle, highlighting the strategic advantages and challenges facing key players like Robinhood and Coinbase. As the crypto market matures and regulatory landscapes evolve, the battle for market share and investor attention will undoubtedly intensify, making it a space to watch closely.

42556480,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144461,1743209402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,CoreWeave’s Risky Nasdaq Debut: A Critical Moment for the AI Cloud Sector,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coreweave-nasdaq-debut-analysis/,"The buzz around Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been deafening, and companies riding this wave are under intense scrutiny. Today marked a significant moment as CoreWeave, a prominent GPU cloud provider deeply intertwined with the cryptocurrency mining world through its partnership with Core Scientific, commenced trading on the Nasdaq. Under the ticker “CRWV,” the company stepped into the public market spotlight, but the initial reception wasn’t exactly the triumphant fanfare many anticipated. Let’s delve into the details of this CoreWeave Nasdaq Debut and what it signifies for the broader tech landscape. CoreWeave Nasdaq Debut: Hype vs. Reality? According to reports from CoinDesk, CRWV stock began its Nasdaq journey at $39 per share. This opening price was already a notch below the anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of $40. The stock didn’t rally upwards from there; instead, it experienced a further dip, settling around the $37 mark shortly after trading commenced. This lukewarm reception is noteworthy, especially considering the pre-IPO hype surrounding CoreWeave. CoreWeave’s IPO was a substantial $1.5 billion affair, attracting significant attention, particularly because of a notable investor – NVIDIA. The semiconductor giant, an early backer of CoreWeave, injected a hefty $250 million into this IPO. NVIDIA’s involvement added considerable weight and credibility to CoreWeave’s market entry. Yet, despite this powerful endorsement, the initial trading performance suggests that the market’s enthusiasm might be tempered by underlying concerns. Decoding CRWV Stock Performance: What’s Behind the Initial Dip? Bloomberg technology columnist Dave Lee offered some insightful perspectives on why CRWV stock might not have soared as expected right out of the gate. He suggests several factors that could be weighing on investor sentiment: Massive Debt Burden: CoreWeave reportedly carries a significant amount of debt. High debt levels can make investors nervous, especially in a fluctuating economic climate. It raises questions about the company’s financial flexibility and its ability to manage repayments, potentially impacting profitability. Client Concentration Risks: Dependence on a small number of large clients is another point of concern. If CoreWeave relies heavily on just a few major customers for the bulk of its revenue, the loss of even one key client could severely impact its financial health. This lack of revenue diversification creates vulnerability. Revenue Diversity Challenges: Expanding on the previous point, Lee highlights the potential lack of revenue diversity. A company with a broad range of revenue streams is generally considered more stable and resilient. If CoreWeave’s revenue is concentrated in a narrow sector or service offering, it might be perceived as riskier. These points, while diagnostic, are crucial for understanding the market’s initial reaction to the CoreWeave Nasdaq Debut . Investors are likely scrutinizing these fundamental aspects of the company’s business model as they assess its long-term viability and growth potential. GPU Cloud Provider in the Spotlight: More Than Just Crypto While CoreWeave has ties to the cryptocurrency world, particularly through its partnership with Core Scientific, it’s essential to recognize its primary identity as a GPU cloud provider . In today’s tech landscape, this is a powerful position to be in. Here’s why GPU cloud providers are becoming increasingly vital: The AI Revolution Driver: GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are the workhorses of the AI revolution. They are exceptionally efficient at handling the complex computations required for machine learning, deep learning, and other AI applications. As AI adoption explodes across industries, the demand for GPU cloud services is surging. Beyond Gaming and Graphics: While GPUs were initially developed for gaming and graphics-intensive tasks, their capabilities extend far beyond. They are now indispensable for scientific research, data analytics, video editing, and, of course, cryptocurrency mining (though CoreWeave’s primary focus seems to be shifting towards AI). Scalability and Flexibility: Cloud-based GPU services offer unparalleled scalability and flexibility. Businesses can access vast amounts of GPU computing power on demand, without the massive upfront investment and maintenance costs associated with owning and managing their own hardware. This is particularly attractive for startups and companies with fluctuating computing needs. CoreWeave, as a specialized GPU cloud provider , is strategically positioned to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for AI computing infrastructure. However, the challenges highlighted by Dave Lee suggest that navigating this rapidly evolving market will require careful financial management and strategic diversification. NVIDIA Investment and AI Industry Implications: A Wind Vane for the Future? NVIDIA investment in CoreWeave’s IPO is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a strong signal of confidence in the company’s potential and the broader AI industry . NVIDIA is at the heart of the AI revolution, manufacturing the very GPUs that power these cloud services. Their backing carries significant weight and suggests a long-term strategic alignment. Dave Lee’s assertion that CoreWeave will serve as a “wind vane for the entire AI industry ” is particularly compelling. Here’s why CoreWeave’s journey on the public market is so closely watched: AI Cloud Market Health Indicator: CoreWeave’s stock performance and overall business trajectory will provide valuable insights into the health and maturity of the AI cloud market. Its successes and struggles will reflect broader trends and challenges within this sector. Investor Appetite for AI Pure-Plays: The market’s reception to CoreWeave will gauge investor appetite for pure-play AI infrastructure companies. Are investors ready to bet big on companies solely focused on providing the computing power for AI, or are they more cautious? Validation of the GPU Cloud Model: CoreWeave’s performance will, to some extent, validate or challenge the viability and scalability of the GPU cloud service model. Its ability to overcome challenges like debt and client concentration will be closely scrutinized by competitors and new entrants in the space. Navigating the AI Industry Challenges: A Risky Bet or Calculated Move? The AI industry is undeniably brimming with potential, but it’s also a landscape fraught with challenges. CoreWeave’s CoreWeave Nasdaq Debut comes at a time when the broader economic environment is uncertain, and investor sentiment can be volatile. The company’s success is not guaranteed, and the initial stock performance underscores the inherent risks. However, risk often goes hand-in-hand with high reward. If CoreWeave can effectively manage its debt, diversify its client base and revenue streams, and capitalize on the ever-increasing demand for AI computing power, it has the potential to become a major player in the cloud computing landscape. The NVIDIA investment and the sheer momentum behind the AI revolution are significant tailwinds in its favor. Ultimately, CoreWeave’s journey on the Nasdaq will be a fascinating case study. It’s a test of investor confidence in the AI cloud sector, a measure of the viability of specialized GPU cloud providers, and a real-time experiment in navigating the complexities of a rapidly evolving technological frontier. Keep a close watch on CRWV stock – it’s likely to be a bellwether for the AI industry for months and years to come.

One of the Most Trusted Buy Signals in Bitcoin Just Flashed,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-this-btcs-bottom-one-of-the-most-trusted-buy-signals-in-bitcoin-just-flashed/,"Bitcoin’s price has drawn renewed attention following the activation of a historically reliable on-chain signal—the Hash Ribbon indicator. Currently trading around $84,500 after a 3.9% drop over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin (BTC) is under pressure from broader macro uncertainty. However, the Hash Ribbon , which measures miner stress and recovery using 30-day and 60-day hash rate moving averages, has now flashed its eighth major buy signal in BTC’s history. $BTC Hash Ribbon indicator has appear a buy signal.

Tony Severino, a Chartered Market Technician, flagged bearish divergences between price action and momentum indicators. “BTC is making higher highs while the RSI posts lower highs. That’s not bullish—it’s a red flag,” he noted. BTC remains below the 50-period EMA near $86,000, reinforcing short-term bearish structure. The RSI sits around 36, rebounding from oversold levels, but lacks momentum. Unless BTC breaks above $86,800, recovery remains uncertain. Macroeconomic Headwinds Add Caution Even with the bullish on-chain signal, macro forces loom large. Strong U.S. economic data—Q4 GDP revised to 3.4% and jobless claims declining—supports a hawkish Fed stance, dampening appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions are flaring again with Trump’s proposed 25% auto tariffs, set for April 2. While gold surged to an all-time high of $3,059 on the news, BTC hasn’t mirrored the safe-haven rally. This divergence has left some questioning Bitcoin’s role as digital gold. Jamie Coutts of Real Vision noted, “Hash Ribbons are a solid signal, but broader conditions aren’t aligning like previous cycles.” With Wall Street returning post-holiday and ETF flows stabilizing, short-term direction may depend on how BTC reacts to upcoming inflation data. Gold hits $3,059 ATH while BTC lags behind Trump’s tariffs add to global economic anxiety ETF inflows flatline amid mixed crypto sentiment Bitcoin Consolidates Near $84.5K Amid Cooling Bearish Pressure BTC is stabilizing near $84,500 after a sharp drop, finding short-term support at $83,000. The RSI is rebounding from oversold levels, hinting at fading bearish momentum. However, BTC remains below the 50-EMA at $86,000, keeping the near-term bias bearish. Upside target : Break above $86,800 could trigger a rally toward $88,800 Downside risk : Drop below $83,000 may expose $81,200 Market tone : Cautious, with $34B daily volume and 2.86% drop BTC is consolidating in a narrowing range, with macro catalysts likely to dictate the next move.

Peter Brandt Predicts $65,635 Bearish Target",https://coingape.com/markets/why-is-bitcoin-price-down-today-peter-brandt-predicts-65635-bearish-target/,"Bitcoin price plunged below $85,000 on Friday, hitting $84,200 at its lowest point as market-wide selling pressure triggered massive liquidations. Bitcoin Price Tumbles Below $85,000, Sparking $116 Million Long Liquidation Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the critical $85,000 support level on Friday, hitting a low of $84,200 as selling pressure intensified. At press time, BTC remains under pressure, reflecting broader market weakness and increasing liquidation risks. Bitcoin price analysis | BTCUSD, March 29 | Source: CoinMarketCap The sharp BTC price decline contributed to a total of $400 million in crypto liquidations, with $116 million in Bitcoin long positions wiped out. More so, on Thursday, wallets linked to the U.S. government transferred 97 BTC and 884 ETH, sparking speculations that a sell-off could follow. However, the transaction appears to align with the federal government’s efforts to consolidate its crypto holdings following Trump’s executive order issued on March 6. As outlined in the fact sheet , the order mandates federal agencies to report their cryptocurrency holdings within 30 days to the Secretary of the Treasury. This suggests that the $10.3 million in BTC and ETH transfers may be part of a broader asset consolidation initiative, rather than an immediate liquidation event. Peter Brandt Predicts $65,635 Bearish Target Veteran trader Peter Brandt has issued a stark bearish warning for Bitcoin, citing a bear wedge breakdown with a potential downside target of $65,635. His technical analysis, shared on X, highlights a completed bearish pattern following a double top formation. “Don’t shoot the messenger. Just reporting on what the chart says until it says something different. Bear wedge completed with 2X target from the double top at 65,635,” Peter Brandt, March 28, 2025 Brandt’s chart illustrates Bitcoin’s rejection at $92,070, followed by a series of lower highs and a tightening wedge pattern. Bitcoin price prediction | Source: X.com/PeterBrandt The breakdown below $85,285 confirms the bearish trajectory, reinforcing concerns of a deeper correction. If BTC continues on this path, a retest of $75,000 could come before reaching the projected downside of $65,635. As selling pressure mounts, traders remain cautious about Bitcoin’s next moves. Whether bulls can reclaim key levels or if further downside awaits will largely depend on macroeconomic developments and investor sentiment in the coming days.

Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) at $2.45 is gaining momentum, fueled by legal victories and increasing use in cross-border payments. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) successfully thrives as an operation during this period. MUTM tokens proceed through their fourth presale stage at the current price of $0.025. Since its launch The project has accumulated $5.7 million from 7400+ holders. Moving forward with MUTM purchases today will bring a minimum profit of 3 times the value when Mutuum Finance launches at $0.06 and represents potential 50 times returns if the token reaches $3 during 2025. Mutuum Finance: Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance positions itself as an appealing investment option that draws strong support from investors. Mutuum Finance offers a new definition for decentralized finance by developing a next-generation dual-lending method consisting of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology. Smart contracts through the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model manage lending pools by accepting USDT stablecoins and issuing loans with ETH asset security. Users achieve complete ownership of confidential loan arrangements through Peer-to-Peer (P2P) since this model does not require intermediaries. The dual system achieves maximum security combined with adaptive operations while delivering profits through current APY rates reaching up to 10% for liquidity providers. Built for Security, Stability & Growth Mutuum Finance dedicates itself to security combined with transparency by conducting thorough third-party audits while deploying open-source smart contracts to establish trust. Platform stability improvements will come from launching a stablecoin backed by USD in addition to implementing fee-supported token buyback operations which will uphold price stability for the long term. Through the feature of staking rewards stakeholders receive incentives to maintain their liquidity which bolsters overall confidence within the ecosystem. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 7400 investors. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity The Phase 3 presale opens an exceptional opportunity for people to buy MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.025. MUTM token prices will increase gradually from $0.025 to $0.06 through 11 price stages of the sale period allowing investors to attain 140% return before trading begins. The market experts believe MUTM tokens will reach the $3 milestone following its launch thus becoming one of the foremost DeFi tokens in 2025. During phase 5 investors can acquire MUTM tokens at $0.03 price level which delivers up to 95% instant profit to those who purchased in the initial stage and the current capital level has crossed $5.7 million. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives Mutuum Finance intends to boost adoption by running a $100,000 giveaway that will award 10 participants with $10,000 MUTM tokens each. A referral system provides more benefits to users who successfully connect new investors to the platform which speeds up the community growth rate and user interaction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains strong investor demand through its ongoing presale which produced $5.7 million from more than 7400 token holders. During Phase 4 investors purchase MUTM tokens at $0.025 but Phase 5 will cost $0.03 before the token launches for $0.06 which brings a 140% ROI. That analysis indicates sustained market expansion until 2025 when MUTM will reach minimum price targets exceeding $3. MUTM’s dual lending model that merges P2C and P2P systems brings enhanced security and efficiency and decentralization power to boost its DeFi competition in the market. The crypto project benefits from early adoption through a $100,000 capital giveaway which is paired with referral rewards so the growing community increases market demand.

The transfer of ownership of X to xAI on March 28 means that the class-action lawsuit against Musk — accusing him of defrauding former Twitter shareholders by delaying the disclosure of his initial investment in the social media platform — has become “a whole lot spicer,” Cinneamhain Ventures partner Adam Cochran said in a March 28 X post. Acquisition may open up xAI to more ‘exposure’ On the same day that Musk said “xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” a US judge reportedly rejected Musk’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit. Cochran said it has “opened up his AI entity to exposure here too, and it’s a much bigger pie.” Source: Grok Musk said the deal values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, factoring in $12 billion in debt from the $45 billion valuation. He originally bought X, formerly Twitter, for around $44 billion in April 2022 . “xAI and X’s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,” Musk said. Source: Bryan Rosenblatt “This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI’s advanced AI capability and expertise with X’s massive reach,” he said, adding: “This will allow us to build a platform that doesn’t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.” However, Cochran claimed that “Musk used his pumped up xAI stock to pay multiple times over value for X, but still take an $11B loss on the transaction.” He said that Musk is “screwing over xAI investors, and X investors” and was executed to sell user data to xAI. Related: Elon Musk’s ‘government efficiency’ team turns its sights to SEC — Report xAI is best known for its AI chatbot “Grok” which is built into the X platform. When Musk released it in November 2023, he claimed it could outperform OpenAI’s first iteration of ChatGPT in several academic tests . Source: Raoul Pal Musk explained at the time that the motivation behind building Grok is to create AI tools equipped to assist humanity by empowering research and innovation. While Cochran said that Grok being valued at $80 billion is an “insanely dumb valuation,” crypto developer “Keef” disagrees.

As per a letter sent to several key regulatory officials, the senators asked what regulatory agencies plan to do about these concerns as lawmakers seek to move forward with stablecoin legislation. WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin sparks controversy The stablecoin, USD1, is backed by WLFI, which President Trump and his family hold major stakes in. The Trump family involvement creates a potential conflict of interest that could pose serious risks to the nation’s financial system.’ The letter was signed by five Democratic lawmakers in the US Senate The write-up was addressed to Michelle Bowman, the chair of the Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation committee, and Rodney Hood, the acting Comptroller of the Currency. The lawmakers specifically inquired how the agencies plan to regulate WLFI and its newly launched USD1 stablecoin. The letter came as members of Congress are considering legislation to regulate stablecoins through the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act. If signed into law, the bill would essentially allow the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Federal Reserve to oversee stablecoin regulation, including for issuers like WLFI and its USD1 coin. The senators argue that the rollout of a stablecoin overseen by a sitting president poses exceptional risks. “President Trump’s involvement in this venture, as he strips financial regulators of their independence and Congress simultaneously considers stablecoin legislation, presents an extraordinary conflict of interest that could create unprecedented risks to our financial system,” the letter states. Lawmakers warn of Trump’s financial ties influencing stablecoin regulation The senators are concerned about potential conflicts between Trump’s financial interests and the regulatory decisions that will be made by agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The financial ties raise the question, the letter states, of whether financial regulators will make decisions influenced by whether the Trump family — which owns 60% of WLFI’s equity — will benefit. Furthermore, Trump’s executive order in February 2024 has been noted to make the fears worse. The order put federal agencies — including the OCC — on notice to regularly consult the White House on their priorities, potentially handing the president excessive leeway over financial regulation. Such an arrangement, the senators say, also aggravates the existing conflict of interest surrounding the stablecoin. The USD1 stablecoin offered by WLFI saw its launch in late March 2025 and is viewed as a direct competition in the fast-growing digital currency space. Launched on major blockchain platforms, including Ethereum and BNB Chain, details about the company alongside its project have been largely mysterious, fostering additional scepticism among critics. WLFI’s $550M token sales and Trump family ties spark regulatory and ethical concerns Since its launch in September 2024, WLFI has completed two public token sales, raising a total of $550 million. The project has attracted interest for its political connections, with Donald Trump Jr. pitching the stablecoin at the DC Blockchain Summit in March 2025 and playing a role in the push for the coin. The Trump family owns a majority stake in the company. The senators say they are concerned about the potential risks stablecoins pose to the financial system. Still, they also ask for stronger regulatory action in the face of an increasingly widening debate in Congress over the regulation of stablecoins. If instituted, the GENIUS Act would put the OCC and the Federal Reserve at the nexus of regulating stablecoin companies like WLFI to ensure they are held to sophisticated financial standards. President Trump’s February 2024 executive order directing federal agencies to consult with White House officials regularly is facing heightened scrutiny in light of the launch of USD1. This order, which gives the president influence over financial regulators like the OCC and the Federal Reserve, is seen by critics as increasing the potential for conflicts of interest, especially as Trump’s family has major stakes in WLFI. Meanwhile, Congress is advancing the GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins), which is another attempt to regulate the risk posed by stablecoins as lawmakers throughout Congress move to address their unregulated aspects. The legislation aims to provide a consistent regulatory framework for stablecoins, granting the OCC and the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate the digital asset ecosystem. If passed, the legislation would impose strict regulatory standards on stablecoin issuers such as WLFI, increasing transparency and accountability in the sector.

The current breakdown has triggered a new worry among investors for a coin that had the prospect of reclaiming its spot among the top 10 largest digital currencies. The LINK price has fallen to $14.1, down 9.12% in the past 24 hours. This latest selloff has also raised the question of where the LINK floor is triggered. Bitcoin Price and Bollinger Bands Insight The Chainlink drawdown is steep and depends on the Bitcoin price selloff triggered by today’s US Core PCE figures . LINK has recorded more selloffs than most altcoins in the top 20 based on a percent decline over 24 hours. LINK has fared much better on longer timeframes, as the token is still up by 1% in the past 7 days. The token’s Year-to-Date (YTD) growth is 34.76%, making analysts wonder if more selloff is inbound. LINK/USDT Price Chart. Source: CoinMarketCap The LINK/USDT 4H Chart offers insight into the Chainlink price outlook. The current price is trading at the lower Bollinger Bands, $14.04. The deviation from the upper bands is a sign of intense volatility, which may or may not go well for the token. Over the past 30 days, the LINK price has not dropped below $13, which is now classified as the next support level to watch. LINK and Dependence on the General Market The broader market is divided on what is next for Chainlink. The Oracle service provider remains one of various institutional clients’ most used blockchain protocols. This means that the adoption of its services depends on the market or external factors. Besides this, the price action of Bitcoin and other altcoins is also a major determinant of its potential rebound. At the time of writing, the price of BTC has dropped to a new weekly low of $83,872.69, down by 3.77% in 24 hours. With the bearish outlook, Peter Brandt said Bitcoin price crashing to $70,000 is not impossible. With Chainlink’s dependence on Bitcoin, the altcoin may maintain its current outlook until the top coin prints a new rally. Major LINK Price Catalyst to Watch Per an earlier CoinGape report, Chainlink inked a deal with the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). This LINK partnership with ADGM will support the development of compliant frameworks for tokenized assets, expand blockchain adoption, and promote regulatory dialogue within the UAE and globally. In an earlier LINK price analysis , projections were made that this partnership may push the token’s price to a high of $44. For now, the protocol’s price action signals caution overall.

The billionaire in an X post that the total value of his xAI company is now $80 billion, and the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) is valued at $33 billion. He noted that the value of X is $45 billion when including $12 billion of debt. Musk also mentioned that the purchase of X by xAI was done through an all-stock transaction. XAI Holdings, the newly formed company, is valued at over $100 billion, excluding debt. Morgan Stanley served as the sole banker for the deal, representing both sides. Elon Musk shared that the futures of XAI and X are now closely linked. By combining xAI’s cutting-edge AI technology with X’s vast audience and resources, he believes that this move will unlock huge potential for both companies. A Stock Swap Since Musk owns both X and xAI, the deal is likely a stock swap, with X investors getting xAI shares. Both the companies have mutual investors including venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity, Vy Capital, and Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Co. Linda Yaccarino, who Musk hired as CEO of X, wrote in a post after Friday’s announcement, “The future could not be brighter.” “The move appears sensible, considering the current trend of increased investments in AI, data centres, and computing,” said analyst Paolo Pescatore, founder of PP Foresight. Elon Musk’s AI startup, xAI, founded in 2023, recently secured $6 billion in funding, bringing its valuation to $40 billion. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, cutting costs and pushing for less content moderation. This led to a significant drop in advertising revenue. Meanwhile, Musk’s xAI startup, which competes with OpenAI, has been promoting its chatbot, Grok, using data from X users. Musk Leading Tech and Government Reform Alongside leading Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, and overseeing X, Elon Musk has spent a lot of time in Washington, D.C., becoming a key figure in Donald Trump’s second administration. After donating nearly $300 million to Trump and other Republican causes for the 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he’s focused on cutting government jobs, reducing spending, and rolling back regulations. This position gives Musk the power to make changes that could benefit his business empire. With Trump back in office and Musk now in the executive branch, X has become the go-to platform for staying updated on the Trump administration.

The move comes as the Trump administration continues pushing USD1, a token issued by his family-owned company World Liberty Financial, into the heart of the U.S. economy. The letter was signed by Elizabeth Warren, Ranking Member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; Ron Wyden, Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee; Chris Van Hollen, Jack Reed, and Cory Booker, all of whom warned that Trump’s dual role as both regulator and private crypto issuer could blow a hole through every existing financial safeguard. They demanded that the Fed and OCC explain how they plan to prevent Trump from using his office to manipulate financial policy and protect his personal business interests. Democrats question Fed and OCC over Trump family’s USD1 The lawmakers said the launch of USD1 places Trump in a position to interfere with financial regulators just as Congress is reviewing the GENIUS Act, a bill that would give the Fed and OCC broad powers over stablecoin oversight. While the bill claims to strengthen crypto enforcement, the version now under review includes no limits on the President’s ability to override regulatory actions that could hurt the profitability of his own token. The senators warned that Trump could step in to block any OCC decision on USD1, demand they avoid setting strong rules for stablecoins, or even stop them from investigating World Liberty Financial altogether. They added that in a crisis, Trump could direct the Fed to launch a liquidity program specifically to prop up stablecoins like USD1—or worse, give special access to WLF by pushing the central bank to grant it a master account, something that would allow direct ties to the Federal Reserve system. The group also flagged the risk that Trump could deny this kind of help to other crypto competitors, creating a completely unfair playing field. They pressed both agencies to confirm whether they’ve put internal controls in place to block political interference and keep regulation, enforcement, and supervision free from White House orders. The senators asked directly: “How will you protect your independence when the President’s own company is the one being regulated?” GENIUS Act advances in Congress Since taking office, Trump has promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world” and claims the dollar-backed stablecoin is a step toward that goal. On March 7, Trump met with two dozen crypto executives at the White House and told attendees he wanted Congress to pass stablecoin legislation and send it to his desk by August. Bo Hines, a senior White House adviser focused on crypto, later said the bill could reach Trump for signing by May. The legislation, known as the GENIUS Act, passed through the Senate Banking Committee with an 18-6 vote. It even got support from five Democrats. But three of the five senators who signed the Friday letter—Warren, Van Hollen, and Reed—voted against it in committee. The other two, Booker and Wyden, aren’t on the committee but still raised concerns about the bill’s lack of checks on presidential power. The GENIUS Act is now headed to the Senate floor. If passed, it would hand stablecoin regulation to the Fed and OCC, but with no clear firewalls to keep the White House out of day-to-day decisions. That’s where the senators see a massive red flag: the very person who signs the bill could also block enforcement actions and tilt the system in favor of his own business.

After briefly touching higher levels of nearly $90,000, the asset has seen a 3.3% decrease over the past day, bringing its current price to roughly $84,222. While price volatility remains a short-term concern, Bitcoin’s broader trend shows signs of consolidation within this range. Amid the movement from BTC’s price, on-chain analysts are offering insights into Bitcoin’s behavior beyond the surface-level price action. Related Reading: CEO On Bitcoin: A Big Idea Whose Time Has Finally Come Bitcoin Mean Coin Age and Supply Dynamics in Focus A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Onchained points to Bitcoin’s Mean Coin Age (MCA) as a crucial metric for understanding current market sentiment. The MCA represents the average age of unspent transaction outputs (UTxOs), which can help reveal the behavior of long-term holders. According to Onchained, Bitcoin’s recent upward momentum is not a product of short-term speculation or news-driven hype. Rather, it is being influenced by the strategic actions of long-term holders. These participants typically acquire BTC during market downturns and hold through volatile phases, reducing the available supply and gradually increasing scarcity. This behavior creates conditions in which even moderate increases in demand can lead to stronger price responses due to reduced liquidity in the market. With Bitcoin’s supply capped at 21 million, the accumulation of coins by long-term holders contributes to a tightening of supply. As these coins become increasingly illiquid, they apply upward pressure on price when demand strengthens. This mechanism is a core feature of Bitcoin’s market dynamics and is viewed by some analysts as a signal of potential bullish continuation. Onchained wrote: This illiquidity creates a supply-demand imbalance, contributing to upward pressure on prices when demand increases. As fewer coins are available for trading, the price becomes more sensitive to buy-side pressure, leading to stronger upward price movements. Monitoring Behavioral Shifts for Market Signals The analysis also highlights the significance of a sudden drop in MCA, which can indicate long-term holders are beginning to move their coins. Such behavior may signal changing sentiment, profit-taking, or reactions to broader macroeconomic conditions. According to Onchained, “the movement of these coins from long-term holders can drive short-term volatility and is a signal that market dynamics are changing.” Onchained emphasized that relying solely on public commentary or high-profile announcements—such as regulatory statements, ETF launches, or tweets from influential figures—may distract from the deeper, data-driven trends that govern Bitcoin’s performance.

The analyst noted: The truth lies within the data itself. The blockchain speaks clearly and transparently, and it is through this data that we can understand bitcoin’s true movement. S.N architected Bitcoin to ensure that the financial information we need is open and accessible to all, so we can make informed decisions, not be misled by the stupidity of popular narratives. Let the data guide us, not the whims of outsiders who misunderstand what is truly happening.

While Cardano and TRON have focused on enhancing scalability and infrastructure, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking another route: making entry into crypto straightforward. Cardano leans on academic research while TRON prioritizes content decentralization, and both have achieved significant growth. BlockDAG, however, demonstrates that turning mining into a game can drive strong momentum. Its Tap Miner, accessed via Telegram, has attracted over 400,000 users by removing barriers to entry. With a presale haul exceeding $208 million and a 2,380% ROI from its first batch, BlockDAG suggests simplicity can unlock real growth. Cardano: A Blockchain Fueled by Peer-Reviewed Development Charles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, started Cardano (ADA) in 2015 to deliver a third-generation blockchain emphasizing long-term goals like interoperability, scalability, and sustainability. The platform is managed by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), known for its commitment to formal verification and research-based development. Cardano’s multi-stage fundraising, running from 2015 to 2017, raised $62.2 million, launching ADA at $0.0024. By September 2017, the platform went live with basic transactional capabilities. It utilizes Ouroboros, a Proof-of-Stake consensus system, and employs a dual-layer design—CSL for transactions and CCL for smart contracts—to maximize efficiency and security. Cardano has steadily progressed in adoption and technical upgrades. As of March 26, 2025, ADA is priced at $0.7456, showing a 13.63% annual increase. The asset sees daily trading volumes exceeding $1.1 billion, marking it as a major player in the blockchain space. TRON: Decentralized Media Sharing at Scale Founded by Justin Sun in 2017, TRON (TRX) aims to reshape digital content distribution by reducing intermediaries between creators and audiences. Its ICO, launched in September 2017 just before China’s crypto restrictions, brought in $70 million. Originally based on Ethereum, TRX migrated to its own blockchain by June 2018. TRON’s structure comprises three layers—Storage, Core, and Application—supporting smart contracts and decentralized apps. Its Delegated Proof-of-Stake model involves 27 elected Super Representatives managing block validation and governance. TRON continues to gain traction, especially in Asian markets. TRX is currently valued at $0.12, up from $0.10 one year earlier, reflecting a 20% annual rise. Its daily trading volume is close to $800 million. With its emphasis on performance, speed, and creator control, TRON remains a leading blockchain project. BlockDAG Made Mining Easy and Turned It Into a Viral Game Instead of relying on traditional mining models, BlockDAG launched Tap Miner—an engaging mobile game within Telegram—which has now brought in over 400,000 users. Over 100,000 people play it each day, proving that fun and accessibility can fuel high participation. Tap Miner removes the need for technical knowledge or hardware, offering a repeatable cycle: earn, upgrade, and keep playing. This gamified format removes entry barriers and encourages continuous use. Its impact isn’t just anecdotal—it’s statistically significant. According to BlockDAG’s CEO Antony Turner, Tap Miner’s performance has been outstanding. Over 800,000 users have joined the broader X1 Miner App platform, with TG Tap Miner acting as the initial gateway for many. This move to make crypto more approachable is paying off. BlockDAG has raised over $208 million in its ongoing presale, selling more than 18.9 billion coins. Its current batch 27 price sits at $0.0248, offering a 2,380% increase from its initial batch price. What BlockDAG is doing is shaping usage habits. Tap Miner is not a side feature—it’s the main engine drawing people into the project. Its simplicity and entertainment value are converting users into long-term participants. As the mainnet launch approaches, this early traction could turn into a solid foundation for broader growth and expansion. Final Remarks! The paths taken by Cardano and TRON are clearly defined—Cardano relies on academic development, and TRON empowers creators through direct access. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is focusing on a different strength: making crypto easier for everyone. With its 800,000-strong user base built through Tap Miner and the X1 Miner App, and an ROI of 2,380% from its first batch, BlockDAG is prioritizing engagement and reach over complexity. If ease of use becomes the key factor in the future of crypto, BlockDAG might be leading that charge rather than following it.

Avalanche offered speed and flexibility for developers and enterprises. But now, BlockDAG is entering the spotlight—not with just another tech upgrade, but by putting users at the center of the experience. Its team includes a respected cryptographer, a university professor, and a CEO focused on global inclusion. BlockDAG’s value lies not only in innovation but in how it turns technology into something people can use. Keynote 3 reflects this shift—away from theoretical promises and toward practical adoption. Chainlink: Bringing Smart Contracts & External Data Together Launched in 2017 by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis, Chainlink (LINK) was built to address the “oracle problem”—the need to connect smart contracts with off-chain data in a secure way. Its ICO ran from July to September 2017, offering tokens at $0.11 and raising about $32 million. The mainnet launched in 2019, giving developers access to decentralized oracles that feed data directly into smart contracts. As of March 26, 2025, LINK trades at $15.85, up 4.52% from the previous day but down 21.43% from its $20.18 value a year earlier. Still, it has grown 14,409% from its ICO price, showing that its early backers have seen long-term rewards. Chainlink’s role as a data bridge keeps it relevant, though its future growth may depend on how new use cases develop within the evolving smart contract landscape. Avalanche: Building for Speed & High-Volume Applications Avalanche (AVAX), created by Ava Labs and launched in September 2020, aims to be a fast and flexible platform for decentralized apps and enterprise-level blockchain solutions. Its July 2020 ICO raised about $42 million, with token prices starting at $0.50. On March 26, 2025, AVAX is priced at $22.76—up 1.15% from the day before. That figure marks a 4,452% increase since its ICO, highlighting its appeal to early investors. Avalanche’s tech supports fast finality and high throughput, making it ideal for DeFi and scalable custom blockchains. Its performance focus remains its biggest strength, and developers continue to explore Avalanche as a base for high-speed blockchain products. BlockDAG’s Leadership Team Is Designed for Real-World Impact At the heart of BlockDAG’s growing momentum is a leadership team with deep experience and a strong track record. CEO Antony Turner is steering global adoption efforts that have helped the project raise more than $208 million, sell 18.9 billion coins, and reach batch 27 at a token price of $0.0248. That’s a 2,380% return since batch one. Turner’s people-first approach has already attracted over 750,000 users through mobile mining apps. On the academic side, Maurice Herlihy—professor at Brown University and a leader in distributed computing—has played a key role in shaping the BlockDAG Academy. His work is giving both new and experienced developers the tools to learn and build on the platform. Security is in the hands of Dr. Youssef Khaoulaj, BlockDAG’s Chief Security Officer. A cryptographic engineer, he is building the infrastructure for a secure, fault-tolerant network. He’s also guiding third-party audits by Certik and Halborn to ensure that the mainnet launch meets industry-leading security standards. This blend of leadership—covering tech, education, and security—gives BlockDAG a foundation built to support long-term adoption, not just hype cycles. Execution & Real Utility Are Becoming the New Standard Chainlink tackled a key gap by enabling real-world data for smart contracts. Avalanche raised the bar with performance. Both have strong use cases. But BlockDAG is carving a new path—one built around accessibility, community tools, and real-world education. Its presale numbers, user engagement, and leadership team suggest something more than just another blockchain launch. BlockDAG is moving from theory to delivery, offering a model where technology and usability grow together. As crypto adoption evolves, the projects that succeed may be those that go beyond just being fast or smart—they’ll be the ones that are easy to use, well-supported, and secure by design. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 points in that direction—and it might just be the kind of blueprint the industry needs next.

As Shiba Inu sees renewed momentum and Meme Index approaches the end of a strong presale, both projects highlight how investor interest can spike with the right narrative. However, Dragoin offers something these others don’t: a structured, stage-based presale that actively rewards early commitment. While SHIB relies on trading volume and Meme Index leans into token aggregation, Dragoin’s Game of Thrones-inspired ecosystem stands out for its clear value proposition tied to early action. Its incremental pricing model doesn’t just incentivize speed—it makes financial sense. For many, it’s not just a meme—it’s strategy. Shiba Inu Surges on Bullish Momentum and Rising Volume Shiba Inu (SHIB) is gaining traction again, up 7% in the past 24 hours and 11% over the past week. This price movement, in turn, is backed by a 228% surge in trading volume, signaling growing bullish sentiment. Moreover, Open Interest has also climbed to $23.88 million, showing increased capital flowing into SHIB derivatives. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below 70, suggesting there’s still room for further upside before the asset becomes overbought. If buying pressure holds, SHIB could retest the $0.00003000 level and potentially aim for $0.00003300. On the other hand, if bears take over, a fallback to $0.00002300 or even $0.00002000 is possible. Consequently, traders are keeping a close eye on momentum indicators and support-resistance zones as SHIB’s price action unfolds. Overall, the current trend shows renewed interest, with data pointing toward optimism—but also caution as key levels are tested. Meme Index Nears $4M Presale Cap Ahead of Exchange Launch Meme Index is entering its final presale week with nearly $4 million already raised, capturing strong investor interest. Notably, the project introduces the world’s first meme coin index platform, offering users exposure to top meme coins through a single token. Through this approach, by using real-time data and community voting, the platform dynamically adjusts its index to track trending meme assets like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Bonk. Importantly, the native $MEME token plays a central role, giving holders both exposure and governance power. Following the presale, with listings set for Uniswap and centralized exchanges, $MEME is positioned to tap into meme coin momentum with a more structured approach. Additionally, its model rewards holders with airdrops, staking benefits, and rebalancing bonuses. As a result, as excitement builds ahead of its launch, the project stands out for combining meme culture with utility, giving traders a simplified way to engage with high-volatility assets. Strike Early, Gain More: Dragoin Rewards First Movers Dragoin’s 25-stage presale model isn’t just a launch strategy—it’s a calculated opportunity for investors who value timing and foresight. Specifically, with each stage, the price of $DDGN rises incrementally, making early participation not only cost-effective but strategically rewarding. In fact, those who enter at Stage 1 secure the lowest possible price per token, meaning their investment stretches further compared to those who join in later rounds. As a result, this model encourages financial prudence. Instead of chasing price spikes post-launch, early buyers are positioned to maximize their token quantity at minimal cost. For instance, purchasing $500 worth of tokens at Stage 1 yields significantly more $DDGN than that same amount invested at Stage 10 or beyond. This becomes especially important when token value appreciates, multiplying potential returns based on entry price and token volume held. Furthermore, by rewarding speed and decisiveness, Dragoin turns early participation into a long-term advantage. At the same time, it builds a sense of urgency, pushing the community to act rather than wait. As such, as tokens become scarcer through the burn mechanism and stage-by-stage price hikes, early investors gain both financial leverage and a head start in the Dragoin ecosystem—from gameplay perks to staking opportunities. Dragoin’s Stage 1 presale is live at $0.0000292, promising a potential 6,700% ROI at the $0.002 launch price. Why Acting Early Could Be the Smartest Move in Crypto Right Now Momentum may drive projects like Shiba Inu and Meme Index into the spotlight, but momentum alone doesn’t guarantee value. Dragoin’s presale strategy is a reminder that structure and foresight often matter more than hype. By rewarding early participation through its incremental pricing model, Dragoin gives investors a clear reason to act early—not just for lower entry prices, but for greater long-term potential. While others chase volatility, Dragoin encourages calculated decisions. For those watching the market closely, the smartest play might not be following the noise—but getting in before the next stage closes.

According to blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, as of March 21, 75.8% of SHIB addresses have held their tokens for over 155 days, surpassing Ethereum’s 74.2% and Bitcoin’s 73.3%. This shift suggests that more investors now view SHIB as a long-term asset rather than a short-term speculative play. A closer look at the data reveals a strong trend toward long-term investment in SHIB. Only 2% of holders have owned SHIB for less than a month, while 22% have held it for 1 to 12 months, and 76% for over a year. Among newer cryptocurrencies, SHIB now boasts the longest average holding period at 2.6 years, surpassing Ethereum’s 2.4 years, though Bitcoin still leads at 4.4 years. That said, only Litecoin (LTC) and Chainlink (LINK) have a higher percentage of long-term holders, at 77.7% and 77.5%, respectively. One key driver of SHIB’s long-term appeal is Shibarium , the project’s Layer 2 scaling solution. Adoption of Shibarium has surged, with daily sign-ups skyrocketing over 4,000%, according to data from Shibarium scan. Transaction volumes have also increased significantly, jumping 61% in a month from 2.38 million to 3.82 million. Meanwhile, smart contract deployments have soared 800%, with new contracts rising from 12 to 109 per day. This rapid growth underscores the rising developer interest in building decentralized applications (dApps) on Shibarium, further strengthening the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Beyond network growth, SHIB’s increasing long-term holder base aligns with improving crypto regulations, particularly in the U.S. Recent developments, such as the the establishment of a U.S. crypto research body have also boosted investor confidence, with the SHIB community hopeful SHIB will be added at some point. Speculation is also mounting around a potential Shiba Inu ETF , with growing community advocacy for its approval. Despite this optimism, SHIB’s price has faced bearish pressure, dropping 6.55% in the past 24 hours to $0.00001424 at press time. However, analysts like Master Ananda believe SHIB is approaching a key support level and could rebound soon. “The market bottom was hit in June 2023, and since then, we’ve seen higher highs and higher lows,” Ananda noted on Tradingview. “The 2024 corrective phase is coming to an end, and SHIB is poised for a bullish breakout.” According to Ananda, if history repeats itself, SHIB could rally 600% or more from its current levels, mirroring the 1,800% surge that followed its June 2023 bottom.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,SHIB|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-29 02:11:25

With regulatory clarity emerging for blockchain gaming and real-world asset tokenization breaking new ground, the industry is evolving rapidly. Immutable X’s SEC investigation has officially concluded without any charges, boosting confidence in Web3 gaming, while Ondo Finance has crossed $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), showcasing the rising demand for tokenized assets. But where does Qubetics fit into this high-stakes equation? Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another project entering the crypto market. With a revolutionary approach to blockchain development through its QubeQode IDE, it’s solving real-world issues that have plagued both developers and businesses. The inefficiencies of outdated coding platforms, slow development cycles, and complex integrations are being streamlined through Qubetics’ ecosystem. Its powerful, user-friendly development environment is setting a new standard for blockchain application creation one of the top crypto projects to invest in. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Development Qubetics is a blockchain innovation designed to simplify and enhance development processes through its unique QubeQode IDE. Unlike conventional blockchain programming tools that require deep coding expertise, QubeQode offers an intuitive environment where businesses, professionals, and developers can create smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) with ease. Imagine an enterprise needing to build a supply chain tracking system but struggling with the complexity of blockchain implementation. QubeQode allows for seamless drag-and-drop functionalities, built-in debugging tools, and real-time collaboration features, reducing development time by more than 60%. This shift isn’t just about efficiency—it’s about accessibility, enabling businesses to integrate blockchain solutions without hiring an army of specialized coders. The numbers reinforce its potential. Qubetics has raised over $15.5 million, with more than 504 million $TICS tokens already sold in its crypto presale . With over 23,900 token holders, the project’s traction is undeniable. Those securing $TICS at its presale price of $0.1300 could see significant growth, with potential ROIs ranging from 669% to 11,437% if market adoption follows its projected trajectory. To put it into perspective, a simple $200 purchase at the current presale stage would yield approximately 1,538 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $1, that $200 could grow to $1,538. And if adoption continues to build momentum and $TICS reaches $15, that same $200 turns into $23,070. That’s the kind of future-focused math that’s drawing attention—and participation. One of the top crypto projects to invest in. Immutable X (IMX): A Milestone for Web3 Gaming For months, the Web3 gaming community has been watching the SEC’s scrutiny of Immutable X, the Ethereum-based layer-2 scaling solution for gaming applications. With the investigation now officially closed, the path is clear for Immutable to drive further innovation without regulatory uncertainty looming over it. Immutable X is already a force in blockchain gaming, providing gas-free transactions, enhanced scalability, and true asset ownership. Its marketplace is home to some of the most promising blockchain gaming projects, ensuring frictionless transactions and seamless interoperability across platforms, one of the top crypto projects to invest in. IMX’s market performance reflects renewed confidence, currently trading at approximately $0.722112—a 12.66% surge within 24 hours. However, its value remains 22.90% below the projected target of $0.936548 by March 30, 2025, indicating that further growth opportunities still exist. For blockchain developers and gaming projects seeking a reliable, scalable, and regulatory-friendly ecosystem, Immutable X remains a top contender. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Redefining DeFi with Institutional-Grade Tokenization Ondo Finance has achieved what many DeFi projects have struggled to accomplish: bridging traditional finance with decentralized assets. By surpassing $1 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), Ondo is proving that the appetite for tokenized U.S. Treasuries and institutional-grade financial instruments on the blockchain is more than just speculation—it’s becoming a fundamental shift in the financial sector. Ondo’s rise to prominence is based on a straightforward yet powerful premise: providing secure, high-yield, tokenized assets that institutional and retail participants can access with ease. Unlike speculative DeFi protocols, Ondo’s offerings are anchored in tangible, government-backed financial products, giving it a layer of credibility that few crypto projects can match. ONDO is currently priced at approximately $0.78, with analysts pointing to its increasing role in transforming DeFi by enabling real-world assets to be traded in a trustless and permissionless manner. As traditional financial institutions explore blockchain integration, Ondo is positioning itself as a key player in this sector’s evolution. The Road Ahead for These Top Crypto Projects to Invest In The blockchain landscape is shifting fast, with Qubetics, Immutable X, and Ondo Finance leading the charge. Qubetics is making blockchain development more accessible, Immutable X is cementing its place in Web3 gaming with newfound regulatory clarity, and Ondo is redefining institutional DeFi. For those seeking the top crypto projects to invest in , staying ahead of these developments is crucial. Whether it’s Immutable X’s gaming ecosystem, Ondo’s real-world asset tokenization, or Qubetics’ groundbreaking QubeQode IDE, these projects are shaping the future of blockchain technology. Qubetics’ presale is moving fast, and with its ability to solve real-world problems that have hindered blockchain adoption, it’s not just a project to watch—it’s a project to be part of. Stay informed, stay ahead, and embrace the next wave of blockchain innovation.

After gathering a massive $11.4 billion since its collapse, the cryptocurrency firm is ready to begin making significant payouts as per a latest report from Bloomberg . While smaller creditors with “convenience claims” have already received payments, FTX will begin paying its major debt holders on May 30, according to bankruptcy lawyer Andrew Dietderich, who informed the judge overseeing the Chapter 11 case. The main creditors of FTX are investors who are owed millions of dollars, along with institutions that had cryptocurrency stored on the FTX platform. Massive Payout Challenge The 2022 collapse of FTX, once a leading cryptocurrency exchange, left behind a huge number of creditors from all walks of life. While settling these claims quickly would help preserve the most value, the process is complicated by the massive number of claimants resulting from the exchange’s downfall. What makes it worse is that Bitcoin has increased in value by more than four times since FTX’s bankruptcy, adding to the frustration of many former customers who were hoping to be repaid in digital assets instead of cash. Paying off all creditors will take time, as FTX is dealing with a large number of questionable claims. Lawyer Andrew Dietderich explained that some of these claims could conflict with “know your customer” (KYC) rules, which require FTX to confirm the identities of its creditors. While other claims might not be valid at all, making the process of resolving them more complicated and time-consuming. 27 Quintillion Claims! Intriguingly, FTX is dealing with an overwhelming number of claims, totaling “27 quintillion,” according to Dietderich. A quintillion is 1 followed by 18 zeros—1 billion times bigger than 1 billion. In bankruptcy cases, lawyers typically filter out duplicate, inflated, and false claims after a payout plan is approved by a judge. FTX is facing billions of these flawed claims, Dietderich said. FTX needs to pay legitimate creditors quickly because the interest it’s earning on the $11.4 billion is lower than the 9% rate creditors are earning while waiting for their payments. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022 after its crypto platform was shut down and handed over to insolvency experts. It got court approval for its payout plan in October. Atkins Questioned Over FTX Ties U.S. lawmakers grilled potential SEC Chair Paul Atkins over his connections to the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, while also criticizing the agency’s former chair, Gary Gensler. Notably, FTX hired Patomak Global Partners, where Paul Atkins is involved, as an adviser in 2022. Senator Elizabeth Warren pointed out the potential conflict of interest that could arise if Atkins is confirmed as SEC Chair, due to his firm’s past ties with FTX.",News|Crypto news|Hack,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 02:31:45

The most notable of these is RCO Finance (RCOF), which has surpassed big heavyweights like Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL). RCO Finance: The New Leader in Crypto Innovation RCO Finance’s (RCOF) AI-powered trading platform and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions are making it the best crypto to buy in 2025. RCOF offers a smooth and effective ecosystem for traders and investors, in contrast to Cardano and Solana, which struggle with scalability and network congestion. Using real-time data analysis, RCO Finance’s AI-powered Robo Advisor is one of its greatest assets. It assists traders in making well-informed judgments. This technology minimizes risks and maximizes profits by allowing users to precisely navigate the cryptocurrency market. RCOF is becoming a favorite among investors because of its quick acceptance, and in the upcoming months, its value is predicted to soar. As more traders become aware of its potential, RCOF is solidifying its position as the best crypto to buy in April 2025. Cardano: A Promising Project Facing Challenges In the cryptocurrency market, Cardano (ADA) has long been regarded as a leading candidate. Cardano has, however, suffered from sluggish development and postponed updates in spite of its robust community and scholarly approach. There is a $722.99 million 24-hour trading volume at the current price of $0.72 per ADA. Cardano’s current value is 76.66% lower than its peak of $3.10. Although it has expanded, it does not have the same explosive potential as RCO Finance. RCO Finance is the best crypto to buy for investors looking for large profits because the market is moving toward projects with instant utility. Solana: High Speed, but With Network Issues Solana (SOL) remains popular among investors and developers due to its high speed and low fee. However, network failures are frequent, and issues with centralization have raised questions about its long-term survivability. It is now trading at $138.21 per SOL , with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.769 billion. Solana is now trading at 53.12% below its all-time high price of $294.85. While it has made notable gains, its volatility makes it less attractive than RCO Finance. RCO Finance is a more stable investment with its decentralized AI-powered ecosystem, and therefore the best crypto to buy in April 2025 for long-term appreciation. RCOF ‘ s Beta Platform: Real- Life Performance The majority of presale projects remain in the idea stage, but RCOF has already introduced its Beta Platform, offering investors the chance to live their experience with its AI-powered Robo Advisor . Such pre-launch exposure makes it clear that RCOF relies on substance, not hype, as it truly helps traders optimize their strategy and risk management. For the interested investor seeking a strong token presale, RCOF’s live Beta Platform is solid proof of its promise. Early birds have been amazed at a clear edge, with Robo Advisor spotting winning bets ahead of when they are trending. Find out more about the RCO Finance Beta Platform. Render has been on a wild ride in the last 24 hours, dipping to a low of $3.1554 before surging to a high of $3.7954, and that’s a 14.19% increase. This price action is a demonstration of the volatility traders can tap into for potential profits. By buying at the lows and selling at the highs, smart investors are able to leverage these variations to the fullest. With RCO Finance’s AI-based Robo Advisor, traders can utilize real-time, data-based insights to navigate the market with precision and confidence. RCO Finance: A Safe and Transparent Investment Safety is the top priority for RCOF. The project has been vetted by SolidProof, ensuring its smart contracts are secure and trustworthy. Being transparent in this way has guaranteed more investor confidence, as presale funding has already reached $14.41 million. RCOF is trading at $0.100000 currently, before the upcoming surge to $0.13000. It is a time-sensitive offer, making it the best crypto to buy before the next price surge. RCO Finance is changing the game when it comes to crypto privacy. Unlike centralized exchanges that have strict KYC requirements, RCOF offers a fully decentralized trading experience. This makes it the choice for investors who wish to maintain financial anonymity while investing in a high-growth project. No KYC translates to safe and convenient trading, further making RCO Finance the best crypto to buy in April 2025. The Future of Crypto Investing: Why RCOF is Ahead With its decentralized model, trading intelligence powered by AI, and fully functional Beta Platform, RCO Finance is surpassing Cardano and Solana. Investors’ demand is surging to an all-time high, with over 51.12% of tokens available already sold.

33767162,[object Object],1743217226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin’s Next Move: Here’s What Exchange Flows Are Telling Us,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-next-move-here-what-exchange-flows-telling/,"While Bitcoin has seen less upward momentum in recent days, the asset still manages to maintain stabilization above the $84,000 ever since its reclaimed it earlier this week. So far, BTC’s uptick in the past week has reduced to a mere 0.2% as it price currently trades at $84,263 down by 3.2% in the past day. As the market assesses Bitcoin’s next potential move, exchange flow data has become a key area of focus for a particular CryptoQuant analyst. Notably, insights shared by CryptoQuant contributor Ibrahimcosar shed light on evolving investor behavior . Exchange Flow Patterns May Signal Bullish Undercurrent In a post titled “Bitcoin Flow Across All Exchanges: Is a Strong Rally Ahead,” Ibrahimcosar examined the broader implications of current Bitcoin movement trends across centralized exchanges. The core of the analysis lies in interpreting Bitcoin’s netflow across all exchanges. When more Bitcoin is deposited into exchanges than withdrawn, the netflow is considered positive—a condition that typically reflects growing selling pressure. Conversely, when outflows exceed inflows, netflow turns negative, suggesting investors are withdrawing their assets for long-term holding, a behavior commonly viewed as bullish . According to Ibrahim, recent data shows that since February 6, 2025, Bitcoin has experienced sustained outflows across multiple exchanges. This pattern indicates that holders may be moving their assets into cold wallets with the intention of long-term storage. Historically, such activity has been associated with increased market confidence and, in many instances, preceded upward price movement . Ibrahim further explains that while exchange inflows are usually a sign of short-term bearish sentiment due to anticipated selling activity, heavy withdrawals often also signal accumulation behavior . When investors are willing to pay transaction fees to remove BTC from exchanges, it implies expectations of future price appreciation. Net outflows, especially when accompanied by low volatility, may hint at preparation for a more aggressive price rally. Volatility Ahead For Bitcoin? Although Bitcoin’s recent price action may appear muted, the flow-based indicators suggest underlying market strength . Ibrahim emphasized that strong outflows without corresponding spikes in inflows are worth monitoring, as they reduce liquid supply and may lead to increased price sensitivity during periods of renewed demand. The broader implication is that while day-to-day volatility continues, BTC’s long-term trajectory could remain upward if these withdrawal trends persist. Such patterns have historically preceded key rallies and align with broader on-chain metrics pointing to growing accumulation among larger investors. However, there has also been signals that bearish moves still lingers especially as the derivative market sees less BTC flowing indicating “reduced risk appetite.” Whales are levering down. Less BTC flowing to derivatives = reduced risk appetite. Historically, this trend leans bearish. pic.twitter.com/j5k22mO5r9 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) March 27, 2025 Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin analysis|Bitcoin market|Bitcoin Market Price|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Crypto Market,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-29 03:00:26

The company has accumulated $11.4 billion in cash since it shut down and filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. Minor creditors, who hold what FTX labels “convenience claims,” began receiving payments earlier, but the main group of creditors must wait until the end of May. This group includes investors owed millions of dollars such as institutions that held huge amounts of crypto on the platform. They suffered huge losses when the exchange collapsed in 2022. Dietderich informed US Bankruptcy Judge Karen Owens in Wilmington, Delaware, that the delay in paying all creditors stems from a large number of questionable claims. He said that FTX faces “27 quintillion” claims, emphasizing that a quintillion is a 1 followed by 18 zeros. These include duplicates, false claims, or conflict with KYC requiring identity checks. While such large numbers of claims are not unusual in major bankruptcies, Dietderich warned that it will take time to filter out the invalid ones. He added that the company seeks to compensate legitimate creditors as soon as it can. The case is FTX Trading Ltd., 22-11068, in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

An analyst suggests a monthly close above its current range could position the cryptocurrency for a 35% surge. Related Reading: SUI Reclaims Key $2.40 Support Amid Breakout – Is A New High Coming? Chainlink Retest Crucial Price Zone Chainlink has retraced 9.1% in the past 24 hours to retest the key $14 support zone again. The cryptocurrency surged 15.7% from last Friday’s lows to hit an 18-day high of $16 on Wednesday, momentarily recovering 35% from this month’s low. However, the recent market correction halted the momentum of most cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling back to the $83,700 mark and Ethereum (ETH) dipping to the $1,860 support zone. Today, LINK dropped from $15 to $14.07, losing all its Wednesday gains. Previously, analyst Ali Martinez noted that the cryptocurrency has been in an ascending parallel channel since July 2023. Chainlink has hovered between the pattern’s upper and lower boundary for the last year and a half, surging to the channel’s upper trendline every time it retested the lower zone before dropping back. Amid its recent price performance, the cryptocurrency is retesting the channel’s lower boundary, suggesting a bounce to the upper range could come if it holds its current price levels. Meanwhile, Rekt Capital highlighted that the token is testing its multi-month symmetrical triangle pattern, which could determine the cryptocurrency’s next move. As the analyst explained, Chainlink consolidated inside a “Macro Triangular market structure” for most of 2024 before breaking out of the pattern during the November market rally. During the Q4 2024 breakout, the cryptocurrency hit a two-year high of $30.9 but failed to hold this level in the following weeks. As a result, it has been in a downtrend for the past three months, with LINK’s price falling back into the Macro Triangle. “The main goal for LINK here is to retest the top of the pattern to secure a successful post-breakout retest,” Rekt Capital detailed, adding, “It’s possible this is a volatile post-breakout retest.” LINK Needs To Hold This Level Rekt Capital pointed out that, historically, Chainlink has had downside deviations into this price range: “Back in mid-2021, LINK produced a downside deviation into this price area in the form of multiple Monthly downside wicks.” Nonetheless, the cryptocurrency is downside deviating “but in the form of actual candle-bodies closes rather than downside wicks” this time. The analyst also highlighted that, like in 2021, LINK is trading within a historical demand area, at around $13-5 and $15.5, testing this zone as support. Based on this, the cryptocurrency must successfully hold this area to “position itself for upside going forward.” Related Reading: Is Solana Preparing For Rally To $180? SOL’s Social Sentiment Hits Historic Positive Levels Moreover, the retest is key for reclaiming the top of its triangular market structure. Breaking and recovering that level would “exact a successful post-breakout retest” and enable the price to target the $19 resistance in the future. The analyst concluded that if LINK closes the month above the triangle top, it “would position price for a successful retest, despite the downside deviation.” As of this writing, Chainlink trades at $14.09, a 6.9% drop in the monthly timeframe.

Despite the token’s dramatic 95% crash just hours after its launch, regulators found no evidence of fraudulent activity or malicious intent on Welch’s part. The once-hyped memecoin skyrocketed to a staggering $500 million valuation before plummeting below $60 million in a matter of 20 minutes, sparking widespread criticism and accusations of a pump-and-dump scheme. JUST IN: ""Hawk Tuah"" girl Haliey Welch says SEC closed its investigation into her crypto meme coin that crashed 95% hours after launch. She says they will not pursue any charges or monetary sanctions. pic.twitter.com/RNxzf6IDjb — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) March 28, 2025 In a statement, Welch confirmed the SEC’s decision, stating, “The investigation is closed, and I will not face any charges or monetary sanctions.” The SEC recently clarified its stance, asserting that meme coins do not qualify as securities, which may have influenced the outcome. However, the debate around regulatory oversight continues, with concerns about “rug pulls” and investor protection remaining central. Though Welch walks away unscathed from the SEC’s scrutiny, the crypto community remains divided on how to handle such volatile assets. What Experts Are Saying? Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel commented on the development and said, “The SEC did not find “no wrongdoing.” That’s not something the SEC ever says when closing an investigation. Rather, the current administration has declared meme coins are not securities, and thus the SEC has no jurisdiction.” James Murphy, also known as Metalawman, said it’s no surprise. Meme coins are typically not considered securities, so the SEC has no jurisdiction. The SEC is focusing on its core responsibilities these days. If fraud was involved in the launch, it could be investigated by criminal prosecutors or state consumer protection agencies.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-29 03:38:37
42563495,https://coingape.com/?p=246562,1743220006,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Here’s Why Peter Schiff Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) Price Crash to $10K,https://coingape.com/heres-why-peter-schiff-predicts-bitcoin-btc-price-crash-to-10k/,"Peter Schiff, a BTC critic, has recently predicted that Bitcoin price could plummet to as low as $10,000. Schiff has expressed concerns over Bitcoin’s long-term viability, particularly in comparison to gold. His argument revolves around Bitcoin’s current performance, which he believes is being driven by short-term hype rather than solid fundamentals. Schiff’s prediction is particularly alarming for those who view Bitcoin as a store of value. In the current trends, Peter Schiff notes that millions of young people are invested in Bitcoin while gold, a standard hedge, is pushing higher. This view stems from his assertion that when gold prices rise to new record levels then the value of Bitcoin may plummet. “By the time they get to their target of $5K for gold, they will drag Bitcoin down to $10K, meaning a drop of 95% from the highest it was valued at in 2021,” Schiff reasoned. Bitcoin Price Recent Performance Against Gold According to Peter Schiff, Bitcoin price has underperformed in relation to gold. Gold prices recently broke through $3,000 per ounce as global economic conditions continued to affect the global economy. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has depreciated in value, especially in terms of the precious metal, gold. Since early 2025, the prices of Bitcoin have come down by over 30% against gold with one Bitcoin currently only equivalent to 27.4 ounces of gold as compared to 41 ounces in December of 2021. If Bitcoin is an asset that people only buy when the stock market is going up and risk appetite is high, what is it that investors are buying? It's not a stock as it will never have earnings or pay a dividend. It's clearly not a risk-off asset, a store of value, or digital gold. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) March 28, 2025 Another issue that Schiff dislikes about Bitcoin also revolves around its categorization as a “risk asset.” He says that BTC price movements are synchronized with the rest of the market, especially when investors are more willing to take risks. While gold provides investors with a safe-haven, the Bitcoin price operation is defined as having a volatility closer to that of the traditional markets among investors. Therefore, as argued by Peter Schiff, BTC price may decline as investors turn to the safe-havens, such as gold, in turbulent times. Market Analyst Weigh In On Bitcoin Trend Several market analysts are echoing Schiff’s concerns, suggesting that Bitcoin price could face challenges in the near term. Peter Brandt, a veteran trader, has pointed out that Bitcoin might be on a path to $65,635, citing a “bear wedge” pattern that has emerged in the cryptocurrency’s price charts. Meanwhile, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe shared his own cautious outlook on Bitcoin’s short-term prospects. Van de Poppe noted that while Bitcoin price has been holding above the $80,000 mark, its price action is starting to show signs of weakness. He added, “It starts to look slightly less good,” and suggested that if Bitcoin falls below $84,000, a deeper correction could be imminent. Similarly, the crypto trader TheKingfisher expressed doubts about a sustained bullish recovery, indicating that Bitcoin’s current price movement aligns with a typical market cooldown. He suggested that Bitcoin could be approaching a “seasonal reset” as part of the broader market trend. Alternative Views on Bitcoin’s Future Trend Not everyone shares Peter Schiff’s pessimism about Bitcoin price. Charlie Morris, founder of ByteTree, highlighted that despite recent challenges, Bitcoin may have already seen its worst. He explained that while gold ETFs are experiencing slower inflows, Bitcoin could be positioned for a potential recovery. This view contrasts sharply with Peter Schiff’s, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency may not be as doomed as some critics suggest. Additionally, Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , has weighed in on the broader market of precious metals and cryptocurrencies. While Kiyosaki acknowledged Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation, he predicted that silver would outperform both Bitcoin and gold in the near term The post Here’s Why Peter Schiff Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) Price Crash to $10K appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|BTC price,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-03-29 03:46:46

On March 27, hackers executed a series of coordinated moves, dumping large amounts of Ethereum onto the market. This has, understandably, raised some concerns about volatility and security within the Ethereum ecosystem. Not to mention, those hackers probably shouldn’t be doing what they’re doing. This has all been happening alongside a severe downturn in Ethereum-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Not fun times for investors in the digital asset world. The Hack: Large ETH Dump and the Impact on the Market As per the latest reports, a fresh wallet has obtained 3,433 ETH from the THORChain decentralized liquidity network. It then promptly sold the same for 6.8 million DAI, putting the price per ETH at $1,981 during the time of the sale. This transaction, albeit a large one, was just an appetizer. Two other wallets, possibly linked to the same group of intruders, were served the main course—a total of 14,064 ETH obtained from THORChain and the Chainflip decentralized exchange. These wallets then flipped their Ethereum for 27.5 million DAI at an average price of around $1,956 per ETH. Hackers are dumping $ETH ! 2 new wallets(likely related to hackers) received 14,064 $ETH from #THORChain and #Chainflip , then dumped for 27.5M $DAI at an average selling price of $1,956. https://t.co/hSP1PRGpuL https://t.co/6axvL6d7Dg pic.twitter.com/7RoYCGMdWD — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) March 28, 2025 The dump of ETH is very concerning, and the amount involved — more than 17,000 ETH — is a substantial portion of what’s available on the market. The pressure this forced onto Ethereum opened a window for speculators to take the price down. And for a token that has been struggling to find legs lately, the market did not need any help from the outside to lower it further. Meanwhile, the hackers behind the hack have plenty of other avenues to explore with their DAI. They could convert it to another asset, still using a pseudo-anonymous method through mixers and other tools. Or, they could find a way to put it to work, which is honestly something we should all be holding our breath for. Ethereum ETFs See Outflows Amid the Market Disturbance Following the ETH dump, there has been a direct impact on Ethereum-related financial products. On March 27, Ethereum-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had a total net outflow of $4.22 million. Notably, none of the nine Ethereum ETFs that we tracked during this timeframe were able to muster any net inflows. This fact, coupled with the total outflow, indicates a pronounced turn in investor sentiment toward these Ethereum products. On March 27, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $89.06 million, marking the tenth consecutive day of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $4.22 million, with none of the nine ETFs recording any net inflow. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 28, 2025 This is a big step for Ethereum. For ETF, see “Ethereum ETF.” An Ethereum ETF would allow institutional investors to invest in the Ethereum blockchain and Ether, the cryptocurrency that blockchain “powers,” without holding Ethereum directly. This is a great way for institutional investors to get exposure without holding the underlying asset. The problem is that it makes Ethereum a far less stable investment in the long run. And this is quite clearly because there are security issues with Ethereum. Broader Implications for Ethereum and the Crypto Market Hacker actions and Ethereum ETF liquidations: a warning to the crypto universe. Ethereum ETFs have been selling ETH in big quantity—Ethereum ETF liquidations have been a problem recently. Hackers, meanwhile, haven’t been sitting idle. They’ve also been selling off a big pile of ETH. The outflows (and the ETH price drop that has accompanied them) are ostensibly related to the pens we’ve been putting together for the Ethereum ETF that we expect to be and to make big waves in the near future. But informal reports from various factions over inside the Ethereum network also suggest that those network vulnerabilities are currently being more than usually exploited. And when you put all this together—Ethereum ETF liquidations, the selling off by hackers, and the fact that those hackers are allegedly exploiting network vulnerabilities—you realize that there’s a fair bit of Ethereum that’s been dumped, for several different reasons, into a not very accommodating price environment. Apart from the direct selling pressure on Ethereum, the actions of these hackers could have consequences for how Ethereum is viewed in the long term. When something is described as ‘risky and unpredictable,’ people tend to hold back from embracing it, and the much-told tale of crypto-risks seems like a narrative under which potential new investors might be dissuaded from engaging with Ethereum or institutional players from getting involved in crypto whatsoever. And that kind of dissuasion is not helpful for Ethereum’s adoption as a global asset. The drop-off in Ethereum ETF inflows could show that traditional investors are even more hesitant to get into the crypto space, especially after recent security issues. They (ETFs) have been seen as a vehicle for exposure that’s safer, if not exceedingly so, and that’s certainly a factor in the kind of regulated environment these ETFs provide. But if fewer institutional investors want in and if they’re even pulling back from this vehicle as a way to get into the crypto market, then that’s, I think, a credible sign for a broader pullback. What’s Next for Ethereum? Questions about the cryptocurrency’s future keep surfacing when hackers offload Ethereum onto the open market and when institutional investors shy away from Ethereum ETFs. But despite these recent disturbances, not just to the price but to the very security of the Ethereum network, the fundamentals of the Ethereum market, I believe, remain strong: Ethereum is more scalable than ever; it is more useful than ever as a decentralized finance platform; and as for price volatility, well, that is a hallmark of all cryptocurrencies. To restore Ethereum’s recent sell-off and rebound back to where it was, not so long ago, the digital currency must reassert its security—even more so given the recent high-profile hack of a major Ethereum-based service. That security must be reinforced against the sorts of attacks that brought down the Ethereum service on July 20. Ethereum could be more volatile in the short term. This is particularly true if the hackers behind the recent sell-offs are forced to liquidate even more of their holdings. But sell-offs caused by hackers don’t reflect on the long-term health of a cryptocurrency—only its short-term price action. And Ethereum’s price isn’t the only thing that has been moving when it comes to this altcoin—some very significant developments have been occurring. So let’s get into those.

They are fueled mostly by the actions of long-term holders. When I say, “long-term holders,” I mean investors who buy Bitcoin at low prices, hold it for extended stretches of time, and think very little about the liquidity of their Bitcoin investments. These investors marry their Bitcoin, and like the loyal spouses and partners that many of us are, they promise to stay with their Bitcoin, in sickness and in health and till death do us part, for the longest and most serious stretch of time. Bitcoin’s Current Market Dynamics: The Role of Long-Term Holders One of the primary telltales that disclose the market behavior of long-term Bitcoin investors is the Mean Coin Age (MCA). The MCA measures the average age of all Bitcoin in circulation and indicates how long holders have kept their assets before moving them. When the MCA is high, it’s kind of like saying that a significant portion of the Bitcoin in existence has been held for a long time and not moved, kind of like the way people keep their money in long-term savings accounts. These long-term holders are not only less likely to sell but also have held onto their Bitcoins since before the last couple of bull runs. So they’re probably in it for the long haul and are not the kind of people who push around the liquidity in the market. Bitcoin’s price isn’t just hype—it’s driven by long-term holders. • Mean Coin Age (MCA) shows they buy cheap, hold tight, and reduce liquidity. • Less $BTC available + rising demand = price squeeze. • If MCA starts dropping, a market shift could be coming. Forget the… pic.twitter.com/lUHO5JydpY — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) March 28, 2025 Currently, the price movement of Bitcoin can largely be attributed to the behavior of long-term holders, who are maintaining the upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. In the past several months, the price action indicates continued dominance by these investors, who have been reluctant to sell even when the broader market has been undergoing its own fluctuations. Yet, this may not last much longer. Some recent indicators suggest that the price movement dynamics are shifting. Possible Shift in Market Sentiment A possible warning sign that a market is shifting can be seen in the Mean Coin Age (MCA). If the MCA begins to decrease, this could signal that more Bitcoin is changing hands, apparently between wallet addresses. This in turn suggests that Bitcoin holders are becoming either less confident or more nimble (or both) and are either readying to sell or to move their coins in advance of a possible price drop. A likely outcome of lowering the MCA is that it could increase the supply of Bitcoin in the marketplace. (Recall that the now-in-effect MCA had already decreased the supply, which is presumably one reason for the increase in Bitcoin’s price.) If the same decline in demand accompanied this possible increase in supply, then downward price pressure could very well result. This would definitely not be a desirable outcome for Bitcoin enthusiasts. Positive Signs: U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Seeing Record Inflows Even though a possible market shift is worrisome, there are still some good signs for Bitcoin investors. One of the most encouraging developments is the ongoing growth of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. On March 27, they had a net inflow of $89.06 million. This was the tenth consecutive day of net inflows. So about four and a half months into 2023, it’s increasingly clear that institutional capital is being directed toward Bitcoin-focused ETFs. On March 27, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $89.06 million, marking the tenth consecutive day of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net outflow of $4.22 million, with none of the nine ETFs recording any net inflow. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 28, 2025 The consistent influx of assets into Bitcoin ETFs underscores Bitcoin’s emerging legitimacy in conventional finance. Investors are clamoring for more ways to access this digital asset, and the ETF has become the vehicle of choice. Yet, three things stand in the way of that becoming a reality. The ongoing success of Bitcoin ETFs, however, raises an important question: are the inflows into them driven by the institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term price performance, or are they just a result of speculation on its short-term price movements? If the latter, then these vehicles might not aid stabilizing long-term price performance for Bitcoin; and, in fact, they could make things worse. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Although it is impossible to say with certainty what direction Bitcoin will take next, the current market situation is one of delicate balance. The actions of long-term holders have been the main factor influencing the price of the cryptocurrency of late, but the potential for a shift in the market is very real. As the number of BTC available in the market continues to rise and the dynamics of the market shift, it becomes even more important for investors to stay alert and watch for signposts that might indicate the next price move. One way to do this is to look at the diversification of Bitcoin supply across market participants. Regardless of the long-term investment strategy one adheres to, Bitcoin is an asset whose income-bearing qualities one must respect. Some holders of Bitcoin may argue against this and state that they intend to hold their assets indefinitely. Yet, even those long-term holders must acknowledge the reality of the potential income that their assets could yield short of simply sitting back and waiting for their portfolio to appreciate. The next few weeks will be critical in deciding if the Bitcoin market will be propelled by long-term holders or if a new trend will push it in a different direction, reshaping its price pattern. For now, Bitcoin remains an intriguing but volatile asset, one that continues to attract a lot of eyes from investors all over the world. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

CZ Responds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has rolled out two new mechanisms designed to boost community involvement in token management: Vote to List and Vote to Delist. These initiatives allow users to have a direct say in which tokens get listed or removed from the platform, hinting at a more decentralized decision-making. However, amid the excitement, fake news began circulating claiming that Binance plans to delist Ethereum (ETH) from its CEX. This rumor quickly sparked panic among traders, but Binance’s Changpeng Zhao (CZ) addressed it, dismissing the claims with a sharp response: “Whoever believes this deserves to be poor.” Whoever believes this deserves to be poor. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) March 28, 2025 Despite CZ’s firm rebuttal, the situation has ignited a broader debate within the crypto community. A data analyst raised concerns in the comment section, explaining the potential drawbacks of Binance’s listing and delisting strategies. According to the analyst, new tokens often experience hype-driven price surges, only to crash by over 95% post-unlock. “New listings are overhyped, then crash hard. Old coins get delisted or monitored when they no longer benefit Binance or show low trading volumes,” the analyst pointed out. This pattern has led some to question whether Binance is repeating the mistakes of other top exchanges like Bittrex and Poloniex, which faced declines after neglecting user interests. The analyst added, “Memecoins today, gone tomorrow. If Binance wants to stay #1, it needs to address this imbalance. Retail traders deserve better!” As Binance continues to dominate the crypto space, the focus now shifts to how the exchange will balance community-driven decisions with the long-term interests of its diverse user base.

The developments centered around recent news reports that allege Davis has been up to some not-so-savory activities concerning the $MELANIA token. In short, it seems Davis has been liquidating his $MELANIA holdings in a very underhanded manner and sending the millions of tokens he’s been cashing out to a series of centralized exchanges. For weeks, Davis’s wallets lay inactive, prompting many to think he’d abandoned his token ventures. But just 12 days ago, his MELANIA wallets burst back into life. Davis was last seen in this space with tokens like LIBRA, which he upped the ante with in a previous expose done in conjunction with YouTuber-investigator Coffeezilla. With his recent wallet activity, he’s now hitting us big again with these transactions. Covert Moves: Millions in MELANIA Tokens Sent to Exchanges For the past fortnight, Hayden Davis has been busily divesting himself of MELANIA tokens through a little-known method called single-sided liquidity. It’s a way of selling into liquidity pools that doesn’t require a corresponding buy order to keep things in balance—a fact that could, in theory, be making token prices go down. In any case, on September 21, Davis sold us $1,065,153 worth of alarms. These movements are very similar to the ones that Davis used in the launch and sale of LIBRA, a token that has also drawn a lot of controversy because of the price manipulation tactics that it uses. So, a lot of people in the cryptocurrency community are now asking whether he is using the same strategy with these tokens to benefit financially while screwing over retail investors and the broader market. 1/ Hayden Davis is STILL selling MELANIA He recently sent $1M to exchanges and extracted over $2M from the liquidity pools pic.twitter.com/1sWIkGmtxj — Bubblemaps (@bubblemaps) March 28, 2025 In addition to the amounts transferred to centralized exchanges, Davis also pulled in more than $2 million from the liquidity pools. These moves seem to indicate that he is taking advantage of the increased liquidity of $MELANIA to lock in some seriously profitable trades, once again raising the issue of whether his trading is aboveboard. A Pattern of Market Manipulation: LIBRA, MELANIA, and Beyond Hayden Davis and his tokens, like LIBRA and MELANIA, are not well understood. They are surrounded by controversy and suspicion. Davis is involved in several projects, and many of those have hit significant rough patches—price volatility and even tampering have led to concerns that Davis may just be pumpin’ them up so that he can serendipitously cash in on the upswing. Most recently, Davis has done just about all that he can do to category-amplify suspicions regarding MELANIA. Davis employs a strategy that sells large amounts of tokens. These are not just any tokens; they are carefully chosen and gelled with gleam over them. The next two sections offer a closer look at the standout ones, even as we keep in mind that not all kinds of standouts are worth holding or using. Davis’s tactics, which involve the strategic selling of large quantities of tokens through liquidity pools, appear to be part of a broader strategy to extract value from the market without necessarily creating long-term value for holders or users of the tokens. His approach to liquidity pools also allows him to offload tokens in a way that might not be immediately visible to other market participants. His wallets had stayed inactive for weeks. Then they suddenly began to dump large quantities of MELANIA tokens. This doesn’t look good. None of this looks good. What does look good is the sailing away of profit that appears to be coming from Davis’s wallet, which is quite imbuing with the previously mentioned pattern of following consistent, reliable profit in consistently, reliably undetectable ways. Implications for the MELANIA Community and the Crypto Market Hayden Davis is selling MELANIA tokens at an ongoing pace, and this has left many holders in a state of uncertainty. For investors holding onto their MELANIA tokens, recent sales have likely created downward price pressure, which has led some to recently express concern over the potential for losses on the tokens (especially for those with higher average purchase prices). Davis’s wallets that haven’t yet sold their tokens also have many wondering if the future holds even more sell-offs and lower prices. The cryptocurrency market as a whole is called into question by Davis’s actions. Despite substantial developments in the space, cryptocurrency still seems to be without the sorts of clear regulatory guidelines that most industries have. This is in part because, as we know, the whole business of cryptocurrencies—from mining to trading to storing them securely—takes place in a virtual world that’s accessible only to a select few. And when we talk, in the context of Davis’s case, about holding people accountable for their actions, we have to remember that the world of cryptocurrency is one where price manipulation and market abuse can occur without leaving behind many discernible trails. Conclusion: A Cautionary Tale for Investors The MELANIA market is ongoing, and Hayden Davis is in it and making moves. It is a reminder of the species of market risk that attaches to the MELANIA token and to investing in highly speculative tokens, especially when they are connected to market manipulative personalities. Davis’s sell-offs are, in a way, an act of caution psychology that should give pause to anyone tempted toward entering in or staying long around MELANIA. The cryptocurrency market is maturing, and with this maturation comes the need for increased transparency and regulatory oversight. Without stronger protections in place, individual investors and pension funds alike are left vulnerable to the machinations of trading firms that prefer to operate in the shadows. Clearly, my view is that the actions of firms like the one that employed Hayden Davis are bad for the markets, and things are going to have to change. Until they do, be careful out there.

The crypto firm, backed by President Trump’s family, has raised concerns within the Senate Banking Committee. In a March 28 letter , they called on key officials, including Michelle Bowman of the Federal Reserve and Rodney Hood of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, to outline their plans for regulating WLFI and its stablecoin. Congress to Decide on Stablecoin Rules The letter comes as Congress debates the GENIUS Act, a new bill aimed at regulating stablecoins. If passed, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act would give the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve the power to oversee stablecoin issuers like WLFI and its USD1 coin, marking a major shift in crypto regulation. In February, Trump signed an executive order that mandates federal agencies, like the OCC, to regularly coordinate with the White House, giving the president greater control over federal decisions and policies. “President Trump’s involvement in this venture, as he strips financial regulators of their independence and Congress simultaneously considers stablecoin legislation, presents an extraordinary conflict of interest that could create unprecedented risks to our financial system and to the integrity of decisions made by the [Fed and OCC],” the letter noted. “The launch of a stablecoin directly tied to a sitting President who stands to benefit financially from the stablecoin’s success presents unprecedented risks to our financial system.” Senators Raise Red Flags Over Trump’s Stablecoin Ties Senators are questioning how regulators can effectively oversee WLFI, considering its close connections to the current president. At the same time, Congress is pushing for new laws to regulate stablecoins—digital currencies meant to work like the dollar for holding value or buying other crypto assets. Launched in March 2025, WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin is seen as a direct competitor in the booming digital currency market. Available on major blockchains like Ethereum and BNB Chain, the project’s limited transparency has raised skepticism among critics. Meet USD1 — the stablecoin your portfolio’s been waiting for.

From the not-so-secret world of the burgeoning memecoin sector to the plainly visible rising prominence of AI-driven platforms, to the less visible resurgence of gold-backed tokens, investors are apparently diversifying their strategies and making carefully targeted investments in a handful of very select cryptocurrencies. The latest data shows an unmistakable interest from smart money in memecoins, AI projects, and gold-backed tokens. The most heavily collected assets were memecoins and unique narratives, with 17 wallets accumulating them. Smart money also engaged with the AI sector, with 10 wallets focusing on that. Gold-backed tokens earned the attention of 5 smart money wallets. These actions are reflective of a larger phenomenon, with movements in the wallets of smart money indicating new opportunities being seized in the exciting (and rapidly growing) sectors of memecoins, AI, and gold-backed tokens. Memecoins Continue to Dominate Smart Money Accumulation The memecoin market is still bringing in the smart cash, betting on tokens with strong community loyalty, unique stories, and viral growth potential. Investors are most focused right now on $BROCCOLI, $PIKA, and $WOLF. $BROCCOLI, a memecoin connected to CZ’s dog, saw the highest accumulation within this category. For this memecoin, 10 smart money wallets accumulated $103,000 worth of it, making its market cap $56.5 million. Its unique narrative and AI-powered features helped in its appeal, but its listing on Binance was probably the big factor in drawing so much attention. $PIKA, another memecoin that gained attention because of its ties to protests, attracted six smart money wallets and accumulated $20,000. Despite its smaller market cap of $874,000, $PIKA’s unique narrative has resonated with investors and made it one of the standout tokens in the memecoin space. Meanwhile, $WOLF, a memecoin strongly tied to $PEPE, also attracted the attention of two smart money wallets that accumulated $10,000. With a market cap of $25.5 million, $WOLF continues to draw attention because of its alignment with other popular meme-based assets.

In the past 24 hours, AI-focused projects such as $SERV and $DKING have captured the attention of discerning investors, to the tune of what looks like some smart money flowing into them. $SERV, a platform positioned as a leader in AI agent technology, attracted 2 smart money wallets that accumulated $10K worth of the token. With a market cap of $16 million, $SERV is drawing attention due to its strong partnerships and potential for growth in the AI-driven space. Another AI project, $DKING, which combines sports betting with AI, received $18K worth of investments from 3 smart money wallets. With a market cap of just $5 million, $DKING is still in its early stages but shows promise with its innovative approach to blending AI with traditional sports betting platforms. Gold-Backed Tokens: A Secure Investment Amid Volatility Even though the memecoin and AI sectors are where many smart money investors are currently active, traditional assets aren’t being completely ignored. Investors are increasingly turning to tokenized gold as a safe haven investment. Over the last 24 hours, two of the most accumulated tokens in the gold-backed sector were $PAXG and $cbBTC. $PAXG, a token backed by physical gold, remains a decent, stable investment amid the ongoing volatility of the crypto market. One smart money wallet recently accumulated $22K worth of $PAXG (market cap = $668 million). Listed on a number of exchanges, $PAXG appears to be attracting a fair number of investors looking for a more secure store of value in the crypto space. Moreover, $cbBTC, a Bitcoin token that has been wrapped and is now issued by Coinbase, has drawn the sharp interest of some extremely well-connected investors. In this case, two different wallets picked up $76K worth of $cbBTC. With a market cap of $700 million, the token’s abilities to work across different blockchain networks and its solid foothold in the market provide a nice option for those wanting to diversify their portfolios and still have a play in Bitcoin. Conclusion: Smart Money Continues to Diversify Across Key Narratives The last 24 hours of activity from smart money have shown a relatively narrow focus, but that is exactly the point. It appears the cryptocurrency market is undergoing a movement from broad diversification within portfolios to sector specialization. And in the past 24 hours, if you invested in three specific areas—memecoins, AI-driven platforms, and gold-backed tokens—you would have seen a serious uptick in the value of those assets, thanks in part to some special situations playing out within those three sectors. The crypto market keeps evolving, but smart money is betting on assets of two kinds: the kind we can only dream are secure and stable, from speculative coins like $BROCCOLI and $PIKA to cutting-edge AI tokens like $SERV and $DKING, and the kind we know for sure is secure and stable, like gold-backed tokens ($PAXG and $cbBTC) and other reliable infrastructure of digital finance. This is a bet worth studying: It speaks to the relativity of today’s market. Some investors go bold; some play it safe. What can we learn from the smart-money playbook?

Popcat and Brett Coin have shown impressive price movements, but they remain highly speculative. In contrast, Dragoin stands out by combining meme culture with strong tokenomics, giving it a distinct advantage. While Popcat benefits from a surge and Brett Coin shows recovery potential, Dragoin is uniquely positioned with its community-driven ecosystem, a play-to-earn game, and a clear roadmap for growth. This blend of viral appeal and solid financial backing makes Dragoin a more promising investment opportunity. Popcat’s Recent Surge: A Closer Look Popcat, a meme coin within the Solana ecosystem, has recently experienced a notable price surge. On March 25, 2025, Popcat’s price reached $0.2722, marking its highest level since March 3. This increase has propelled its market capitalization to approximately $254 million, positioning it as the sixth-largest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem. Additionally, the quantity of Popcat tokens held on exchanges has declined by nearly 10% over the past week, now totaling 237.85 million tokens. This reduction suggests that investors are transferring their holdings from exchanges to private wallets, a behavior often interpreted as a bullish indicator. Furthermore, these developments occur alongside a broader recovery in meme coins within the Solana network, including tokens like Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Peanut the Squirrel, all of which have seen price increases exceeding 20% in the last seven days. However, it’s important to note that while Popcat’s recent performance is promising, the meme coin market is known for its volatility. Brett Coin Price Forecast: A Look at Its Potential Growth Brett Coin ($BRETT), a meme coin tied to the Base blockchain, has seen notable price swings since its launch. After reaching an all-time high of $0.236 in December 2024, the coin faced a sharp decline at the beginning of 2025. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about its future. By the end of 2025, some predictions suggest that Brett could stabilize at around $0.10, with the potential to revisit its peak near $0.24. Looking further ahead, the coin is expected to see steady growth, with average predictions of $0.35 in 2026 and even a possible $0.50 if it achieves wider adoption. For 2030, the more bullish outlook places Brett at approximately $2.73, depending on successful partnerships and increased usage within the Base blockchain ecosystem. However, like many meme coins, Brett remains highly speculative, and its future success will depend on broader market conditions and community engagement. Dragoin Combines Viral Appeal with Serious Investment Potential Dragoin ($DDGN) is shaping up to be a meme coin with more than just viral appeal.

The “abrupt halving model” of Bitcoin frequently results in miner turnover and a lack of network stability. Similarly, Ethereum struggles with high gas fees and limited scalability, which are persistent issues. On the other hand, BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces a “continuous halving model” that smoothly decreases rewards, helping to sustain miner profitability and avoiding sharp declines. This methodical reduction not only retains miner participation but also promotes the overall health of the network for the long haul. Consequently, BlockDAG emerges as a viable answer to the challenges encountered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, establishing itself as a forward-looking model for upcoming blockchain infrastructures. Bitcoin: The Trailblazer of the Digital Currency Era Introduced in 2009 by the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin emerged as the inaugural decentralized digital currency, ushering in a revolutionary era in finance. Starting from a value of nearly nothing, its first noteworthy exchange was in 2010 when 10,000 BTC were traded for two pizzas. Over time, Bitcoin transitioned from relative anonymity to widespread acceptance, characterized by both extreme volatility and remarkable growth. In November 2013, it hit a milestone of $1,000 per BTC for the first time, escalating to a peak of about $20,000 by December 2017. Despite significant price swings, Bitcoin has shown tenacity, surpassing its prior peak in 2021 with a value exceeding $60,000. As of March 26, 2025, Bitcoin’s price stands at roughly $87,847.17, an astounding rise of over 2,928,000% since its inception. This trajectory has resulted in substantial returns for early adopters and buyers who maintained their stakes, as Bitcoin continues to lead the cryptocurrency market, functioning both as a digital reserve of value and a safeguard against inflation. Ethereum: Pioneering Programmability in Blockchain Conceived by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and officially launched on July 30, 2015, Ethereum has significantly altered the blockchain landscape. Unlike Bitcoin, which is often likened to digital gold, Ethereum introduced a programmable blockchain, empowering developers to create decentralized solutions and applications (dApps). Its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2014 saw Ether (ETH) priced at only $0.31 per token, amassing over $16 million. This groundbreaking innovation swiftly gathered a robust developer community, which catalyzed the proliferation of numerous decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and NFTs. Ethereum’s price experienced a meteoric rise from under $10 in 2016 to more than $1,000 by January 2018. As of March 26, 2025, Ethereum’s value has climbed to approximately $2,068.60, demonstrating an extraordinary growth of over 667,000% since its ICO. This impressive surge has delivered tremendous gains for early backers, solidifying Ethereum’s pivotal role in driving blockchain innovations and the flourishing DeFi landscape. Revamping Miner Rewards: BlockDAG’s New Method vs. Bitcoin’s Classic Approach Bitcoin’s halving process has always been a mixed blessing. Precisely every four years, the miner rewards are cut by 50%, leading to dramatic declines in revenue that challenge profitability. This “abrupt halving model” tends to push less efficient miners out, potentially leading to network centralization and security risks. Contrastingly, BlockDAG employs a different strategy with its “continuous halving model” . This model smoothly tapers off rewards following a geometric curve, rather than implementing steep cuts. This gradual reduction enables miners to adjust gradually, ensuring sustained profitability and avoiding abrupt financial shocks. This method helps maintain a healthier network by keeping a larger number of participants active. BlockDAG’s effective strategy is underscored by its impressive performance metrics. During its presale phase, it raised $208 million, with its coins currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27. From the first batch, the return has escalated to a notable 2,380%. Moreover, more than 18.9 billion coins have been sold, indicating robust community support and buyer confidence. In stark contrast to Bitcoin, which experiences significant mining disruptions with each halving, BlockDAG’s steady reward reduction model ensures continuous miner motivation, fostering enduring stability across the network. This approach is vital for preserving miner involvement, promoting decentralization, and enhancing security measures. As Bitcoin continues to struggle with miner retention post-halving, BlockDAG’s sustainable approach offers a viable solution to some of the enduring challenges in the blockchain arena. As this model gains traction, it could potentially revolutionize the way cryptocurrency networks address miner incentives and maintain network security. Redefining Blockchain Sustainability Using BlockDAG As the blockchain sector evolves, the limitations of established protocols like Bitcoin’s “abrupt halving” and Ethereum’s scalability hurdles are becoming more apparent. Bitcoin faces the danger of losing miners due to its sharp reward reductions, while Ethereum deals with ongoing network congestion. In this landscape, BlockDAG’s “continuous halving model” emerges as a strategic alternative, aimed at maintaining miner participation and overall network robustness. BlockDAG’s method of gradually decreasing mining rewards, rather than abrupt reductions, fosters a stable and enduring environment. This approach, coupled with a strong focus on scalability and security, highlights its potential to serve as an effective blockchain solution. As the demand grows for feasible alternatives that offer balanced and sustainable models, BlockDAG could well define the future standards of blockchain resilience.

42564122,https://nulltx.com/?p=147563,1743220811,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Shows Strong Interest in Memecoin Market as Inflows Outpace Outflows,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-shows-strong-interest-in-memecoin-market-as-inflows-outpace-outflows/,"The memecoin market has been very active lately, with smart money inflows and outflows taking significant turns on March 27, 2025. Recent data show the market netting a positive volume of $3.33 million. Inflows of $5.00 million outpaced outflows of $1.67 million, indicating a clear shift toward the memecoin space. “We’re definitely seeing some confidence coming back into memecoins,” said one analyst. Memecoins, pushed on by community enthusiasm and speculative trading, have established themselves in recent years. Though often considered volatile and high-risk assets, these tokens seem to be catching the attention of both retail and institutional investors. On March 27, 2025, the market saw some fairly impressive inflows into certain memecoins, with some tokens really emerging in terms of performance and demand from investors. Inflow Dominance: Top Memecoins See Significant Gains Among the most remarkable events in the memecoin market, $FARTCOIN has truly farted its way into the influx of capital, with an inflow of $3.9 million. This represents the bulk of the total seen across the market, suggesting that $FARTCOIN may be gearing up for a big, uh, growth spurt. As one of the highest volume memecoins in recent weeks, $FARTCOIN’s surge in investment can be attributed to renewed interest in its meme-based narrative, which frankly, is more coherent than some actual investment theses I’ve seen. Other memecoins that caught the spotlight on March 27 were $GHIBLI, which gained an inflow of $232K. Most likely named after the well-known animation studio, the token uses pop culture to attempt to rope in investors looking for the next big speculative asset. Following it closely, $POPCAT gained an inflow of about $75K, and $MNDE, a much smaller-name token, had an inflow of around $67K. Both of these tokens are of viral nature themselves and are seen trying to capitalize on the pop culture moment. They had no big or obvious reason to show up and appear in my radar. Also, $WOULD, another memecoin on the market, saw a small but significant inflow of $47K. While this is a lesser amount than we saw for $FARTCOIN, $GHIBLI, and others, the consistent investment into $WOULD is a clear indicator of the ongoing interest we’re seeing in a range of memecoins across the sector. Outflows: Some Memecoins Experience Investor Retreat The overall market experienced inflows, but several specific tokens saw outflows, indicating that investor sentiment may be shifting. The largest outflow was seen by $AVA, one of the more established memecoins, which lost $578K in just the past week. This is a significant retraction for $AVA and suggests that it might be more of a balancing act for crypto portfolios these days. Even then, with $578K leaving the market for $AVA, surely that cash must be going towards something. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 27/03/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $5.00M Outflow: $1.67M Volume: $6.67M Net Volume: $3.33M There was inflow into: $WOULD ($47K) $POPCAT ($75K) $MNDE ($67K) $GHIBLI ($232K) #FARTCOIN … pic.twitter.com/FxHBOYuxix — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 28, 2025 Other tokens that saw pour-outs are $ARC, which experienced a reduction of $87K, and $FAT, which had a small outflow of $78K. On the other hand, $GIGA and $LAYER also saw outflows, with $102K and $132K, respectively, being removed from their total. All of these outflows could suggest some short-term uncertainty or even a change of strategy on the part of the investors, who might be moving the capital to other projects in the memecoin space. It is curious that, even with these outflows, March 27 still has a net positive movement of $3.33 million, which underscores that the memecoin market has a pretty rosy outlook at this moment. Meanwhile, even if some tokens are a bit inactive, the memecoin market keeps going—like some sharting on an elevator—thanks to the sustained momentum brought by highly demanded assets like $FARTCOIN and $GHIBLI. The Role of Smart Money in Shaping the Memecoin Market The inflows on March 27 spotlight the continuing influence of smart money—large investors or entities with sophisticated market knowledge—on the memecoin market. These investors have taken to favoring certain upstart tokens, and they’re starting to favor the ones that do well by their communities, the ones that are highly liquid, and the ones that on their face have a better chance of being economically viable in the future. Memecoins, which are notorious for being speculative, today are a high-risk, high-reward asset class. Still, the smart money actively participates in the memecoin market. Indeed, it would appear that, in general, the cryptocurrency market is adopting memecoins as part of a broader investment strategy. Also in play, of course, is the El Salvadoran government, which has thrown its lot in with Bitcoin and, by extension, the memecoin market. The swift movement of capital observed on March 27 shows that the memecoin market is heavily influenced by the whims of investors and is capable of making sharp turns in a very short period of time. Memecoins are no safer or saner than any other speculative instrument; in fact, they may be less safe and less sane, because speculating on them is like speculating on a joke. Yet on the evening of March 27, when memecoins were supposedly under heavy selling pressure, capital was in fact moving into such coins at a surprising rate. Conclusion: Growing Investor Activity in Memecoins To sum up, the memecoin marketplace is now seeing an uptick in investor interest. Where not long ago it appeared that the highest-profile memecoins and memes like Dogecoin were falling out of favor, now inflows of capital to specific memecoins within the marketplace seem healthier and more sustainable than their outflows. Still, even a cursory glance at the deal flow of memecoins across the past quarter is a bit alarming. Is the following bulleted list of some leading recent memecoin fundraising rounds supposed to lend any positive vibes to the market? $FARTCOIN $GHIBLI Another Positive Vibes Only (PVO) moment for the memecoin market. As the market keeps evolving, memecoins will probably stay a vital but thrilling sector of the cryptocurrency landscape. With both rapid gain potential and the speculative trade risks they bring, investors need to watch closely how these coins affect and are affected by the movements of capital in this space. Otherwise, they might find themselves not ahead of the curve but rather behind it. The future memecoin market is as uncertain as ever. Its coins’ value is going to derive mainly from their street cred, social media impacts, and, above all, the continued engagement of their loyal communities.

In the DeFi world, Ethereum is currently the number one player, with its decentralized apps (DApps) like Uniswap, Compound, and Maker. Decentralized finance around Bitcoin simply doesn’t exist–at least not in any significant way–despite the fact that Bitcoin has more than tripled in value over the past year. Indeed, the total value locked up in Bitcoin-backed DApps amounts to a paltry $182 million, according to DeFi Pulse. With 25.49% of the total TVL, $CORE leads in #BTCFi . This reflects higher user trust, greater liquidity, and broader use than its competitors. #Core 's dominance makes it the most reliable and stable choice for those seeking security and growth in BTCFi. #JustUseCore #Crypto pic.twitter.com/w5sCb8jzvf — CryptoRoar (@CryptoRoar07) March 24, 2025 The prominence of $CORE in the BTCFi space illustrates more than just its market standing; it underscores the CoreDAO ecosystem’s effectiveness and allure. The ecosystem is seeing consistent growth and adoption, powered by an array of integrated projects that supply a revenue stream and make the BTCFi space more useful and appealing. $CORE has more than 50% of the total locked value in its BTCFi products (that’s a pretty healthy growth factor). And it is now the dominant player in BTCFi products (which is more than just a place with a peachy user interface: those BTCFi products have some $-value attached to them). The CoreDAO Ecosystem: A Broad Range of Partners Driving Growth The $CORE ecosystem keeps gaining momentum, driven by the appearance of numerous projects that instil it with the kind of “liquidity” and “utility” that decentralized financial structures need to thrive. In addition to the performance of the $CORE token itself, which is leading a sector we call “BTCFi,” a number of high-performing projects in the DeFi space around CoreDAO have since unfurled their sails. And the total value locked (TVL) in these projects offers a glimpse at the kind of diverse capabilities that the $CORE ecosystem is crystallizing. These projects include CoreSwap, CoreDEX, CoreBNB, and Adax.pro . The key projects in the CoreDAO ecosystem are @DesynLab, @colend_xyz, and @Pell_Network. These projects have an incredible amount of trust and activity among users, as demonstrated by their TVL amounts. They are clearly driving the engagement and momentum of the Core ecosystem. 1. @DesynLab: TVL = $191.63 million, making it one of the top projects in both Core and the greater Web3 space. 2. @colend_xyz: TVL = $131.35 million, showing a very impressive amount of user interest and engagement. CoreDAO’s appeal is even further enhanced by @Pell_Network, which has $113.97 million secured in its platform. Other contributors to the ecosystem include: • @BitFluxFi, with a total value locked of $99.49 million. • @SumerMoney, with a total value locked of $91.66 million. • @avalonfinance_, with a total value locked of $70.87 million. @Coredao_Org Ecosystem Total Value Locked Distribution Mapping out the TVL distribution within CORE thriving DeFi ecosystem. @DesynLab – $191.63M @colend_xyz – $131.35M @Pell_Network – $113.97M @BitFluxFi – $99.49M @SumerMoney – $91.66M @avalonfinance_ – $70.87M… pic.twitter.com/dlEmTJ5ubE — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) March 26, 2025 All these projects are helping to shape the CoreDAO ecosystem into a vibrant hub of DeFi innovation. Yet farther down the list, still playing a significant role, are @b14g_network, Core Earn, and @glyph_exchange, each contributing their own distinct offerings and ambiance to the community, as diverse outfits do in any neighborhood. @b14g_network has $12.76 million under management. Core Earn, with its own distinct vibe, has $8.08 million. @glyph_exchange, very much in tune with the others, adds $6.31 million under management. These outfits together are part of the BTCFi scene. They serve the community in particular ways, really hitting four quadrants of a Bitcoin Finance neighborhood. Almost a phrase I would never use in 2023: Bitcoin Finance. CoreDAO’s Strong Position in the BTCFi Sector BTCFi TVL’s largest share, $CORE, shows not only the platform’s leadership but also its capacity to draw in huge amounts of liquidity. Liquidity is trust in this space. Users of decentralized financial products need to feel secure that things won’t break. They just won’t engage if there’s even a whisper of doubt that everything is okay. $CORE dominates the DeFi space because its reputation is rock-solid, and increasingly, people are coming to see the strength of the CoreDAO ecosystem in providing secure, scalable Bitcoin-based financial solutions. Those solutions run the gamut. $CORE integrates a ton of platforms and protocols, which means from a user perspective, $CORE is an access point to all kinds of Bitcoin-secured, DeFi financial services. This broad ecosystem, made up of diverse projects with different use cases, offers a comprehensive suite of options for investors, traders, and developers within the BTCFi space. CoreDAO’s ability to seamlessly integrate these projects and to grow its TDL share is a testament to the strength of its ecosystem and its potential to drive, y’all, yet more BTCFi growth in the coming months and years. The Future of $CORE and the BTCFi Ecosystem The future seems bright for $CORE and the bigger BTCFi ecosystem. The total value locked in the CoreDAO ecosystem is showing us that not just users but also institutions are seeing the value proposition of engaging with DeFi protocols built on Bitcoin. As this sector expands, it’s very likely that $CORE will maintain its position as something akin to a Bitcoin 401(k), continuously attracting new projects and users to its ecosystem. In addition, CoreDAO stands to benefit greatly from the surging demand for decentralized finance products that are backed by Bitcoin, putting it in an excellent place to take advantage of the much-hyped DeFi adoption. With the promise of Core now working its way into many different projects, these next few months should be filled with excitement as we see what sorts of unusual (in a good way) products are likely to come out of these experiments. As trust grows among users, and they continue to take part in BTCFi, the $CORE positioned right now to be even less influential in a rapidly space, where security, liquidity, and innovation are crucial, could all of a sudden start being more influential. This is particularly the case because security, liquidity, and innovation are absolutely what $CORE has been offering. Following is an outline of the three pillars in which $CORE offers a reliable and stable choice for users. And a big part of this play for BTCFi is that $CORE is now absolutely for real.

42564285,https://nulltx.com/?p=147565,1743221155,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"SEC Closes Investigation Into Crypto.com, No Enforcement Actions to Be Taken",https://nulltx.com/sec-closes-investigation-into-crypto-com-no-enforcement-actions-to-be-taken/,"The cryptocurrency industry has received a substantial boost from a recent development. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has informed the popular exchange Crypto.com that it is closing the investigation that it had opened into the exchange some time ago and that it will not be taking any enforcement action against the exchange. According to other sources, the SEC’s decision to not take any action against the exchange right now clears up what has been a cloud of uncertainty hanging over the exchange and its users and is the result of what had previously been a fairly deep dive taken by the SEC into the workings of the exchange. The SEC’s latest step is a sign of a stormy season for Crypto.com, which has found itself in crosshairs of the regulatory body as part of its ongoing effort to bring greater oversight to the cryptocurrency space. Despite the potential risks posed by the investigation, Crypto.com has managed to sidestep the enforcement actions that many (including us) had feared, potentially establishing a precedent for other crypto firms under similar types of regulatory scrutiny. The Legal Back-and-Forth: From Wells Notice to Lawsuit Last year, the SEC issued a Wells notice to Crypto.com, which was the start of the investigation. A Wells notice is a formal notification that the SEC has identified possible violations of federal securities laws. Of course, this is traditionally a not-so-welcome sign for companies. It usually signals that the SEC is considering enforcement actions and gives the company a chance to respond with its defense or take legal action before enforcement is attempted. SCOOP: The @SECGov has officially closed its investigation into @cryptocom with no enforcement actions being brought against the exchange, according to a source close to the matter. The move comes after the company received a Wells notice from the SEC in October of last year,… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) March 27, 2025 In reaction to the SEC’s notice, Crypto.com took the uncommon step of suing the agency to get it to stop overreaching its jurisdiction. The exchange claimed that the SEC simply doesn’t have the authority to regulate what it does, and it especially doesn’t have the authority to classify its services and tokens as securities. This was a big move for Crypto.com and a pretty clear message that it thinks—and really wants everyone to believe—that it isn’t a security and shouldn’t be treated like one. Nonetheless, the legal duel was short-lived. By December last year, Crypto.com had decided to abandon its lawsuit and, in a surprising shift, was now opting for a more cooperative approach with the SEC. What seemed to prompt this even more sunshiny shift? A surprise announcement by Donald Trump that he intended to appoint Paul Atkins—a longtime pro-crypto advocate who pretty much likens the regulatory environment for crypto to what the colonialists encountered when they crossed the Delaware—a much different SEC chair than Gary Gensler. The decision by Crypto.com to withdraw the lawsuit was part of a larger shift in the industry’s dynamic. With the hope of new leadership at the SEC, many in the cryptocurrency sector were beginning to think that the regulatory environment might be shifting to one more welcoming of innovation and growth. The SEC’s Decision: No Enforcement Actions A significant victory for Crypto.com—this is how many in the broader cryptocurrency industry see the SEC’s conclusion of its investigation. Not only was Crypto.com avoided by the SEC from enforcement action, but it appears that the SEC is shifting here, too, in not taking such a heavy-handed and fearful approach in regulating crypto. Before this, increasing scrutiny by the SEC over the activities of crypto exchanges and service providers in general had a lot of people in the crypto space very concerned. For Crypto.com, this means the exchange can put the investigation behind itself and move forward without the threat of penalties or legal action. One of the largest global players in the virtual space and growing larger all the time, the exchange is in a good position to expand its services and user base without regulatory headwinds. Currently, when a variety of regulatory bodies have existed for a long time and the rules are well known, there is still considerable uncertainty around how to apply these rules to crypto. One of the major tools that the SEC uses to enforce compliance with the federal securities laws is the threat of bringing an enforcement action. That the SEC didn’t bring an enforcement action in this case may suggest that they don’t consider it strictly a securities problem. A Changing Regulatory Landscape for Crypto The legal drama surrounding Crypto.com and its resolution shines a light on the changing regulation of the cryptocurrency industry. Although the SEC has been a very watchful and sometimes harsh overseer of the space, its own methods and goals seem to be changing. The conclusion of this case without any sanctioning of Crypto.com might signal that the SEC is not as eager as it once was to enforce its interpretation of the securities laws against what it sees as violators in the space. The worldwide crypto community has for a long time been voicing a desire for precise and uniform regulations pertaining to digital assets. The lack of certitude has generated a headwind for industry participants. Why is a rule-based landscape so desired? Because our digital asset economy is growing and maturing. Every day, more exchanges, wallets, and service providers enter the market with a lineup of new offerings and experiences. They hope, and we hope, that regulatory agencies like the SEC will soon give not just them, but also us, a clear signal on how to operate safely within the law. If new leadership comes in at the SEC, the way it handles probes and enforcement against the crypto industry might change. If pro-crypto figures like Paul Atkins are put into key spots, the SEC could operate in a more “balanced” and “supportive” manner toward the crypto space, thus encouraging further growth and innovation within it. At present, Crypto.com appears to have mostly avoided any damages from this legal quagmire and has emerged with no enforcement actions lined up against it. The exchange, which has become a major player in the worldwide world of cryptocurrencies, now seems to be in as good a place as it could be to push forward and offer even more services to a user base that just keeps growing. The overall outcome for the cryptocurrency industry could be a sense of relief, especially if it indicates space for constructive dialogue between crypto firms and regulators. For the maturity of the industry, that’s a good sign. With the unfolding legal and regulatory landscape, exchanges like Crypto.com are probably going to remain at the vanguard of navigating the crypto-construct dialogue and the relationship between crypto and traditional finance.

42564441,https://nulltx.com/?p=147566,1743221290,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Stablecoin Reserves Surge, Reflecting Increased Market Activity and Liquidity Across Web3",https://nulltx.com/stablecoin-reserves-surge-reflecting-increased-market-activity-and-liquidity-across-web3/,"In a clear sign of increasing market activity, stablecoin reserves at exchanges have surged in just a 24-hour period to a new total of about $32.8 billion. This sharp increase in reserves indicates that profits are being taken, and that capital is flowing, within the wider cryptocurrency market—and is yet another sign that sentiment in this market has shifted materially over just a week toward more liquid and reliable assets. Stablecoin reserves across all exchanges surged from $32.1 billion to $32.8 billion in just 24 hours, signaling increased profit-taking activity in the market. pic.twitter.com/fKfd0P5CPx — Ali (@ali_charts) March 28, 2025 The increase also signals a burgeoning need for liquidity in DeFi ecosystems and capital flowing into numerous Web3 platforms. Stablecoins, pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. Dollar, have long been the backbone of trading in digital assets, providing traders and investors with a safe harbor from the volatility that still often surrounds cryptocurrencies. This latest surge in stablecoin reserves serves to shine a light on not just one, but two, seemingly maturing markets: markets for these instruments themselves and markets for the overall growth of Web3. $USDC Achieves Historic Milestone, Ethereum Leads the Pack One of stablecoins’ most notable developments is the continued dominance of USDC. The supply of the stablecoin has hit an all-time high of $60 billion. This explosive growth embodies a broader shift toward stable, more reliable assets in the still-evolving world of cryptocurrency. USDC doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon. It seems to be the stablecoin of choice for quite a few in the crypto world, and it doesn’t appear that it has much in the way of rivals. Ethereum is at the forefront of stablecoin adoption. The smart contract platform has attracted a large amount of value in stablecoins, with over $36 billion in reserves currently held on the network. The stablecoin ecosystem on Ethereum is impressive in scale. Not only is the amount of value served by stablecoins considerable, but several of these stablecoins are also employed extensively for different purposes both within the realized DeFi ecosystem and in other manners that are partially on-chain or entirely off-chain. This allows not just for a way of moving value around that thoroughly exceeds anything served by either Bitcoin or any of the numerous blockchains that have issued other types of tokens, but also for several systems of decentralized applications (dApps) that extensively use stablecoins and are probably the leading-edge examples of blockchain-based financial systems. Nonetheless, Ethereum isn’t the only blockchain network reaping the rewards of the stablecoin upswing. Other networks such as Solana, Base, HyperliquidX, and Arbitrum have also registered significant stablecoin usage. They are gaining serious momentum in the Web3 arena, serving up scalable and efficient solutions for the kind of decentralized applications that today count on stablecoins for liquidity, trading, and all sorts of financial activities. Solana, with its high throughput and low fees, has secured a spot as a big player in the stablecoin universe. While it’s not yet at Ethereum’s level of dominance, the network is making a strong push to capture a large share of the stablecoin market. Base and HyperliquidX, two much newer contenders, are also making waves as decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and protocols increasingly turn to stablecoins for liquidity and stability. Stablecoin reserves are also seeing very rapid growth on Arbitrum, reflecting the adoption of Arbitrum as a scaling solution for decentralized applications. That is to say, Arbitrum is seeing growing adoption as a means for operating decentralized applications, and that is obviously a very good thing for Arbitrum. Why is Arbitrum doing that? Why is it seeing fast growth in stablecoin reserves? For several very good reasons, Arbitrum is now a go-to layer 2 for stablecoin transactions. A $230 Billion Market Cap for Stablecoins: Growing Liquidity and Demand The total stablecoin market cap is now more than $230 billion. This speaks to not only the unprecedented growth of stablecoins but also their burgeoning importance in the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) worlds. With their low volatility, increasing adoption, and inbuilt stability, stablecoins are emerging as a pivotal part of the Web3 ecosystem. The total stablecoin market cap surpassing $230 billion emphasizes the burgeoning quest for not only traditional crypto market liquidity but also for that in DeFi platforms and dApps. The trend here is clearly to move even deeper into the realm of the Web3 space, thereby inking a deal of deeper market penetration. The manner in which digital assets like these are being soaked up by both retail and institutional figures across the space is quite impressive, and it speaks to the unfurling comfort and exceptional pace of adoption that these pseudo-cash instruments are enjoying. 1. The Role of Stablecoins in the Blockchain Ecosystem Stablecoins are a crucial component of the ecosystem surrounding blockchain technology. They enable users to transact quickly, securely, and at minimal cost across the many different networks that make up the blockchain universe. $USDC supply tops ATH of $60B — a 100% year-over-year increase. @ethereum leads with over $36B, followed by @solana , @base , @HyperliquidX , and @arbitrum . The total stablecoin market cap has now surpassed $230B, signaling deeper liquidity and rising demand across Web3. pic.twitter.com/vv69B9sTdE — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) March 26, 2025 Despite their being a relatively new phenomenon, the use cases for stablecoins are multiplying. As the underlying technology continues to spread, these specific value-expressing tokens will become a common element of nearly any application built on top of a blockchain architecture. Moreover, stablecoins represent a far more stable medium of exchange than do either Bitcoin or Ethereum. They are backed by assets that are themselves stable; hence, they can be employed with far greater confidence in any application that necessitates a reasonably predictable expression of value. Looking Ahead: The Growing Role of Stablecoins in Web3 Even as the overall stablecoin market cap continues to swell, the future of stablecoins in the Web3 ecosystem looks inevitably bright. That is, stablecoins appear to be following the path of least resistance toward their probable, if still controversial, destination. Stablecoins’ evolution is correlated with the broader development of DeFi and blockchain’s marching into the establishment. More and more, users are turning to stablecoins as an antidote to the price volatility of other cryptocurrencies, which seems to make stablecoins a semi-necessary asset class in the crypto landscape. The continued integration of stablecoins into decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and other blockchain-based financial services will generate liquidity and stir innovation across the sector. But look at stablecoins and what they hold in store for the crypto market. They are sitting on exchanges with the potential to create a liquid marketplace for profit-taking. They are also being adopted by institutions, and their growing use portends a future infused with stablecoins. The crypto space is in a profit-taking, stablecoin-infused moment. As we look ahead, it is evident that stablecoins are not merely a fad but an essential component of the Web3 revolution. As the stablecoin market grows, new technological advances and regulatory developments will mold the use of these assets, integrating them deeper into the global digital economy. The future, it seems, is rather bright for the stablecoin. There are still many ways in which it—and the environment it serves—might grow, but the basic idea is that it now facilitates a more stable, more liquid blockchain and DeFi ecosystem.

In a little over just 100 days, we are now achieving a remarkable $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). That accomplishment puts us in the same frame as some of the fastest emerging blockchain platforms like Arbitrum and the BNB Chain and gives us company among some of the names in DeFi that we all know. In a little over just 100 days, we are now achieving a remarkable $1 billion in total value locked (TVL). Unprecedented TVL Growth: Berachain at the Forefront In the fast-growing universe of blockchain technology, TVL is commonly used as a yardstick to assess a network’s vitality and desirability. TVL stands for Total Value Locked; and it measures the sum of value (in the form of crypto-assets) that has been locked into a network’s smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). TVL is a good metric of user trust in a blockchain, and also, it is a strong indicator of how much developer interest there is in the system. Berachain’s speed of growth has set it apart from many of its rivals. These often take longer to hit similar milestones. When you stack Berachain up against big hitters like BNB Chain and Base—both of which topped $1 billion in TVL (Total Value Locked) within a year—it’s hard to not be impressed by Berachain’s relatively swift ascent. These established networks, with the backing of prominent centralized exchanges (CEXs), took a longer, more sustained route to ecosystem-building. Berachain is the fastest-growing chain by TVL Today, @SonicLabs TVL reached $1B, a milestone achieved in just over 100 days. Meanwhile, @berachain and @arbitrum are leading in terms of TVL growth speed. @BNBCHAIN and @base — both backed by major CEXs — surpassed $1B in TVL… pic.twitter.com/9kXjrApv0Q — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) March 27, 2025 In addition, the surge in Berachain’s popularity has positioned it within striking distance of Arbitrum when it comes to the speed at which total value locked (TVL) is piling up on the two networks. This is noteworthy because Arbitrum has already distinguished itself as an up-and-coming scaling solution for Ethereum and a pathway toward Ethereum’s promise of true, global state. TVL growth is also a pathway toward capturing developer mindshare and user attention in the otherwise crowded Layer 1 and Layer 2 space. What Sets Berachain Apart? Several key factors can be credited for Berachain’s swift ascent to prominence. The blockchain boasts a robust technical infrastructure that, alongside its unique features, makes it a highly desirable option for both developers and users. Berachain’s current and future implementations demonstrate an unequivocal commitment to satisfying the ever-growing demands of decentralized applications and financial services. When it comes to offering a truly viable solution, it appears that Berachain is indeed attempting to fulfill all of the promises that a next-generation blockchain should. Moreover, the architecture of the Berachain blockchain is meant to tackle the limitations of previous-generation blockchains, furnishing a more efficient and speedy solution for developers. It is this focus on not just optimizing transaction speeds, but also on trimming transaction costs down to the bone, that has made Berachain an attractive choice for DeFi protocols. Another key aspect of Berachain’s rapid expansion is the lively ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) being constructed on its framework. Benefiting from a robust community of developers, the network is witnessing ongoing innovation and the unveiling of fresh applications, which in turn is drawing a steadily increasing number of users and liquidity. These dApps are absolutely vital in terms of how they are driving up the network’s total value locked (TVL) figure, given that users are much more likely to lock up assets in a dApp and thereby increase Berachain’s TVL if the dApp is a non-trivial, engaging application. Competitive Landscape: Berachain Among the Best In the larger blockchain world, Berachain’s growth is really exceptional. BNB Chain and Base, which are supported by big central exchanges, took close to a year to go past the $1 billion mark in total value locked. And yet here comes Berachain, apparently being configured to scale and also deliver as a working network, and not only sitting at close to $1 billion TVL in just five months of its being live, but also rising daily, as far as I can tell. Indeed, this rumored working network is apparently very well liked by users and developers, as it now has a much bigger user base than just five months ago. Berachain’s swift adoption stacks up well against newer blockchain platforms like Sui Network and Aptos, which took considerably longer to reach the same level of standing. All the same, Sui Network and Aptos have been fetching decent reviews and pretty much straight lines in their growth charts for some time now. Yet I’ve missed their breakout sessions in the same way I missed R&B heartthrob Usher back in the day. Berachain starts off as an audacious underdog in a sews with a mighty chain of command by its DeFi community. The Future of Berachain and DeFi Innovation Looking forward, Berachain’s growth is showing no signs of easing up. Having reached $1 billion in TVL so swiftly, the platform is set to keep on pulling in developers, liquidity, and users. The network’s laserlike focus on scalability, low fees, and smooth transaction processing makes it a magnetic choice for decentralized applications that want to ensure efficient and cost-effective performance. In addition, as Berachain keeps expanding its ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and of smart contracts, the expectation is that the network, too, will generate further innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. If projects built on Berachain prove successful, they might inspire other blockchain platforms to take similar approaches. And that might have some further effects on the future of DeFi and the future of blockchain technology. To conclude, Berachain’s rapid growth and its capacity to achieve $1 billion in TVL in just over 100 days signify a big step for the blockchain ecosystem. As one of the platforms that are “growing the fastest” when it comes to TVL, Berachain is showing that it can compete with many of the big names in the industry. Its success moving forward will likely have a sizable impact on DeFi’s future, and even its potential for more growth is something to keep a close eye on in the coming months and years.

The platform’s evolution and the unbroken flow of inventive ideas coming from its direction underscore something interesting about how it’s going about its business: there’s creativity, and even a bit of avant-garde panache, in what Shape_L2 is doing. That’s something that’s not easily found in the blockchain industry these days. Strong Network Growth and Steady Activity USDC is the digital dollar. Given this, the vast majority of users will only ever experience the USDC as an on-chain dollar. In July 2022, 61% of contracts deployed on USDC were on-chain. The USDC is just a way of lending and borrowing money with MobileCoin on a trustless, decentralized basis. The first half of 2023 saw 15 contracts deployed on-chain with USDC; the second half of 2023 may have more, as interest in deploying contracts to the MobileCoin network continues to grow. USDC can, therefore, be seen as the only on-chain dollar in MobileCoin’s network. The consistent expansion of the Shape_L2 network owes itself to the network’s seamless integration with the Optimism Stack, which allows the Layer 2 network to function as something akin to an alternative to Ethereum’s mainnet. The way that the Shape_L2 network has scaled and integrated with the Optimism development framework means that the network can now offer low-cost, high-speed opportunities for doing business on the blockchain. (As the creators of the network like to point out, this is superbly well-suited for the NFT economy.) And this seems to have worked well enough that the creators and developers of decentralized applications are finding ways to make use of it. Gasback: A Game-Changer for Contract Deployers One of the most thrilling aspects of Shape_L2 is the rollout of Gasback, a revolutionary mechanism that handles a colossal 80% of the sequencer fees in the platform. This means that when developers create a financial product on the platform, they are directly rewarded for doing so. Most net revenue from Layer 2 goes right back to the platform and, by extension, to the users of the platform. 1/ Live on Dune for a month, @Shape_L2 is an @Optimism Stack–powered ETH L2 built for NFTs and onchain culture. And now, $SHAPE is coming Here’s what’s happening on Shape, and some of the standout projects shaping this non-fungible ecosystem https://t.co/ohktIXalWk — Dune (@Dune) March 27, 2025 Since its implementation, Shape_L2 has already dealt with a grand total of $35,300 in transaction fees. Out of that, $24,100 has ended up netting Layer 2 in profit. Thus far, 203 accords have been inscribed for Gasback, with $19.3K set aside for reclamation by developers. Of that amount, $2.6K has already been divvied up, and there’s no indication that anyone in the platform’s community should be embarrassed to accept what they’ve been given. Gasback is not only a vital part of the Shape_L2 income stream, it’s also something that is likely to make that platform far more developer-friendly (and hence more appealing). After all, who wouldn’t want to work in an environment where there’s money available for what used to be called “experimental” (and is now called “innovative”) programming? Gasback is there to offer rewards for such “innovative” work. This financial incentive model is especially useful in the fast-moving environment of Web3 and NFTs. Developers are always trying to find new means of plummeting costs and raking in revenue. By making a directly profitable system for deploying contracts, Shape_L2 has created an ecosystem in which Web3 developers might actually thrive, experiment, and keep building. The Power of Stack: Reputation and Progress through Participation Shape_L2 uplifts engagement to the next level with Stack, its innovative reputation layer designed to reward users for participation. Stack turns everyday interactions into kind of progress that offers users rewards in the form of medals, ranks, and perks. It’s what Stack Shape_L2’s engagement mechanism that rewards users for participating in the platform. Up to now, the platform has produced 18,300 Stack NFTs and, across the community, has earned 76,000 medals. The top-ranking project, Proof of Personhood, has received 28,000 medals. This result demonstrates the community’s interest in establishing unique on-chain identities. With 10,100 Stack holders, Shape_L2’s reputation layer has proven to be an effective tool for building community engagement; its collaboration and engagement with the community has fostered an environment where users are encouraged to continue contributing to the growth of the platform. The gamified structure of Stack rewards users for their participation and keeps them hooked into the ecosystem. That’s great for developers and writers of content on Shape_L2. And as we expand our ecosystem, user reputation becomes even more important. Stack will play a role in that, too. So even as I was writing this, I began to realize just how central Stack is going to be to the creation of a vibrant decentralized community that recognizes user contributions. Exciting Projects and On-Chain Experimentation Shape_L2 is also home to several exciting projects that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of NFTs and on-chain culture. One of the standout projects is Otom, developed by @kGolid, which brings NFTs to life in a dynamic way. In Otom, everything is on-chain, allowing users to mine, annihilate, and combine NFTs to create molecules, earn energy, and interact with mechanics that feel alive. The platform has already seen significant engagement, with 30K daily actions and a peak of 76K actions on March 24. The most popular actions include annihilation and mining, which highlight the interactive nature of Otom and its ability to captivate users. Another electrifying initiative underway at Shape_L2 is DeePle, rendered by @deekaymotion. This project intersects art, identity, and on-chain personalization within an avatar experience. 543 unique items exist in this universe, 4.4K minted avatars inhabit it, and these figures generate $160K and $1.1K in primary and secondary sales, respectively. The DeePle experience is a testament to what can emerge from Shape_L2, which continues to act as a launchpad for dynamic NFT projects. The Future of Shape_L2 Shape_L2’s swift expansion and constant innovation promise a luminous destiny for the platform. With its powerful network-driven activities, its groundbreaking Gasback system, a gamified reputation layer, and a diverse array of on-chain projects, Shape_L2 has speedily positioned itself as a hub for NFTs and on-chain experimentation. As the platform scales and continues to evolve, it appears almost certain that it will play a leading role in defining the future of Web3 and decentralized culture. Shape_L2 is setting itself up as a big player in the whole Ethereum Layer 2 thing, and it’s doing it by giving developers and users kind of the opposite of what a usual top-down model would give. Instead of saying, ‘Hey, this is what you should build, and here are the rules you should follow,’ Shape_L2 is saying, ‘Here’s a bunch of interesting tools. Use them however you like. And, if you do use them and then come up with a decent reason why what you’ve built is worth backing, then you’ve got a shot at earning some cash on top of whatever else you stand to gain from your own praxeological innovation.
