The global interest in tokenized assets is on the rise, and among other companies, Robinhood is buying into the wave with its plan to launch a blockchain-based platform that allows its customers to trade tokenized assets. Robinhood to launch a blockchain platform Robinhood Markets Inc. is currently working to claim its stake in global finance by developing a blockchain-based platform that will allow European retail investors to trade U.S. securities. According to individuals familiar with the matter, Robinhood, based in Menlo Park, California, is currently in talks to build the platform in partnership with a digital asset company. Two blockchains under consideration for the collaboration are Arbitrum and Solana. Arbitrum operates as a layer-2 solution on the Ethereum network, and Solana is known for its fast transaction speeds and low costs. Discussions are still ongoing, and no official agreement has been reached. A spokesperson for Robinhood declined to comment on the ongoing discussions, and Offchain Labs, the developer behind Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, both followed suit and refrained from responding to media inquiries. Robinhood’s proposed platform would tokenize U.S. stocks and potentially other securities, while giving investors in the European Union access to trade them 24/7 with increased efficiency and lower settlement costs. At present, Robinhood’s customers within the European Union only have access to cryptocurrency trading. However, the company recently secured a brokerage license in Lithuania, which allows it to offer traditional stock trading services across the EU. This development is expected to pave the way for the blockchain venture . Tokenized securities Tokenized securities are digital representations of traditional financial assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate that are recorded on blockchain networks. The technology offers greater efficiency, faster settlement times, and significantly lower infrastructure costs. A 2023 report by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) showed that distributed ledger technology (DLT) could cut global clearing and settlement costs by up to $20B annually. These saved expenses come from reducing the reliance on centralized agents and complex reconciliation processes, which often delay trading. Several major financial institutions are buying into the tokenization wave. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, known as BUIDL , has attracted over $2B in assets since its launch. Franklin Templeton and Apollo have each launched their own tokenized investment products in recent years. Even Coinbase has expressed interest in offering tokenized securities. The CEO of Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, publicly shared his enthusiasm for the potential of tokenized assets. Speaking on a podcast in March, he said, “Tokenized securities can really push forward U.S. company dominance in the global market. Right now, it’s very difficult to invest in a U.S. company if you’re overseas.” This challenge is precisely what Robinhood’s blockchain platform seeks to solve as European investors face regulatory and operational hurdles when they try to invest directly in U.S.-listed securities. Robinhood ’s acquisition of Bitstamp, a well-established European cryptocurrency exchange, is also critical to its expansion into the EU. Bitstamp’s MiFID-compliant multilateral trading facility (MTF) license would allow Robinhood to offer crypto-linked derivatives and potentially even tokenized securities. Once the deal closes, Robinhood could use Bitstamp’s infrastructure and licensing to bring its tokenized platform to the European market faster and more securely.

The trading platform is likely to tap into Solana (SOL) and Arbitrum (ARB) chains for its planned development. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD), an established electronic trading platform, is ostensibly planning to develop a blockchain tokenization platform to enable European retail investors to participate in the United States securities market. Reportedly, Robinhood plans to collaborate with Arbitrum (ARB) and Solana (SOL) networks to enable the tokenization of U.S. securities. Currently, Robinhood provides cryptocurrency trading services to several EU countries and stock trading services to retail investors in the United Kingdom. Once finalized, the new tokenization platform by Robinhood will help democratize the mainstream adoption of U.S. securities via the blockchain technology. Robinhood Taps Blockchain to Remain Profitable In the recently released first-quarter earnings report, Robinhood noted that crypto trading remained a significant contributor to its overall revenue. During the first three months of 2025, Robinhood reported a revenue of about $252 million from crypto trading services. However, Robinhood highlighted that its crypto trading services dropped by 35 percent from the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result, the trading platform is compelled to diversify its products to ensure a sustainable revenue source for its shareholders. The company has laid significant emphasis on blockchain technology to ensure transparency and seamless adoption of its services globally. Last month, Robinhood secured a brokerage license in Lithuania, which will play a crucial role in its entry into the EU market, particularly in the tokenization and trading of U.S. stock securities. Furthermore, Robinhood acquired Bitstamp cryptocurrency exchange to enhance its legalities in more jurisdictions in the near future.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING|ARB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 22:58:38

But another project with a unique vision is getting attention from the blockchain and AI communities. Enter Ruvi AI, a pioneering platform that combines AI with blockchain to solve real world problems and open up new innovation pathways. What is Ruvi AI’s Vision Ruvi AI is at the forefront of technological convergence by combining the robust, transparent network of blockchain with advanced AI capabilities. It’s designed to deliver solutions across industries like healthcare, supply chain management and finance. By leveraging blockchain’s immutable data and AI’s predictive power, Ruvi AI allows users to unlock new insights. One of Ruvi AI’s key features is its accessibility. The platform prioritizes user friendly interfaces so its tools are available to organizations that may not have deep knowledge of blockchain. Whether it’s predicting financial risks or optimizing logistics networks, Ruvi AI makes its solutions intuitive and effective. By doing so, the project has positioned itself as the go to platform for businesses looking to leverage next gen tech. Presale Success Ruvi AI’s presale launch is a huge success. Within days of launching Phase 1, the project has sold over 10 million tokens and raised over $100,000. This is a testament to the community’s confidence and enthusiasm for the project’s roadmap and potential. Right now, Ruvi AI tokens are priced at $0.01 in Phase 1. Investors can still get in before Phase 2 starts but time is running out as Phase 2 will have a 50% price increase to $0.015 per token. And to add to the confidence, the beta platform will be released shortly after the presale so the development team is committed to delivering on their timelines. VIP Tiers for Investors To reward early believers, Ruvi AI has VIP tiers with extra bonuses and returns . Two tiers stand out for their benefits: VIP Tier 3 VIP Tier 3 requires a $1,000 investment and gets 100,000 tokens in Phase 1. It also gets a 60% bonus so 160,000 tokens. At $0.07 listing price, these tokens would be worth $11,200. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, Tier 3 investors could see returns of $160,000. VIP Tier 5 For larger investments, VIP Tier 5 is the way to go. With a $5,000 investment, you get 500,000 tokens plus 100% bonus so 1,000,000 tokens. At $0.07 listing price, this is $70,000. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, Tier 5 investors could see returns of $1,000,000. Both tiers show Ruvi AI’s investor first approach, delivering massive long term gains and building trust with its growing community. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Supporters Ruvi AI goes beyond traditional rewards by offering leaderboard rewards to top supporters during the presale. The updated reward structure means everyone gets a chance to benefit: Top 10 get 500,000 tokens each. At $0.07, tokens are worth $35,000, which could be $500,000 if the $1 valuation is reached. Top 50 get 250,000 tokens each. Tokens are worth $17,500 at $0.07 and $250,000 at $1. Top 100 get 100,000 tokens each, worth $7,000 at $0.07 and $100,000 at $1. Top 200 get 75,000 tokens, worth $5,250 at $0.07 and $75,000 at $1. Top 500 get 40,000 tokens, worth $2,800 at $0.07 and $40,000 at $1. Top 1000 get 20,000 tokens, worth $1,400 at $0.07 and $20,000 at $1.This structure rewards participation at all levels, creates a strong and active community and maximizes value for Ruvi AI supporters. Building the Future of Blockchain and AI While Avalanche is funding the future of blockchain, Ruvi AI is building its own by combining blockchain with AI to solve real world problems. From the successful presale to the VIP tiers and leaderboard rewards, Ruvi AI is setting new standards for transparency, innovation and investment. The Ruvi AI project is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of a movement that will change the way technology integrates. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast, business leader or early stage investor, Ruvi AI promises not only groundbreaking solutions but also massive growth.

Right now, Pepe (PEPE) is drawing attention with signs of a potential trend reversal, while Cardano (ADA) continues to earn credibility through consistent upgrades and a research-driven roadmap. Both projects offer compelling cases, but Unstaked ($UNSD) is taking a different route, one focused on real-world utility and automation. Its AI-powered agents and on-chain Proof of Intelligence system bring measurable, verifiable engagement to the forefront of blockchain functionality. With its crypto presale still underway, Unstaked positions itself as a standout among emerging coins. For those seeking early access to utility-driven growth, it’s a strategic opportunity worth watching. Pepe (PEPE) Sets the Stage for a Breakout Move Pepe (PEPE) is turning heads as technical signals continue to align in its favor. The token has established a firm base and recently confirmed a double-bottom formation, a bullish pattern that often precedes trend reversals. Coupled with consistent buying pressure and well-defended support zones, this setup is attracting renewed interest from traders who see momentum building beneath the surface. With resistance levels clearly in sight, a breakout could trigger sharp upward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rebounding from oversold territory, adding further strength to the case for bullish continuation. If PEPE sustains its current consolidation and breaks through overhead resistance, the next leg up could arrive faster than expected. Cardano (ADA) Reclaims Attention with Strategic Strength Cardano (ADA) is regaining momentum as community interest picks up, largely fueled by recent insights from founder Charles Hoskinson. His pointed commentary on competitors has cast a spotlight on Cardano’s disciplined approach to blockchain development, renewing confidence in ADA’s long-term vision. Unlike hype-driven projects, Cardano continues to win support through its academic rigor and commitment to security and scalability. Its steady development and methodical rollouts are starting to resonate with a broader audience. As attention shifts toward sustainable, research-backed platforms, ADA’s rise is becoming a key storyline in the search for next-generation blockchain solutions. Unstaked Could Follow the Footsteps of Crypto’s Biggest 100x Winners Some of the biggest gains in crypto history have come from early-stage bets on platforms that combined utility with perfect timing. Projects like Solana and Polygon delivered 100x to 500x returns once their ecosystems took off, while AI-driven networks such as Fetch.ai proved that real-world functionality can be just as powerful as hype. In this context, Unstaked is starting to mirror that same trajectory. Currently priced at just $0.006695 in Stage 2 of its crypto presale , the project has already raised over $1 million, signaling strong early demand. What makes Unstaked stand out isn’t just its presale numbers but the functionality it’s building. The platform allows users to deploy AI agents that autonomously manage, moderate, and grow digital communities on Telegram and X. These agents are not theoretical; they’ll go live right after launch, delivering immediate utility and solving a major pain point in the Web3 ecosystem. Unstaked’s infrastructure is powered by its Proof of Intelligence protocol, which tracks every agent action on-chain and distributes rewards based on verified engagement. That adds a layer of transparency and merit-based earning that most projects simply don’t offer. The UNSD token plays a central role in governance, utility, and access across this ecosystem. With real AI use cases, strong early traction, and on-chain performance baked in from day one, Unstaked offers more than a speculative bet. It presents an early opportunity to back a platform designed for long-term utility. As demand for AI-integrated tools rises, history suggests platforms like Unstaked could be the next 100x story, if you get in before the crowd. Quick Recap While Pepe (PEPE) flashes promising technical signals and Cardano (ADA) continues its methodical climb, Unstaked offers a fundamentally different value proposition, one grounded in active utility and verifiable performance. Its AI-driven agents and on-chain Proof of Intelligence system go beyond market speculation, delivering a platform built for real engagement and scalable results. With its presale gaining traction and utility ready to activate post-launch, Unstaked ($UNSD) is quickly emerging as a serious contender among emerging crypto coins. For those prioritizing long-term functionality over short-term hype, Unstaked presents a compelling entry point ahead of broader adoption.

Kaspa is preparing for a major speed upgrade, XRP is seeing less network activity, and another project is making progress with practical tools instead of short-term hype. Web3 ai takes a different path. It does not focus on protocol changes or short-term rallies. Instead, it uses AI to help users with trading choices. Its $WAI token powers tools that run around the clock to monitor markets, spot scams, shift assets, and improve DeFi activity. For anyone looking at the next top bullish crypto, attention is moving from promises to actual tools. Web3 ai is part of that shift. Kaspa Upgrade Could Unlock New Network Speed The new Kaspa (KAS) upgrade, named Crescendo, is set to change how the network performs. Scheduled for May 5, this update will increase block speed from one per second to ten. This shift is more than just faster times. It boosts the network’s ability to handle more transactions while keeping its core values of security and decentralization. From a market view, this upgrade may trigger price growth. Analysts are focused on the $0.0990 level as a key point. A close above that could start a stronger upward move. If it breaks $0.15, the trend could strengthen further. With better performance and growing interest, Kaspa’s update is one of the top stories in the space right now. XRP Activity Drop Adds Pressure to Price Trend New XRP data shows a big drop in network use, with active addresses falling 44% in just a few days. This change matches a slide in price, raising concerns about a short-term pullback. Even though XRP is trading above $0.50, the lower user activity adds to bearish signals. Current charts are showing stress as XRP stays near support zones. If sellers increase and buyers don’t return, the price could test the $0.47 to $0.48 area. Still, if XRP holds above current levels, it may stay in a sideways trend, delaying any bigger price changes. $WAI Powers a Nonstop AI Trading System Web3 ai runs at all hours, and so does the system behind it. While traders rest, $WAI holders stay connected through an AI-driven engine that tracks market changes, spots scams, adjusts portfolios, and finds high-yield DeFi options. This is not just a group of features. It is a full-time crypto system, always on and ready to act. At the center of this setup is the $WAI token, available at $0.0003 in presale batch 1. With a planned listing price of $0.005242, early users may see gains up to 1,747%. But its value goes beyond that. $WAI powers everything from AI trade bots and price scanners to fraud alerts and lending tools. It is the main link to a smart, automated dashboard made to help you every second. Unlike tokens that just sit unused, $WAI drives a system made to take action. Whether it’s adjusting your assets during market swings or pointing out new presale risks, Web3 ai works like a full-time quant analyst that doesn’t stop. For those searching for the top bullish crypto with a clear use case and 24/7 function, $WAI stands out as a working product, not just an idea. The ai crypto presale is still active, but not for long. When it closes, access to one of the most advanced AI systems for retail traders may close with it. Functionality Could Define the Next Bullish Trend Kaspa is focused on faster blocks, and XRP is dealing with lower user numbers. Web3 ai is moving in a different direction, focusing on performance instead of price changes. Its system, powered by $WAI, monitors the market, controls risk, and manages assets in real time. These tools are often used by professionals, but now available to regular traders. What makes this different is not the promise of future gains, but what is already in motion. As more users look for long-term tools that can work in any market, platforms like Web3 ai may be what separates the next top bullish crypto from the rest.

On April 29, the project witnessed one of its most heated Buyer Battles so far, selling over 59.15 million BDAG coins within a single day. At the heart of this surge was wallet 0x8e7a…d25, which led the charge by purchasing 1.63 million BDAG, earning the additional unsold coins from the 25 million daily allocation pool. This intense competition shows how BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are changing user behavior. Participants are not simply buying coins; they are engaging strategically, aiming for daily wins as well. As May 13 approaches, marking the final chance to secure BDAG at $0.0019 before the exchange listing, interest continues to build rapidly. For those tracking crypto ICOs with clear momentum and a growing user base, BlockDAG is proving difficult to ignore. Buyer Battles Reshape Coin Accumulation Tactics April 29’s record-breaking sales day highlighted more than just high volume. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles have created an exciting and strategic element in the presale. Unlike traditional crypto ICO structures that rely on simple buying incentives, BlockDAG rewards the highest daily buyer with leftover coins from the daily 25 million BDAG allocation. Wallet 0x8e7a…d25 showcased this perfectly, securing 1.63 million BDAG and claiming the coveted bonus. This reflects more than luck. It is part of a calculated strategy that has become increasingly common as buyers seek maximum advantage before public trading begins. While other crypto ICOs often stick with standard presale models, BlockDAG’s competitive approach has created daily excitement. Each 24-hour cycle is now a new opportunity, encouraging bigger and more aggressive purchases. This has directly contributed to BlockDAG’s impressive $227.5.5 million raised to date and over 19.7 billion BDAG coins sold. In batch 28, BDAG is priced at $0.0262, but early buyers still have a chance to grab coins for just $0.0019 before May 13. Combining urgency, strategy, and community-driven participation, BlockDAG stands out among top crypto ICOs as a project where buyers are actively shaping the market. The Final Countdown: Why May 13 Matters As BlockDAG’s presale races toward its close, time has become a critical factor. With May 13 fast approaching, buyers face a shrinking window to secure BDAG coins at $0.0019. Once this offer expires and the exchange listing goes live, prices are expected to enter open market dynamics, where higher valuations and increased demand could quickly reshape the landscape. Buyer Battles are becoming more intense as this deadline draws near. Participants are now competing with greater determination to claim daily bonuses, positioning themselves ahead of potential price surges. For newcomers and crypto veterans alike, the appeal is clear. Early access and the chance to win additional BDAG create powerful incentives. BlockDAG’s value proposition extends beyond its presale mechanics. Featuring hybrid Proof-of-Work combined with Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, the platform aims to offer scalability and efficiency. This makes it attractive to miners, developers, and long-term holders alike. Additionally, BlockDAG’s 25% referral bonus and 5% buyer bonus add layers of opportunity. These programs reward users who help expand the community and encourage rapid adoption. Together, they highlight why BlockDAG’s final presale days are so crucial for those seeking crypto ICOs with a combination of short-term rewards and future growth potential. Why BlockDAG Dominates the Crypto ICO Discussion in 2025 With countless projects launching daily, standing out in the crowded crypto ICO market is no easy task. BlockDAG, however, has managed to capture and hold attention through a strategy focused on rewarding active participation. Unlike projects that rely solely on speculation or vague promises, BlockDAG has tied meaningful rewards to user engagement. The April 29 victory by wallet 0x8e7a…d25 is a clear example. Buyers are no longer passive. They are competing daily, shaping outcomes, and driving volume higher. This dynamic has helped BlockDAG surpass $227.5.5 million in presale funds raised and push total coins sold beyond 19.6 billion. The passed CertiK audit adds further credibility, confirming that BlockDAG’s infrastructure has met stringent security standards. As exchange listings draw closer, this assurance will likely boost buyer confidence even more. Ultimately, BlockDAG’s structure encourages ongoing participation and builds a loyal community. From Buyer Battles to referral bonuses, it is clear why BlockDAG is seen as one of the most impactful crypto ICOs right now. Those who act before May 13 stand to be part of a select group with early access to what could become a major player in the market. Final Thoughts April 29 set a new benchmark in BlockDAG’s growing presale story. Wallet 0x8e7a…d25’s acquisition of 1.63 million BDAG coins and the intense Buyer Battle that unfolded reflect a community eager to compete and accumulate ahead of exchange listings. As May 13 nears, the chance to buy at $0.0019 and claim daily bonuses will soon end. For anyone comparing crypto ICOs, BlockDAG offers a rare blend of real-time rewards, proven ROI of 2,520%, and a user-driven ecosystem supported by a successful CertiK audit. For those still on the sidelines, now is the moment to explore BlockDAG. The final presale days offer a limited opportunity to enter at favorable prices before the market reshapes valuations in public trading.

While the move has reaffirmed confidence in asset-backed on-chain ecosystems, it has also triggered renewed interest in utility tokens with real value proposition. Analysts are now singling out Qubetics , Polygon, and Render as the top contenders benefiting from this macro-level shift. Qubetics ($TICS), a new entrant shaking up the crypto scene, appears to be riding this institutional wave with smart positioning around interoperability and dev-focused innovation. Its $16.7 million presale success and a unique dual-pronged ecosystem—featuring QubeQode and Qubetics IDE—set it apart from peers. Unlike conventional tokens banking only on hype, Qubetics is structuring itself as an infrastructure layer for creators, entrepreneurs, and devs building across chains. Qubetics’ Tech Suite Could Be a Power Play for Developers and Multi-Chain Builders Qubetics has stepped into the limelight with tools designed to serve blockchain-native developers and mainstream coders alike. Through its flagship QubeQode and the integrated Qubetics IDE, the platform streamlines smart contract development and deployment across multiple blockchain networks. In an industry where fragmented ecosystems slow down adoption, Qubetics offers the Web3 equivalent of unified development environments seen in traditional tech. The platform serves both solo devs and corporate teams aiming to deploy decentralized applications without hitting chain-specific walls. Whether you’re building a lending protocol on Ethereum, a gaming dApp on Avalanche, or an RWA dashboard on Stellar, QubeQode’s flexibility ensures seamless output across chains. That’s not just convenient—it’s critical in 2025, where interoperability is no longer a bonus, but a necessity. Use cases range from enterprise finance tools that need rapid multi-chain deployments to individual smart contract writers looking to test and iterate on their logic using Qubetics’ visual testing environment. This kind of development-first approach is being recognized as a foundational infrastructure play, positioning Qubetics as a top crypto presale worth serious attention. Qubetics Presale ROI Potential: The Math Behind the Hype For those scanning today’s markets for the top crypto presale, Qubetics continues to check the right boxes—and not just on tech. The presale is now in Stage 33, priced at $0.2302 per $TICS token, and will enter a price jump every Sunday at 12 a.m. as part of its 7-day rotating cycle. With over 511 million tokens sold and more than 25,900 token holders already on board, the project has raised over $16.7 million, underlining community confidence. The projections are compelling. A $100 buy-in at today’s price would yield the following ROI possibilities if $TICS reaches post-launch targets: At $1, the ROI equals 334.33%, turning $100 into $434.33 At $5, the ROI jumps to 2,071.63%, reaching $2,171.63 At $10, it’s a massive 4,243.26% return, totaling $4,343.26 And at $15, the ROI spikes to 6,414.90%, netting $6,514.90 These figures place Qubetics not only among the top crypto presale projects in terms of utility but also in terms of raw profit potential. The presale momentum isn’t showing signs of slowing, especially with the Qubetics mainnet launch confirmed for Q2 2025. For many early participants, this project is shaping up as the best crypto pre sale for lifecycle growth and long-term hold strategies alike. Render Explores Gateway to Apple Vision Pro and Nvidia AI Push According to the latest CoinMarketCap Academy briefing, Render (RNDR) is advancing its position by enabling decentralized rendering for AI and high-fidelity digital environments. CEO Jules Urbach stated that Render Network’s integration plans are now centered around providing GPU compute power to Apple’s Vision Pro ecosystem and Nvidia’s AI stack. The Render Foundation is also backing the Open Compute Language initiative, which promotes interoperability across GPUs, a narrative that could significantly strengthen RNDR’s value proposition. Additionally, Render’s upcoming RNP-006 governance proposal hints at further decentralizing node validation and compute task routing. This model mirrors Ethereum’s staking economy but focused on GPU cycles instead of just financial validation. Render’s positioning as a computational layer for spatial computing, metaverse use, and machine learning makes it a strong companion to the growing appetite for on-chain utility. This layered growth strategy, supported by increasing developer incentives and integrations, reinforces its potential for longer-term relevance beyond market cycles. Polygon’s Steady Price Action Masks Growing DeFi Momentum In recent analysis published by The Cryptonomist, Polygon (MATIC) is experiencing subtle but consistent momentum despite relative price stability. Over the past week, MATIC posted 1.44% gains and saw trading volumes increase by 2.52%. What’s catching analysts’ attention isn’t the price, but the underlying DeFi growth on the Polygon chain. Specifically, over 50% of MATIC wallets holding for over a year are still active—a statistic that signals long-term conviction in the network’s future. Moreover, on-chain metrics suggest that the number of daily active users has continued to climb, even without flashy token spikes. The analysis highlighted Polygon’s increasingly vital role in hosting DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces that prioritize transaction speed and gas efficiency. Amid Ethereum’s congestion concerns, many developers continue to migrate liquidity and dApp activity to L2s like Polygon. For those considering allocation into longer-term value protocols, Polygon’s fundamentals suggest it remains a core DeFi infrastructure piece. Its quiet strength could be preparing it for a more aggressive breakout later this year, particularly as Ethereum’s roadmap unfolds. Conclusion: Are These Three the Smartest Bets for 2025 Short-Term Strategy? With real-world asset narratives capturing institutional interest, the entire landscape for altcoin valuation is shifting. Qubetics has firmly established itself as the top crypto presale by blending deep utility with ROI potential. Its dev-focused ecosystem, 10% weekly price jumps, and projections north of 6,000% have made it a magnet for serious capital. Render continues to earn its place in the conversation through unique integrations with Apple and Nvidia and by pioneering decentralized GPU utility, while Polygon’s on-chain usage metrics prove that developer ecosystems are increasingly leaning toward its speed and cost-effectiveness. For early adopters prioritizing fundamentals, tech stack relevance, and tokenomics that work, these three projects offer compelling short-term entry points and long-term promise. Those aiming to ride the next market rotation would be wise to watch these plays closely—and to view Qubetics not only as a dev tool or RWA hub but possibly as the best crypto presale of this cycle.

Per the South Korean newspaper Noksek Gyungjae Shinmun , crypto exchanges think Lee’s promise to “lower crypto transaction fees” could result in lower profits for their platforms. South Korean Crypto Exchanges: Commission Fee Fears Lee made the pledge this week, along with a promise to green-light Bitcoin spot ETFs . He appears to have been responding to a slew of crypto-related manifesto promises from his main rival, the People Power Party’s Kim Moon-soon. Kim, earlier this month, promised to let the country’s sovereign wealth and state pension funds buy BTC and other tokens. South Korea goes to the ballot booth on June 3.

(Source: MBN News/Screenshot) However, Lee leads Kim by around 20 percentage points in most opinion polls. And exchanges fear that if he wins power in early June, they could be hit in the pocket. The media outlet wrote that the entire crypto industry was now “expressing concerns” about Lee’s “fee reduction plan.” One exchange official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the newspaper: “Domestic crypto exchange fees commission fees are already very low compared to overseas platforms. Additional reductions could have a significant impact on exchanges’ profitability.” A senior executive at a non-fiat trading South Korean crypto exchange spoke to Cryptonews.com on May 7. Also speaking on condition of anonymity, the executive said: “Exchanges are already over-regulated as things stand in this country. A commission fee cap will hurt everyone in the sector more, particularly smaller operators.” Lee, meanwhile, is reportedly “reviewing a plan” that involves cutting crypto transaction fees in order “to establish parity with domestic stock market transactions.” BOK expected to lower key rates this month amid deepening economic downturn https://t.co/1NpTm1uPRT — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 6, 2025 South Korean Fees ‘Are Already Lower Than Those of International Rivals’ The media outlet said that, per its calculations, South Korean crypto exchanges charge an average of 0.05% in commission fees. Lee’s plan would see fees capped at 0.015%, a reduction of around 70%. The media outlet wrote that Binance commission fees stand at 0.1%, although it offers a 25% discount (0.075%) for transactions involving its own coins. The United States-based Coinbase trading platform, meanwhile, charges a fee of 0.5% for transactions worth less than $10,000. Advocates of Lee’s policy say that the move is part of a wider effort to protect crypto investors. They also say it will increase transparency and boost transaction volumes. South Korea’s high court delayed its first hearing on leading presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung’s election violation case until June 18, two weeks after the election date, ensuring he will be able to run for the country’s top office https://t.co/jl13YC7th5 — Bloomberg (@business) May 7, 2025 S Korean Exchanges Face Other Limiting Factors, Claim Industry Insiders South Korean industry insiders also complained that domestic exchanges experience limitations when it comes to diversifying their profit structures. While many overseas exchanges can offer profit-generating services such as crypto derivatives and margin trading, domestic platforms are restricted by tight regulations. As such, any sort of transaction fee cap would hurt South Korean crypto exchanges’ main revenue flow. This could prove to be “a huge burden,” crypto exchange officials claimed. Insiders called on politicians to hold “consultation sessions with the industry” and “consider the market’s unique characteristics.” The post South Korean Crypto Exchanges Fret Over Commission Fee Cap Fears appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Crypto Exchange|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-07 23:30:00

Among the most ambitious claims is the idea that the XRP price could skyrocket to $1,000 or even beyond. In response to these projections, a crypto analyst has outlined several key factors that would need to align for XRP to reach such a target. Factors Needed To Take The XRP Price To $1,000 While it’s tempting to imagine XRP hitting a four-digit price target, X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Jasmin argues that the numbers don’t support such a prediction. For the XRP price to reach $1,000, it would need to climb as high as 46,848%, accompanied by key factors like a significant rise in global adoption, especially by financial institutions. Related Reading: XRP Price To $1,000: Analyst Reveals Target For When Banks Start Using XRP Although Ripple, a blockchain company, has made progress in partnering with global banks and fintech firms for cross-border payments, that level of adoption is still nowhere near enough to support a $1,000 XRP price tag. To even approach this level, XRP would need to become a fundamental part of the global financial structure across different sectors, particularly in banking, remittance, and investment. But beyond simple adoption, XRP would have to be deeply integrated into major economies in such a way that it becomes an indispensable currency for daily transactions. For this to happen, Jasmin reveals that the cryptocurrency would need widespread regulatory clarity to ensure that it can be used in multiple jurisdictions without any legal barriers. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the US SEC has already created years’ worth of uncertainty around XRP’s legal status. Until this issue is resolved favorably, the cryptocurrency’s potential for mainstream adoption remains limited. Jasmin has also highlighted that XRP would have to incorporate mechanisms that would drastically reduce its circulating supply. While the cryptocurrency’s price could grow with more aggressive token burns, a jump to $1,000 still seems unlikely. Such a high valuation would also need massive speculative trading activities, which are usually seen during bull markets. How Market Cap Influences A $1,000 Projection Based on Jasmin’s analysis, the most significant factor that makes a $1,000 XRP price projection unrealistic is its market capitalization. Currently, XRP has a market cap of about $125.15 billion, and for its price to hit a four-digit level, its total market valuation would need to reach $50 trillion. Related Reading: XRP Price Cross That Led To 20x Rally In 2017 Returns To put this in perspective, the global crypto market capitalization today is $3.09 trillion, according to CoinGecko data. This would mean that XRP alone would need a market cap over 15x higher than the entire crypto market. Furthermore, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has never even come close to reaching a $10 trillion market cap. BTC’s market valuation currently sits at $1.92 trillion, meaning XRP would have to surpass it by over 25x to get a $50 trillion market cap. Due to these extreme market cap requirements, Jasmin argues that a $1,000 or even $10,000 target is highly unrealistic. However, she acknowledges that a price surge to $5 or even $10 is a far more attainable goal.

44299923,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158218,1746661810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,UBS Forecast: USD/ZAR Could Plummet on Rising Risk Appetite,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usd-zar-ubs-forecast/,"For those tracking global markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, shifts in major currency pairs like the USD/ZAR can offer valuable insights into broader economic sentiment. Recent analysis from UBS suggests a notable potential movement for this pair, indicating that conditions are aligning for the US Dollar to weaken against the South African Rand. This outlook is significantly tied to increasing trade deal optimism and a corresponding rise in global investor risk appetite . What is Driving the UBS Forecast on USD/ZAR? UBS analysts point to specific factors underpinning their view that the USD/ZAR exchange rate may decline. A lower USD/ZAR rate means it takes fewer US Dollars to buy one South African Rand, effectively indicating a strengthening ZAR relative to the USD. The primary drivers identified are: Trade Deal Progress: Positive developments or the anticipation of favorable outcomes in major international trade negotiations tend to reduce global economic uncertainty. This encourages investors to move away from traditional safe-haven assets, like the US Dollar, towards currencies associated with emerging markets, such as the South African Rand. Increased Risk Appetite: When investor confidence is high and global economic prospects appear brighter, there is a greater willingness to take on more risk. Emerging market currencies and assets often benefit disproportionately from this shift, as they typically offer higher yields but also carry greater perceived risk. A surge in risk appetite directly supports the ZAR. These two factors are often intertwined. Successful trade talks signal improved global economic health, which in turn boosts confidence and encourages risk-taking in the Forex market and beyond. How Does Trade Deal Optimism Impact Emerging Markets? Emerging markets, like South Africa, are often highly sensitive to global trade flows and investor sentiment. Here’s why trade deal optimism is particularly impactful: Export Potential: Better trade relations can open up or expand export markets for South African goods, boosting economic activity and potentially improving the country’s trade balance. Foreign Investment: Reduced trade tensions create a more stable and predictable global environment, making emerging markets more attractive destinations for foreign direct investment and portfolio flows. This inflow of capital increases demand for the local currency (ZAR). Commodity Prices: Many emerging economies are significant commodity exporters. Improved global trade often correlates with stronger demand for commodities, pushing prices up. As a major exporter of minerals and other commodities, South Africa’s economy benefits from higher prices, which supports the Rand. This positive feedback loop reinforces the case for a stronger ZAR when trade prospects improve, influencing the USD/ZAR pair. Understanding the Role of Risk Appetite in Forex Risk appetite is a key metric for understanding capital flows in the Forex market . It describes the level of risk that investors are willing to take on. When risk appetite is high, investors seek higher returns, often found in assets perceived as riskier, such as: Emerging market currencies (like ZAR) Stocks in developing economies Certain commodities Conversely, when risk appetite is low (during periods of uncertainty or fear), investors flock to safe havens like: The US Dollar (often considered a primary safe haven) Japanese Yen Swiss Franc Government bonds from stable economies Gold The current environment, characterized by increasing trade deal optimism , is fostering higher risk appetite . This dynamic directly impacts the USD/ZAR pair, as capital flows move out of the safe-haven USD and into the higher-yielding, risk-sensitive ZAR. What Does a Weakening USD/ZAR Mean for the Market? A weakening USD/ZAR rate has several implications for different market participants: For South Africa: Makes imports cheaper (potentially reducing inflation). Makes exports more expensive for international buyers (could impact competitiveness unless commodity prices are rising). Attracts foreign investment seeking exposure to a strengthening currency and potentially higher local returns. Can improve the country’s external debt profile if denominated in USD. For USD Holders/Investors: Investments in ZAR-denominated assets become more valuable when converted back to USD. Travel to South Africa becomes less expensive. For the Forex Market: Increased trading activity around the USD/ZAR pair. Potential for volatility as sentiment shifts. May signal broader trends for other emerging market currencies against the USD. Are There Challenges or Risks to This Outlook? While the UBS forecast highlights the potential for USD/ZAR to weaken, it’s crucial to remember that Forex markets are influenced by numerous factors. Potential challenges or risks include: Reversal in Trade Optimism: Any breakdown or negative turn in trade negotiations could quickly reverse sentiment and strengthen the USD. Domestic Issues in South Africa: Local political instability, economic challenges (like power shortages or high unemployment), or changes in monetary policy by the South African Reserve Bank could negatively impact the ZAR regardless of global sentiment. Unexpected Global Events: Geopolitical shocks, new economic data from major economies (US inflation, Federal Reserve policy), or other unforeseen events can rapidly shift risk appetite and currency valuations. Commodity Price Volatility: While often linked to trade, commodity prices have their own dynamics and significant declines could hurt the ZAR. Therefore, while the current environment supports the UBS forecast , continuous monitoring of global and local developments is essential. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Given the UBS forecast and the factors at play, what should market participants consider? Monitor Trade Headlines: Keep a close eye on news related to major international trade negotiations. Positive headlines reinforce the trend; negative ones pose a risk. Track Risk Appetite Indicators: Observe broader market movements. Are stock markets rising globally? Are traditional safe havens like gold or the Yen weakening? These can be signs of increasing risk appetite . Analyze South African Fundamentals: Pay attention to South Africa’s economic data releases (inflation, growth, unemployment) and political developments. These domestic factors play a significant role in the ZAR’s strength. Consider Volatility: Emerging market currencies can be volatile. Risk management is crucial if trading the USD/ZAR pair. Look for Confirmation: While UBS has a view, look for analysis from other major banks and research institutions to see if there is a consensus forming in the Forex market . This environment driven by trade deal optimism and rising risk appetite presents potential opportunities but also requires careful analysis and awareness of potential pitfalls. In conclusion, UBS’s outlook for a potentially weaker USD/ZAR pair is strongly linked to the positive momentum generated by trade deal optimism and the resulting increase in global investor risk appetite . These factors create a favorable environment for emerging market currencies like the South African Rand. However, market participants must remain vigilant, as the complex interplay of global events, domestic conditions, and shifts in sentiment can quickly alter the trajectory of currency pairs in the volatile Forex market .

44300157,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158219,1746662151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI in Gaming Startup Sett Secures $27M for Revolutionary Game Development AI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-gaming-startup-funding/,"For those tracking the convergence of technology and digital economies, the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence are creating ripples across various sectors, including the booming world of gaming. Just as GPUs evolved to power complex game graphics and now fuel AI computations, AI itself is becoming integral to how games are built and promoted. This intersection is precisely where a new player, Sett, is making its mark, emerging from stealth with significant startup funding to apply AI to the mobile game landscape. What Problem is Sett Solving with AI in Gaming? The mobile gaming market is fiercely competitive. Building a game might be accessible, but making it stand out and succeed is a monumental challenge. Companies pour billions into user acquisition marketing, yet the content needed for this, like engaging playable ads, is costly and time-consuming to produce. This is the core pain point Sett targets. They’ve developed AI agents specifically designed to tackle the complexities of getting games noticed in a crowded marketplace. How is Sett Revolutionizing Mobile Game Marketing? Sett’s primary focus is on enhancing mobile game marketing through AI-driven automation. With changes in user tracking on platforms like iOS, the emphasis has shifted to ‘creative content’ – interactive marketing materials and in-game moments that draw users in. These ‘playable’ ads, while effective, are often as complex and expensive to create as mini-games themselves. Sett claims its AI platform can generate this crucial marketing content significantly faster and cheaper than traditional methods. Early customers include major names like Zynga, Scopely, and Rovio, indicating strong initial traction. Exploring the Impact of Game Development AI on Efficiency The startup asserts a dramatic improvement in efficiency for creating marketing assets. By leveraging their game development AI agents, Sett suggests the process can be up to 15 times faster and 25 times cheaper compared to manual creation. This level of automation could fundamentally change how game publishers approach their marketing efforts, allowing for more experimentation and scale in reaching potential players. The company’s technology includes a custom game engine and an agentic layer designed to generate code, providing a flexible foundation for their AI tools. What Does This Funding Mean for Gaming Industry News? Sett’s emergence and substantial startup funding highlight a key trend in the gaming sector: the increasing reliance on AI to solve operational challenges. The investment, totaling $27 million across seed and Series A rounds led by firms like Bessemer Venture Partners, signals strong investor confidence in Sett’s approach. This news adds another layer to the dynamic gaming industry news landscape, especially considering parallel developments like AppLovin selling its gaming assets, which were reportedly used, in part, to train their own AI models for ad tech. Sett’s funding will be used to expand their team of engineers and AI specialists to meet demand, as they already have over 100 studios on a waiting list. Is AI Set to Replace Human Creativity in Game Development? While Sett’s current focus is on marketing and in-game content generation, the broader question of AI’s role in full game development AI looms. Sett’s CEO, Amit Carmi, believes building AI agents for end-to-end development and marketing is possible, though he notes this might not be Sett’s ultimate direction. Investors and founders suggest that while AI can automate parts of production and distribution, especially marketing content, the human element remains crucial for the high level of detail and creativity needed to make truly successful, stand-out games in a crowded market. The consensus seems to be that AI will serve as a powerful tool and co-pilot rather than a complete replacement for human designers and developers in the foreseeable future. In summary, Sett’s $27 million funding round marks a significant moment for the application of AI in gaming . By focusing on AI agents for automated marketing content creation, the company addresses a critical need for efficiency and cost reduction in mobile game marketing . This development is a notable piece of gaming industry news , demonstrating how substantial startup funding is flowing into AI solutions that promise to reshape parts of the game creation and promotion pipeline. While the full scope of game development AI is still unfolding, Sett is positioned to play a key role in making mobile games more visible and viable.

Technical indicators are bullish, and the approval odds of a much-anticipated Cardano ETF are boosting investor confidence. However, while traders are keeping a close eye on ADA, another project is quietly stealing the spotlight with an even greater potential for explosive growth. Enter Ruvi , the AI-powered cryptocurrency set to redefine blockchain innovation. If Cardano’s steady rise excites you, Ruvi’s massive upside potential will leave you speechless. Here’s why Ruvi could be your ticket to crypto millions. Cardano eyes a $1 break, but will it deliver? Cardano has seen a resurgence in investor sentiment, thanks to well-aligned technical patterns. The formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders and a successful test of a descending wedge suggest ADA might soar beyond key resistance levels of $0.88 and $1. Notably, speculation around the approval of a Cardano ETF is injecting the market with optimism, presenting ADA as a strong play for long-term investors. But even if Cardano reaches $1 and beyond, ADA’s established position caps its growth compared to earlier stages. For those looking for multiplier-level returns, early-stage projects like Ruvi represent the ultimate growth opportunity. Why Ruvi is outshining the competition Ruvi isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a full-fledged ecosystem revolutionizing industries through artificial intelligence. Designed for maximum impact and sustained growth, Ruvi merges cutting-edge AI with blockchain, driving solutions in predictive analytics, fraud detection, and logistics optimization. Key reasons Ruvi outshines other tokens: Fixed supply creates scarcity Unlike inflationary tokens, Ruvi’s hard cap of 1.5 billion tokens fuels demand, ensuring sustained price appreciation. Real-world AI application Ruvi isn’t just theoretical. Its integration of AI delivers measurable results across industries. Unmatched presale bonuses The Ruvi presale is designed to reward early supporters, offering unparalleled bonuses that multiply investor returns. Ruvi presale structure Ruvi’s presale provides an irresistible opportunity to secure tokens at just $0.01 each, with tailored bonuses designed to amplify your investment: $200-$500 investment: 20% bonus $500-$1,000 investment: 40% bonus $1,000-$2,000 investment: 60% bonus $2,000-$5,000 investment: 80% bonus Investments over $5,000: 100% bonus Real examples of Ruvi’s ROI potential Entry-level ($300 Investment) Investing $300 secures 30,000 tokens at $0.01 each. With a 20% bonus, you get an extra 6,000 tokens, taking your total to 36,000 tokens. If Ruvi hits $1.90, your initial $300 investment could yield an impressive $68,400. Mid-tier ($1,500 Investment) A $1,500 investment gets you 150,000 tokens. With a 60% bonus, you gain an additional 90,000 tokens, totaling 240,000 tokens. Should Ruvi reach $3.50, your portfolio could balloon to $840,000! High-tier ($7,000 Investment) At $7,000, you receive 700,000 tokens, and with a 100% bonus, this doubles to 1.4 million tokens. If Ruvi climbs to $5.00, your initial stake could skyrocket to $7 million! Why timing is critical While Cardano navigates the crowded crypto market, Ruvi offers something rare in today’s environment—first-mover rewards. Investing during its presale phase not only secures tokens at the lowest price but also locks in generous bonuses. Every day you delay, Ruvi edges closer to higher valuations, reducing the phenomenal ROI currently within reach. Take action before it’s too late Cardano’s potential surge to $1 promises gains for its holders. But in a world where gains are measured in multiples, Ruvi offers the kind of groundbreaking opportunity usually reserved for the earliest movers in the crypto space. Don’t sit on the sidelines while others seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance to multiply their investments.

If Not, There’s Still Time to Earn at $0.0019 Before BDAG Hits Exchanges",https://thecoinrise.com/heard-about-blockdags-25-referral-rewards-if-not-theres-still-time-to-earn-at-0-0019-before-bdag-hits-exchanges/,"In a world where crypto earnings often take time or complex steps, BlockDAG (BDAG) keeps it simple. Refer someone, and you get 25% of their BDAG buy right away. It’s not delayed or locked up. It’s fast, direct, and happens the moment the transaction goes through. Even better, the person you refer earns a 5% BDAG bonus too. Every referral becomes a shared win. With BDAG priced at $0.0019 until May 13 and exchange listings going live the same day, there’s not much time left. For those searching for the top crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG’s mix of easy rewards and early pricing stands out. Fast Payouts, Simple Steps, Real Rewards BlockDAG’s referral setup works fast. As soon as you sign up, you get your own referral link. Share it, and when someone uses it to buy, you receive 25% of their purchase in BDAG right away. They get 5% more BDAG too, which makes it easy to share and benefit together. What makes this system different is how quick and clear it is. There’s no long wait, no extra steps, and no spending limits. Just use your code, earn coins, and repeat as many times as you like. That’s what makes BlockDAG feel different right now. If you’re looking for a crypto to invest in now without needing big funds or advanced skills, this is one to watch. Countdown to $0.0019: Final Chance Before May 13 The referral rewards are exciting, but timing is what makes this moment stand out. BDAG is currently available at a limited price of $0.0019, a sharp drop from the current batch 28 rate of $0.0262. This special offer ends on May 13, along with the chance to buy before listings go live. After that, exchange updates will roll out and prices will shift based on the market. That means buyers later on could pay much more per coin. Right now, the numbers line up well for users sharing referral links. For anyone seeking a crypto to invest in now, it’s a simple equation: buy low, earn 25% BDAG from each referral, and help others earn their 5% bonus too. Three wins in one move. Momentum Backed by Real Numbers BlockDAG’s referral setup works even better because of how far the presale has come. With $227.5 million already raised and over 19.7 billion BDAG sold across 28 batches, this is a project already in action. The ROI from the very first batch now stands at 2,520%, showing that those who joined early made strong gains. The current price gives new users a shot at getting in near those levels before listings change the game. The referral program is also powering fast organic growth. As more users hear about it and join, it becomes easier to keep earning 25% BDAG through new sign-ups. That’s why many see this as a solid crypto to invest in now. It’s simple, and both buyers and sharers benefit immediately. Last Say BlockDAG is showing how earning in crypto can work without delay. The 25% referral bonus pays right away, and the person you bring in gets 5% extra. Combine that with the $0.0019 limited price valid until May 13, and it creates a short-term opening that’s getting harder to ignore. With $227.5 million raised, 19.7 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% gain since batch one, this is no longer just early speculation. Whether you’re new to crypto or want to grow fast by sharing a referral code, BlockDAG brings speed and access. If you’re aiming for a crypto to invest in now with real earning potential, this may be one of the clearest moves of 2025. But the window is closing, and once May 13 passes, the game could change completely.

The US government reportedly uses modified apps to archive messages. A Reuters photo last week revealed that Michael Waltz, the recently ousted national security adviser, was using TeleMessage to communicate with colleagues during a Trump administration cabinet meeting. Trump said last week on Truth Social that he plans to nominate Waltz to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations. The former national security adviser fell into hot water earlier this year for accidentally adding a journalist to a sensitive Signal chat about war plans between top Trump administration figures. The identity of the hacker remains unknown, but 404 Media viewed the hacked material that was anonymously provided. The hacker also anonymously noted that the hack took 15-20 minutes and “wasn’t much effort at all.” The hacker didn’t access Waltz’s messages specifically, but the thief did access data related to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the crypto exchange Coinbase, as well as other financial institutions. A screenshot shows that the hacker was able to access a TeleMessage panel that lists the names, phone numbers and email addresses of CPB employees. The screenshot also shows an option to select 747 entries, suggesting that the attacker has access to the data of hundreds of US government employees.

44300281,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158220,1746662451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Treasury Powerhouse: Asset Entities and Strive Merge for Public BTC Play,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asset-entities-bitcoin-treasury/,"Big news is hitting the wires for those following the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency. Asset Entities (NASDAQ: ASST), a company already listed on the NASDAQ exchange, is set to merge with Strive Asset Management. The strategic goal? To create a new kind of entity on the public markets: a dedicated Bitcoin treasury company. This move signals a potentially significant shift, offering investors a novel way to gain exposure to the leading digital asset. What is a Public Bitcoin Treasury Company? Before diving into the specifics of the Asset Entities and Strive Asset Management deal, let’s clarify what a public Bitcoin company focused on treasury operations actually entails. Unlike companies that mine Bitcoin or provide crypto services, a Bitcoin treasury company primarily holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a significant asset. The core objective is often to provide shareholders with direct exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin through the company’s stock. Key characteristics typically include: Primary Asset Holding: A substantial portion of the company’s assets consists of Bitcoin. Strategic Focus: Management is focused on strategies related to acquiring, holding, and potentially managing their Bitcoin reserves. Shareholder Value: The value proposition to shareholders is often tied directly to the performance of their Bitcoin holdings. Public Listing: Being listed on a major exchange like NASDAQ allows broader investor access compared to private funds or direct crypto ownership. The most prominent example of this model is MicroStrategy, an operating software company that has famously adopted a corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, accumulating significant amounts of BTC over time. Asset Entities ASST and Strive Asset Management: The Merger Explained According to a GlobeNewswire press release, Asset Entities (NASDAQ: ASST) is merging with Strive Asset Management. The new combined entity will operate under the Strive brand and will remain listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. This is a crucial point – the existing public listing of Asset Entities provides a direct path for the new, Bitcoin-focused venture to immediately trade on a major U.S. exchange. Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has positioned itself as an asset manager focusing on a different approach to investing, often emphasizing a focus on profit over political or social agendas (often referred to as ‘anti-ESG’). Their move into the Bitcoin treasury space via this merger with Asset Entities ASST indicates a strategic decision to embrace digital assets as a core component of their future offerings. The press release highlights that the new entity will focus on maximizing Bitcoin (BTC) exposure and long-term value for shareholders. This suggests a dedicated strategy towards accumulating and holding Bitcoin, making the company’s stock a proxy for direct BTC investment, albeit with the added layers of corporate structure, management decisions, and market dynamics. Why This Strategic Move? Benefits for the New Entity and Investors The decision by Asset Entities and Strive Asset Management to merge and focus on becoming a NASDAQ listed Bitcoin company offers several potential benefits: Immediate Public Access: Leveraging Asset Entities’ existing NASDAQ listing bypasses the traditional IPO process for Strive’s new venture, allowing them to hit the ground running on a major exchange. Clear Market Positioning: Positioning the new entity explicitly as a ‘Bitcoin treasury company’ provides a clear and understandable value proposition for investors interested in Bitcoin exposure through traditional equity markets. Strive’s Brand and Expertise: Operating under the Strive brand brings their established identity and asset management expertise to the venture, potentially attracting their existing investor base and new capital. Potential for Capital Raising: Being publicly listed can facilitate easier access to capital markets for potential future fundraising, which could be used to acquire more Bitcoin. Shareholder Access to BTC: Provides traditional investors, who may be hesitant or unable to directly hold Bitcoin, with a regulated and familiar avenue for exposure via stock ownership. This merger creates a unique vehicle that combines the accessibility of a public stock with the investment focus on a volatile, high-growth asset class like Bitcoin. What Are the Potential Challenges and Risks? While the prospects are exciting, establishing a dedicated Bitcoin treasury company on a major exchange like NASDAQ also comes with significant challenges and risks: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The most obvious risk. The value of the company’s primary asset, and therefore its stock price, will be highly sensitive to the volatile price swings of Bitcoin. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally and within the U.S. Changes in regulations could impact the company’s operations, reporting requirements, or even the ability to hold Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Management and Operational Challenges: Successfully managing a corporate treasury of a volatile digital asset requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Market Perception and Premium/Discount: The stock price might trade at a premium or discount to the underlying value of its Bitcoin holdings (often referred to as Net Asset Value or NAV), influenced by market sentiment, management performance, and liquidity. Investors considering the new Strive entity will need to weigh these risks carefully against the potential benefits of Bitcoin exposure. Comparing to Other Public Bitcoin Companies How does this new venture compare to existing public Bitcoin company examples? As mentioned, MicroStrategy is the benchmark. However, MicroStrategy is primarily a software company whose core business generates revenue, and its Bitcoin treasury is a corporate strategy layered on top. While its stock price is heavily influenced by its BTC holdings, it still has an underlying operational business. The new Strive entity, emerging from the merger of Asset Entities and Strive Asset Management, appears to be positioning itself with a much more explicit and central focus on the Bitcoin treasury function from its inception. This might make it a more direct, albeit potentially more volatile, proxy for Bitcoin compared to companies with diversified operations. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching this development, here are some points to consider: Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Investing in a company whose value is closely tied to Bitcoin’s price means accepting significant volatility. Research the New Entity: Once the merger is complete and the new entity is fully operational under the Strive brand, thoroughly research their specific strategy for managing their Bitcoin treasury, their security protocols, and their management team. Understand the Premium/Discount: Pay attention to whether the stock is trading at a premium or discount to the value of its underlying Bitcoin holdings. This can indicate market sentiment and potential mispricing. Diversification: Consider how this investment fits into your overall portfolio diversification strategy. Stay Informed: Keep up with news regarding both the company’s performance and broader Bitcoin and crypto market developments. The creation of a dedicated NASDAQ listed Bitcoin company is a notable event, expanding the options for investors seeking regulated exposure to the digital asset space. A Compelling New Avenue for Bitcoin Exposure The merger between Asset Entities (ASST) and Strive Asset Management to form a public Bitcoin treasury company under the Strive brand is a significant development in the evolving landscape of crypto adoption within traditional finance. By creating a dedicated entity focused on maximizing Bitcoin exposure while remaining listed on NASDAQ, they are offering investors a clear and accessible pathway to participate in the potential growth of BTC. While the inherent volatility of Bitcoin and the operational challenges of managing a large digital asset treasury present risks, the strategic vision to create a focused public Bitcoin company could resonate with a growing segment of investors looking for regulated exposure. This move by Strive Asset Management and Asset Entities ASST marks another step towards bridging the gap between traditional equity markets and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies, potentially setting a precedent for future similar ventures.

Zhao, also known as CZ, said on a Farokh Radio podcast episode aired May 6 that he “wouldn’t mind” a pardon and that his lawyers have already filed the paperwork on his behalf “I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said, adding that he submitted the request after Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported in March that he was seeking a pardon from Trump amid discussions of a business deal between the Trump family and Binance.US. Zhao denied the reports at the time, but said on the podcast that he thought “if they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply.” He added that Trump’s pardon of three BitMEX founders, including Arthur Hayes, also motivated him to submit an application. Zhao said the application was submitted about two weeks ago. Changpeng Zhao (right) speaking with Farokh Sarmad (left). Source: Farokh Radio Zhao said at the time of the Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal reports that “no felon would mind a pardon,” and claimed he is the only person in US history to serve prison time for a Bank Secrecy Act charge. Zhao pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge in November 2023 as part of a deal Binance reached with US authorities, which saw it pay a $4.3 billion fine , to which Zhao contributed $50 million. He was also forced to step down as CEO . Zhao was later sentenced to four months in prison and was prohibited from working at Binance as part of his plea deal.

While our primary focus is the exciting world of digital assets, it’s crucial to keep an eye on traditional financial markets. Why? Because movements in the US stock market often offer valuable insights into broader economic trends and overall investor sentiment , which can indirectly influence the crypto landscape. Today, we’re seeing a notable positive signal from Wall Street. What’s Happening with the Stock Market Opening? The stock market opening today brought good news for traditional investors, with major indices kicking off the trading session on a higher note. This follows a period where markets have been closely watching economic data and corporate earnings reports. Here’s a quick look at how the key indices performed right out of the gate: S&P 500: Started the day up +0.13% NASDAQ: Opened with a gain of +0.07% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Saw the strongest initial momentum, rising +0.31% These early gains, though modest, suggest a positive start to the trading day, indicating that market participants are feeling a degree of optimism. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About the S&P 500 and NASDAQ? You might wonder, ‘I’m here for Bitcoin and Ethereum, why talk about the S&P 500 and NASDAQ ?’ That’s a fair question! The connection lies in the concept of risk appetite and market liquidity. Historically, there has been a correlation between the performance of tech stocks (heavily represented in the NASDAQ) and risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. When investors feel confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, both tech stocks and crypto often benefit. Conversely, during periods of uncertainty or fear, investors tend to move towards safer assets, sometimes leading to sell-offs in both markets. The NASDAQ , in particular, is home to many growth-oriented technology companies. Its performance is often seen as a barometer for investor confidence in future innovation and economic expansion – themes that also resonate strongly within the crypto space. Similarly, the S&P 500 , representing the 500 largest US publicly traded companies, provides a broader snapshot of the overall health and direction of the US economy. When these major indices show strength, it can signal a more favorable macroeconomic environment for risk assets globally, including digital currencies. Understanding Investor Sentiment: A Key Driver At its core, the positive stock market opening reflects improving investor sentiment . Sentiment is essentially the overall attitude of investors towards a particular market or financial instrument. It’s driven by a mix of factors, including economic data releases, corporate earnings, geopolitical events, and even news headlines. Positive sentiment in traditional markets can spill over into the crypto market for several reasons: Increased Risk Appetite: When investors feel optimistic, they are more likely to allocate capital to higher-risk, potentially higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Liquidity: A strong stock market can indicate healthy overall market liquidity, meaning there’s more capital flowing through the financial system, some of which can find its way into crypto. Confidence Boost: General economic confidence, reflected in stock market gains, can indirectly boost confidence in newer, less-established asset classes like digital assets. Conversely, negative sentiment stemming from stock market downturns often correlates with crypto price drops, as investors become risk-averse and potentially liquidate crypto holdings to cover losses or increase cash positions elsewhere. What Might Be Driving This Positive Start? While the initial report is brief, several factors could be contributing to this morning’s positive momentum: Positive Economic Data: Recent reports on inflation, employment, or consumer spending might have exceeded expectations, boosting confidence in the economic outlook. Strong Corporate Earnings: If companies are reporting better-than-expected profits, it signals underlying business strength. Federal Reserve Outlook: Any indications that the Federal Reserve might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle or considering future cuts can be positive for markets. Geopolitical Stability: A reduction in major geopolitical tensions can decrease uncertainty and encourage investment. It’s important to remember that market movements are complex and influenced by a multitude of factors. The initial stock market opening is just one data point in a continuous trading day. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how should you, as a crypto investor, use this information? Stay Informed: Recognize the interconnectedness. While crypto has its unique drivers, global macroeconomic conditions and traditional market sentiment matter. Watch for Correlation: Observe how Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies react throughout the day. Do they track the stock market’s movements, or are they following their own narrative? Assess Risk Appetite: A positive US stock market can indicate higher overall risk appetite. This might be a favorable environment for altcoins or higher-beta crypto assets, but always conduct your own research. Diversify Your Information Sources: Don’t rely solely on stock market news, but integrate it into your broader understanding of the financial landscape. This morning’s positive start in the US stock market , including gains in the S&P 500 and NASDAQ , is a signal of potentially improving investor sentiment in traditional finance. While not a direct predictor of crypto prices, it’s a data point worth considering as part of the larger global economic picture that influences all asset classes. Concluding Thoughts The higher stock market opening today provides a glimmer of optimism in the broader financial world. For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding these traditional market movements is like having an extra compass. It helps gauge the prevailing winds of investor sentiment and global risk appetite, factors that can subtly, yet significantly, impact the path of digital assets. Keep watching how this sentiment evolves throughout the day and week, and how the crypto market responds.

While the United States has emerged as a significant player in the global Bitcoin mining industry , its reliance on hardware manufactured predominantly overseas, particularly in China, presents a critical vulnerability. This situation is forcing companies to rethink strategies, potentially altering the competitive balance on a global scale. Why Are Tariffs a Major Concern for US Bitcoin Miners ? At the heart of the challenge is the simple fact that high-performance application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, the backbone of modern Bitcoin mining operations, are not widely produced domestically. For years, China dominated both the manufacturing and operation sides of the Bitcoin mining industry . While crackdowns in China led to a mass migration of miners to other regions, including the U.S., the manufacturing base largely remained concentrated in Asia. This dependency means that American mining companies must import the vast majority of their Bitcoin mining equipment . Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, directly increase the cost of acquiring these machines. For an industry with already tight margins, heavily influenced by energy costs and Bitcoin price volatility, added expenses on core infrastructure can be devastating. Think of it like this: Higher Upfront Costs: Tariffs add a percentage onto the purchase price of every mining rig imported. Reduced Profitability: Increased capital expenditure means a longer time to recoup investment, impacting overall profitability. Competitive Disadvantage: Miners in regions without similar tariffs can acquire the same equipment at a lower cost, giving them an edge. The imposition of significant crypto tariffs specifically targeting mining hardware could fundamentally alter the economic viability of mining operations within the United States. The Current State of Mining Hardware Tariffs The issue of mining hardware tariffs has been a point of contention for some time. Under previous administrations, tariffs were placed on a wide range of goods imported from China, including electronics that could be classified as computing hardware used for mining. The Trump administration, despite its leader’s later expressed interest in crypto, was the one that initially implemented these tariffs. Recently, there was a temporary reprieve. A 90-day pause on certain tariffs provided a brief window of relief for US Bitcoin miners . This pause allowed companies to potentially accelerate hardware imports at pre-tariff prices, a strategic move to stock up before the potential resumption of higher costs. However, as The Block reported, this relief was temporary, and uncertainty looms large as the July deadline approaches. The potential re-imposition of tariffs creates significant planning challenges. Companies must weigh the risk of waiting against the cost of buying now, even if they don’t immediately need the equipment. This uncertainty is perhaps as damaging as the tariffs themselves, making long-term capital planning difficult for the Bitcoin mining industry in the U.S. Key Points on the Tariff Situation: Tariffs apply to imported ASIC mining machines. These tariffs originated from broader trade policies with countries like China. A temporary 90-day pause offered brief relief. The potential resumption of tariffs in July is causing significant concern and strategic adjustments. The specific tariff rates can vary based on classification, but the impact is a direct increase in hardware cost. The Global Ripple Effect: Who Stands to Gain from High Crypto Tariffs in the U.S.? When costs for US Bitcoin miners rise due to tariffs, it inevitably shifts the global competitive landscape. Mining is a global endeavor, and capital tends to flow to regions where it can operate most efficiently and profitably. If the U.S. becomes a more expensive place to set up or expand mining operations, other regions become relatively more attractive. As the source article notes, Russia is one country that stands to gain. Why? Access to energy costs is a major factor in mining profitability, and Russia often boasts competitive energy prices. Furthermore, if they can acquire the same Bitcoin mining equipment without facing the same tariff burdens as U.S. companies, their operational costs become significantly lower on a per-machine basis. This cost advantage allows Russian firms to potentially expand more rapidly or operate profitably at lower Bitcoin price points than their American counterparts. But it’s not just Russia. The report highlights that global miners are increasingly eyeing alternative markets. Regions in Africa and South America are emerging as potential new hubs for the Bitcoin mining industry . These areas often offer: Lower Energy Costs: Access to abundant and cheap sources of electricity, sometimes from renewable sources. Developing Infrastructure: Opportunities to build out mining infrastructure from the ground up. Potentially Favorable Regulations: Some countries are actively seeking to attract crypto businesses. Access to Hardware: Potentially less friction or lower costs for importing Bitcoin mining equipment compared to a high-tariff environment like the potential one in the U.S. This global diversification is a natural response to economic pressures. While tariffs might be intended to protect or encourage domestic industries, in a globally connected industry like Bitcoin mining, they can inadvertently push activity (and hash rate) to other parts of the world, potentially undermining the goal of establishing the U.S. as a dominant mining center. Strategic Adjustments: How US Bitcoin Miners Are Responding Facing the dual challenge of existing tariffs and potential increases, US Bitcoin miners are not sitting idle. They are actively adjusting their strategies to mitigate risks and maintain competitiveness. These adjustments span several areas: 1. Accelerated Hardware Procurement: During the temporary tariff pause, many companies likely rushed to import as much Bitcoin mining equipment as possible to lock in lower prices before the potential resumption of higher mining hardware tariffs . This involves significant capital outlay upfront but hedges against future cost increases. 2. Diversifying Suppliers (Where Possible): While major ASIC manufacturers are concentrated, miners may explore options from different producers or look into secondary markets, though the latter comes with its own risks regarding machine lifespan and efficiency. 3. Exploring Domestic Manufacturing: Although currently limited, there is ongoing discussion and nascent effort within the U.S. to develop domestic manufacturing capabilities for mining hardware. This is a long-term strategy that requires significant investment and technological development to compete with established foreign producers. 4. Geographic Relocation/Expansion: As mentioned, some U.S. companies are looking at expanding or relocating parts of their operations to more favorable jurisdictions, both domestically (seeking lower energy costs in states like Texas or those with abundant hydro power) and internationally (exploring the opportunities in Africa, South America, or other regions with lower crypto tariffs and energy prices). 5. Lobbying and Advocacy: The Bitcoin mining industry is increasingly engaging with policymakers in Washington D.C. to educate them about the industry’s needs and the potential negative consequences of tariffs on its growth and competitiveness within the U.S. 6. Focusing on Efficiency and Innovation: Regardless of hardware costs, improving operational efficiency (energy use, cooling, uptime) becomes even more critical when capital expenses are high. Investment in infrastructure and operational best practices is key. These strategic shifts highlight the resilience and adaptability of the US Bitcoin miners , but they also underscore the significant pressure the industry is under due to external economic and trade policies. Challenges and Opportunities for the Bitcoin Mining Industry in the U.S. The tariff situation presents a clear set of challenges but also potential, albeit difficult, opportunities for the Bitcoin mining industry in the United States. Challenges: Increased operational costs and reduced profitability. Difficulty in competing with miners in regions with lower hardware costs. Uncertainty hindering long-term investment and expansion planning. Potential for slower growth or even contraction of U.S. hash rate share. Risk of pushing innovation and investment in mining infrastructure to other countries. Opportunities: Potential impetus for developing a domestic Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturing industry (long-term). Increased focus on energy efficiency and utilization of renewable energy sources to offset other costs. Development of innovative financing and operational models to adapt to cost pressures. Strengthened industry lobbying efforts to create a more favorable regulatory environment. Driving diversification into regions with untapped potential, contributing to the global decentralization of hash rate. Navigating these challenges requires a combination of smart business strategy, technological adaptation, and effective engagement with the political process. The future trajectory of the Bitcoin mining industry in the U.S. is heavily dependent on how these factors play out, particularly regarding the duration and level of crypto tariffs . Looking Ahead: The Future of US Bitcoin Miners and Tariffs The coming months are crucial for US Bitcoin miners . The decision regarding the resumption of mining hardware tariffs in July will be a pivotal moment. If tariffs return at significant levels, the pressure on U.S. operations will intensify, likely accelerating the strategic shifts already underway, including potential moves to more favorable international locations. Conversely, if the tariffs are removed or significantly reduced, it would provide a much-needed boost to the competitiveness of the Bitcoin mining industry within the U.S., potentially attracting more investment and encouraging expansion. The outcome will depend on a complex interplay of trade policy objectives, domestic economic considerations, and the growing recognition of the strategic importance of the Bitcoin network and the infrastructure that supports it. The situation also highlights a broader theme: the interconnectedness of global trade policy and the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, traditional economic levers like tariffs have unexpected and significant impacts on nascent but important industries like Bitcoin mining. For investors and observers of the crypto space, understanding the implications of these tariffs is vital. It’s not just a technical issue; it’s an economic and geopolitical one that affects the distribution of hash rate, the profitability of mining companies, and the overall health and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for the U.S. Mining Landscape The potential return of significant tariffs on imported Bitcoin mining equipment represents a critical juncture for US Bitcoin miners . While a temporary pause offered brief relief, the underlying dependency on foreign hardware and the threat of increased crypto tariffs pose substantial challenges to the growth and competitiveness of the Bitcoin mining industry in the United States. This situation not only impacts American firms but also creates opportunities for international competitors, such as those in Russia, and drives diversification into new global markets like Africa and South America. The strategic responses of U.S. miners—from accelerated procurement to exploring international expansion and lobbying efforts—underscore the high stakes involved. The coming decision on tariffs will significantly shape the future landscape of Bitcoin mining, determining whether the U.S. can solidify its position as a global leader or if economic pressures will continue to push this vital industry towards more favorable shores.

44300899,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158226,1746663635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Michael Saylor: Boldly Urges Microsoft to Choose Bitcoin Over Stock Buybacks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-bitcoin-saylor-advice/,"Imagine one of the world’s largest and most influential technology companies making a radical shift in its financial strategy. That’s precisely the bold suggestion recently put forward by none other than Michael Saylor , the outspoken founder of MicroStrategy and a staunch advocate for Bitcoin. Speaking at Strategy World 2025, Saylor delivered a compelling argument aimed squarely at Microsoft: abandon the traditional practice of stock buybacks and instead, channel that capital into a significant Bitcoin investment . Michael Saylor’s Vision: A Blueprint for Corporate Treasury? Michael Saylor is not new to advocating for corporate Bitcoin adoption . His own company, MicroStrategy, famously holds a substantial amount of BTC on its balance sheet, making it one of the pioneers and largest corporate holders globally. This strategic move, initiated years ago, was a direct result of Saylor’s deep conviction that traditional fiat currencies are depreciating assets over the long term and that Bitcoin is the only viable long-term store of value in the digital age. His appearance at Strategy World 2025 provided a platform to bring this conviction to a wider audience of corporate strategists and finance leaders, specifically targeting a company with the financial might and forward-looking reputation of Microsoft. Saylor’s vision is clear: corporations need to fundamentally rethink their treasury strategies for the 21st century, and that involves embracing hard digital assets like Bitcoin as primary reserve assets rather than liabilities or simply low-yield cash. Why a Microsoft Bitcoin Strategy Could Be Transformative The idea of Microsoft , a company synonymous with mainstream technology, stability, and immense financial resources, allocating a portion of its vast cash reserves to Bitcoin is significant. A Microsoft Bitcoin strategy, even a relatively small one compared to their total assets, could send a powerful signal across the entire corporate world. It has the potential to legitimize Bitcoin investment strategy for countless other large companies that might be hesitant to be early movers. Beyond the symbolic impact, holding Bitcoin could serve practical purposes for Microsoft. It could act as a powerful hedge against inflation, which erodes the value of large cash holdings. It could also diversify their treasury holdings away from traditional dollar-denominated assets and potentially offer significant upside appreciation in a rapidly evolving global economy. However, such a move is complex and not without its challenges. Microsoft would need to navigate potential shareholder skepticism, address concerns about Bitcoin’s price volatility, and build or acquire the necessary infrastructure and expertise for secure custody and management of digital assets, all while understanding the evolving regulatory landscape. Evaluating the Bitcoin Investment Strategy for Corporations Let’s delve deeper into the core of Saylor’s argument: performance. He presented a clear, data-driven case based on historical returns. According to reports, he cited a dramatic difference in average annual returns over a specific period: Bitcoin (BTC): An impressive average annual return of approximately 62%. Microsoft Stock (MSFT): A respectable, but significantly lower, average annual return of approximately 18%. This significant gap is the crux of Saylor’s recommendation. He suggests that capital deployed into a Bitcoin investment strategy could generate far greater returns for shareholders over the long term than capital used for activities like stock buybacks or simply holding cash. A corporate Bitcoin investment isn’t just about buying BTC; it involves a comprehensive assessment of risk tolerance, determining an appropriate allocation size relative to the company’s balance sheet, and establishing robust, secure custody solutions to protect the asset. It requires a fundamental shift in how a corporate finance department views reserve assets – moving from low-yield, stable instruments to a high-growth, volatile, but potentially more rewarding digital asset class. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption While Microsoft hasn’t publicly announced plans for such a move (yet), the landscape of corporate Bitcoin adoption is undeniably expanding. A growing number of public and private companies, spanning various sectors, are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset. Their motivations are diverse but often include several key factors: Inflation Hedge: Seeking to protect the purchasing power of their cash reserves against currency debasement. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Diversifying away from traditional financial assets perceived as being at risk in the current global economic climate. Potential Appreciation: Believing that Bitcoin’s unique properties and limited supply will lead to significant value appreciation over the long term. Attracting Talent and Signalling Innovation: Positioning the company as forward-thinking and adaptable in the digital age. This trend, championed early on by figures like Michael Saylor , is moving from the fringe to the mainstream, prompting more corporate boards and finance committees to seriously consider the asset class as a legitimate component of their treasury strategy. Stock Buybacks vs Bitcoin: A Strategic Showdown Stock buybacks are a widely used corporate finance tool. Companies repurchase their own shares from the open market, which reduces the number of outstanding shares. This action is intended to increase the earnings per share (EPS) and potentially boost the stock price, thereby returning value to shareholders. It’s often seen as an efficient way to deploy excess cash when a company believes its own stock is undervalued or sees limited opportunities for higher returns by reinvesting directly in the business. Saylor’s argument creates a direct and provocative comparison: is the return generated by reducing share count (and hoping the market responds positively) truly superior to the potential return and balance sheet protection offered by holding a rapidly appreciating, decentralized asset like Bitcoin ? He clearly believes the latter offers a more compelling path for long-term value creation and preservation in the current economic and monetary environment. This debate highlights a fundamental strategic choice companies face regarding capital allocation – stick with traditional methods or embrace innovative digital asset strategies. Actionable Insights & Considerations for Corporations: For any company considering Saylor’s advice, whether it’s Microsoft or another large corporation, the path forward involves rigorous due diligence and strategic planning: Comprehensive Research: Understand Bitcoin’s technology, its role in the global economy, market dynamics, and historical performance beyond simple percentage returns. Thorough Risk Assessment: Evaluate volatility risks, regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions, and the operational security needs for holding significant digital assets. Custody Solutions: Explore and implement secure, institutional-grade custody solutions to protect the invested capital. Shareholder Communication: Prepare a clear and convincing rationale to explain the strategy and its potential benefits and risks to investors and the market. Long-Term Perspective: Approach a Bitcoin investment strategy with a long-term view, accepting short-term price volatility as part of the asset’s nature. Summary: Michael Saylor ‘s call for Microsoft to abandon stock buybacks in favor of a Microsoft Bitcoin strategy is a bold and significant challenge to conventional corporate finance wisdom. Backed by compelling data showing Bitcoin’s significant historical outperformance compared to traditional assets like Microsoft stock, his argument positions Bitcoin as essential “digital capital” for the modern era, offering a powerful hedge against traditional market frailties and monetary inflation. While a move of this magnitude by a company the size of Microsoft would be monumental and involve navigating complex internal and external factors, Saylor’s persistent advocacy, rooted in his own company’s pioneering and successful corporate Bitcoin adoption , forces a critical conversation about the best way for corporations to preserve and grow value in an increasingly digital, volatile, and unpredictable world. The strategic debate between traditional capital allocation methods like stock buybacks and innovative digital asset strategies is far from settled, but Michael Saylor has certainly ensured it remains front and center for the corporate elite.

44301110,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158227,1746663922,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolut Unleashes Rapid Bitcoin Lightning Payments in Europe,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/revolut-bitcoin-lightning-payments/,"Exciting news for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and Revolut users across the UK and parts of Europe! The popular British financial app, Revolut, is making a significant leap into the future of digital transactions by integrating Bitcoin payments powered by the Lightning Network. This move, facilitated by Lightspark’s advanced infrastructure, promises to transform how users interact with Bitcoin within the Revolut ecosystem. What is the Bitcoin Lightning Network and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the world of Bitcoin, transactions on the main blockchain can sometimes be slow and costly, especially during periods of high network congestion. The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a ‘Layer 2’ payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Think of it as adding extra lanes to a busy highway. Instead of processing every small transaction directly on the main, slower blockchain (Layer 1), the Lightning Network allows users to create secure payment channels off-chain. Within these channels, multiple transactions can occur instantly and with minimal fees. Only the final balances are settled on the main Bitcoin blockchain, significantly reducing the load and increasing efficiency. The key benefits of using the Lightning Network include: Speed: Transactions are near-instant, often settling in milliseconds. Lower Fees: Fees are typically fractions of a cent, making small transactions economically viable. Scalability: It allows for a much higher volume of transactions than the base Bitcoin layer can handle alone. Enhanced Privacy: While not completely private, off-chain transactions offer a degree of privacy as they aren’t broadcast to the entire network immediately. Revolut and Lightspark: Powering Faster Crypto Payments This strategic integration positions Revolut at the forefront of fintech innovation. By adopting the Lightning Network, Revolut is directly addressing some of the long-standing pain points associated with using Bitcoin for everyday transactions – namely, speed and cost. This makes Bitcoin more practical for payments, not just as a store of value. The integration is being powered by Lightspark , a company founded by former Meta executive David Marcus. Lightspark specializes in providing infrastructure and services to facilitate enterprise-grade access to the Lightning Network. Their technology helps companies like Revolut connect reliably and efficiently to the Lightning network, abstracting away much of the technical complexity. Lightspark’s role is crucial. They provide the backend technology that allows Revolut to send and receive Bitcoin payments over the Lightning Network seamlessly and securely. This partnership is a testament to the growing maturity of the Lightning ecosystem and its readiness for mainstream adoption by large financial platforms. How This Impacts Revolut Users in the UK and Europe The rollout in the UK and select European countries means millions of Revolut users will soon have access to significantly improved Bitcoin transaction capabilities. While the initial report from CoinDesk didn’t specify the exact use cases (e.g., sending Bitcoin to friends, paying merchants), the underlying technology enables: Faster transfers of Bitcoin between Lightning-enabled wallets. Potentially lower fees for sending Bitcoin compared to traditional on-chain transfers. A more responsive and user-friendly experience when dealing with Bitcoin within the app. This development is particularly significant for the Fintech sector. Revolut is one of the largest digital banks globally, and its adoption of the Lightning Network sends a strong signal about the potential of this technology.

According to an X post by Trader Tardigrade, such patterns often form around the time of a price bottom. #Dogecoin 's daily chart appears to be forming a ""Diamond Bottom"" Reversal Pattern, suggesting a potential shift for $Doge from a recent downtrend to an uptrend. pic.twitter.com/6aSlEfUSMg — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) May 6, 2025 Trader Tardigrade’s bullish thesis was echoed by fellow trader Galaxy, who argued in an X post that the Dogecoin price’s weekly chart has started to form higher highs and higher lows following its 2024 breakout from a 600 day accumulation period.

Dogecoin Price Prediction – Explosion Higher Coming? Macro conditions currently aren’t conducive to a renewed altcoins /meme season. As highlighted by the Fed at today’s FOMC policy announcement , US economic conditions remain highly uncertain. The Fed didn't use the word ""stagflation"", but that's what it's warning about. Never a good moment when your central bank says that it's worried about *both* higher unemployment and higher inflation. That's a problem that monetary policy alone can't solve. pic.twitter.com/myxRG1CDmk — Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) May 7, 2025 US President Trump’s trade war has added upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth, creating a potential “stagflation” scenario for the US economy for the first time in over 50 years. In such an environment, risk assets, which Dogecoin is very much one of, aren’t expected to perform particularly well. Thanks to its growing narrative as “digital gold” and a safe haven, Bitcoin is looking perky, and nearing a retest of $100,000. That, plus the aforementioned favorable chart patterns, could suggest that a medium-term bottom is in for the Dogecoin price. If Bitcoin pushes back above $100,000 and towards a retest of its record highs around $108,000, the Dogecoin price can continue to recover. If it can break above $0.20 resistance, a move back to $0.28 would be on the cards. However, for a new meme season to emerge, a big positive catalyst is going to be needed. That could be something like upside risks to US inflation subsiding, opening the door for significant rate cuts from the Fed. Altcoins / meme coins have historically thrived in times of easing financial conditions, after all. Until then, the Dogecoin price is unlikely to see explosive moves to the upside. The current market environment should be viewed by crypto investors as a good time to steadily add to their DOGE bags. Better Alternative for Fast Gains – Solaxy (SOLX)?

The state’s Senate has taken a significant step forward with the passage of a key piece of legislation: the Arizona Bitcoin Bill , officially known as SB 1373. This development signals a growing interest among state-level policymakers in exploring the potential roles of digital assets like Bitcoin within state financial operations. But what exactly does this bill propose, and what does it mean for the future of Arizona Crypto initiatives? Understanding the Arizona Bitcoin Bill SB 1373 At its core, SB 1373 is designed to establish a digital asset reserve for the state of Arizona. This isn’t just a theoretical concept; the bill outlines the creation of a specific mechanism for holding and managing certain digital assets. According to reports, this reserve would be under the stewardship of the state treasurer’s office. Key components of the proposed reserve include: Legislature-Set Funds: The reserve could include funds specifically allocated by the Arizona legislature for the purpose of acquiring digital assets. This suggests a potential pathway for the state to invest directly in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Seized Cryptocurrencies: The bill also provides for the inclusion of cryptocurrencies that have been seized by law enforcement. This is a practical consideration, as authorities increasingly encounter digital assets in criminal investigations. The passage of SB 1373 through the Senate is a crucial legislative hurdle cleared, pushing Arizona closer to potentially becoming one of the first states with a formal mechanism for managing digital assets at this level. Why Consider a State Bitcoin Reserve? The concept of a State Bitcoin Reserve raises questions about the motivations behind such a move. Proponents often highlight several potential benefits: Store of Value: Bitcoin is often viewed as a potential hedge against inflation and a store of value, similar to gold. A reserve could offer a way for the state to diversify its treasury holdings. Attracting Innovation: By embracing digital assets, Arizona could position itself as a forward-thinking state, potentially attracting blockchain companies and talent. Future Preparedness: As digital assets become more integrated into the global economy, having a framework for managing them could be seen as preparing for the future. Managing Seized Assets: A formal reserve provides a clear process for handling cryptocurrencies seized in legal proceedings, ensuring they are managed responsibly. However, establishing a State Bitcoin Reserve is not without its challenges and risks, including price volatility, security concerns related to custody, and the evolving regulatory landscape. The Path to Governor Hobbs With the Senate’s approval, the Arizona Bitcoin Bill now moves to the desk of Governor Hobbs for her final decision. This is a critical stage in the legislative process, as the Governor holds veto power. The journey of SB 1373 is particularly noteworthy because it follows a previous attempt to pass similar legislation. Earlier this year, Governor Hobbs vetoed SB 1025, a bill that also aimed to establish a state digital asset reserve. The reasons cited for that veto included concerns about the bill’s potential financial risks and operational complexities. The fact that a similar bill has passed the Senate again suggests that proponents have either addressed previous concerns in the new version (SB 1373) or are making another strong push for the concept. All eyes are now on Governor Hobbs to see if she will sign this iteration into law or issue another veto. Arizona Crypto Landscape: A Look Back at SB 1025 Understanding the context of Arizona Crypto legislation requires looking back at SB 1025. While the specifics of why it was vetoed are relevant, the key takeaway is that the idea of a state digital asset reserve has faced executive resistance previously. This history adds an element of uncertainty to the fate of SB 1373 . It’s important for citizens and stakeholders interested in Arizona Crypto policy to consider: What were the precise differences between SB 1025 and SB 1373? (This information might not be in the original snippet but is crucial for a comprehensive understanding). Have the concerns raised during the SB 1025 debate been adequately addressed in the new bill? What is the current stance of Governor Hobbs and her administration on digital asset policy? The legislative process is often one of iteration, and the reintroduction and passage of a bill like SB 1373 demonstrate persistence from its supporters. What Happens Next? The future of the Arizona Bitcoin Bill rests solely with Governor Hobbs . Her decision will determine whether Arizona takes this potentially pioneering step into holding digital assets in its treasury. If signed, the bill would likely require significant planning and infrastructure development by the state treasurer’s office to safely and effectively manage the reserve. This development is being watched closely by other states and by the wider cryptocurrency community, as it could set a precedent for state-level adoption and management of digital assets. The journey from Senate passage to gubernatorial approval is the final, critical hurdle for SB 1373 . Conclusion: Awaiting the Governor’s Decision The passage of the Arizona Bitcoin Bill , SB 1373, by the state Senate marks a significant moment in the ongoing conversation about integrating digital assets into state finances. The bill proposes the creation of a State Bitcoin Reserve , comprising both allocated funds and seized cryptocurrencies. While the concept holds potential benefits like portfolio diversification and fostering innovation in the Arizona Crypto space, it also faces challenges. Having overcome the Senate, the bill now awaits the decision of Governor Hobbs . Her previous veto of a similar bill, SB 1025, adds a layer of anticipation and uncertainty to the outcome. The coming days or weeks will reveal whether Arizona will move forward with establishing this novel digital asset reserve.

44301582,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158239,1746664821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,USDT Mint: 1 Billion Tether Unleashed – What it Means for Bitcoin and the Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usdt-tether-crypto-impact/,"In a significant development that captured the attention of traders and analysts worldwide, the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert recently reported a massive issuance: 1,000,000,000 USDT was minted at the Tether Treasury. This substantial injection of liquidity into the ecosystem is not an everyday occurrence and often sparks intense discussion and speculation within the crypto market . What does such a large USDT mint signify, and what potential effects could it have on assets like Bitcoin and the broader landscape? Understanding the Basics: What is USDT and Tether Treasury? Before diving into the implications of this colossal mint, it’s crucial to understand the entities involved. USDT is the largest and most widely used stablecoin in the cryptocurrency space. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable price, typically pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar. Tether is the company behind USDT . They claim that each USDT token is backed by reserves, which historically have included a mix of cash, cash equivalents, loans, and other assets. The goal is for 1 USDT to always be worth approximately 1 US dollar. The Tether Treasury is essentially the wallet or address controlled by Tether where new USDT tokens are generated (minted) and from which they are distributed. Minting new tokens does not automatically mean they are put into circulation. Often, newly minted USDT sits in the Treasury wallet until it is needed for distribution to exchanges or other large entities based on actual demand. Why Mint 1 Billion USDT? Exploring the Potential Reasons A mint of this size is a powerful signal, but its meaning can be interpreted in several ways. Here are some of the most common reasons why Tether might mint such a large amount of USDT : Meeting Market Demand: The most straightforward reason is increased demand for USDT on cryptocurrency exchanges or in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Large traders, institutions, or even retail investors looking to enter the market or seeking a stable store of value often buy USDT with fiat currency. When demand outstrips the available supply on exchanges, Tether mints new tokens to meet this demand. Inventory for Exchanges: Centralized exchanges require a sufficient supply of USDT to facilitate trading pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT). Tether might mint tokens to replenish the inventories of major exchanges, ensuring smooth trading operations and liquidity. Swaps and Chain Migrations: Sometimes, Tether mints tokens on one blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) to facilitate a swap or migration to another blockchain (e.g., Tron, Solana). While this is a mint, it doesn’t necessarily increase the total circulating supply if an equivalent amount is burned on another chain. However, large mints often precede or coincide with such rebalancing acts. Preparing for Institutional Inflow: A large mint could potentially signal anticipated large purchases by institutional players who prefer to acquire crypto assets using USDT or need USDT for other purposes within the crypto ecosystem. Internal Treasury Management: Less often discussed, but Tether might mint tokens for internal management purposes, though distribution is the key factor for market impact. It’s important to note that a mint itself doesn’t inject money into the system; it’s the distribution of that minted USDT from the Treasury that matters. The tokens sitting in the Treasury wallet are not yet in active circulation. The Potential Impact on Bitcoin and the Crypto Market Historically, large USDT mints have often been followed by positive price movements in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market . This correlation has led to theories (and sometimes accusations) that Tether mints are used to prop up prices. However, a more widely accepted interpretation among analysts is that large mints are a *reaction* to existing or anticipated demand. If there’s high demand for USDT , it often means people are bringing fiat currency into the crypto ecosystem specifically to buy cryptocurrencies. They buy USDT first because it’s easy to move between exchanges and stable. The act of buying USDT with fiat increases the demand for USDT , prompting Tether to mint more. This influx of fiat-backed USDT then provides the liquidity for traders to buy Bitcoin , Ethereum, and other altcoins, potentially driving prices up. Does More USDT Always Mean Higher Bitcoin Prices? Not necessarily. While the correlation has been observed, it’s not a direct cause-and-effect where Tether simply prints money to buy Bitcoin . The sequence is generally understood as: Increased external demand for crypto assets brings fiat into the ecosystem. Fiat is often converted into USDT for ease of trading. High demand for USDT leads to Tether minting more to meet that demand. The newly acquired USDT is then used by buyers to purchase Bitcoin and altcoins. So, the mint is often a symptom of bullish sentiment and incoming capital, rather than the sole cause of price increases. However, the presence of large amounts of readily available USDT does provide significant liquidity, making it easier for large buy orders to be filled without causing massive price swings, which can facilitate upward trends. Tether’s Role and Transparency in the Stablecoin Landscape Tether’s position as the dominant stablecoin issuer gives it significant influence, but also attracts scrutiny. The company has faced questions regarding the composition and sufficiency of its reserves for years. While they have increased their reporting frequency and undergone some audits/attestations, concerns about transparency and the potential risks associated with their reserve holdings (like commercial paper) persist. The minting of 1 billion USDT , while routine in terms of meeting demand, highlights the sheer scale of Tether’s operations and its importance to the liquidity of the global crypto market . The health and stability of Tether are therefore critical to the broader ecosystem. Market Sentiment and Reaction to Large USDT Mints When Whale Alert reports a large USDT mint from the Tether Treasury , the reaction in the crypto community is often mixed: Optimists: View it as a bullish signal, indicating strong demand for crypto assets and potential for upward price movement. They see it as fuel for the next rally. Skeptics: Express concerns about potential market manipulation or question the legitimacy of the reserves backing the newly minted tokens. They worry about the systemic risk Tether poses. Analysts: Typically look for subsequent movements of the minted USDT out of the Treasury wallet and onto exchanges to confirm if it’s entering active circulation and being used for trading. The reporting of the mint itself creates buzz and can influence short-term trading sentiment as market participants try to front-run the potential impact. Benefits and Challenges of Large Liquidity Injections Injecting 1 billion USDT into the potential supply has both positive and negative aspects for the crypto market : Benefits: Increased Liquidity: Provides ample USDT for traders on exchanges, reducing slippage on large orders and facilitating smoother trading. Facilitates Inflow: Makes it easier for new capital (fiat) to enter the market and be deployed into crypto assets like Bitcoin . Supports Growth: A healthy, liquid stablecoin market is essential infrastructure for the growth of the entire crypto ecosystem, including DeFi and other applications. Challenges: Transparency Concerns: Fuels ongoing questions about Tether’s reserves and whether the minted USDT is fully backed. Potential for Manipulation: While often debated, the possibility that large, opaque issuances could be used to influence market prices remains a concern for some. Centralization Risk: The dominance of a single entity like Tether in the stablecoin market represents a point of centralization risk for the decentralized crypto ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Market Participants For anyone involved in the crypto market , a large USDT mint from the Tether Treasury is a data point worth considering. Here’s what you might do: Monitor Distribution: Don’t just note the mint; watch if and when the 1 billion USDT moves out of the Treasury wallet to exchanges. This indicates it’s entering circulation and is more likely to impact trading. Observe Market Reaction: See how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react in the hours and days following the distribution. Does buying pressure increase? Consider the Broader Context: Is this mint happening during a bullish trend, a consolidation phase, or a downturn? The market environment heavily influences the impact. Stay Informed on Tether: Keep track of news and reports regarding Tether’s reserves and regulatory status, as these factors can affect confidence in USDT . Understand It’s Not Guaranteed Pump: Recognize that a mint provides *potential* liquidity and is often a *signal* of demand, but it doesn’t guarantee price increases. Other market factors are always at play. Concluding Thoughts: A Billion-Dollar Signal The minting of 1 billion USDT by the Tether Treasury is a significant event in the daily flow of the crypto market . It underscores the vital role USDT plays as the primary liquidity provider and gateway for capital entering the space. While it often correlates with periods of increased market activity and potential upward price movement for assets like Bitcoin , it’s essential to view it within the larger context of market demand, capital flows, and Tether’s operational dynamics. It’s a billion-dollar signal that the wheels of the crypto economy are turning, driven by demand that necessitates the issuance of more stablecoin fuel.

However, recent reports paint a concerning picture for one of the leading Layer 2 solutions: Arbitrum. The Arbitrum governance system is seeing a significant decline in voter turnout, coinciding with a substantial drop in the ARB price . What’s Happening with Arbitrum Governance? DL News recently highlighted a worrying trend: participation in Arbitrum’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting has reportedly tumbled. This comes at a time when the ARB token’s value has seen considerable depreciation. Low Voter Turnout: The core issue is the dwindling number of token holders casting votes on important proposals that shape the future of the Arbitrum network. Impact on Proposals: Low participation makes it harder for proposals to meet the required quorum or passage thresholds, potentially stalling development or necessary changes. Community Discussion: The community is actively discussing potential remedies, including a proposal to lower the governance proposal passage rate from the current 5% of eligible voting power to 4.5%. This situation isn’t unique to Arbitrum, as other projects relying on crypto governance are also exploring ways to boost engagement and improve voting incentives. How Has the ARB Price Reacted? The market performance of the ARB token has been challenging over the past year. According to reports, the ARB unit price has fallen significantly, around 71% in the last year. While correlation doesn’t always equal causation, it’s difficult to ignore the timing of the price decline alongside the drop in governance activity. A lack of active governance could be perceived by the market as a sign of apathy, potential centralization risks (if only a few large holders vote), or slow decision-making, which could negatively impact investor confidence and the ARB price . As of a recent check, ARB was trading at approximately $0.3031, showing a modest gain of 0.42% over the preceding 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, this minor short-term uptick doesn’t negate the larger trend of depreciation and the underlying concerns about governance health. Why is Active DeFi Voting Important? In the realm of DeFi and decentralized networks, DeFi voting through governance tokens is fundamental. It’s the mechanism by which token holders collectively make decisions about the protocol’s parameters, upgrades, treasury spending, and overall direction. Active participation ensures: Decentralization: Prevents control from being concentrated in the hands of a few. Community Alignment: Decisions reflect the broader interests of the token holders and users. Protocol Health & Evolution: Allows the network to adapt, improve, and remain competitive. Legitimacy: A well-governed protocol instills confidence in users and developers. When Arbitrum governance sees low participation, it raises questions about how effectively the DAO can steer the project, potentially hindering its long-term growth and stability. Addressing the Challenges: The Arbitrum DAO Responds The proposed reduction in the passage threshold from 5% to 4.5% is a direct response to the challenge of meeting quorum requirements with lower turnout. While seemingly a small change, it aims to make it easier for proposals to pass, preventing governance gridlock. However, this approach also has potential drawbacks. Lowering the threshold might allow proposals to pass with even less broad community consensus, potentially increasing the influence of smaller, more active factions or large individual holders. The discussion within the Arbitrum DAO is crucial. They need to weigh the need for efficient decision-making against the principle of broad decentralized participation. Beyond just lowering thresholds, other strategies being considered across the crypto space to boost DeFi voting include: Voter Incentives: Rewarding participants with small amounts of tokens, NFTs, or other benefits for casting votes. Delegation: Making it easier and more intuitive for token holders to delegate their voting power to trusted representatives who are more engaged. Simplified Interfaces: Improving the user experience for accessing governance forums and voting mechanisms. Education: Better communication about the importance of proposals and the voting process. Gamification: Introducing elements that make voting more engaging or competitive. Actionable Insights for ARB Holders If you hold ARB tokens, your participation matters. Even if you have a small amount, contributing to the voting process or delegating your vote helps strengthen Arbitrum governance . Stay informed about ongoing proposals in the Arbitrum DAO forums and consider casting your vote on issues that impact the network’s future and, potentially, the ARB price . Low participation is a challenge, but it’s one that the Arbitrum community is actively trying to address. The success of these efforts will be vital for the long-term health and decentralization of the network. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Arbitrum Arbitrum stands at a critical juncture. The confluence of a significant ARB price drop and declining Arbitrum governance participation presents a clear challenge. While the proposal to lower the passage threshold is a step towards addressing governance efficiency, the deeper issue of voter apathy requires more comprehensive solutions. The community’s ability to re-engage token holders in the DeFi voting process will be key to ensuring the network remains decentralized, adaptable, and resilient in the competitive Layer 2 landscape. The health of the Arbitrum DAO is intrinsically linked to the potential for future growth and stability.

Yet in 2025 Solana lingers at $150.46 grappling with network congestion and regulatory shadows dimming hopes for a repeat performance. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol, is surging through its presale, amassing $7.6 million and 9,500 holders. Currently in phase 4 at $0.025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) promises a 140% return at its $0.06 listing. Let’s unpack Solana’s past glory and Mutuum Finance’s rising potential, spotlighting why the latter may outshine in 2025. Solana’s 2021 Triumph Fades Solana’s 2021 ascent was a spectacle. Starting below $2, it climbed to $257, driven by its high-throughput blockchain and low fees. Developers flocked to its ecosystem, boosting DeFi integrations. However, 2025 paints a different picture. Trading at $150.46, Solana faces hurdles. Network congestion slows transactions, and regulatory pressures loom. Analysts note its failure to breach the $165 resistance, with some predicting a slide to $100. Solana’s reliance on external adoption falters as competing blockchains emerge. Its once-vibrant momentum now wanes, leaving investors cautious. Attention shifts to newer projects, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), offering fresher prospects. This transition highlights the crypto market’s relentless evolution. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gains Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform revolutionizing lending in the crypto market. It offers peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending allowing users to deposit assets like ETH or DAI to earn passive income through interest-accruing mtTokens. These tokens remain liquid and transferable across DeFi ecosystems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in decentralized finance. Its presale, now in phase 4, has raised $7.6 million, with 443 million tokens sold and 9,500 holders onboard. Priced at $0.025, phase 4 is 57% filled, signaling brisk demand. The next phase will see a 20% price hike to $0.03, granting current investors a 20% gain. At listing, the token hits $0.06, securing a 140% return. Analysts project a post-launch surge to $3, promising a 11,900% ROI. The team is finalizing a Certik smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social media, bolstering trust. This momentum underscores Mutuum Finance’s allure as phase 4 nears its close. Innovative Lending Fuels Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its dual-lending model. Lenders deposit assets into liquidity pools, earning interest via mtTokens, which grow in value over time. Borrowers access funds by posting overcollateralized assets, ensuring stability. A buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers, creating steady buy pressure. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. This gamified incentive sparks competition, deepening engagement. As phase 4 tokens dwindle, the urgency to join intensifies, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a high-yield opportunity in DeFi’s next wave. A New Dawn in DeFi Solana’s 2021 rally captivated the crypto market, but its 2025 struggles signal a shift. Network woes and regulatory clouds dim its luster, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a beacon. Its presale success, with $7.6 million raised and a 140% listing return, draws eager investors. The projected $3 post-launch price fuels excitement, offering a potential 11,900% ROI. As phase 4 races toward completion, the 20% price jump to $0.03 looms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s audited smart contracts and innovative lending model promise stability and growth. Investors seeking the next big win should explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now, before phase 5 tightens the entry window.

44302174,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158243,1746666021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ethereum Security Status: Shocking Revelation from NY AG’s Push to SEC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ny-ag-ethereum-security/,"A significant development has surfaced from the ongoing debate surrounding the regulatory classification of cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum (ETH). Newly revealed documents shed light on a direct push from the New York Attorney General’s (NY AG) office to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the Ethereum security status . This revelation, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Coinbase, highlights the complex and often conflicting views among regulators on how to categorize and oversee digital assets. The Core Revelation: NY AG Pushed for Ethereum Security Status At the heart of this story is the disclosure that, during New York’s 2023 case against the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin, the state’s top law enforcement office explicitly urged the SEC to formally declare Ethereum (ETH) a security. This is a crucial point because the SEC has historically avoided making a definitive public statement on whether ETH, in its current form, constitutes a security under U.S. law. While past comments from SEC officials, notably former Director William Hinman, suggested ETH was sufficiently decentralized not to be a security, the agency has never issued a formal, binding determination. The NY AG’s request, buried within documents recently made public by Coinbase, underscores the pressure state regulators can exert on federal bodies and reveals a potentially different perspective on ETH’s classification at the state level compared to the federal one. This internal communication brings into sharp focus the lack of regulatory clarity that has long plagued the crypto industry. Unpacking the KuCoin Case and the NY AG’s Stance The context for the NY AG’s push was the lawsuit filed against KuCoin in March 2023. The NY AG alleged that KuCoin was operating as an unregistered securities and commodities broker or dealer in New York, violating the state’s Martin Act. The case listed ETH, along with LUNA and other tokens, as examples of cryptocurrencies that the NY AG considered securities or commodities requiring registration. By urging the SEC to label ETH a security, the NY AG’s office was likely seeking alignment or validation from the primary federal securities regulator. This would have significantly strengthened their case against KuCoin by leveraging a federal determination. However, the documents indicate the SEC did not publicly adopt this position in response to the NY AG’s request related to the KuCoin proceedings. The SEC’s Response (or Lack Thereof) to the Push The documents released by Coinbase, which include internal SEC discussions, do not show the SEC issuing a public declaration that ETH is a security following the NY AG’s request. This non-action (at least publicly within the context of the KuCoin case) is consistent with the SEC’s broader approach to ETH’s classification – maintaining ambiguity despite numerous opportunities and calls for clarity. Why the SEC chose not to publicly label ETH a security in this instance, despite the NY AG’s urging, remains a subject of speculation. Possible reasons include: Ongoing internal debate within the SEC itself. A strategic decision to avoid a definitive statement that could have wide-ranging implications for the entire crypto market. Differing legal interpretations or priorities between the federal and state levels. The SEC’s continued silence on ETH’s status, especially after being directly prompted by a state regulator in a significant enforcement action, adds another layer of complexity to the SEC crypto regulation narrative. How Coinbase FOIA Documents Brought This to Light This revelation did not come from an official regulatory announcement but from documents obtained by Coinbase through a Freedom of Information Act request. Coinbase, currently engaged in its own high-stakes legal battle with the SEC, has been actively seeking information regarding the SEC’s internal deliberations and communications concerning cryptocurrency classifications. The FOIA process allows the public (including companies facing regulatory action) to request access to government records. Coinbase’s success in obtaining these specific documents highlights their strategic effort to uncover information that could potentially be relevant to their defense or shed light on the SEC’s regulatory process. The release of these Coinbase FOIA documents provides a rare glimpse into the inter-agency communications and internal thinking that shape crypto regulation in the U.S. Why the SEC Crypto Regulation Debate Matters for Everyone The debate over whether cryptocurrencies, particularly major ones like Ethereum, are securities is not merely a technical legal argument. It has profound implications for the entire digital asset ecosystem: For Projects and Developers: If a token is deemed a security, it faces stringent registration requirements under securities law, which can be costly and complex, potentially stifling innovation. For Exchanges and Platforms: Trading platforms dealing with securities must register as securities exchanges or broker-dealers, subjecting them to extensive regulations regarding market surveillance, customer protection, and more. For Investors: Classification impacts disclosure requirements, investor protections, and the venues where assets can be legally traded. For the Market: Regulatory uncertainty creates volatility and can deter institutional investment, hindering mainstream adoption. The disagreement or lack of clear alignment between the NY AG and the SEC on ETH’s status, as revealed by these documents, exemplifies the fragmented regulatory landscape that the industry currently navigates. Clear and consistent SEC crypto regulation is crucial for the healthy development of the market. Implications of a Potential Ethereum Security Designation While the SEC didn’t act on the NY AG’s specific request in the KuCoin case, the possibility of Ethereum eventually being labeled a security by the SEC remains a significant overhang for the market. Such a designation, particularly for a network as large and fundamental as Ethereum, would likely trigger substantial upheaval: Exchanges might delist ETH in the U.S. if they cannot comply with securities trading rules. DeFi protocols interacting with ETH could face intense scrutiny. The ETH staking landscape could be impacted, as staking services might be viewed as offering unregistered securities. It could set a precedent for classifying other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. The NY AG’s past action, now public knowledge thanks to the FOIA documents, serves as a stark reminder that while the SEC has remained publicly cagey, other powerful regulators view ETH through the lens of securities law. The Broader Landscape: NY AG vs. SEC on Ethereum and Other Assets The tension revealed in the FOIA documents is part of a larger picture where state regulators, like the NY AG, have often taken aggressive enforcement action against crypto firms operating within their borders, sometimes stepping into areas where federal clarity is lacking. The NY AG’s office has been particularly active in pursuing cases against crypto companies for allegedly violating state securities and commodities laws. This contrasts with the SEC’s approach, which has primarily focused on classifying tokens offered through initial coin offerings (ICOs) as securities and pursuing enforcement against platforms allegedly trading unregistered securities. The difference in approach, or at least the difference in public statements and actions regarding assets like Ethereum, highlights the potential for a patchwork of state and federal regulations if a unified federal framework isn’t established. What the KuCoin Settlement Tells Us About State vs. Federal Action Ultimately, the KuCoin case concluded with a $22 million settlement with the NY AG’s office, including $5 million allocated for compliance monitorship. This settlement resolved the state’s allegations that KuCoin operated illegally in New York. While the settlement itself didn’t result in a federal declaration on ETH’s status, the fact that the NY AG included ETH in their allegations and sought federal backing underscores the legal theories being pursued at the state level. The KuCoin settlement demonstrates the power of state regulators to enforce their interpretations of existing laws against crypto entities, even in the absence of explicit federal crypto legislation or clear federal guidance on specific assets like ETH. It’s a reminder that crypto firms must navigate not just federal regulations but also those at the state level. Actionable Insights: Navigating Regulatory Uncertainty For investors, developers, and businesses in the crypto space, the key takeaway from this revelation is the continued presence of significant regulatory uncertainty, particularly regarding the classification of major assets like Ethereum. While the SEC hasn’t made a move, the fact that a powerful state regulator like the NY AG urged them to classify ETH as a security is noteworthy. What can you do? Stay Informed: Follow regulatory developments closely, both at the federal (SEC, CFTC, Congress) and state levels. Understand the Risks: Be aware that the regulatory status of many digital assets, including ETH, is not definitively settled in the U.S., which carries potential risks for market access and stability. Consider Compliance: For businesses, prioritizing legal and compliance frameworks is crucial, acknowledging the potential for assets to be viewed differently by various regulatory bodies. Conclusion The disclosure that the New York Attorney General’s office pushed the SEC to label Ethereum a security during the 2023 KuCoin case is a significant piece of the complex U.S. crypto regulatory puzzle. Revealed through Coinbase’s FOIA efforts, it highlights the differing views and pressures within the regulatory landscape and underscores the persistent lack of clarity surrounding the Ethereum security status at the federal level. While the SEC did not publicly adopt the NY AG’s position in that context, the revelation serves as a potent reminder that the debate over ETH’s classification is far from over and continues to be a point of contention among powerful regulatory bodies. This ongoing uncertainty in SEC crypto regulation , exemplified by this interaction and the resulting KuCoin settlement , remains a critical factor shaping the future of the digital asset market in the United States.

LINK Holds Near $15 While ETH Price Stuggles,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-successfully-clears-certik-audit-link-holds-near-15-while-eth-price-stuggles/,"Some cryptocurrencies are facing tough resistance. Chainlink (LINK) is showing some strength but is yet to break past $15.30. Ethereum (ETH) has dropped to $1,780, shaking confidence among traders. While these assets await signs of a rebound, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining ground steadily. The project recently cleared its CertiK audit, confirming strong smart contract security, and has already distributed over 19.7 billion BDAG coins. In contrast to LINK and ETH, BlockDAG is not relying on market rebounds, it’s producing consistent results. With a 2520% ROI already recorded and a $0.0019 entry valid through May 13, it stands out as the top crypto to buy now. Chainlink (LINK) Price Update: Can It Break Through $15.30? Recent Chainlink (LINK) price movement suggests a potential breakout, with the coin hovering at $15.02. The $15.30 resistance remains a key level. If LINK crosses this mark, it may aim for $17. Technicals support this outlook, with an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and a bullish EMA crossover, both indicating growing buyer interest. Still, confirmation is needed with a strong move above $15.30; if not, LINK may stay in the $14.50 to $15.30 band. From an on-chain perspective, LINK exchange reserves declined 1.03%, a positive signal, though a 37.46% surge in netflows suggests some near-term selling pressure. For now, traders remain cautiously optimistic about the next Chainlink (LINK) price update. Ethereum (ETH) Price Drop Triggered by 2.59% Daily Fall On April 30, 2025, Ethereum (ETH) saw a 2.59% drop, pulling its price to $1,780.25 during a low-volume session, creating further uncertainty. This decrease also brought ETH’s market cap down 2.70% to $214.93 billion. Trading volume dipped by almost 10%, pointing to reduced activity. RSI levels have moved into neutral territory, and the total ETH supply held at 120.73 million, showing no immediate inflation concern. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC pair recovered slightly from a low of 0.0180 BTC and now sits above 0.0185 BTC. This range is considered crucial; holding it could open the path for Ethereum to test higher zones, although volatility remains high. BlockDAG Clears CertiK Audit, Securing Strong Smart Contract Protections BlockDAG has officially passed CertiK’s audit, marking a significant moment in its security roadmap. CertiK, a top name in blockchain audits, lends credibility to BDAG’s development goals. This audit wasn’t a simple review, it’s part of a broader three-layered security plan safeguarding both treasury and vesting contracts. Beyond code checks, the team implements internal protocols, operational controls, and maintains a standing partnership with CertiK for ongoing analysis and surveillance. Security forms the backbone of BlockDAG’s system. Regular audits and strict screening for listings prove the team’s long-term focus on building a trustworthy network. Such preparation before launch places BlockDAG in a class of its own. The metrics reinforce this position. Over 19.7 billion BDAG coins have been distributed so far, and $227.5 million has been raised. From Batch 1 to 28, returns have reached 2520%. With a projected launch value of $0.05, the current limited-time price of $0.0019 (valid till May 13) is gaining attention. Based on current growth and security credentials, BlockDAG remains a top crypto to buy right now . Final Say! Chainlink (LINK) shows signs of recovery but still struggles to surpass $15.30. Ethereum (ETH) is stabilizing after a sharp drop, yet no strong recovery trend is visible so far. During this period of uncertainty, BlockDAG continues to report solid achievements. Completion of its CertiK audit confirms its technical resilience. With more than 19.7 billion coins distributed and a 2520% return recorded across presale batches, momentum is strong. The current $0.0019 entry option is available until May 13, presenting a final chance before listings start. Among current projects, BlockDAG stands out based on real results rather than market noise.

For the first time in weeks, bulls appear firmly in control, reclaiming momentum and building a case for a sustained uptrend. After a prolonged period of uncertainty, BTC is now trading within a pivotal range that could shape its next major move. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Accumulation Trend Develops – New Bullish Phase Ahead? A drop below the $90,000 support zone would threaten the current structure and potentially confirm bearish momentum. On the other hand, a clean breakout and daily close above $100,000 would likely open the door to a powerful rally and renewed market confidence. This makes the coming sessions especially critical for traders and investors alike. Top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Bitcoin’s strong technical setup, pointing to the 4-hour chart where BTC is showing “beautiful strength” as it tests the upper bounds of its trading range. This could be the beginning of a breakout phase if bulls can maintain pressure and flip resistance into support. Bitcoin Triggers Investor Frustration As $100K Breakout Remains Elusive Bitcoin is testing investors’ patience once again as it continues to struggle below the key psychological level of $100,000. Despite strong price action in recent weeks, BTC has failed to reclaim this milestone, leaving the market divided over what comes next. While some analysts maintain that the bull run is far from over and expect Bitcoin to break its previous all-time high at $109K, others argue that this current rally is nothing more than a relief bounce within a broader bear market structure. Following months of heavy selling pressure and macro uncertainty, Bitcoin has shown renewed strength, reclaiming key support levels and climbing back above $97K. This move has reignited bullish hopes, especially as price action forms higher lows and approaches the top of a multi-week range. Cheds has weighed in with a more optimistic take, highlighting Bitcoin’s “beautiful 4H strength” as the price continues to press against range highs. Cheds noted that BTC is showing more resilience than he initially expected, a sign that bulls still have control, at least for now. However, the $100K level remains a major resistance zone. A confirmed breakout above it could validate a full-scale continuation of the bull market. Until then, the market remains at a standstill, caught between anticipation and doubt. Traders are watching closely for either a breakout above $100K to trigger new upside momentum, or a breakdown below $92K–$90K to confirm a deeper correction.

Whether this is a setup for new highs or the calm before renewed downside remains to be seen, the next move could define sentiment for the months ahead. Technical Details: BTC Testing Critical Supply Bitcoin is trading at $96,959 after bouncing strongly from support near $94,000 and reclaiming short-term momentum. The 4-hour chart shows a clear attempt by bulls to retest the $98,000 level, a key resistance zone just below the psychological $100K barrier. Price is trending well above both the 200-period simple moving average (SMA) at $88,387 and the 200-period exponential moving average (EMA) at $90,723, reinforcing the bullish structure that has been developing since mid-April. The recent move confirms higher lows and a sustained bullish trend, as BTC continues to build upward pressure against range highs. Volume has picked up slightly during the latest breakout attempt, suggesting fresh demand entering the market. However, the $98K–$100K area has historically triggered selling interest, so a decisive break and close above $100K will be essential to confirm a true breakout.

On the downside, holding above the $94K–$95K zone will be critical to preserving bullish momentum. For now, Bitcoin appears to be setting the stage for a breakout, but traders should watch closely as price compresses just under resistance. The next move will likely set the tone for the broader market.

For those following the digital landscape, including the dynamic crypto space often influenced by major tech shifts, a significant development has emerged: Microsoft is embracing a new open standard from Google aimed at improving how AI ‘agents’ interact. This move is set to enhance the capabilities of Microsoft AI agents , making them more collaborative and versatile. Microsoft Embraces Google A2A Protocol Microsoft recently announced its support for Google’s newly launched Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This open standard is designed to allow AI agents, which are semi-autonomous programs powered by AI, to communicate and work together across different platforms, applications, and services. Think of it as creating a common language for AI assistants and tools. Google unveiled the Google A2A protocol in early April, proposing a framework where agents can securely exchange goals, invoke actions, and collaborate on tasks. This is a crucial step towards building more complex and capable AI systems that aren’t limited to a single environment. Microsoft’s commitment goes beyond just verbal support. The company is actively integrating the A2A specification into two of its key AI development platforms: Azure AI Foundry: A platform for building, training, and deploying AI models. Copilot Studio: A tool for creating custom copilots and AI agents. Furthermore, Microsoft has joined the A2A working group on GitHub, signaling its intention to contribute to the protocol’s development and related tooling. This collaborative approach underscores a broader industry push towards open standards for AI. Enhancing Microsoft AI Agents with Interoperability The integration of the A2A protocol into Microsoft’s platforms is a game-changer for developers and enterprises using Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio . Once A2A support is fully implemented, agents built on these platforms will gain the ability to seamlessly interact with external agents, regardless of whether those agents were created using different tools or are hosted outside Microsoft’s ecosystem. This means that a Microsoft AI agents could initiate a task that requires assistance from an agent running on Google Cloud or another third-party service. For example, a Microsoft-built agent handling calendar management could coordinate with a Google-built agent specializing in drafting emails to schedule a meeting and send out invitations automatically. This level of cross-platform functionality is what AI agent interoperability aims to achieve. Microsoft stated, “By supporting A2A and building on our open orchestration platform, we’re laying the foundation for the next generation of software — collaborative, observable, and adaptive by design.” They envision a future where “The best agents won’t live in one app or cloud; they’ll operate in the flow of work, spanning models, domains, and ecosystems.” Why AI Agent Interoperability Matters for Enterprise The move towards shared AI agent protocols is particularly significant for enterprise customers. Businesses are increasingly experimenting with AI agents to boost productivity, with a recent KPMG survey indicating that 65% of companies are exploring this technology. The ability for agents to work together across internal systems, partner tools, and production infrastructure is essential for building complex, automated workflows. Achieving true AI agent interoperability allows enterprises to build more robust and flexible solutions. It ensures that different specialized agents can be combined to handle sophisticated tasks while maintaining necessary governance and service-level agreements (SLAs). This alignment with broader industry efforts for shared protocols is crucial for fostering a healthy, competitive, and innovative AI ecosystem. The AI agent market itself is projected for substantial growth, with Markets and Markets forecasting the segment to grow from $7.84 billion in 2025 to $52.62 billion by 2030. Standards like A2A will play a vital role in enabling this growth by reducing friction and complexity in agent development and deployment. Seamless Collaboration with Copilot Studio Microsoft’s decision to integrate A2A into Copilot Studio follows its earlier support for Anthropic’s MCP standard, which focuses on connecting AI to data systems. This pattern shows Microsoft’s commitment to supporting multiple open standards that facilitate AI collaboration and connectivity. By supporting standards like A2A and MCP, Microsoft is positioning Copilot Studio as a versatile platform capable of interacting with a wide range of external AI models and systems, enhancing the capabilities of custom Microsoft AI agents built within the studio. Conclusion: A Step Towards a Connected AI Future Microsoft’s adoption of Google’s Agent2Agent protocol is a positive step towards a more interconnected and collaborative future for artificial intelligence. By integrating A2A into platforms like Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio, Microsoft is not only enhancing the capabilities of its own Microsoft AI agents but also contributing to the development of open standards that benefit the entire AI ecosystem. This focus on AI agent interoperability is crucial for unlocking the next wave of AI-powered applications and workflows, enabling agents to work together seamlessly across different platforms and services, ultimately driving innovation and productivity.

On the larger time frame, the price is holding above the important support level of $2, but momentum remains weak. The market appears to be in a holding phase, with limited direction in recent days. Experts are watching XRP’s price pattern and believe it’s still going through a correction. At first, it looked like a triangle shape, but now it seems to be forming a more typical pullback pattern called an ABC correction, which could take more time to finish. Important Support and Resistance Levels In the shorter time frame, there’s some speculation that a low may have formed on April 7, but there is not yet enough evidence to confirm this. The recent move up is unclear and could simply be part of a temporary correction within a larger downtrend. Support between $1.74 and $2.30 is being watched. As long as the price stays above $1.74, the potential for a bullish reversal remains. However, traders are looking for a strong move above $2.25 to confirm a new upward trend. This would signal the start of a C-wave rally, possibly leading to higher highs. Until then, the market remains uncertain. XRP briefly broke below a previous support level but has started to recover. While it’s possible that a bottom is in, there is still a chance the price could fall again before turning higher, with $2.30 seen as the next support if that happens. The long-term forecast still includes a possible rally, with targets between $5.00 and $6.60, but these will only come into focus once a clear bottom is confirmed and the market shows strong upward momentum.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-08 01:15:13

MACD 線（藍色） 你可以將其視為您的動量追蹤器。 當價格走勢開始反轉時，它會作出反應，顯示市場是處於能量增強還是放緩的狀態。 2. 訊號線（橘色） 這條線會緊跟著 MACD 線。 當藍線由下而上穿越橘線時，通常表示動能正在轉強（買入訊號）。 當藍線由上而下穿越橘線時，可能表示動能正在轉弱（賣出訊號）。 3. 柱狀圖（紅色或綠色柱體） 這些柱體顯示藍線與橘線之間的距離。 判讀方式： 柱體增長 = 動能增強 柱體縮小 = 動能減弱 綠柱 = 多頭能量（買方需求強勁） 紅柱 = 空頭壓力（賣方壓力大） 為什麼要使用 MACD？ MACD 是用來辨別進出場時機的指標，能提供以下資訊： 何時動能正在增強 何時動能可能反轉 何時應觀望等待 舉例說明： MACD 指標（圖表下方的指標面板） MACD 線 (藍色) : 326 訊號線 (橘色): -279 MACD 線向上穿越訊號線：黃金交叉 柱狀圖轉為綠色並持續增長：動能走強。 交叉發生在零線以下：趨勢走弱，可能是下跌信號。 移動平均線（主圖表） 20日 EMA（藍線）：約 84,067 50日 MA（綠線）：約 84,170 當前比特幣價格為 87,269，且高於兩條均線，顯示買方主導市場，走勢可能會持續上漲。 專業祕訣: 要提升訊號的確定性，可將 MACD 與 EMA 或 SMA 搭配使用。 在關鍵支撐/壓力區附近觀察 MACD 交叉，可提高準確度。 避免在震盪市場中只依賴 MACD 來做判斷 — 容易出現假訊號。 立即在Bitfinex進行實戰演練： 登入 Bitfinex 選擇任一交易對（如 BTC/USD） 在指標欄位新增「MACD」 留意以下訊號： 多頭訊號：MACD 線向上穿越訊號線 空頭訊號：MACD 線向下穿越訊號線 柱狀圖增長：市場趨勢正在增強 柱狀圖縮減：動能減弱，趨勢可能正在放緩 這些練習可以提升判斷準確性，讓你在交易決策時更有信心，減少困惑。 MACD 深受交易者青睞，因為它能在價格反轉之前，提前發出趨勢變化的預警信號。 MACD 與 SMA/EMA 的不同之處 觀看 MACD 實際操作 下一篇圖表解析系列文章 RSI —如何判斷市場是否處於超買或超賣狀態？ The post 圖表解析系列：MACD – 提前掌握進場時機的核心指標 appeared first on Bitfinex blog .",Uncategorized|chart decoder|taiwanese,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitfinex blog', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitfinexblog,2025-05-08 01:16:07
44302801,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158245,1746667200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Binance Reserve Ratio: 30 Months of Unwavering Transparency and User Fund Safety,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-reserve-ratio-safety/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, trust and transparency are paramount. For users entrusting their digital assets to a centralized exchange, knowing that their funds are secure is non-negotiable. This is where the concept of a reserve ratio becomes crucial. Binance, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, recently hit a significant milestone that underscores its commitment to user fund safety and Binance transparency : maintaining a reserve ratio of over 100% for an impressive 30 consecutive months. Understanding the Binance Reserve Ratio: What Does 100%+ Mean? At its core, a reserve ratio for a financial institution, including a crypto exchange , is a measure of the assets it holds compared to the liabilities it owes its customers. A ratio of 1:1, or 100%, means that for every dollar (or crypto equivalent) a customer has deposited, the exchange holds at least one dollar (or crypto equivalent) in reserves. A ratio above 100% indicates that the exchange holds more assets than its customer liabilities. Think of it like a bank account. If you have $100 in your checking account, a traditional bank might only be required to hold a fraction of that in reserve, lending out the rest. In the crypto space, however, the expectation, especially after certain industry events, has shifted dramatically. Users want exchanges to hold all of their deposited assets, and then some. A 100%+ Binance reserve ratio provides a strong signal that the exchange is not using customer funds for risky activities and can meet withdrawal requests even during periods of high demand. The Significance of 30 Consecutive Months Maintaining a reserve ratio above 100% is one thing; doing it consistently for two and a half years (30 months) is quite another. This lengthy streak, as reported by Wu Blockchain via X, highlights several key aspects of Binance’s operations: Operational Stability: It suggests robust internal processes and risk management systems are in place to ensure that customer assets are always backed 1:1 or more. Commitment to Transparency: While the initial impetus for Proof of Reserves came from external pressures, maintaining this standard for so long indicates an institutional commitment rather than a temporary measure. Handling Market Volatility: The past 30 months have included significant market swings, bear markets, and regulatory challenges. Successfully navigating these periods while keeping reserves above 100% is a notable achievement. This consistent performance reinforces confidence among users regarding the security and availability of their funds on the platform. Proof of Reserves: The Engine Behind Binance Transparency How does an exchange prove it holds the reserves it claims? This is where the concept of proof of reserves comes into play. Binance, like several other major exchanges, utilizes a Merkle Tree proof of reserves system. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it generally works: Snapshot of User Balances: The exchange takes a snapshot of all user account balances at a specific point in time. Merkle Tree Construction: These balances are anonymized and hashed into a data structure called a Merkle Tree. Each user’s balance contributes to the final ‘Merkle Root’. Verification for Users: Individual users can then verify that their specific balance was included in the snapshot and correctly incorporated into the Merkle Root, without revealing other users’ balances. Verification of Exchange Holdings: Simultaneously, the exchange provides a list of wallet addresses holding the assets and works with third-party auditors to verify that the total assets held in these wallets match or exceed the total customer liabilities represented by the Merkle Root. This combination of cryptographic proof (Merkle Tree) and third-party verification aims to provide verifiable evidence of the exchange’s crypto exchange reserves . Shifting Holdings: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT The report also noted slight changes in the composition of Binance’s reserves compared to the previous month: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holdings decreased slightly, while USDT increased slightly. What could explain these shifts? User Activity: The most straightforward explanation is user deposits and withdrawals. If users are withdrawing BTC and ETH and depositing or holding more USDT, the reserve composition will naturally shift. Trading Patterns: Increased trading volume between BTC/ETH and stablecoins like USDT could also influence the balances held by the exchange to facilitate these trades. Market Movements: While the total reserve value might be measured against liabilities, the composition in specific assets can change based on price fluctuations and user reactions to them. These minor fluctuations in asset composition are normal for a large, active exchange and don’t necessarily indicate an issue, especially when the overall reserve ratio remains above 100%. Why is Binance Transparency and Proof of Reserves Important for User Fund Safety? For anyone using a centralized crypto exchange, the primary concern is the safety of their deposited assets. Unlike holding crypto in your own self-custody wallet, you are trusting the exchange to safeguard your funds. Here’s why initiatives like a strong Binance reserve ratio and proof of reserves are vital for user fund safety : Mitigating Insolvency Risk: By publicly demonstrating they hold more assets than liabilities, exchanges reduce concerns about potential insolvency or inability to return customer funds. Building Trust: In an industry that has faced trust deficits, verifiable transparency builds confidence among both retail and institutional users. Accountability: Regular proof of reserves reports hold exchanges accountable for managing customer assets responsibly. Differentiation: Exchanges that commit to and consistently demonstrate strong reserve ratios and transparency set themselves apart in a competitive market. While Proof of Reserves is not a complete picture (it doesn’t typically show liabilities like loans the exchange might have taken out), verifying the existence of customer assets is a critical step forward for industry standards and user protection. Challenges and Considerations for Crypto Exchange Reserves While the 30-month streak is positive news, it’s also important to consider the broader context of crypto exchange reserves and proof of reserves systems: Liability Side: As mentioned, most PoR systems focus on the asset side. A full picture requires visibility into liabilities as well. Auditor Independence and Rigor: The quality and independence of the third-party auditors are crucial. Are they conducting thorough audits, or just verifying the data provided by the exchange? Frequency: While monthly checks are good, real-time or more frequent verification would be even better, though technically challenging. Scope: Does the PoR cover all assets and all entities within a large exchange group? These are areas where the industry continues to evolve, aiming for even higher standards of verifiable transparency. Actionable Insight: What Does This Mean for You? For users of Binance, this report serves as a positive indicator of the platform’s financial health and commitment to keeping customer funds backed by reserves. For users of other exchanges, it highlights the importance of looking for platforms that offer regular, verifiable proof of reserves . When choosing or using a crypto exchange, consider: Do they publish Proof of Reserves reports? How frequently are these reports updated? Do they use a verifiable method like a Merkle Tree? Is a reputable third party involved in the verification process? While no system is foolproof, exchanges that proactively address user fund safety through initiatives like strong reserve ratios and proof of reserves are generally demonstrating a higher level of responsibility to their users. Conclusion: A Milestone for Trust in Crypto Binance’s achievement of maintaining a 100%+ reserve ratio for 30 consecutive months is a significant milestone in the ongoing effort to build trust and ensure user fund safety within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Reported by Wu Blockchain, this streak, despite minor fluctuations in specific asset holdings like BTC, ETH, and USDT, underscores the exchange’s operational resilience and commitment to Binance transparency through its proof of reserves system. While transparency efforts in the industry are always evolving, this consistent performance sets a positive example and provides users with a verifiable indicator of the platform’s financial backing of customer assets.

The whale activity now surrounding the token is something that appears to have caught the attention of not just investors but also market analysts. That’s because these large traders seem to be making a significant accumulation of the token over the past couple of months. And it’s not just these traders that appear to be bullish on the token; with 300,000 addresses now in possession of 10,000 or more XRP, it appears a lot of folks in the market are getting pretty confident about this token. The shift in the ecosystem appears to be toward larger $XRP holders who are quietly stockpiling the digital asset in anticipation of some kind of big event. This provides a window of opportunity to rethink the discussion around what the SEC Ripple case has really been about. Over 300,000 addresses now hold 10,000+ $XRP — a sharp jump that screams rising confidence from whales and large holders. Looks like strategic accumulation is back… Are the big players front-running a major move in the XRP ecosystem? pic.twitter.com/ec21oZQQKx — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) May 5, 2025 If you’re enjoying this deep dive into $XRP and its market movements, be sure to subscribe for more detailed analyses, as well as insights, on the fascinating world of digital assets and their ecosystems. Whale Accumulation Points to Growing Confidence In the sphere of cryptocurrency, the behavior of whales often gives us crucial insight into the trends we see in the market. Whales—people or entities that hold a ton of a given cryptocurrency—can sometimes so dramatically affect price levels that they give off signals about the direction the market is headed. And it’s not only the case that some of these whales have been buying up more XRP; the recent data reveals that it is now over 300,000 addresses that hold at least 10,000 XRP, up sharply from previous periods. A development that is really very interesting is happening with XRP. This is pointing to large holders being very confident in the future of this asset. In fact, the recent price action and the uptick in the confidence of large holders are showing signs that something may be happening in the near future with XRP. This may be happening because major players may be anticipating something substantial within the XRP ecosystem, whether it is a significant technological development, regulatory clarity, or other market-moving news. BREAKING Whales Accumulate $1.8 Billion in $XRP in 30 Days WE'RE SO BACK pic.twitter.com/xr3CORnWpT — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 6, 2025 Owning $XRP is also a bet on its future potential. And right now, the $XRP-dominated investments of big players seem to be saying something way beyond the obvious. Whales, by the way, are the Kraken of the crypto world. Historically, they’ve been good at front-running the market, following just behind the major players. If that’s how we should interpret this recent series of $XRP purchases, we might also have to interpret these purchases as being for some potentially big thing that the XRP investment situation is going to do. The Role of Bitcoin and the Broader Market XRP has consistently held a price above $2 when at the same time Bitcoin is trading just over $92,000. This shows that the market is still really strong, considering that Bitcoin’s dominance is kind of undeniable. However, the altcoin market, since this has happened, seems to be getting a lot more attention and capital inflow, so that might be a part of this whole scenario too. XRP holding its price when Bitcoin is just over $92,000 really shows that the overall market is strong. The reality that Bitcoin is still trading well beyond $92,000 gives our broader crypto market a sense of stability and positivity—pushing altcoin investor sentiment in the same direction. With Bitcoin’s dominance leading the market, it’s likely that some of the capital flowing into BTC is also spilling over into other promising assets with recent optimistic stories to tell—like XRP. XRP’s capacity to uphold its price intensity, regardless of how much or how little Bitcoin is worth at any given time, speaks to an asset class maturity around XRP. More than that, though, it may be telling us something about the ecosystem XRP is part of—a maturing ecosystem that appears to be appealing to much more than just retail investors. Is a Major Move Coming for XRP? There is a developing theory that XRP may be on the verge of seeing a considerable price change because of how whales have been acting lately. It appears that these large investors have been accumulating a lot of XRP. In addition to this, large-holder addresses (i.e., those holding over 1 million XRP) have been increasing more substantially than before. This certainly seems to suggest that something might be going on behind the scenes that is influencing these large entities to stock up on XRP. The tactical boost to reserves might also be a clue that these deep-sea divers are getting ready for prices to reassert themselves. Of all cryptocurrencies that are in play, XRP is one of the more entrenched and the one whose price moves are most commonly tied to two kinds of forces: global ones (like looming regulatory decisions) and local ones that have to do with the network itself (like how well that’s operating, or how many people are using it). Recent whale activity in the market has some observers thinking that XRP is about to do something big. These market professionals see XRP as an asset on the verge of a strong rally, whether that rally is powered by institutional adoption, a positive outcome in the cryptocurrency’s ongoing legal battles, or a more general uptrend in altcoins. Conclusion: A Key Indicator for the Future of XRP Whale activity around XRP is now concentrated with the largest players in the crypto market, who look to be quite confident in the asset’s future potential. Since October 1, 2022, over $1.8 billion worth of XRP has been accumulated by these large players, who appear to be positioning themselves for what could be some significant development around the XRP ecosystem. Now, over 300,000 addresses contain large amounts of XRP, and they seem to number among the asset’s ever-growing fan base. XRP is in an awesome place right now. It has taken on some serious adoption, and that is only set to expand greatly. The two major markets for cryptocurrency that are developing right now are China and India (who together account for over 36% of the world’s population). To this point, I reiterate that XRP is one of the key players in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its adoption is happening rapidly, and in some major ways, and that is certainly no reason for anyone who holds XRP to lose sleep. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44302925,https://nulltx.com/?p=149101,1746667387,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Fractal Bitcoin Dominates as Top Blockchain for Transactions, Sui Network Leads in Volume",https://nulltx.com/fractal-bitcoin-dominates-as-top-blockchain-for-transactions-sui-network-leads-in-volume/,"The previous week held some pivotal developments for both transaction volume and transaction counts across numerous chains . From April 27 to May 3, 2025, transaction activity in Fractal Bitcoin exploded. And while we can’t quite say the same for chains like Polygon and Arbitrum (which experienced some declines), hey — at least we have Base, Sui, and BNB Chain holding it down for us. Oh, and speaking of holding it down, doesn’t that sound like something the number one chain (by transaction count and volume this week) right after BTC, Fractal Bitcoin, would do? Indeed. Top Chains by Transaction Count: Fractal Bitcoin Surges, Polygon and Arbitrum Decline Pacing itself in transaction count, Fractal Bitcoin saw a 106.4 million transaction blockbuster week, a record 89.12% week-over-week uptick that translated to over 200% growth in transaction processing. This not only put Fractal Bitcoin back on the top title as most transacted upon, but it signed off as a clear message that this platform is seeing the kind of user adoption that translates to actual growth in the transaction space. Following closely behind Fractal Bitcoin, Base completed a credible 51.2 million transactions this week, good for a solid 6.12% increase over the previous week’s total. While it didn’t match Fractal Bitcoin’s explosive growth, Base continued to show strong, steady progress, affirming its status as one of the top blockchains in transaction activity. The modest growth seen by the Sui Network can be interpreted as an even more stable sign for this blockchain than for newer projects apparently experiencing growth bursts. The network did accumulate almost a million extra transactions this past week, which seems to suggest a good enough growth signal if you’re an Sui enthusiast. On the other hand, a few projects that have been around for longer than Sui, like Tron and BNB Chain, also added a few extra million extra transactions this past week. Although these two are significant figures, the leaders are doing even better. Polygon and Arbitrum faced downturns in activity counts, but not as bad as Solana’s. My guess is that Solana’s recent news is fueling this narrative, which was already somewhat established. As I’ve previously stated, my interpretation is that if users are leaving Solana, they are largely going to Ethereum or Layer 2s like Arbitrum. I don’t see much evidence for them going to anywhere else. Transaction Volume in USD: Sui Network Continues to Lead, Ethereum Sees a Drop Sui Network took the crown when it came to transaction volume, amassing a staggering $38.8 billion in transaction volume, with a 1.80 percent increase from the previous week. The network’s clear dominance in that area, as well as its rising transaction volume, could be a signal that interest in its platform is sticking around, if not increasing, and that new developments or user adoption could be fueling a fire that’s keeping the platform in play. The second position saw a steep drop for Ethereum, which recorded $$18.6 billion in transaction volume, a 28.07% decline WoW. This downturn could be reflective of broader market dynamics or reduced activity on Ethereum as users migrate to newer or more specialized blockchains. Ethereum, despite this drop, remains one of the key players in the blockchain ecosystem, and such fluctuations may be temporary or periodic market cycles. The first position, the undisputed leader in the race, is occupied by the Bitcoin blockchain. Arbitrum experienced favorable movement in its transaction volume with $3 billion processed during the week, this being an increase of 6.23% from previous volumes. Arbitrum, a tournament-structure scaling solution for Ethereum, has always been a better solution for moving money around. Some speculate that it receiving more transactions than usual may be due to the imminent ETH staking unlock, which we expect could free around $16 billion of collateral for users. This is definitely something to keep an eye on. Other chains like the BNB Chain, Base, Tron, Polygon, and Optimism all suffered sharp declines in transaction volumes. The BNB chain saw its transaction volume tumble to $2 billion, a 53.61% WoW drop, while Base and Tron saw their volumes dive by 13.17% and 25.02%, respectively. Optimism had a 32.85% decrease in transaction volume, while Polygon’s volume took a 46.05% hit. Top 8 Chains by Total Txn & Txn Vol. (Apr 27-May 3) 1/2 @fractal_bitcoin surged to 106.4M transactions (+89.12% WoW), doubling its activity to take the top spot. @base follows with 51.2M (+6.12% WoW), while @SuiNetwork holds steady at 41.9M (+0.14% WoW). @trondao … pic.twitter.com/xwnebzCtQZ — OKX Explorer (@okxexplorer) May 6, 2025 Shifting Blockchain Trends: Fractal Bitcoin’s Dominance and Sui Network’s Stability Examining these trends makes it clear that blockchain activity is becoming richly diversified, with different platforms experiencing distinct growth arcs based on user preferences and network enhancements. Bitcoin’s astonishing surge in transaction counts seems to suggest that strong user demand for its services exists; if Fractal Bitcoin really has that strong user base, it’s likely due either to its unique value proposition or to recent, tantalizing updates to the network. Meanwhile, Sui Network, our next stop on the world tour of dWeb possibilities, is enjoying a moment of something close to transaction volume supremacy. If you want large-scale blockchain operations, it looks like Sui is the place to be. While other blockchain networks such as Polygon and Arbitrum have seen their transaction activity drop, it is essential to remember that blockchain ecosystems are dynamic and often recover quickly from downturns. In what is never a static marketplace, the current data indicate that blockchain projects must consistently invent and reinvent themselves, most often by means of network upgrades, if they are to have any hope of holding onto or significantly enlarging their user bases. So far, Fractal Bitcoin and Sui Network seem to be the top performers of the previous week, and it will be thrilling to see if the trend holds or if other chains will step up to take them on.

44302988,https://nulltx.com/?p=149100,1746667540,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Binance Maintains Dominance in CEX Market, Gate.io and Bitget Secure Top Positions",https://nulltx.com/binance-maintains-dominance-in-cex-market-gate-io-and-bitget-secure-top-positions/,"A recent analysis by CoinGecko has scrutinized the performance of centralized exchanges (CEXs) in order to identify the leaders in the spot trading market. The report, which is based on data from October 1, 2024 to April 30, 2025, provides a very clear picture of who is dominating in this sector, with Binance clearly holding down the first position and doing so by a rather wide margin. However, there’s apparently some very serious competition going on right below the top spot, with exchanges like Gate.io and Bitget solidifying their places as major contenders in the trading market. Binance Continues to Lead with a Stronghold on the Market By April 2025, Binance was still the biggest player in the world of centralized exchanges, with a commanding 38.0% market share of total monthly spot trading volume. Even as the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced its ups and downs, Binance has stayed strong and has actually solidified its dominance by offering consistently competitive fees, a huge number of trading pairs, and a well-rounded set of services that cater to both beginner and expert traders. Even though Binance’s market share has undergone some slight changes recently, it is becoming clear that the platform’s luster has not faded. Its enormous global presence, deep liquidity, and constant rollout of new trading features and tools have not only held but strengthened its leadership position within the crypto space. Beyond just spot trading, Binance has further secured its standing with futures trading, staking, and a host of other offerings, creating an ecosystem that draws a diverse assembly of crypto enthusiasts. Gate.io and Bitget: Rising Competitors While Binance remains the indisputable leader, Gate.io has persistently held the No. 2 spot, commanding in April 2025 a market share of 9.0%. Gate.io earned that place through a combination of low trading fees, a very broad assortment of listed cryptocurrencies, and its standing as one of the most user-friendly exchanges in the industry. Why is this of particular interest? Because even with Binance’s big lead, Gate.io has somehow managed to appeal to traders who like an exchange that’s a bit more straightforward with its trading experience — and yet still has some very advanced features. Gate.io’s ability to keep hold of its position in the pecking order of exchanges, even during periods of real market volatility, has to speak to some very solid user base and a real good reputation. Nipping at the heels of Binance and Bybit is Bitget, which in April 2025 secured 7.2% of the market share. The rapidly rising exchange’s place is reflective of a broader industry movement toward trading platforms specialized in serving certain customer segments. Unlike exchanges that cater to a wide swath of traders, Bitget focuses almost exclusively on serving advanced traders. It mainly offers derivatives and futures contracts and leverages those two offerings to provide high-margin trading opportunities. With an international expansion plan and a promise to add a great many trading products over the next year, it looks like Bitget is well-placed to give the other two exchanges some competition. A Look at Other Notable Exchanges The remainder of the top 10 list shows mostly familiar and a few up-and-coming names. MEXC and OKX are tied at 7.1% market share, putting them in fourth and fifth place, respectively. Both have profited from their extensive product lines (spot trading, futures, staking, and different flavors of derivatives), and it’s very possible these two platforms could place even higher next time, as they seem intent on continuing to innovate and improve their already centralizing services. Another major player in the industry, Coinbase, holds 6.9% of the share in this market, putting it in sixth place. While its focus had been mainly on the U.S. market, it has in recent years broadened its service offerings and now does a considerable amount of business internationally. Its reputation for regulatory compliance and ease of use makes it a go-to platform for new traders, though it continues to face significant competition from Binance and other global exchanges. Exchanges that make up the top 10, with market shares definitely nearing Quintuplets territory, are Bybit, Upbit, Crypto.com, and HTX Global. Bybit brings next-level derivatives trading to the party; Upbit, a full-on cryptocurrency exchange; Crypto.com, an expansive ecosystem that includes a wallet, credit card, crypto-rewards platform, and staking services; and HTX, well, we’ll get back to you on HTX, but it’s obviously pulling its weight because it’s part of this exclusive club. Top 10 CEX by Market Share in April 2025 1. @binance – 38.0% 2. @Gate_io – 9.0% 3. @bitgetglobal – 7.2% 4. @MEXC_Official – 7.1% 5. @okx – 7.1% 6. @coinbase – 6.9% 7. @Bybit_Official – 6.7% 8. @upbitglobal – 6.4% 9. @cryptocom – 6.2% 10. @HTX_Global – 5.4% — CoinGecko (@coingecko) May 6, 2025 Market Dynamics and the Path Forward The centralized exchange market keeps expanding with new entrants and existing platforms fighting for a piece of the action. Binance is the clear leader, but the spot trading market cap is still significantly untapped, and not even the top exchanges are very close to claiming a large majority. Exchanges like Gate.io and Bitget have grown impressively, and their success seems to hint that in 2023, the top site in the spot trading ranking is not even close to being the top dog in most other aspects. The top 10 exchanges are likely to keep shifting as they introduce new features, services, and strategic moves. They will need to continually adapt in order to maintain or grow their market share, and how they do it will vary: – Some will enhance the user experience. – Others will expand into new regions. – And still others will diversify by offering up new kinds of financial products. To sum up, although Binance is by far the dominant player in the centralized exchange market, there are still plenty of opportunities for innovation and growth among its would-be competitors, as evidenced by Bitget and Gate.io, two platforms that are racking up user growth and interest. As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, and as these promising competitors put forth their this-is-why-you-should-trade-with-us arguments, the centralized exchange space may well begin to look like something other than an all-Binance, all-the-time proposition.

44303105,https://nulltx.com/?p=149099,1746667684,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Whale Activity and Institutional Investment Surge: Bitcoin Movement and BlackRock’s Massive Purchases,https://nulltx.com/whale-activity-and-institutional-investment-surge-bitcoin-movement-and-blackrocks-massive-purchases/,"In recent hours, a large sum of Bitcoin has been moved after lying still for more than 10 years, provoking wild speculation and excitement across the crypto markets. Two whales, with wallets that hadn’t been touched for nearly 11 years, moved a combined sum of 3,422 BTC (around $325 million), provoking many in the markets to wonder what might have caused these whales to move such a large—really, huge—sum after so long. Was someone, or some entity, just testing out a movement of Bitcoin? Was it a sign of something more sinister at work? Or, to be completely honest, was it the first real whale sighting of 2023? Historic Whale Movements: Over $324 Million in Bitcoin Shifts After 10 Years In a turn of events that has grabbed the cryptocurrency world’s attention, two enormous Bitcoin addresses thought to be inactive have suddenly come back to life after more than a decade of dormancy. Whale “1NWPS” transferred 2,343 BTC worth about $222.2 million to a new wallet after being dormant for over 10 years. And Whale “1PiEK,” which hadn’t been heard from in a staggering 11.75 years, re-emerged to move 1,079 BTC worth approximately $102.5 million. $324.2M in #Bitcoin on the move after over 10 years of dormancy! In the past 3 hours, two Satoshi-era whales, who had been inactive since 2014, transferred 3,422 $BTC ($325M) to new wallets: Whale “1NWPS” woke up after 10.5 years, moving 2,343 $BTC (~$222.2M). Whale… pic.twitter.com/UKb78WJDXp — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) May 6, 2025 For market analysts who analyze movement of Bitcoin, the fact that these transactions involve Bitcoin from the early days of the network—often called “Satoshi-era” Bitcoin—is significant. Those coins are among the first mined in Bitcoin’s infancy, and so they’re highly prized within the community (for better or worse). Everyone knows that addresses associated with these coins should be watched closely, since movement of coins from these addresses is probably a good indicator of potential major market activity. The transfers have raised eyebrows because of the coins’ age and the market situation. Most analysts think that Bitcoins held for that long must be moved for some good reasons. They speculate about the kinds of things that make even the quietest of Bitcoin holders turn active. Factor in that Bitcoin is at a record price, and that these appear to be very large transfers, and you can see why some imaginations might run a little wild. This occurrence syncs well with past large movements of capital in and out of cryptocurrencies, where long-dormant Bitcoin wallets are reactivated during big upswings in the market. When the price of Bitcoin has just broken upwards past $90,000, it does make one wonder if these so-called Bitcoin whales might have been behind that market movement. Be it capitalizing on the current bull run or responding to the heightened volatility of the market and movements of price highs and lows, it remains to be seen what these Bitcoin whales do next. BlackRock’s Aggressive Bitcoin Acquisition: $4.44 Billion in Two Weeks In a different significant development, Bitcoin has seen institutional investments flooding in, with one of the biggest asset managers in the world, BlackRock, aggressively amassing Bitcoin. Over the last couple of weeks, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has taken on another 41,452 BTC—worth approximately $3.92 billion—that brings its total to 620,252 BTC, or roughly $58.51 billion. BlackRock bought another 5,613 $BTC ($529.5M) and now holds 620,252 $BTC ($58.51B). BlackRock has bought a total of 47,064 $BTC ($4.44B) since April 21. https://t.co/pRDoPUTxus pic.twitter.com/gtBs0TMVyg — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 6, 2025 The ongoing collection of Bitcoin by BlackRock emphasizes the swelling institutional focus on digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. Since April 21, the investment firm has amassed 47,064 BTC, converting to $4.44 billion, which it has made apparent is being used to express a bet on Bitcoin’s staying power and its long-term viability as a store of value. With the price of Bitcoin stubbornly remaining near the highs it reached in 2021, BlackRock’s ongoing purchases have not only been noticeable but have also served as a point of conversation for both retail investors and those investing through other institutions. These purchases’ timing is also very interesting. The latest buying spree by BlackRock follows a big rise in Bitcoin’s price and, at the same time, a much more common effort by institutional investors to include digital assets in their portfolios. With these big steps from a major player like BlackRock, it’s becoming ever clearer that Bitcoin is an asset class that might be safe enough to put into irrefutable, legally binding documents. On May 5, Bitcoin ETFs saw a significant net inflow of $425 million, marking three consecutive days of net inflows. This continued flow of capital into Bitcoin-related financial products points to the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the traditional financial system. As more institutional investors gain exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs and other investment vehicles, the potential for Bitcoin to further solidify its position as a “mainstream” asset grows. On May 5, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $425 million, marking three consecutive days of net inflows. All nine spot Ethereum ETFs recorded zero net inflows or outflows throughout the day, showing no movement. https://t.co/Hj2Gs48E6C — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 6, 2025 The Future of Bitcoin: Increased Institutional and Whale Activity A large supply of previously dormant Bitcoin is now on the move, driven by what appears to be an emerging market for the previously inactive crypto. The very fact that Bitcoin—always billed as a scarce and valuable asset—is finding so many previously unaccounted-for coins suddenly available for sale is having a pronounced chilling effect on the price. And it’s happening at the same time that we have some very deep-pocketed institutional players getting into the market for Bitcoin. While Bitcoin’s price remains constant and well above the level of $90,000, and institutional interest in the digital asset keeps ramping up, I can’t help but think that the future of Bitcoin is very bright indeed. Whale activity and institutional buying appear to be steering Bitcoin towards an even more heightened supply/demand dynamic, which I think will end up being a favorable one for Bitcoin’s price in the months ahead. Meanwhile, with even more mainstream financial institutions leaping into the embrace of Bitcoin, I don’t see the very understandable legitimacy problem that the digital currency used to have as existing anymore. To sum up, Bitcoin’s future is increasingly being shaped by such major developments as the whales movin’ and the porpoises buyin’. If those big fellows keep on keepin’ on buyin’ up, what happens next, then, in the next chapter of the Bitcoin story? The secret, I’ve been told, lies in the coming weeks and months.

Six hours ago, identified by the address 0x20D869bA482C6D7a5451Ca1976C655afed01bF67, this Ethereum whale made its first major transaction (since going dormant, that is), withdrawing a substantial amount of the token—1,700 ETH, to be precise, worth around $3.1 million—from a significant cryptocurrency exchange (that is Binance, we should say). Whale Resurfaces—1,700 $ETH Withdrawn from #Binance After 6-Month Silence After a quiet six months, a known Ethereum whale is back in action. Wallet 0x20D869bA482C6D7a5451Ca1976C655afed01bF67 just withdrew 1,700 ETH from Binance, totaling $3.1 million, roughly 6 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/6FLSikOIE8 — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) May 6, 2025 According to the Ethereum Whale Watch Twitter account, this withdrawal is a big deal. The cryptocurrency community is, once again, buzzing over the sudden movement of funds from a previously dormant whale. This latest development has experts speculating about the whale’s next move and what it could mean for the price of Ethereum. There’s even some chatter about the possibility of a stealth fork in Ethereum’s future. Whale’s Return to Action: 1,700 ETH Moved from Binance In the Ethereum ecosystem, the address that this recent withdrawal came from has long been respected as one of the largest and most powerful players it has. Any activity it conducts is usually pretty closely monitored by market analysts, as transactions from large holders—often termed “whales”—can send pretty strong signals about upcoming changes in market sentiment or price direction. Before this transaction, the wallet had not been used for half a year, which makes this transfer that much more dramatic. The 1,700 ETH that came out of Binance represents quite a large cut of the whale’s remaining balance, which is now around 5,000 ETH, or about $9 million at current prices. While it doesn’t seem like a liquidation, it’s still a noticeable shift for a major Ethereum market actor. Despite the substantial size of the recent withdrawal, the whale’s Ethereum holdings are currently sitting on a loss of $3.6 million that isn’t realized yet, given that the price of Ethereum is a lot lower than when the whale first acquired all that Ethereum. The whale’s long-term hold may be responsible for that loss, unless it has somehow managed to engage in long-term Ethereum mining under conditions that might be said to favor miners rather than holders. The whale’s recent price decision to take the plunge and move some Ethereum could suggest that the recent prices tended to favor whales rather than holders. A Broader Look at Ethereum ETFs and Market Activity This whale’s activity coincides with a notably still period concerning the Ethereum ETF market. On May 5, all nine spot Ethereum ETFs registered no net inflows or outflows—meaning the ETFs had zero buying or selling activity for that day. That suggests ETF investors are currently taking a break from making decisions about whether to buy or sell spot Ethereum. On May 5, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $425 million, marking three consecutive days of net inflows. All nine spot Ethereum ETFs recorded zero net inflows or outflows throughout the day, showing no movement. https://t.co/Hj2Gs48E6C — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 6, 2025 Ethereum ETF activity remains quiet. That makes it all the more notable when individual large-scale investors (often called “whales”) shift their own assets. In recent days, one such whale withdrew 1,700 ETH from Binance. What’s that about? Is this investor trying to push down the price of ETH ahead of a further drop by moving a large amount of ETH onto the market? Or is this move a sign of something ostensibly positive for Ethereum’s price in the not-too-distant future? The absence of any meaningful progress with Ethereum ETFs also implies that institutional enthusiasm for Ethereum is perhaps on hold for now. Even with the overall fascination with cryptocurrencies and digital assets pushing ahead, Ethereum-centric financial vehicles are not recording the sort of capital inflow that has been observed in other slices of the crypto market. The ETF deadlock could be down to a combination of things: a skeptical stock market, concerns about ETF performance, and a possible diversion of attention (and investment) from Ethereum to other blockchain platforms. The Bigger Picture: Whale Behavior and Market Impact The return of a significant-holding whale after a long dormancy is always something that gets market participants excited. 1,700 ETH is a lot to move in any direction, so what does this mean for the future of Ethereum? Is this whale reallocating, making a market call, or responding to the current conditions in crypto? Is this whale going to dump E… Price movements can be significantly impacted by whale activity, especially in a market as choppy as cryptocurrency. If the whale keeps dumping its ETH, it’s sure to push the price of ETH down. But if the whale is simply diversifying into other assets or is holding its position (for now), then the immediate effect on the price of Ethereum could be negligible. No matter what this whale had in mind, the fact remains that one of the largest holders of Ethereum has now moved a giant pile of the cryptocurrency. And it is those kinds of moves, along with selling or buying cryptocurrency, that can make a whale look like a market-mover. If a whale moves funds or does something that looks suspicious or impactful, traders and analysts will use the event to try to divine broader market sentiment. Conclusion: Monitoring the Whale and Ethereum’s Next Moves Transferring 1,700 ETH out of Binance is noteworthy in the world of Ethereum. This is especially true for the current state of the market, with a significant whale suddenly making a move after being dormant for a long spell. We still don’t know for certain why it acted now of all times, but the fact that it pulled out a huge amount of ETH may suggest it’s up to some serious business and possibly playing the long game, with all those unrealized losses racked up since the last peak and paying little heed to whatever prices happen to be for it right now. Ethereum ETFs have shown little movement, while the activities of the whales could signal a larger shift in the market. These developments make the next few weeks extremely important for both Ethereum and its investors. If the price movement of Ethereum is going to change, the next week certainly appears to be a crucial one. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44303155,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158246,1746667859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin: Tim Draper Issues Crucial Warning to Businesses,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-draper-businesses-irresponsible/,"Imagine a world where not holding a specific asset is considered ‘irresponsible’ for a business. According to billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper , that asset is Bitcoin . Speaking at the Financial Times Digital Assets Summit, Draper didn’t mince words, suggesting that companies overlooking Bitcoin in their strategies are making a significant mistake. But why such a strong stance, and what does it mean for the future of commerce and investment? Who is Tim Draper and Why Listen? Tim Draper is a name synonymous with bold predictions and early investments in groundbreaking technologies. As a prominent venture capitalist, his track record includes early bets on companies like Hotmail, Skype, Tesla, and Coinbase. His long-standing bullish view on Bitcoin isn’t new, but his recent remarks carry weight given his influence in both the traditional investment world and the burgeoning crypto space. When Draper speaks, the market and business leaders tend to listen, especially when he frames inaction as ‘irresponsible’. Why is Bitcoin for Businesses Becoming Essential? Draper’s core argument for why businesses should hold Bitcoin centers on its accelerating adoption curve. He highlighted that both governments and corporations are increasingly recognizing and integrating Bitcoin into their operations and reserves. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about acknowledging a global shift towards digital assets. Consider these points that make Bitcoin for businesses a compelling topic: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unpredictable monetary policy, Bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power better than depreciating fiat currencies. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin transactions are borderless, enabling easier international payments and access to new markets without traditional banking hurdles or high fees. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets away from purely fiat holdings, potentially enhancing long-term value. Innovation & Brand Image: Embracing Bitcoin signals a forward-thinking approach, appealing to a tech-savvy customer base and talent pool. Growing Infrastructure: The ecosystem supporting Bitcoin (exchanges, payment processors, custody solutions) is maturing rapidly, making integration more feasible for businesses. While challenges remain, such as regulatory uncertainty and price volatility, Draper’s view is that the long-term benefits and the direction of global finance make ignoring Bitcoin a riskier proposition than engaging with it. Understanding Crypto Adoption Beyond Price Draper’s optimism isn’t solely based on price charts. He pointed to a significant shift in developer focus within the crypto world. For years, much innovation seemed centered on alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). However, recent advancements have brought sophisticated capabilities directly to the Bitcoin network. This evolution is critical to understanding growing crypto adoption : Smart Contracts: While historically associated with platforms like Ethereum, smart contract functionality is now expanding on Bitcoin layers, enabling more complex transactions and applications. DeFi on Bitcoin: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications are beginning to emerge on or connected to the Bitcoin network, leveraging its security and liquidity. Ordinals and Runes: These developments allow for the creation of unique digital assets and tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, driving new use cases and developer interest. This technical progress indicates that Bitcoin is not just a store of value but a platform for innovation, further solidifying its foundational role in the digital economy and accelerating broader crypto adoption . Draper’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction No discussion with Tim Draper about Bitcoin is complete without his famous price target. He reiterated his belief that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2025 . This prediction, while ambitious, is rooted in his long-term view of Bitcoin replacing or significantly supplementing traditional fiat currencies for everyday transactions and commerce. Factors potentially supporting such a bold Bitcoin price prediction include: Continued institutional and corporate adoption. Increasing global macro-economic uncertainty driving demand for scarce assets. Technological advancements making Bitcoin more usable for payments and applications. Potential regulatory clarity in major economies. Draper also revealed plans to launch a Bitcoin-only fund that will operate using smart contracts, demonstrating his commitment not just to predicting Bitcoin’s future but actively building infrastructure within its ecosystem. Regulatory Hurdles and the Future of Commerce While bullish, Draper did touch upon challenges. He specifically blamed regulatory overreach under the previous U.S. administration for potentially slowing down Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. Unclear or overly restrictive regulations can stifle innovation and adoption. Despite this, his long-term vision remains steadfast: a significant, perhaps even complete, shift from traditional fiat currencies towards Bitcoin-driven commerce . This isn’t just about buying coffee with crypto; it envisions a global economic system where Bitcoin serves as a primary medium of exchange and store of value, underpinned by its decentralized and secure nature. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors Tim Draper’s comments serve as a powerful call to action. For businesses, it’s time to seriously evaluate the potential role of Bitcoin in treasury management, international payments, and customer engagement. This requires due diligence, understanding the risks, and exploring the growing suite of corporate crypto services. For investors, Draper’s $250k Bitcoin price prediction is a reminder of the potential upside many see in this asset, but it should be considered alongside thorough personal research and risk assessment. The emergence of Bitcoin -only funds and increasing on-chain activity highlight the diverse ways to engage with the asset. Conclusion: Is Ignoring Bitcoin Truly Irresponsible? Tim Draper’s assertion that businesses without Bitcoin are ‘being irresponsible’ is a strong statement, but it reflects a growing sentiment among proponents of digital assets. His arguments are compelling, citing increasing global adoption, significant technological advancements enabling new uses for Bitcoin , and its potential as a future backbone of commerce. While regulatory hurdles and volatility remain real considerations, the trend towards integrating Bitcoin into the mainstream financial and business world appears undeniable. Whether his $250,000 prediction materializes by 2025 or not, Draper’s message is clear: the time for businesses to pay serious attention to Bitcoin is now.

Under this new law, Arizona will take profits from old, unclaimed assets — like forgotten bank accounts or uncollected checks — and convert them into Bitcoin. The idea is to protect the state’s money from inflation and build a stronger, more modern financial future, all without touching taxpayer dollars. Getting a lot of questions about the Arizona SBR law singing into law. To be clear: There are 4 bills for SBR in AZ. SB 1025 was vetoed. HB 2749 was signed into law! https://t.co/X7VydTkO9E — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 8, 2025 The law also allows Arizona to collect rewards like interest, airdrops, and staking profits from these digital assets. It ensures that the funds are stored safely through regulated U.S. custody services and diversifies the state’s investment strategy without relying solely on Bitcoin. This important bill was championed by Representative Jeff Weninger, who guided it from draft to signature. Crypto exchange Coinbase also supported the bill by providing expert advice and testimony, helping push it across the finish line. Governor Katie Hobbs’ decision to sign the bill has made Arizona a frontrunner in digital-asset innovation within the United States.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-08 01:31:14

It regained strength and now looks bullish on the daily timeframe. Last month, Litecoin went through a major recovery after declining to its lowest level in five months. That recovery brought the price back in the $90 range, but it failed to sustain momentum higher due to a rejection. This rejection triggered a drop, and the crypto started the new month on a weak note. After five days of pullback, it found solid ground and held the $81 level as support. Resurging from this support level yesterday, the price increased significantly and closed briefly above last month’s high. While that has brought more recovery in the market, it is now looking ready for a big move. The psychological $100 level remains a key hurdle for the bulls. If they scale through it, we can expect a bigger move until the price breaks higher. In the next leg down, it must break below before considering a bearish extension in the mid-term. Following the latest recovery in the crypto space, it saw the biggest gain among the top 50 altcoins, leading the daily altcoin rally at the time of writing. Although Stacks’s STX, Worldcloin’s WLD and Hyperliquid’s HYPE also posting double-digit gain, closely following suit. LTC’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview LTC currently eyes a close resistance level of $96.5. A successful surge above this level could bring a recovery to the $100 and $113 resistance. The $130 and $149 levels are higher resistance to watch for a breakup. The $80 level has managed to hold during last leg down. If the price dips below it, the support level to watch is $73.3, followed by last month’s $63 low.

44303828,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158263,1746669043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Figma AI Launches Revolutionary Tools: AI Website Builder, App Prototyping & More",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/figma-ai-website-builder/,"In a significant move impacting the world of digital creation, design powerhouse Figma has unveiled a suite of powerful new Figma AI tools. This launch positions the company squarely against established players like Adobe and Canva, as well as emerging AI-first platforms for web and app development. Unlock Creation with Figma AI Design Tools Figma’s new offerings leverage artificial intelligence to streamline various design and development workflows. This expansion aims to empower designers, marketers, and even developers with faster, more intuitive ways to bring their digital ideas to life. The suite includes tools for building websites, creating app prototypes, generating marketing assets in bulk, and enhancing vector illustration capabilities. With these innovations, Figma is not just enhancing its existing platform; it’s venturing into new territories previously dominated by different types of software. This signals a broader ambition to become the central hub for the entire digital product lifecycle, from initial concept to published output. Introducing Figma Sites: Your AI Website Builder One of the headline features is Figma Sites , an integrated AI website builder . Traditionally, designers would use Figma to create high-fidelity mockups and prototypes of websites, which developers would then translate into code. Figma Sites changes this paradigm by allowing users to generate functional websites directly from their Figma designs, powered by AI. Key capabilities of Figma Sites include: AI-Powered Generation: Create initial site structures and designs rapidly based on input. Collaborative Editing: Teams can easily modify site elements in a visual editor without needing complex coding knowledge or prompting. Responsive Design: Ensure sites look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Interactive Elements: Add transitions, animations, and scroll effects. Built-in CMS (Upcoming): Manage content like blog posts directly within the design environment, including editing text, managing assets, and setting slugs. Custom Code & AI Code Generation: Embed interactive components like stock tickers, either by writing code or using AI to generate it. This tool is particularly valuable for marketing and design teams who have a clear vision for a site and want direct control over its appearance and content, as highlighted by Figma’s Chief Product Officer, Yuki Yamashita. Exploring Ideas with AI App Prototyping: Figma Make Complementing Figma Sites is Figma Make , another AI-powered tool focused on ideation and AI app prototyping . While sharing underlying technology with Sites, Make is geared towards exploring concepts and building interactive prototypes for web applications. How Figma Make works: Prompt-Based Creation: Users can input prompts to generate initial web application prototypes. Collaborative Prototyping: The prototype is collaborative, allowing team members to prompt the AI assistant to modify or add elements. Developer Handoff: Developers can directly access and modify the underlying code of the prototype, facilitating a smoother transition from design to development. Embeddable Components: Generate small, interactive elements (like a clock) that can be embedded into pages published via Figma Sites. Figma Make is designed for higher-fidelity prototyping, allowing teams to add data and test the viability of an idea closer to its final implementation state. Beyond Sites and Make: Marketing & Drawing Tools Figma’s AI push extends beyond websites and app prototypes. The company also announced tools aimed at marketers and illustrators. Figma Buzz: A new tool specifically for marketers. It allows them to leverage designer-created templates with brand-specific elements to generate new creatives easily. Features include inserting AI-generated images, changing backgrounds, and creating assets in bulk using data sources like spreadsheets. This directly challenges tools used for high-volume creative production. Figma Draw: Enhancing vector editing and illustration capabilities within Figma. Previously, complex vector edits often required exporting designs. Figma Draw adds features like text on a path, pattern fill, brushes, multi-vector editing, adding noise and texture, and a lasso selection tool. This positions Figma Draw as a competitor to dedicated illustration software. These additions, along with the existing Figma Slides tool for presentations, create a more comprehensive creative suite within the Figma ecosystem, intensifying competition with companies like Adobe and Canva. How Does Figma AI Stack Up Against the Competition? Figma’s foray into AI-powered creation puts it in direct competition with a diverse set of platforms: Website Builders (Wix, WordPress, Squarespace, Hostinger): These platforms have also been integrating AI tools for site creation, but Figma approaches it from a design-first perspective, integrating directly with existing design workflows. Prototyping/Coding Tools (Replit, Lovable): These tools focus on enabling app creation without deep coding knowledge. Figma Make offers a similar promise but is tightly integrated with the design process. Creative Suites (Adobe, Canva): Figma Buzz and Draw compete with asset creation and illustration tools offered by these giants. Figma’s CPO emphasizes that Figma’s core business is building digital products, and a significant portion of their user base are developers, differentiating their approach from purely creative tools. This isn’t Figma’s first experiment with AI in design; they previously launched a ‘Make Design’ feature that was later pulled. This new launch appears to be a more refined and integrated approach. Pricing and Availability To support these new capabilities, Figma is introducing a new plan called a ‘content seat,’ starting at $8 per month. This plan provides access to Figma Buzz, Slides, FigJam (Figma’s online whiteboard), and the upcoming Sites CMS feature. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Digital Creation Figma’s release of comprehensive Figma AI tools, including the AI website builder Figma Sites and the AI app prototyping tool Figma Make, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of design and development workflows. By integrating AI directly into the creation process, Figma aims to empower users to move from idea to published product faster and more collaboratively than ever before. While facing stiff competition across various sectors, Figma’s focus on a unified platform for digital product creation, bridging the gap between design, marketing, and development, positions it as a formidable player in the future of digital innovation.

IOTA is making moves with its Rebase upgrade and a new custody partner. BNB is tightening into a triangle that could soon resolve upward. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is adding something different: transparency. With a new podcast series and limited-time entry pricing, it’s offering a rare inside look while opening doors before its exchange debut. If you’re asking which is the top crypto to buy in 2025, these updates could point you in the right direction. BNB Eyes $644 as Triangle Pattern Tightens BNB’s price sits around $595.56, forming a symmetrical triangle that suggests price compression ahead of a possible breakout. The pattern shows lower highs and higher lows, creating a tight price range. Traders watching BNB are focused on whether the coin can push past $599, which could lead to new targets at $617 and even $644. If price fails to hold support within this structure, a downward move could follow. Analysts say momentum still favors an upward breakout, but the pressure is building on both ends. This moment of consolidation may end soon with a strong shift in one direction, likely favoring the bulls. IOTA Rebase Upgrade and Zodia Deal Confirmed IOTA has officially moved forward with its Rebase upgrade, which is set to improve network speed and structure. This update includes support for 150 validators and a new staking model to promote decentralization. Alongside Rebase, IOTA has partnered with Zodia Custody to offer regulated asset storage, targeting larger players in the market. The combined launch is designed to attract more attention from institutions, giving IOTA a stronger foundation for future use cases. While these moves signal a technical leap, the price hasn’t reacted much yet. IOTA’s chart shows consolidation between key moving averages after its April rally. Traders expect price action to react once the mainnet Rebase rollout fully activates in the ecosystem. BlockDAG Podcast Unpacks Strategy as Presale Hits $227.5M BlockDAG is doing more than just selling out its presale. The team has launched a podcast series to walk users through its roadmap, presale logic, and upcoming exchange plans. This open format gives new users direct insights into why BlockDAG is gaining so much traction. The platform has already raised over $227.5 million, selling more than 19.7 billion coins. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, far above the limited-time offer of $0.0019 available until May 13. With a public launch price set at $0.05, users tapping into the $0.0019 entry could see gains of 2,520%. The campaign hasn’t just been about coin sales. Over $6.9 million worth of miners have been sold, with 17,310 miners already in circulation. This shows strong belief in the mining side of the project. The recent CertiK audit has also been completed, strengthening trust in the system. The podcast content shares real discussions, not vague promos, giving people access to behind-the-scenes decisions. With listings confirmed and price volatility yet to kick in, BlockDAG is showing clarity in a noisy market. This could be the final shot at entering one of the biggest presales in 2025 before full market exposure takes hold. Which Crypto Stands Out in 2025? BNB shows strong signs of a breakout with its tightening triangle setup around $593. If it clears resistance, it could test levels as high as $644. IOTA has taken a big step with Rebase, adding validator support and locking in a custody deal to attract institutional access. These moves point to network maturity but price remains subdued. Meanwhile, BlockDAG makes a more immediate case. With $227.5 million raised and a current limited-time $0.0019 entry price, the opportunity window is closing fast. The coin’s official launch at $0.05 could reward early buyers heavily. For those searching for the top crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG may be the standout.

At the same time, Shiba Inu’s daily burn rate has soared by over 3200%, even as it clings to key support levels. Both coins are showing movement, but one project is taking a different route: it’s offering real utility from the start. Web3 ai isn’t waiting for market pumps or meme cycles to make progress. Instead, it delivers 12 live AI tools through one streamlined platform, built around the WAI coin. Whether it’s sentiment analysis or trading automation, Web3 ai provides tools that traders usually pay monthly for, at a much lower entry point. At just 0.0003 in Batch 1, WAI gives users access to features that simplify crypto usage and give a competitive edge. It’s not just a crypto presale ; it’s a working platform gaining attention before the public even catches on. Toncoin Could Break Out Soon Based on Key Chart Signals Toncoin has spent weeks in a sideways trend, but technical charts suggest a shift might be coming. The coin is shaping into a classic triangle pattern that often signals a breakout. The resistance near 7.30 is being watched closely by analysts. A decisive move above this point with good volume could drive Toncoin toward the 8.50 level or beyond. Supporting indicators like RSI remain steady, while decreasing volatility hints at a potential price surge. With the market calming down, TON could gain more ground if sentiment improves. Toncoin’s setup presents an early opportunity with a clear breakout level. While it hasn’t caught major attention yet, this silent pattern may soon become a headline mover. Shiba Inu’s Token Burn Skyrockets by 3200% Despite Price Struggles SHIB is holding firm at a vital support area, but a further dip could lead to sharper declines. Behind the scenes, though, a remarkable spike in burn activity, up over 3200%, has grabbed trader interest. Many believe this rapid supply reduction might become the spark SHIB needs for a turnaround. While the price remains under pressure, the token burn rate is climbing fast. Earlier burn events didn’t always impact price, but this sudden jump could shift sentiment if it keeps up. Technicals still point bearish, yet the community’s efforts could help steady the trend. For those willing to watch closely, SHIB’s current range might offer a short-term rebound zone, especially if burn momentum continues. Web3 ai Delivers Full Crypto Tools Suite for Just 0.0003 Traders are moving away from expensive monthly platforms, and the reason is clear. Web3 ai recently rolled out its crypto-focused AI presale, giving access to 12 advanced tools under one roof. No more switching between apps for market insights, trading bots, or portfolio tracking. Through a single dashboard powered by WAI, users get real-time sentiment tools, auto-trading bots, risk management analysis, scam filters, and more. It’s like getting every premium feature in one spot without paying for five different services. Unlike others promising “upcoming” utilities, Web3 ai’s tools will be ready the moment it lists. Right now, the coin is still in Batch 1 at 0.0003. As batches progress, the price climbs to its final 0.005242 listing rate. This means early adopters benefit not only from pricing but also from early tool access. Why juggle multiple subscriptions when Web3 ai wraps it all into one powerful, easy-to-use system? It’s not just a better route, it’s the smarter one. Final Say! TON’s chart hints at a breakout. SHIB’s massive burn could flip market sentiment. But both are relying on future momentum. In contrast, Web3 ai is already offering something functional, attracting traders who want value now, not promises.

Wallet Activity Fuels Hope appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Pi Network community is currently excited after some interesting activity was spotted on Binance’s Stellar deposit wallet — the same wallet used for PI transactions. It seems like Binance has started testing transactions on the Pi Chain, and naturally, this has sparked fresh rumors about a possible listing. The wallet in question, with a long address, recently showed signs of test activity. This couldn’t have come at a better time, with a big Pi ecosystem announcement set to drop on May 14. The Pi Core Team has teased that a bunch of developer applications are under review, and some might even get listed soon. A Pi ecosystem announcement will be released on May 14.

Even after gaining 4% in the last 24 hours, it is still hovering around $0.60, showing very little movement. Market indicators like RSI and OBV show that buying interest is still weak, and unless something major happens — like a Binance listing or a sudden demand spike — analysts think Pi might continue to move sideways or even dip to $0.52 or lower. Since its open mainnet launch back in February 2025, Pi Network has built a strong community of over 60 million users. However, it’s also faced a fair share of challenges. The project has struggled with low liquidity, weak transaction activity, and the lack of smart contract features — which are crucial for building decentralized apps on any blockchain. At its peak, Pi Coin hit $2.90, but concerns over regulatory issues (thanks to its referral-based model) and criticism from crypto leaders — like the Bybit CEO calling it a scam — have kept the project under the spotlight for the wrong reasons. The Pi team, though, has consistently denied those accusations. Now, with May 14 approaching, the Pi Network community is awaiting a big news. Could a Binance listing finally be in the cards?

Here’s how other top coins like Bitcoin and Solana compare. XRP Top Buyers Are The Only Ones In The Green Right Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the situation of the top buyers has been looking for different top digital assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity In Bear Market Zone—Warning Or Opportunity? The indicator of interest here is the “Realized Price,” which keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition level of the average investor on a given cryptocurrency network.When the value of the metric is above the spot price of the asset, the holders as a whole can be assumed to be in a state of net unrealized loss. On the other hand, it being under the token’s price implies the dominance of profit on the network. In the context of the current discussion, the Realized Price of the entire userbase isn’t of relevance, but rather that of only a specific portion of it: the investors who got in during the earlier euphoria phase of December 2024 to January 2025. From today, this period lines up with the 3 months to 6 months old range, so Glassnode has referenced the average cost basis of these mid-term holders. First, here is a chart showing the Realized Price of this cohort for XRP: As is visible in the above graph, the Realized Price of the 3 months to 6 months old XRP investors is currently trading a notable distance under the cryptocurrency’s spot price. Naturally, at least some of the top buyers of the asset would have capitulated by this time, but it would appear that those that still continue to hold are sitting relatively comfortably at a profit margin of 11%. Related Reading: Bitcoin In The Middle Of A Decision Point, Analyst Says—Here’s Why While this may be so for the mid-term holders of XRP, the trend is different for those present on the other major networks. As the below chart shows, Solana’s 3 months to 6 months old hands currently have their cost basis above the spot price. More specifically, SOL’s mid-term investors are holding a net unrealized loss of around 28%. The situation is even worse when it comes to Ethereum, with the cohort sitting about 36% underwater on the blockchain. Even Bitcoin has this group carrying a loss, although the margin is just 1% in the case of the number one cryptocurrency. As for what this trend of the top buyers being underwater could mean, the analytics firm has noted, “price stabilizing below the 3m–6m holders’ cost basis is a clear sign of market weakness.” XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.13, down almost 4% in the last seven days.

The world’s leading economies are zeroing in on a critical threat within the digital asset space. The upcoming G7 Summit , scheduled for mid-June in Alberta, Canada, is set to place a significant spotlight on a pressing issue: North Korea’s crypto hacking activities. This isn’t just about digital assets; it’s about global security and the integrity of the international financial system. Why is the G7 Summit Focusing on Cryptocurrency Theft? The Group of Seven (G7) is an intergovernmental political and economic forum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These nations represent a significant portion of global wealth and influence. When the G7 convenes, their agenda reflects the most critical challenges facing the international community. The inclusion of cryptocurrency theft by rogue states like North Korea on this high-level agenda underscores the severity and scale of the problem. North Korea has increasingly relied on sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly targeting cryptocurrency platforms and exchanges, as a primary means of generating revenue. This revenue is crucial for funding its prohibited weapons programs, including nuclear and ballistic missile development, bypassing international sanctions. The sheer volume of stolen funds has made Pyongyang a major player in the world of state-sponsored cybercrime. Bloomberg recently reported that this topic is expected to be a major point of discussion. The G7 leaders recognize that tackling this issue requires a united front. Isolated efforts by individual nations are simply not enough to counter a threat that operates across borders in the inherently global nature of the internet and cryptocurrency networks. The Scale of North Korea’s Crypto Hacking Operations Estimates from various cybersecurity firms and international bodies like the United Nations paint a concerning picture of the scale of North Korea Crypto Hacking . Reports suggest that the regime has stolen billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency over the past few years. These funds are laundered and used to finance illicit activities, posing a direct threat to international peace and security. Known North Korean hacking groups, such as the infamous Lazarus Group, are notorious for their elaborate schemes. These attacks often involve phishing campaigns, exploiting vulnerabilities in exchange security, or developing sophisticated malware to compromise wallets and platforms. The methods are constantly evolving, making detection and prevention a continuous challenge. The funds acquired through cryptocurrency theft provide a vital lifeline for the North Korean regime, allowing it to circumvent traditional financial sanctions that aim to cut off its access to foreign currency. This makes the G7’s focus on this issue not just about financial crime, but about national security and non-proliferation. Tackling Illicit Financing Through International Cooperation A key outcome expected from the G7 Summit discussion is a commitment to strengthen international cooperation . Why is cooperation so vital in combating illicit financing via crypto? Here are a few reasons: Cross-Border Nature: Cryptocurrency transactions and the platforms handling them operate globally. A hacker in one country can steal from a platform in another, and the funds can be moved through exchanges located worldwide. Information Sharing: Effective tracking and recovery of stolen assets require rapid and seamless information sharing between law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, and cybersecurity experts across different nations. Regulatory Alignment: Harmonizing regulations related to cryptocurrency, particularly Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards, makes it harder for criminals to exploit loopholes in different jurisdictions. Technical Expertise: Sharing technical knowledge about hacking techniques, blockchain analysis tools, and attribution methods enhances the collective ability to identify perpetrators and trace funds. Sanctions Enforcement: Coordinated international sanctions targeting individuals, entities, and wallets associated with North Korean hacking groups are far more effective than unilateral actions. The G7 leaders are expected to discuss concrete steps to enhance this cooperation. This could involve establishing new frameworks for data exchange, conducting joint investigations, and working more closely with the private sector, including cryptocurrency exchanges, blockchain analytics firms, and cybersecurity companies. Challenges in Combating Crypto Theft and Illicit Financing While the commitment from the G7 is a positive step, significant challenges remain in effectively combating illicit financing conducted through cryptocurrencies. Some of these challenges include: Challenge Description Anonymity/Pseudonymity While not fully anonymous, the pseudonymous nature of many cryptocurrencies makes tracing ownership difficult without cooperation from service providers or sophisticated blockchain analysis. Jurisdictional Issues Prosecuting cybercriminals operating from hostile states like North Korea is extremely difficult due to lack of extradition treaties and state sovereignty issues. Technical Sophistication Hackers constantly develop new techniques, exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, and use mixers or tumblers to obfuscate transaction trails. Varying Global Regulations Inconsistent or absent cryptocurrency regulations in some countries create havens for illicit activity. Resource Allocation Tracking complex crypto crime requires significant resources, expertise, and specialized tools, which may not be uniformly available across all nations. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach that combines technological solutions, legal frameworks, and robust international cooperation . The G7 discussion is expected to explore how member states can pool resources and expertise to overcome these hurdles. What Actions Might the G7 Consider? Based on the goal of strengthening international cooperation to block illicit financing , the G7 might consider several actions: Enhanced Intelligence Sharing: Formal agreements for faster and more comprehensive sharing of threat intelligence related to North Korean cyber activities and cryptocurrency movements. Coordinated Sanctions: Implementing synchronized sanctions against individuals, entities, and cryptocurrency addresses identified as being involved in North Korean hacking and money laundering. Capacity Building: Assisting countries with less developed capabilities in enhancing their cybersecurity defenses and blockchain analysis skills to better identify and disrupt illicit flows. Engagement with the Crypto Industry: Working with exchanges, wallet providers, and blockchain analytics companies to improve security measures, implement stricter KYC/AML controls, and facilitate the tracing and seizure of illicit funds. Public-Private Partnerships: Fostering collaboration between government agencies and private cybersecurity firms to share threat information and develop countermeasures against sophisticated attacks targeting cryptocurrency theft . Research and Development: Investing in research for advanced blockchain analysis techniques and tools that can help de-anonymize transactions and track funds more effectively. These potential actions highlight the comprehensive strategy needed to counter the complex threat posed by North Korea’s crypto hacking operations. The focus is not just on punishment after the fact, but on building resilience and disrupting the illicit financial flows at various stages. The Impact on the Broader Crypto Ecosystem While the G7’s focus is specifically on state-sponsored malicious activity, discussions around illicit financing naturally bring increased scrutiny to the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This attention from major global powers like the G7 signals a continued trend towards greater regulation and oversight of the crypto space. Responsible actors within the crypto industry, including compliant exchanges and financial institutions dealing with digital assets, are already implementing robust KYC and AML procedures. The G7’s push for strengthened international cooperation could lead to more standardized global regulations, which, while potentially increasing compliance burdens, could also enhance the legitimacy and security of the ecosystem in the long run. By effectively tackling cryptocurrency theft and its use in illicit financing , the G7 can help differentiate legitimate crypto activities from criminal ones, potentially fostering greater trust and adoption. Conclusion: A United Front Against Digital Crime The inclusion of North Korea’s crypto hacking and illicit financing on the agenda for the upcoming G7 Summit is a clear indication of the global significance of this issue. It underscores how digital assets, while offering innovation, can also be exploited by malicious actors to circumvent traditional financial controls and fund dangerous activities. The expected outcome of strengthening international cooperation is a vital step in building a more secure and resilient global financial system in the digital age. Combating cryptocurrency theft on this scale requires a concerted, coordinated effort from the world’s leading nations. The G7’s focus provides hope that concrete strategies and enhanced collaboration will emerge to counter this significant threat, ultimately protecting both national security and the integrity of the global crypto market.

With the next bull cycle on the horizon, timing and project selection matter more than ever. Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) continue to impress with steady development, deep ecosystems, and institutional attention. They’ve proven their staying power, but their size may limit the scale of returns from new entries. On the other hand, Unstaked (UNSD) is just getting started. As an AI-powered crypto project with real utility and a presale price under $0.007, it offers something different: a shot at asymmetric upside through early access and functional tech. Cardano (ADA): Steady Fundamentals, Limited Short-Term Upside Cardano continues to deliver on its research-driven development model, with recent upgrades like decentralized BTC staking and renewed ETF speculation helping sustain long-term bullish sentiment. Analysts point to targets between $2.91 and $5 in the coming years, reinforcing ADA’s role as a solid, technically advanced Layer-1. That said, caution flags are emerging. Whale activity and a falling Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) signal weakening internal conviction. With a large existing market cap, ADA’s ability to multiply sharply is limited. It remains a stable long-term play, but likely won’t match the upside potential of earlier-stage projects like Unstaked. Solana (SOL): Market Momentum Meets Competitive Pressure Solana’s growth story continues, fueled by meme coin activity and rapid stablecoin adoption. Price action has broken through $150, and with institutional names like ARK Invest showing interest, SOL could test $200 soon. Its transaction speed and active developer base remain key competitive edges. However, the Layer-1 field is crowded. With Ethereum, Sui, and Aptos pushing innovation, Solana faces constant pressure to stay ahead. While its performance is strong, the path to outsized gains over five years may be flatter compared to smaller, utility-focused tokens like Unstaked, which offer more room for exponential growth. Unstaked (UNSD): Redefining AI Utility in Web3 from Day One Unstaked (UNSD) is doing more than riding the AI trend, it’s building the infrastructure for a fully decentralized AI agent economy. Unlike many AI-labeled projects, Unstaked’s core offering is tangible: autonomous agents that manage and grow communities on Telegram and X, all tracked on-chain. With its presale live at $0.00689 and a launch target of $0.1819, the setup presents early adopters with a projected 2,600% upside, based on utility that’s already functioning, not hypothetical. At the heart of Unstaked is its “Proof of Intelligence” protocol, which rewards only the most effective AI agents based on real engagement. This creates a performance-driven AI ecosystem where each agent competes to deliver actual value. As these agents scale across platforms, Unstaked becomes more than a tool, it becomes a self-sustaining layer of Web3 automation. The fundamentals behind this project are unusually strong for a presale-stage crypto. There’s no VC manipulation, a $20 million liquidity pool is already secured for launch, and agent deployment is scheduled for immediate post-launch rollout. This isn’t vaporware, it’s functioning infrastructure. Compared to legacy Layer-1s like Cardano and Solana, Unstaked stands out with a first-mover advantage in AI utility. For those scanning the market for asymmetric upside, UNSD represents a rare entry point into a working, scalable AI economy. One Crypto Stands Out Cardano and Solana have proven their strength through robust ecosystems and market share, but their size also means future gains may be incremental rather than exponential. They remain solid, lower-risk plays, but not necessarily high-upside ones for new capital. Unstaked, in contrast, is just getting started. With a functional AI agent network, a unique Proof of Intelligence system, and pricing under a cent, it offers something rare: a real product, real utility, and ground-floor entry. For those eyeing the next wave of breakout projects, a $1000 position in Unstaked ($UNSD) today could deliver the kind of upside most Layer-1s can no longer offer.

44304416,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158268,1746670242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Apple AI Search: Unlocking a New Era for Safari Browsing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/apple-ai-search-safari/,"The world of technology is constantly evolving, and few companies move the needle quite like Apple. For anyone tracking major shifts in the digital landscape, especially those relevant to innovation and market dynamics like in the cryptocurrency space, Apple’s next potential move is big news. Recent reports indicate that Apple is seriously considering integrating advanced AI search engines directly into its Safari browser. This isn’t just a minor update; it could fundamentally change how millions of users find information online and signal a significant strategic pivot for the tech giant. What Did Eddy Cue’s Testimony Reveal? The catalyst for this revelation came from a surprising source: the courtroom. During his testimony in the U.S. Justice Department’s ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Eddy Cue , Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services, made a notable disclosure. His appearance was primarily related to the massive, estimated $20 billion-a-year agreement that currently makes Google the default search engine across all Apple Safari devices. This deal is a cornerstone of Apple’s services revenue and a major factor in Google’s search dominance. However, Cue’s testimony went beyond just defending the Google partnership. He revealed that for the first time, searches conducted directly through Safari saw a decline last month. Cue attributed this change directly to the increasing public adoption and use of AI technologies, particularly AI-powered tools that can answer questions directly rather than just providing links. Why Is Apple Looking at AI Search Engines Now? Eddy Cue was quite clear about Apple’s motivation. He stated his belief that providers of AI-powered search will eventually replace traditional search engines like Google. This isn’t just a theoretical idea for Apple; it’s a future they believe is coming, and they want to be prepared. As a result, Apple is now “actively looking” at incorporating these advanced services into Safari. This strategic exploration suggests Apple recognizes the shifting landscape of information retrieval. Users are increasingly seeking summarized answers, conversational interfaces, and AI-driven insights, moving beyond the traditional list of ten blue links. By exploring integration with leading AI search engines , Apple aims to keep Safari relevant and valuable in this evolving environment. Which AI Search Engines Are on Apple’s Radar? According to the Bloomberg report based on Cue’s testimony, Apple is looking at several prominent players in the AI space. The companies mentioned are: OpenAI: Known for ChatGPT, OpenAI is a leader in large language models and conversational AI. Integrating their tech could bring powerful chat-like search capabilities to Safari. Perplexity: This company focuses specifically on building an AI-native search engine that provides direct answers and sources. Cue explicitly mentioned that Apple has already had discussions with Perplexity. This indicates concrete steps are being taken beyond just internal consideration. Anthropic: Creators of the Claude family of models, Anthropic is another major player focused on developing helpful and harmless AI. Their models are known for strong performance in understanding and generating text. Exploring these diverse providers suggests Apple is evaluating different approaches to AI search integration, looking for the best fit for the Safari user experience. What Benefits Could Safari AI Bring to Users? Integrating powerful Safari AI capabilities could unlock a host of new features and benefits for Apple users: Direct Answers: Instead of just showing links, the browser could provide concise, AI-generated answers to complex questions. Information Summarization: AI could quickly summarize long articles or web pages, saving users time. Conversational Search: Users could ask follow-up questions or refine their queries in a natural, conversational manner. Enhanced Research: AI could help users brainstorm ideas, find related information, or even generate outlines based on search topics. Seamless Integration: If implemented well, AI search features could feel like a natural extension of the Safari browsing experience. These potential features represent a significant leap beyond traditional keyword-based search. What Are the Challenges and Considerations for Apple? While the prospect of Apple AI Search is exciting, Eddy Cue also tempered expectations during his testimony. He noted that while Apple is actively looking at these services, they “probably won’t be the default” search option anytime soon. The primary reason he cited is that he believes these services “still need to improve.” Several challenges likely contribute to this cautious approach: Accuracy and Reliability: AI models can sometimes hallucinate or provide incorrect information. Ensuring a high level of accuracy for a core browsing function is critical for Apple’s reputation. Integration Complexity: Seamlessly integrating external AI services into the browser UI and backend infrastructure is technically challenging. Data Privacy and Security: Handling user queries and data with third-party AI services raises significant privacy considerations that Apple, known for its privacy focus, must address carefully. Cost: Running large language models for search is computationally expensive. Integrating these at scale for millions of users would involve substantial costs. Disruption to the Google Deal: Any significant shift towards alternative default search options could impact the lucrative agreement with Google, requiring delicate negotiation or a strategic phase-out. User Adoption: While AI is gaining traction, not all users may immediately embrace a radically different search experience. These factors explain why Apple is exploring but likely taking a measured approach before making any AI service the default in Apple Safari . The Broader Impact: How This Affects the Tech Landscape Apple’s exploration of AI Search Engines sends a strong signal to the entire tech industry. It validates the growing importance of AI-native search and puts further pressure on traditional search providers like Google to innovate rapidly. Google is, of course, heavily invested in its own AI search initiatives (like Search Generative Experience – SGE), but Apple potentially opening its platform to competitors like Perplexity and OpenAI could shake up the market dynamics significantly. For the cryptocurrency and broader tech community, this move is another data point showing how quickly AI is reshaping fundamental digital interactions. Just as AI is impacting areas like trading analysis, smart contract development, and blockchain security, it’s now poised to transform something as ubiquitous as web search. Monitoring how Apple navigates this shift provides insights into future tech trends and potential areas for innovation. Concluding Thoughts: A Glimpse into the Future of Safari Eddy Cue Testimony has provided a rare glimpse into Apple’s strategic thinking regarding the future of search on its platforms. Driven by observed changes in user behavior and a belief in the eventual dominance of AI, Apple is proactively exploring how to bring advanced Safari AI capabilities to its users. While challenges remain, and a default switch isn’t imminent, the fact that Apple is having discussions with companies like Perplexity underscores the seriousness of their intent. This move is not just about adding a new feature; it’s about ensuring Apple Safari remains a leading browser in an age where AI is fundamentally changing how we access and process information online.

As regulators approve pathways for asset-backed tokens and blockchain enters a new phase of real-world deployment, the race to become one of the best cryptos to hold is heating up. These shifts are already reshaping market sentiment and triggering serious interest from enterprises. There are 3 coins already making strides in the market– Qubetics , Aptos, and Polkadot. European and North American regulators released synchronized proposals favoring decentralized custody and RWA (real-world asset) tokenization—pushing platforms that serve utility over speculation into the spotlight. From community-led governance shifts to cross-border partnerships, many leading protocols are growing fast to stay in the race. Qubetics ($TICS), in particular, is emerging as a front-runner among the best cryptos to hold. While Polkadot is updating governance for long-term agility and Aptos is pivoting toward enterprise integrations, Qubetics is already bridging these worlds with enterprise-ready tools and an expanding crypto presale. This article breaks down each project’s progress and future potential. Qubetics: Modular Simplicity Unlocks Practical Blockchain Utility Qubetics’ strategic focus on enterprise-level adoption is not theory—it is in motion. Its ongoing crypto presale , now in Stage 33, has raised over $16.7 million, with more than 511 million tokens sold to 25,900+ holders. At a current price of $0.2302, $TICS is attracting global attention due to its infrastructure-first approach, giving businesses tools that abstract away blockchain complexity. At the core of this momentum are two innovations: QubeQode : A no-code/low-code builder that lets companies deploy dApps without blockchain engineering expertise. Qubetics IDE: A dedicated development suite that allows professional dev teams to deploy secure smart contracts across multiple chains with native interoperability. Why Qubetics Stands Out Traditional chains like Ethereum require substantial technical knowledge and security audits for every dApp iteration. Qubetics eliminates these barriers by offering pre-audited modular templates within QubeQode. These elements let small businesses and enterprise teams alike deploy projects without high overhead. The Qubetics IDE furthers this by integrating smart routing and security frameworks compatible with EVM, Cosmos SDK, and Polkadot Substrate environments. This combination makes $TICS not only one of the best cryptos to hold but also one of the most adaptable in practical deployment. Presale Highlights: Stage: 33 Token Price: $0.2302 Tokens Sold: 511M+ Holders: 25,900+ Raised: $16.7M+ Analyst Projections (Post-Mainnet): $TICS at $1 = 334% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2071% ROI $TICS at $15 = 6414% ROI The Qubetics design proves that when infrastructure meets usability, market adoption follows. It ranks high among the best cryptos to hold for long-term utility.

On May 6th, HTX once again demonstrated its astute operational prowess by becoming the first global exchange to list the USD1 stablecoin. As USD1 generates significant market traction, the next strategic move for HTX appears increasingly clear: WLFI, poised to potentially become the platform’s next high-impact asset. USD1 Debut: A Masterclass in HTX Agility and Execution On May 6th, HTX announced the global debut of the USD1 stablecoin, establishing itself as the pioneering exchange platform to support trading of this asset. USD1 is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, backed by a reserve comprising short-term US Treasury bonds, cash, and cash equivalents. Custody is managed by the established institution BitGo, with regular audits conducted by third-party firms to ensure compliance and transparency. Currently deployed on both the Ethereum and BNB chains, USD1 has achieved a circulating market capitalization exceeding $2.1 billion, positioning it among the top five stablecoins in both centralized and decentralized markets, underscoring its considerable market potential. HTX listed USD1 with remarkable speed: an announcement on May 5th at 11:10, followed by deposit services commencing at 19:30 that evening, and the launch of spot trading pairs the next day at 11:00. Furthermore, the platform concurrently introduced a zero-fee promotion for the USD1/USDT spot trading pair, effective from 11:00 on May 6th, 2025, until 23:59 on December 31st, 2025. This initiative directly enhances the user experience. This series of efficient actions by HTX not only injects significant momentum into the adoption of USD1 but also lays a solid foundation for the further expansion of the WLFI ecosystem. Anticipating WLFI Listing: HTX’s Next Strategic Play? Following the USD1 launch, market attention has swiftly turned to the next potential high-profile project: WLFI. Launched on October 15th, 2024, WLFI successfully raised $550 million across two token sale rounds, attracting participation from over 85,000 investors. Notably, the project has garnered support from influential figures such as Justin Sun, DWF Labs, and Mike Dudas. Consequently, HTX’s next move regarding WLFI has become key topics within the crypto community. After the precedent-setting launch of USD1, could WLFI be the platform’s next significant offering? Historically, HTX has demonstrated a “bold yet meticulous” approach to new asset listings—venturesome in exploring emerging sectors while precisely gauging market sentiment. In the Q1 2025, HTX decisively listed TRUMP amidst market skepticism. This asset subsequently experienced a peak surge of 900%, rapidly generating market attention and user enthusiasm, effectively setting the stage for the surge in “celebrity coins.” Following this, HTX implemented a series of targeted marketing and promotional activities around TRUMP, capitalizing on the prevailing market trend. Similarly, HTX exhibited foresight in the AI concept coin sector, proactively listing VIRTUAL on the BASE chain (gaining 104%), AVAAI on the SOLANA chain (increasing by 256%), and LUNA (rising by 312%), providing investors with prime opportunities to capitalize on emerging trends. This strategy of “pioneering with prudence” has enabled HTX to consistently maintain a leading position in the competitive cryptocurrency market. In this context, the potential listing of WLFI on HTX appears to be a logical progression. Furthermore, the close relationship between Justin Sun and both WLFI and HTX strengthens this anticipation. From TRUMP to USD1, Justin Sun has played an active role in the WLFI ecosystem, with HTX naturally serving as a crucial platform for his strategic initiatives. Clearly, HTX’s approach to being a first mover is not arbitrary. Each selection is carefully considered, capitalizing on network connections, key junctures, and potential advantages. Of significant note, WLFI officially announced on May 7th its plan to test on-chain airdrop functionality via a Snapshot proposal. This initiative aims to distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible $WLFI holders to verify the airdrop system and reward early supporters. This move not only enhances community engagement and project visibility but also adds further tangible basis and speculative potential for WLFI’s potential listing on HTX. WLFI First on HTX? Justin Sun’s Statement Ignites Excitement From TRUMP to USD1, HTX has consistently delivered “debut blockbuster” listings, providing a compelling prelude for the potential launch of WLFI. This time, Justin Sun’s direct statement has further elevated expectations for WLFI’s premiere on HTX. On May 6th, Eric Trump, son of Donald Trump, announced on social media, “#USD1 is now live on HTX!” Justin Sun subsequently retweeted and responded, “WLFI coming soon on HTX.” This single statement has generated significant excitement. It not only provides a clear indication of WLFI’s impending arrival on HTX, also further solidifies HTX’s position as a central platform for WLFI’s strategic execution. It is foreseeable that once WLFI is successfully listed on HTX, the combined influence of “ Justin Sun + HTX ” will likely trigger a new wave of market enthusiasm, potentially establishing WLFI as another “blockbuster” project for HTX in 2025.

This bill directly addresses concerns about government officials potentially profiting from digital assets while simultaneously shaping policy that impacts the cryptocurrency landscape. It’s a topic that touches upon the very core of ethical governance and the rapidly evolving world of digital finance. Why the Push for a Politician Crypto Ban? The core of the proposed legislation, championed by New York State Representative Ritchie Torres, is straightforward: prohibit key federal personnel and their immediate families from trading or otherwise profiting from digital assets. As reported by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett via X, this isn’t just about preventing lucrative personal trades; it’s about ensuring that those who hold positions of power aren’t using insider knowledge or their influence over policy to gain an unfair advantage in the volatile digital asset market. Think about it: Members of Congress, the President, the Vice President, and countless federal employees are privy to discussions, draft legislation, and regulatory decisions that can dramatically affect the value of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and even memecoins. Allowing them to trade these assets creates a clear potential for crypto insider trading – using non-public information for personal gain. This erodes public confidence and calls into question the integrity of the legislative and regulatory processes surrounding digital assets. The increasing integration of digital assets into the global financial system means that decisions made in Washington D.C. have real-world consequences for investors and the industry. A politician crypto ban is seen by proponents as a necessary step to align the rules governing digital asset trading with those already in place for traditional securities, where similar restrictions on insider trading and potential conflicts of interest exist for government officials. Who Would This Federal Employee Crypto Ban Affect? The scope of the proposed bill is broad, targeting those at the highest levels of government down to various federal employees. Here’s a breakdown of the individuals and groups explicitly mentioned as being subject to the prohibition: The President of the United States The Vice President of the United States All Members of Congress (Senators and Representatives) Federal Employees (This category is vast and would likely require specific definitions within the bill itself, but it aims to cover those working across various government agencies) Immediate Family Members of all the above individuals Defining “immediate family members” is often a critical detail in such legislation, typically including spouses, dependent children, and sometimes other close relatives. The intent is to prevent officials from simply trading through proxies to circumvent the rules. The bill aims to cover a wide range of digital assets, including: Major cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) Stablecoins (digital assets pegged to stable values like the USD) Memecoins (cryptocurrencies often based on internet memes or social trends, known for high volatility) Presumably, other forms of digital assets like NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), depending on the final language of the bill. The inclusion of memecoins highlights the bill’s intent to cover the full spectrum of digital assets, regardless of their underlying technology or perceived value, focusing purely on the potential for speculative profit and conflicts of interest. Addressing Digital Asset Ethics in Government The push for this legislation underscores a growing concern about digital asset ethics within governmental bodies. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, the ethical lines regarding officials’ personal investments become blurrier, especially when those officials are involved in crafting regulations or investigating the industry. This bill attempts to draw a clear line in the sand. Consider the potential scenarios: A Member of Congress holds a significant position in a particular altcoin and then sits on a committee discussing legislation that could directly benefit or harm that altcoin’s ecosystem. A Treasury official is involved in drafting stablecoin regulations while their spouse actively trades stablecoins. An SEC employee has investments in a cryptocurrency project that the agency is investigating. These situations, whether or not actual wrongdoing occurs, create the appearance of impropriety and can severely damage public trust in government institutions and the fairness of the financial system. By enacting a politician crypto ban , the bill seeks to proactively eliminate these potential ethical minefields. Comparing Current Rules to Proposed US Crypto Regulation Currently, rules regarding federal officials’ investments vary. While there are ethics guidelines and laws like the STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act) that require disclosure of stock trades and aim to prevent insider trading in traditional markets, the application to digital assets has been less clear or consistent across all levels and branches of government. Some agencies may have internal policies, but a comprehensive, federal-level prohibition specifically for digital assets affecting all branches and their families is a significant step. Here’s a simplified comparison: Aspect Current Situation (General) Proposed Bill (Ritchie Torres Bill) Scope of Assets Focus on traditional securities; crypto rules less uniform/explicit. Explicitly includes cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, memecoins, etc. Covered Individuals Varies by role/agency; STOCK Act covers Congress/Exec branch officials for stocks. Covers President, VP, Congress, Federal Employees, AND their immediate families. Action Prohibited Insider trading on traditional securities; disclosure requirements for trades. Trading or profiting from digital assets (effectively a ban on holding/trading speculative assets). Primary Goal Prevent insider trading & increase transparency for traditional assets. Prevent conflicts of interest & insider trading specifically related to digital assets; enhance public trust. This table highlights how the proposed bill specifically targets the unique challenges presented by digital assets within the context of governmental ethics and US crypto regulation . Challenges and Benefits of a Federal Employee Crypto Ban Like any significant legislation, this bill faces potential challenges and offers clear benefits. Potential Challenges: Definition Clarity: Precisely defining “digital assets” and “immediate family” in a way that is comprehensive yet enforceable can be complex. Enforcement: Monitoring compliance across a vast number of federal employees and their families would require robust systems and resources. How would non-disclosure or violations be detected and penalized? Scope: Should the ban apply to all federal employees, or only those in roles directly related to financial regulation or policy-making? A broad ban might be seen as overly restrictive for employees whose jobs have no connection to digital assets. Existing Holdings: What happens to digital assets already held by these individuals or their families? Would they be forced to sell, or would they be allowed to hold them without further trading? Potential Benefits: Enhanced Public Trust: By removing the potential for personal gain from policy decisions, the bill can significantly improve public confidence in the fairness and integrity of US crypto regulation . Reduced Conflicts of Interest: Directly addresses the ethical dilemmas posed by officials trading assets they regulate or legislate upon. Level Playing Field: Helps ensure that policy is made based on sound principles rather than potentially being influenced by personal financial interests. Sets a Precedent: Could set a standard for ethical conduct regarding novel asset classes in the future. The debate around these points will be crucial as the bill potentially moves through the legislative process. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What does this mean for the average person interested in crypto or involved in the industry? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on this bill and similar legislative efforts. The details of who is covered and what is prohibited matter. Understand the “Why”: Recognize that this isn’t necessarily an attack on crypto itself, but rather an effort to apply ethical standards to government officials within the context of this new asset class. Advocate for Clarity: If you are part of the crypto industry, engage with policymakers to ensure that any resulting legislation is clear, fair, and effectively addresses ethical concerns without unduly hindering legitimate activity or innovation. Monitor Market Reactions: While unlikely to cause massive immediate shifts, the passage of such a bill could be interpreted by some as a sign of increasing regulatory focus, which can influence market sentiment. The conversation around digital asset ethics and preventing crypto insider trading at the governmental level is vital for the long-term health and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market. This proposed bill is a significant step in that ongoing discussion. A Step Towards Ethical Governance in the Digital Age The proposed bill from Representative Ritchie Torres represents a clear effort to apply traditional ethical standards to the modern world of digital assets. By seeking to implement a comprehensive politician crypto ban and extend it to federal employee crypto holdings, the legislation aims to prevent conflicts of interest and potential crypto insider trading , thereby safeguarding public trust in US crypto regulation . While challenges related to definition and enforcement exist, the benefits of clearer ethical boundaries for those in power are undeniable. As this bill progresses, it will be a key indicator of how the U.S. government intends to navigate the intersection of public service, personal finance, and the burgeoning digital asset economy.

Core Scientific’s Q1 2025 results, shared on May 7, saw it more than double its $210 million net income from the year-ago quarter, while its total revenue reached $79.5 million, missing Zacks analysts' estimates by 8.11%, and falling from its $179.3 million in revenues for Q1 2024. The firm’s primary source of revenue came from $67.2 million in self-mining revenue , $3.8 million in hosted mining revenue, and $8.6 million in colocation, formerly listed as high-performance computing (HPC) hosting. Source: Core Scientific Core Scientific said its drop in Bitcoin ( BTC ) mined and revenue was due to the halving on April 20, 2024, when mining rewards were cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, and its operational shift to HPC hosting, primarily used for artificial intelligence. However, the losses were partially offset by a 74% increase in the average price of Bitcoin and a 33% decrease in power costs due to lower rates and usage. As part of its HPC hosting shift, Core Scientific inked a deal in February with AI startup CoreWeave for a $1.2 billion data center expansion. As a result, Core Scientific anticipates entering 2026 with annualized colocation revenue of $360 million. Inflection point for miners in AI shift Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan said in a statement that its first quarter was an “inflection point,” as the firm positioned itself at the “center of one of the most important shifts in modern computing,” as the demand for high-performance data infrastructure has accelerated.

Source: Google Finance In an August report, asset manager VanEck estimated that if publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies shifted 20% of their energy capacity to AI and HPC by 2027, they could increase additional yearly profits by $13.9 billion over 13 years. Riot Platforms appointed three new directors to its board in February, one of whom has experience converting Bitcoin mining assets toward HPC. Hive Digital, Hut 8 and Iris Energy converted part of their operations to HPC and AI last year, and TeraWulf sold its stake in a Bitcoin mining facility for $92 million in October, with the proceeds marked for hosting AI and building HPC data centers.

Ever feel like the world of traditional finance and central banks is miles away from the fast-paced crypto universe? Think again! Decisions made by institutions like the U.S. Federal Reserve can send significant ripples through all asset classes, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and your favorite altcoins. Right now, a key tool used by traders worldwide, the CME FedWatch tool, is flashing a very clear signal about the upcoming FOMC Meeting in May. According to the latest data, there’s an overwhelming probability – a staggering 97.7% chance – that the Fed will choose to keep Interest Rates exactly where they are. Only a tiny 2.3% chance is assigned to a modest 0.25% rate cut. But what does this high probability hold mean, and more importantly, what could be its Crypto Market Impact ? Decoding the CME FedWatch Tool: Your Window into Fed Expectations Before we dive deeper into the implications of this prediction, let’s quickly touch on what the CME FedWatch tool actually is. It’s not a crystal ball, but it’s pretty close when it comes to gauging market sentiment about the Federal Reserve ‘s next move on Interest Rates . The tool uses real-time data from CME Group’s Fed Funds futures contracts. These are financial instruments where traders essentially bet on the future level of the federal funds rate. By looking at the pricing of these contracts, the FedWatch tool calculates the market’s perceived probability of different rate outcomes at upcoming FOMC Meeting s. It’s a powerful snapshot of collective market expectation, providing valuable insight into how traders are positioning themselves. The May FOMC Meeting Prediction: Stability on the Horizon? The headline from the CME FedWatch tool is loud and clear for the May FOMC Meeting : Stability is the overwhelming expectation. Let’s break down the numbers reported: Probability of Rates Held Steady: 97.7% Probability of a 0.25% Rate Cut: 2.3% Probability of a 0.25% Rate Hike: 0.0% (Effectively zero) This data strongly suggests that the market has largely priced in a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains the current target range for the federal funds rate (which is currently 5.25% to 5.50%). This level has been in place since July 2023. What does ‘holding rates steady’ mean? It means the Fed isn’t making borrowing money cheaper or more expensive, at least not directly through this key policy rate. They are choosing to observe the current economic conditions and the impact of their previous rate hikes before making another move. Why is the Federal Reserve Leaning Towards a Hold? The Federal Reserve ‘s decisions on Interest Rates are guided by its dual mandate from Congress: to promote maximum employment and stable prices (low inflation). Several economic factors likely contribute to the current high probability of a hold according to the CME FedWatch : Stubborn Inflation: While inflation has come down significantly from its peak, recent data points (like the Consumer Price Index – CPI) have shown it’s not cooling as quickly as the Fed would like. This makes rate cuts less likely in the immediate future. Resilient Labor Market: The U.S. jobs market remains relatively strong, with low unemployment. A robust labor market can contribute to wage pressures, which can, in turn, fuel inflation. A strong economy gives the Fed less urgency to cut rates to stimulate growth. Economic Growth: The U.S. economy has shown surprising resilience. Stronger-than-expected growth means the economy can handle higher Interest Rates for longer without tipping into recession, reducing the need for stimulative cuts. Waiting for More Data: The Fed often prefers to see a consistent trend in economic data before making a policy shift. Holding rates allows them time to assess upcoming reports on inflation, employment, and consumer spending. These factors, among others, paint a picture where the Federal Reserve sees the current monetary policy stance as appropriate for now, justifying the high probability of a hold reflected in the CME FedWatch data. The Ripple Effect of Interest Rates: How Fed Policy Shapes Markets Understanding the Crypto Market Impact of Fed decisions requires first understanding how Interest Rates generally affect financial markets. Higher interest rates typically make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers. This can slow down economic activity. They also make less risky investments, like government bonds or savings accounts, more attractive compared to riskier assets. Conversely, lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. They also make riskier assets relatively more appealing as investors seek higher returns than those offered by low-yield safe investments. Traditional Markets: Stocks: Higher rates can negatively impact stock valuations as future earnings are discounted at a higher rate, and borrowing costs for companies increase. Lower rates generally support higher stock prices. Bonds: Bond prices typically move inversely to interest rates. When rates rise, the value of existing lower-yield bonds falls. When rates fall, existing higher-yield bonds become more valuable. U.S. Dollar: Higher interest rates can make the U.S. dollar more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields, potentially strengthening the dollar. Crucial Question: What Does a Fed Rate Hold Mean for the Crypto Market Impact? Now for the part most relevant to you: the potential Crypto Market Impact . The relationship between Interest Rates and crypto isn’t always direct or perfectly correlated, but there are clear mechanisms at play. Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as risk assets, similar to growth stocks or venture capital. When Interest Rates are high and rising, the cost of capital increases across the board. This can: Reduce Liquidity: Less cheap money flowing through the system can mean less capital available to flow into riskier assets like crypto. Increase Opportunity Cost: With higher yields available on safer investments (like Treasury bills), the relative appeal of volatile assets like crypto might decrease for some investors. Impact Tech/Growth Narratives: Many crypto projects are tied to technological innovation and growth narratives, which can be more sensitive to higher borrowing costs and tighter financial conditions. Given the CME FedWatch ‘s prediction of a hold, here’s how the 97.7% probability might influence the Crypto Market Impact : Potential Positives (or ‘Less Negative’): Stability is Priced In: A hold is the highly expected outcome. This means the market has likely already adjusted to the current rate environment. Surprises (like an unexpected hike) tend to cause more volatility than expected outcomes. Avoids Further Tightening: While not a cut, a hold means the Fed isn’t actively making conditions *more* restrictive right now. This avoids adding fresh downward pressure that a hike would likely cause. Focus Shifts to Future Cuts: With a hold expected now, market attention might increasingly turn to *when* the first rate cut might occur later in the year, which is generally seen as bullish for risk assets in the medium term. Potential Negatives (or ‘Continued Headwinds’): No Immediate Stimulus: A hold means no new influx of cheap money into the system, which is what a rate cut would provide. The current higher-rate environment continues to be a factor. Economic Uncertainty Lingers: The reason *why* the Fed is holding (persistent inflation, etc.) indicates underlying economic challenges that could still weigh on investor sentiment for risk assets. Market Could React to Nuances: While the rate decision itself might be a non-event if it’s a hold, the Fed’s statement and Chair Powell’s press conference could contain forward guidance or economic assessments that *do* surprise the market and trigger volatility in crypto. So, while the high probability of a hold suggests the immediate decision itself might not be a shocker for the crypto market, the context surrounding that decision – particularly the Fed’s commentary on inflation and future policy path – will be crucial. Traders will be listening intently for any hints about the timing of potential future rate cuts. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Based on the CME FedWatch outlook and the potential Crypto Market Impact : Expect the Expected (for the Decision): Don’t necessarily anticipate massive volatility *solely* from the rate decision itself if it’s the predicted hold. Focus on the Commentary: Pay close attention to the official FOMC statement released alongside the decision and, more importantly, Chair Powell’s subsequent press conference. Look for language regarding the economic outlook, inflation trends, and any hints about the future path of Interest Rates . Monitor Economic Data: The Fed is data-dependent. Keep an eye on upcoming inflation reports (CPI, PCE) and jobs data, as these will influence future Fed decisions and thus potential Crypto Market Impact later in the year. Risk Management: Regardless of the Fed’s decision, crypto remains a volatile asset class. Maintain a diversified portfolio and practice sound risk management based on your own financial situation and investment goals. In Summary: Navigating the Predicted Hold The latest CME FedWatch data paints a clear picture: the market is overwhelmingly confident (97.7% probability) that the Federal Reserve will keep Interest Rates unchanged at the upcoming May FOMC Meeting . This expectation is likely driven by persistent inflation and a resilient economy, giving the Fed room to maintain its current restrictive stance. For the crypto market, this predicted hold means the immediate environment of higher borrowing costs and tighter liquidity conditions is expected to continue. While the decision itself might not cause major waves if it aligns with expectations, the Fed’s accompanying commentary on the economy and future policy will be key drivers of market sentiment and potential Crypto Market Impact in the days and weeks following the meeting.

The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates. Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation. He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due to concerns over Trump’s trade policy. However, Powell said that “despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position.” In the days leading up to the announcement, data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicated that the futures market expected minimal odds of a rate cut . Powell said the unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is “at or near maximum employment.” The market expects the Fed to drop the Fed funds rate to 3.6% by the end of 2025. Bitcoin fell below $96,000 before retracing back above $98,000 just hours later on May 7. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped below $97,000 to $95,866 after Powell’s speech, but it shot up to tap $98,000 for the first time since Feb. 21 just hours later. Bitcoin momentum has been building, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index returning to “Greed” territory, and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posting inflows of almost $4.41 billion since March 26 . Related: Bitcoin price rallied 1,550% the last time the ‘BTC risk-off’ metric fell this low On March 9, network economist Timothy Peterson warned that if the Fed holds off on rate cuts in 2025, it may cause a broader market downturn, potentially dragging Bitcoin back toward $70,000.

44306050,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158274,1746673222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,OpenAI Launches Ambitious Global AI Partnerships for Infrastructure Growth,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-launches-ai-partnerships/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, where advancements in artificial intelligence are setting the pace, a significant move by a leading AI firm warrants attention, particularly for those tracking major shifts in the digital realm like cryptocurrency enthusiasts. OpenAI has announced a strategic initiative aimed at fostering global AI adoption and building essential infrastructure. This program signals a new era of collaboration between private AI companies and public entities, potentially reshaping the future of AI accessibility and development worldwide. The program, dubbed “OpenAI for Countries,” is designed to work directly with national governments to accelerate the creation of local AI capabilities and infrastructure. Understanding OpenAI for Countries and AI Infrastructure The core objective of the “OpenAI for Countries” program is straightforward yet ambitious: to enable OpenAI to better serve its international customers by establishing local foundations. This involves more than just offering software; it’s about laying the groundwork for AI to function effectively within diverse national contexts. A primary focus is the development of robust AI infrastructure . Building data centers: This is a critical component, requiring significant investment and technical expertise to handle the immense computational needs of AI models. Enhancing connectivity: Ensuring high-speed, reliable network access is vital for distributing AI services and processing data efficiently. Securing power supply: AI data centers consume vast amounts of energy, necessitating stable and sustainable power solutions. By partnering with governments, OpenAI aims to navigate the complexities of developing such infrastructure within different regulatory and environmental landscapes. This collaborative approach is expected to speed up deployment and tailor infrastructure to specific national requirements. The Role of Government Partnerships in AI Development Why are government partnerships central to this initiative? Governments possess unique resources and authority necessary for large-scale infrastructure projects. They can facilitate access to land, permits, and necessary utilities, and often play a key role in shaping national digital strategies. OpenAI’s program seeks to leverage these capabilities to achieve mutual goals. These partnerships extend beyond just physical infrastructure. Governments can assist in: Customizing OpenAI products: Tailoring models like ChatGPT for local languages, cultural nuances, and specific national use cases (e.g., public services, education, healthcare). Navigating regulations: Ensuring AI deployment complies with national data privacy laws, ethical guidelines, and security standards. Promoting adoption: Encouraging the use of AI across government agencies, educational institutions, and local industries. Funding for these projects will be a shared responsibility, with contributions coming from both OpenAI and the participating governments. This co-funding model underscores the commitment required from both sides to make these initiatives successful. Driving AI Development and Global Reach A stated goal of AI development through this program is to “spread democratic AI.” This phrase suggests an effort to promote Western AI models, particularly OpenAI’s, as alternatives to competitors, likely those from China. By establishing a local presence and customizing its offerings, OpenAI aims to make its technology more accessible, relevant, and appealing to countries globally. This strategic push has geopolitical implications, positioning AI technology as a tool of influence and a reflection of different technological philosophies. Connecting to Project Stargate: Expanding OpenAI’s Vision The “OpenAI for Countries” program appears closely linked to OpenAI’s rumored large-scale data center initiative, known as Project Stargate . Project Stargate is reportedly a massive undertaking aimed at building extensive data center capacity, potentially involving significant investment and partnerships, possibly including Microsoft. While initially focused on expanding infrastructure within the U.S., the “OpenAI for Countries” program suggests that Project Stargate’s ambitions extend internationally. It is plausible that the infrastructure built under Project Stargate could support the international projects in the “OpenAI for Countries” program, or that funding sources for Stargate might also contribute to the international expansion efforts. This integrated approach highlights OpenAI’s commitment to securing the vast computational resources needed to train and run increasingly powerful AI models on a global scale. Benefits and Challenges The program offers potential benefits: Accelerated AI adoption and integration in participating countries. Customized AI solutions better suited to local needs. Growth of local technological expertise and job creation. Increased global competition in the AI space. However, challenges exist: Navigating diverse national regulations and political landscapes. Securing substantial and consistent funding from governments. Addressing concerns about data sovereignty and privacy. Ensuring equitable access and preventing a digital divide within countries. Managing competition from other global AI providers. Conclusion OpenAI’s “OpenAI for Countries” program marks a significant strategic shift towards deep international engagement through direct partnerships with governments. By focusing on building local AI infrastructure and customizing its products, OpenAI aims to expand its global footprint, promote its vision of “democratic AI,” and potentially leverage large-scale initiatives like Project Stargate . This ambitious undertaking highlights the increasing importance of government partnerships in shaping the future of AI development and underscores the global race to build the necessary technological foundations for the AI era. The success of these initial 10 projects will likely provide valuable insights into the feasibility and impact of this collaborative model on the worldwide adoption of advanced AI technologies.

BNB Could Spike By 360% The path implies a gain of more than 360% from current levels and, crucially, situates the token in what Kendrick calls “a benchmark-like role” inside the wider crypto capital structure. “BNB has traded almost exactly in line with an unweighted basket of Bitcoin and Ethereum since May 2021 in terms of both returns and volatility,” Kendrick wrote. “We expect this relationship to continue to hold, driving the price from around $600 currently to $2,775 by end-2028.” Related Reading: BNB Textbook Support Rebound Sets The Stage for More Upside – See How Standard Chartered’s broader outlook is unabashedly bullish on the majors: Bitcoin is projected to reach $200,000 in 2025 and $500,000 in 2028, while Ethereum is pencilled in at $4,000 and $7,500 over the same horizons. When those forecasts are translated into cross-asset ratios, they reveal subtle shifts in market share. The BTC-BNB ratio—how many BNB one Bitcoin can buy—is expected to tick up from 157 in 2025 to 180 by 2027, then hold steady, implying that Bitcoin’s dollar appreciation is likely to outrun BNB’s. By contrast, the ETH-BNB ratio is seen slipping from 3.14 in 2025 to 2.70 in 2027, signalling that Ethereum may outperform BNB, but more gently than Bitcoin will. Kendrick acknowledges that BNB “may underperform Bitcoin and Ether both in real terms and as measured by market cap in circulation,” yet he contends that its deflationary tokenomics and deep linkage to the world’s largest centralized exchange “support its long-term value.” The research note scrutinises BNB Chain’s architecture. Its “proof-of-staked authority” model rotates just 45 validators every 24 hours—a sharp contrast to Ethereum’s million-plus validator set. Kendrick describes BNB Chain as “highly centralised relative to other chains,” adding that its developer activity has “stagnated” since the 2021 DeFi surge and now trails networks such as Avalanche and Ethereum. Related Reading: BNB Bulls Target $644 As Classic Chart Formation Emerges Even so, forthcoming technical milestones are expected to expand the ecosystem’s resilience. Kendrick cites the recently completed Pascal hard fork and the looming Maxwell upgrade, due in June, as examples of “incremental but meaningful” incentives for developers. On the demand side, the token’s fortunes remain tethered to Binance’s trading engine. Holders receive tiered fee discounts calculated on their token balance and 30-day volume—a mechanically enforced use-case that has so far “helped the BNB Chain retain activity even as competition from other ecosystems like Solana grows,” Kendrick notes. PancakeSwap, the dominant decentralised exchange on BNB Chain, amplifies that liquidity loop. Meanwhile, regular token burns, coupled with the fixed-limit supply, underpin a structural deflation that Standard Chartered says justifies the premium BNB commands on its market-cap-to-GDP valuation screen—currently “rich” by the bank’s preferred metric. At press time, BNB traded at $605.

The Federal Reserve , specifically its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), just announced a significant decision regarding the Fed Interest Rate . In a move many anticipated but still carries weight, the benchmark interest rate has been frozen. What does this mean for the economy, and more importantly, what could be the Crypto Market Impact ? Despite a backdrop of seemingly solid economic indicators, the central bank opted for a pause rather than another hike. This decision wasn’t made lightly and comes with careful consideration of the current Economic Outlook and incoming Inflation Data . Why Did the Federal Reserve Freeze the Fed Interest Rate? The official statement from the FOMC provides insight into their thinking. While recent months have shown a stable, low unemployment rate and a resilient labor market, the persistent issue of high inflation remains a concern. This creates a complex picture for policymakers. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors influencing the Federal Reserve’s decision: Stable Labor Market: The unemployment rate has held steady at a low level, and job growth has been consistent, indicating underlying economic strength. Stubborn Inflation: Despite previous rate hikes, inflation remains above the Fed’s target, eroding purchasing power. Increased Uncertainty: The FOMC statement explicitly noted a rise in uncertainty regarding the future Economic Outlook . This includes concerns about both the risk of inflation staying high and the potential for increased unemployment. This pause signals a shift from a clear tightening bias to a more data-dependent approach. The Fed will now take more time to assess how past rate hikes are affecting the economy before making further adjustments. Understanding the Economic Outlook and Inflation Data The economic landscape is giving mixed signals. On one hand, consumer spending and business investment show some resilience. On the other hand, the full impact of the rapid rate hikes over the past year is still filtering through the system. The lag effect of monetary policy means that the economy might still slow down considerably in the coming months. The Inflation Data is particularly crucial. While headline inflation has cooled somewhat, core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices) has been stickier. The Fed needs to see clear evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards its 2% target before it can consider cutting rates. The increased uncertainty mentioned by the Federal Reserve stems from various factors, including global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and the unpredictable nature of how inflation will evolve. This complex Economic Outlook makes forecasting difficult for everyone, including investors. What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? This is the question on every crypto investor’s mind. How does the Fed Interest Rate decision influence Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader digital asset space? Historically, periods of aggressive rate hikes have often correlated with downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Higher interest rates make traditional savings and bonds more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from speculative investments like crypto. However, a pause could be interpreted in different ways: Potential Positive: Some might see the pause as a signal that the tightening cycle is nearing its end, potentially leading to increased liquidity in financial markets. More liquidity could flow into risk assets like crypto. Potential Negative: Others might view the pause as an acknowledgment that the economy is weakening significantly, increasing the risk of a recession. A recession could lead to broader market sell-offs, affecting crypto. Volatility: The uncertainty highlighted by the Fed is likely to translate into continued volatility across all markets, including crypto. Price swings could be more pronounced as markets react to every piece of new Inflation Data and economic news. The Crypto Market Impact will ultimately depend on how the economic narrative unfolds from here. Will inflation cool rapidly, allowing the Fed to consider cuts sooner? Or will the economy weaken significantly, leading to recession fears dominating the narrative? Challenges and Risks Highlighted by the Fed The FOMC statement didn’t just announce a pause; it also pointed to rising risks. Specifically, they highlighted that the risks of both high unemployment and high inflation have increased. This is a delicate balancing act for the Federal Reserve . Managing the Economic Outlook involves navigating these dual risks. Aggressively fighting inflation with higher rates could trigger a sharp rise in unemployment. Conversely, easing policy too soon to support employment could allow inflation to become entrenched. These macroeconomic risks are fundamental drivers of market sentiment. Investors in the crypto space need to be aware that the broader economic environment, shaped by the Federal Reserve’s actions and the resulting Inflation Data and employment figures, will continue to play a significant role in crypto price movements. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the current climate of uncertainty following the Fed Interest Rate decision, what steps can crypto investors consider? Firstly, stay informed. Keep a close eye on future Inflation Data , employment reports, and subsequent statements from the Federal Reserve . These will provide clues about the likely direction of monetary policy. Secondly, consider your risk tolerance. The increased uncertainty in the Economic Outlook means that market volatility is likely to persist. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with how much risk you are comfortable taking. Thirdly, think long-term. While short-term price movements are influenced by macro events like the Fed Interest Rate decision, the long-term potential of blockchain technology and specific crypto projects is a separate consideration. Dollar-cost averaging can be a strategy to navigate volatile periods. Finally, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different crypto assets and potentially other asset classes can help mitigate risk. Compelling Summary: Navigating the Pause The Federal Reserve’s decision to freeze the Fed Interest Rate marks a pivotal moment. It reflects a complex Economic Outlook where a strong labor market coexists with persistent high inflation and rising uncertainty. The central bank is now in a wait-and-see mode, heavily reliant on future Inflation Data and other economic indicators. For the crypto market, this pause introduces both potential upside from hopes of peak rates and potential downside from increased recession risks. The Crypto Market Impact will be closely tied to how these conflicting forces play out. Staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective are crucial for navigating this uncertain period.

44306653,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158281,1746674415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Federal Reserve Holds Steady: What This Means for the Cryptocurrency Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-holds-interest-rates/,"The world of finance is constantly reacting to signals from major economic bodies, and few are watched as closely as the U.S. Federal Reserve . Recently, the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) made a decision that, while widely anticipated, carries significant weight for markets globally, including the volatile cryptocurrency market . What Did the Federal Reserve Decide on Interest Rates? In its latest meeting, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25% to 4.50%. This move was largely in line with market expectations, suggesting a period of holding steady after a series of aggressive rate hikes aimed at taming inflation. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key points from the announcement: Rate Stability: The federal funds rate remains unchanged, pausing the tightening cycle for now. Alignment with Expectations: The decision met the consensus view among economists and market participants. Focus on Data: The Fed reiterated that future decisions will depend on incoming economic data, particularly concerning inflation and employment. No Immediate Pivot: While rates are stable, this doesn’t necessarily signal an immediate pivot to rate cuts. The language suggests a readiness to adjust policy as needed. Understanding the Federal Reserve ‘s stance on interest rates is crucial because these rates influence borrowing costs across the entire economy, from mortgages to business loans. This, in turn, impacts consumer spending, investment, and overall economic growth. How Does the FOMC Influence the Cryptocurrency Market? The decisions made by the FOMC have a profound, albeit indirect, impact on the cryptocurrency market . Here’s why: Liquidity: Lower interest rates generally mean more liquidity in the financial system, as borrowing becomes cheaper. This can lead investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Conversely, higher rates tighten liquidity, making riskier assets less attractive. Investor Sentiment: The Fed’s outlook on the economy shapes investor confidence. A stable or optimistic outlook can encourage investment, while concerns about recession or persistent inflation can lead to risk aversion. Dollar Strength: Monetary policy decisions, particularly on rates, affect the strength of the U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes put downward pressure on assets like Bitcoin, which are often seen as alternative stores of value. Inflation Expectations: The Fed’s primary goal is price stability. How the market perceives the Fed’s ability to control inflation influences the narrative around assets like Bitcoin, which some view as an inflation hedge. The decision to hold rates steady, as announced by the FOMC , can be interpreted in several ways by the cryptocurrency market . On one hand, it removes the immediate pressure of another rate hike, which is generally seen as positive for risk assets. On the other hand, it signals that the Fed believes conditions still warrant keeping rates at restrictive levels to combat inflation, which isn’t necessarily bullish. Navigating the Cryptocurrency Market Amidst Monetary Policy Shifts The current phase of monetary policy , characterized by stable but elevated interest rates , presents both opportunities and challenges for participants in the cryptocurrency market . Benefits: Reduced Uncertainty: A predictable Fed decision removes one layer of market anxiety, potentially allowing other factors to drive crypto price action. Stable Macro Backdrop (for now): A pause in rate hikes suggests the Fed is comfortable with the current trajectory, offering a degree of stability in the macroeconomic environment compared to periods of aggressive tightening. Challenges: Continued Tight Conditions: Rates remain high, meaning the cost of capital is still elevated. This can constrain growth in speculative assets and potentially impact crypto-related businesses relying on financing. Data Dependency: The Fed’s future moves are explicitly tied to data. Any negative surprises on inflation or employment could quickly shift the sentiment and policy outlook. Risk-Off Sentiment Lurking: Despite the pause, the underlying economic conditions that led to high rates (inflation) are still being monitored. A resurgence of inflation fears could trigger a return to risk-off behavior. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Pay close attention to future Fed announcements, press conferences, and economic projections (like the dot plot). Monitor Key Data: Keep an eye on inflation reports (CPI, PCE), employment data, and GDP figures, as these will heavily influence the Fed’s next steps. Understand Correlations: Be aware that while crypto has unique drivers, it is not immune to global macroeconomic forces and shifts in monetary policy . Manage Risk: Given the ongoing uncertainty and data dependency, maintaining a disciplined risk management strategy is crucial. The relationship between the Federal Reserve ‘s actions and the cryptocurrency market is complex and constantly evolving. While crypto enthusiasts often focus on technological advancements and adoption, ignoring the broader economic context set by institutions like the FOMC would be unwise. The Role of Monetary Policy in a Digital Age Monetary policy , traditionally focused on managing fiat currencies and banking systems, now operates in an environment where digital assets like cryptocurrencies exist. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve , are increasingly considering the implications of digital currencies, stablecoins, and the broader crypto ecosystem. While the direct tools of monetary policy (like setting interest rates ) primarily target the traditional financial system, their effects ripple outward. The liquidity, risk appetite, and inflation expectations influenced by the Fed’s decisions inevitably spill over into the crypto space. As the crypto market matures and becomes more integrated with traditional finance, this relationship is likely to strengthen. The Fed’s decision to hold rates steady can be seen as a moment of cautious observation. They are likely waiting to see the full effects of previous hikes on inflation and the economy before making their next move. This period of stability in monetary policy could provide a window for the cryptocurrency market to find its footing based on its own fundamentals, but it remains susceptible to shifts in the macro winds. Conclusion: Navigating the Macro Currents The Federal Reserve ‘s decision to keep interest rates unchanged was a non-event in terms of surprise, but a significant signal regarding the current state of monetary policy . The FOMC is in a holding pattern, balancing the need to combat inflation with the risks to economic growth. For the cryptocurrency market , this means the immediate headwind of rising rates has paused, but the broader environment of relatively tight liquidity and data dependency persists. Understanding the nuances of the Federal Reserve ‘s communications and monitoring key economic indicators is essential for anyone navigating the digital asset space. While crypto’s long-term potential is driven by innovation and adoption, its short-to-medium term trajectory will likely remain influenced by the powerful currents of global monetary policy .

Both Arbitrum, a blockchain overlaid on Ethereum, and Solana have been under consideration for the collaboration, though discussions are still ongoing. This move to offer tokenized US securities aligns with a broader trend in the financial industry. As global institutions explore blockchain’s potential, they see an opportunity to cut costs tied to traditional trading infrastructure while benefiting from greater transparency and standardization.

This will allow the company to expand its services within the EU to include stock trading. In addition, Robinhood is in the process of closing a deal to acquire crypto exchange Bitstamp , which would enable the company to offer crypto-linked derivatives under Bitstamp’s MiFID multilateral trading facility license. Despite Crypto Growth, Robinhood Aims to Broaden Revenue Sources The company has enjoyed strong financial performance, with a 50% jump in revenue for the first quarter of the year . A big chunk of this growth came from its cryptocurrency business, driven by a surge in trading volumes as investors sought to hedge against market volatility. As a result, the platform’s profits more than doubled, surpassing analysts’ expectations. Despite its reliance on crypto for now, CEO Vlad Tenev said that Robinhood is working to diversify its business. The company plans to reduce its dependence on crypto transaction volumes over time. “We’re focused on diversifying the business outside of crypto,” Tenev explained during the earnings call. “This will make us less reliant on crypto transaction volumes in the future.” With its latest move, Robinhood aims to tap into the growing interest in blockchain-based financial products. The company’s European expansion, which is backed by Lithuania’s regulatory framework, could serve as a crucial stepping stone in its broader international growth strategy. However, the platform’s success will hinge on its ability to attract a substantial user base and navigate evolving market dynamics in the EU.

Leaked Emails Expose 2021 Doubts About Ripple,https://coinpedia.org/news/did-the-sec-fear-xrps-collapse-leaked-emails-expose-2021-doubts-about-ripple/,"The post Did the SEC Fear XRP’s Collapse? Leaked Emails Expose 2021 Doubts About Ripple appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s long legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may have wrapped up in the company’s favor, but newly released documents show how deeply the agency once worried about the future of XRP. According to a fresh batch of files obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Coinbase, SEC officials were actively debating the stability and security classification of various crypto assets back in 2021. Among them, XRP was very much on their radar. As reported by The Block, in one internal email, SEC officials questioned what might happen if Ripple, the company behind XRP, suddenly “walked away” or “disappeared.” The agency appeared concerned about what risks could surface for the XRP blockchain in such a scenario — a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse into how regulators were viewing crypto projects under pressure. At the time, the SEC had already kicked off a major lawsuit against Ripple, accusing it of operating illegally by selling XRP as an unregistered security. While Ripple has since emerged victorious from that battle — even winning back some of the penalties it had previously paid — these newly uncovered emails show just how uncertain regulators were about the decentralization and resilience of the XRP network itself. The revelations come amid a broader series of disclosures this week from Coinbase, which published dozens of SEC communications related to crypto oversight as part of its own ongoing legal standoff with the agency. This isn’t the first time SEC deliberations on crypto assets have made headlines.

A report from the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert highlighted a massive XRP transfer , specifically 300,000,000 tokens, moved directly from Ripple’s wallets to an address currently identified only as ‘unknown’. Valued at approximately $634 million at the time of the transaction, this large XRP transaction has naturally captured the attention of market observers, analysts, and the broader XRP community. Such substantial movements often trigger speculation about their purpose and potential impact on the market dynamics of XRP. What Did the Whale Alert Report Detail? According to the alert disseminated by Whale Alert, a service renowned for tracking significant cryptocurrency movements, the transaction originated from an address known to be associated with Ripple . The destination was flagged as an ‘unknown wallet’. While the term ‘unknown wallet’ might sound mysterious, it simply means the address hasn’t been publicly identified or linked to a specific entity like an exchange or a known company wallet through available blockchain data or public declarations. Here are the key details of the reported transaction: Amount: 300,000,000 XRP Source: Ripple wallet Destination: Unknown wallet Approximate USD Value: $634,000,000 (at the time of transfer) Reporting Service: Whale Alert This isn’t the first time Whale Alert has flagged large movements involving Ripple or XRP, but the sheer size of this particular transfer makes it noteworthy. Large transactions are often scrutinized because they can potentially signal impending activity like sales, distribution, or strategic shifts by major holders or entities like Ripple. Why Does a Large XRP Transfer from Ripple Matter? Movements of this magnitude are significant for several reasons, particularly when they originate from Ripple , a company that holds a substantial amount of the total XRP supply. Here’s why this large XRP transaction is under the spotlight: 1. Potential Market Impact: A transfer of 300 million XRP could potentially signal preparation for a sale. If these tokens are intended for distribution on exchanges or through over-the-counter (OTC) deals, it could introduce selling pressure on the market, affecting XRP’s price. However, it’s crucial to remember that a transfer doesn’t automatically mean a sale is imminent or guaranteed. 2. Ripple’s Strategy: Ripple uses XRP for various purposes, including its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, institutional sales, and ecosystem development initiatives. A large transfer could be related to funding an ODL corridor, supplying an institutional partner, or moving funds for operational purposes. Understanding Ripple’s intent behind such a move is key to interpreting its potential implications. 3. Whale Activity: While the destination is an ‘unknown wallet’, large transfers are often associated with ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Tracking whale movements is a common practice among traders and analysts trying to anticipate market trends. Even if the destination is another Ripple-controlled address, it signifies a strategic internal movement. 4. Transparency vs. Ambiguity: The ‘unknown wallet’ designation adds a layer of ambiguity. While blockchain provides transparency regarding the transaction itself (amount, source, destination address), the identity and purpose of the receiving wallet remain undisclosed unless the owner voluntarily reveals themselves or the address is later linked to a known entity. Possible Reasons Behind the 300M XRP Transfer Without an official statement from Ripple, any interpretation of this XRP transfer is speculative. However, based on Ripple’s known activities and the nature of large blockchain transactions, several possibilities emerge: Funding On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): Ripple’s ODL service uses XRP to facilitate cross-border payments. Large amounts of XRP are often moved to exchanges or liquidity providers to ensure sufficient supply for these operations. This is a plausible explanation for a significant outbound transfer from Ripple. Institutional Sales or Distribution: Ripple engages in private sales of XRP to institutions and partners. The transfer could be the movement of tokens destined for such a sale or a planned distribution as part of a business agreement. Internal Treasury Management: Ripple manages vast reserves of XRP. The transfer could simply be an internal reorganization of funds between different Ripple-controlled wallets for security, operational efficiency, or allocation to specific departments or initiatives. Ecosystem Development: Ripple supports various projects and developers building on the XRP Ledger. The transfer might be related to funding grants, investments, or partnerships aimed at expanding the XRP ecosystem. Preparation for Exchange Deposit: Less likely to an ‘unknown’ address unless it’s a new cold storage for an exchange, but large transfers can sometimes precede deposits onto exchanges, often interpreted as preparation for selling. However, moving directly from Ripple to an unknown wallet doesn’t fit the typical pattern of exchange deposits reported by Whale Alert, which usually identify the exchange. It’s important to differentiate between XRP released from escrow and XRP moved from Ripple’s operational wallets. While monthly escrow releases are a known source of XRP entering circulation, this particular transaction was reported as originating directly from a Ripple wallet, suggesting it was part of their actively managed holdings. How Does This Relate to Ripple’s Overall XRP Strategy? Ripple holds a significant portion of the total XRP supply, much of which is locked in escrow. The company strategically releases and utilizes XRP for various purposes aimed at promoting the adoption and utility of the XRP Ledger and the XRP token. These purposes include: Developing the XRP Ledger: Funding core development and improvements. Promoting ODL: Providing liquidity for cross-border payments. Incentivizing Ecosystem Growth: Supporting dApp development, NFTs, and other use cases. Institutional Engagement: Selling XRP to financial institutions and corporate partners. A large XRP transaction like the one reported by Whale Alert is typically aligned with one or more of these strategic pillars. It signifies active management of their reserves and execution of their business plan. The market often watches these movements closely for clues about Ripple’s near-term intentions and the health of its business operations. Keeping Tabs: The Role of Whale Alert and Blockchain Trackers Services like Whale Alert play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing transparency into large on-chain movements. By automatically detecting and reporting transactions exceeding a certain threshold, they enable market participants to stay informed about significant shifts in token holdings and flows. While these alerts don’t provide the ‘why’ behind a transaction, they provide the ‘what, when, and how much’, allowing the community to analyze and speculate on the potential implications. For an asset like XRP , with a significant portion held by a single entity like Ripple, tracking these movements is particularly relevant for understanding supply dynamics and potential market events. Conclusion: Awaiting Clarity on the Massive XRP Transfer The movement of 300 million XRP from Ripple to an unknown wallet, as reported by Whale Alert, is a significant event by volume and value. While the transaction itself is confirmed on the blockchain, the precise reason behind this large XRP transaction remains undisclosed. It could be linked to Ripple’s strategic business operations, such as funding ODL corridors, executing an institutional sale, or simply managing internal treasury movements. Until Ripple provides an official explanation, the crypto community will continue to analyze and speculate on the purpose and potential market effects of this substantial XRP transfer . Events like these underscore the importance of on-chain monitoring in the transparent yet often mysterious world of cryptocurrency.

But buyers emerged at around $94,000, halting the decline and allowing BTC to recover fast. Then, the coin started rising again, piercing through pivotal levels that had earlier served as resistance. Related Reading: Tether’s $1 Billion Mint Powers Tron — Is A Breakout Brewing? Key Resistance Levels Broken As Bulls Step In Bitcoin didn’t remain down for long. It broke above $94,600 and even broke a bearish trendline at around $94,755. That opened the doors for another break higher. It continued to breach above $96,500 and is now trading inching closer to the $97k level. The 100-hour Simple Moving Average is also below the current price, which is generally a bullish indicator for momentum. Currently, traders are waiting to see whether BTC will break above $97,000. If that occurs, the next target might be $98,800 or even $100,000. This price level has been a top target for most traders in the last few months. Whales Add Over 81,000 BTC In Six Weeks Large holders, or whales, are gaining confidence. Wallets that hold between 10 and 10,000 BTC have accumulated more than 81k BTC in the last six weeks. Such wallets tend to belong to institutions or long-term investors who prefer to buy when prices are relatively stable or low. 🐳 As May progresses, Bitcoin’s key stakeholders are mostly moving in the right direction if you’re rooting for $100K $BTC in the near future.

The difference in behavior between large and small holders is catching attention. In the past, similar trends have been followed by strong price surges. $734M In Shorts Wiped Out Many short sellers who were making bets on lower prices got caught out around $95,600. Coinglass analytics indicate that short positions exceeding $730 million were swept out when Bitcoin broke above that level. It had been resistance for days. But once buyers retook it, the price exploded and traded as high as $97,200. That move lifted morale among bullish traders and generated fresh momentum within the market. Further liquidations might occur if BTC continues to climb. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Gain Over $300 Billion From Companies In Next 5 Years, Analysts Say Derivatives Reflect Bulls in Charge The derivatives market is likewise turning bullish. Coinglass indicates long positions come out at approximately $2.14 billion, versus $2 billion in short positions. That discrepancy won’t be gigantic, but it’s sufficient to tip the balance towards the bulls. If Bitcoin cannot remain above $97,750, then it could fall slightly. Support is approximately $96,650. If that gives way, then it could move down to $95,400 or $95,200. Further support awaits at $94,400 and then $93,100. But for now, the sentiment is upbeat, and everyone is watching that $100K barrier.

This marks a departure from earlier resistance and comes as part of an updated policy to facilitate banks’ involvement in crypto-asset custody services. The OCC’s clarification, released on Wednesday, extends the scope of services banks can provide, including the ability to outsource crypto custody and execution services to third parties. However, these services must meet the OCC’s stringent safety and soundness criteria to ensure proper oversight and risk management. OCC-regulated banks may buy and sell assets held in custody and are permitted to outsource bank-permissible crypto-asset activities, including custody and execution services. https://t.co/0ScQdgNaS6 pic.twitter.com/J5dEkx4WUL — OCC (@USOCC) May 7, 2025 New OCC Regulations Allow Banks to Act as Custodians for Digital Assets This shift is in line with the OCC’s previous guidance, which recognized that crypto-asset custody is an extension of traditional banking activities. Banks, under this new framework, can act as custodians of digital assets, offering services such as exchange facilitation, trade execution and asset management. Additionally, they may use sub-custodians to handle these tasks, provided there are adequate internal controls in place. The move is a big step towards mainstreaming cryptocurrency within the banking sector. By offering a regulatory framework for crypto custody, the OCC aims to integrate digital assets into traditional banking services, thus ensuring both innovation and protection for customers. With these clarifications, the OCC has further enabled national banks to operate within the evolving digital asset market, ensuring that they remain compliant with legal and financial regulations while meeting customer demands. Banks Set to Expand Crypto Services Under Clearer Regulatory Oversight This development comes as the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, with increasing pressure to create clear guidelines for traditional financial institutions. For banks, this means a broader role in managing crypto assets, potentially enhancing their revenue streams while adhering to the required risk management practices. The regulatory backing gives them the confidence to explore crypto services without fear of regulatory uncertainty, fostering a safer and more integrated approach to crypto-asset transactions. Despite earlier hesitations, the OCC’s decision signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency within the mainstream financial system. However, the full implementation of these policies will depend on how effectively banks can balance innovation with the safeguards required to protect investors and maintain financial stability.

According to CNBC , Bailey has already secured $300m in funding for the venture, while The Information reported that he is still seeking the funds through private equity and convertible debt. This funding package is expected to consist of $200m in equity and $100m in convertible debt, with plans to use the capital for acquisitions and investments. David Bailey, who advised Trump on crypto policy, is raising $300M to launch a publicly traded bitcoin investment firm, aiming to follow the successful path of Strategy.

As a result, Bailey’s company, Nakamoto, will merge with an existing Nasdaq-listed firm. The merger announcement is expected early next week. Following that, the company’s public listing is anticipated later this summer. Bailey’s company, named after the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, will focus on acquiring and holding Bitcoin. This strategy will provide a new avenue for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. Moreover, Nakamoto plans to expand globally. Specifically, it aims to invest in companies across countries like Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa. Nakamoto Attracts High-Profile Investors and Advisory Board to Back Bitcoin Strategy The venture has already attracted a lineup of prominent investors. It will also feature a high-profile advisory board. Bitcoin investment firms like Nakamoto raise significant capital through a combination of equity and debt. This capital is used to buy and hold Bitcoin, offering investors an indirect way to bet on the asset’s price fluctuations. Bailey’s approach is aligned with the strategy popularized by Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). In 2020, Saylor began converting the company’s cash reserves into Bitcoin. This shift transformed MicroStrategy into a Bitcoin holding company. As a result, its stock price soared alongside Bitcoin’s value. Today, MicroStrategy ranks among the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. This sets the stage for Nakamoto to follow suit and capitalize on the growing demand for Bitcoin investment opportunities.

The deal, set to be revealed early morning during a press event inside the Oval, would be the first confirmed agreement since Trump hit dozens of US trading partners with broad tariffs. The president didn’t name the country in his Wednesday night post, but the announcement confirms that Britain is the first. Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. THE FIRST OF MANY!!!” That’s all the White House has said so far. Trump reboots trade strategy with UK at the front No other country has landed a deal yet. Britain now becomes the first, and the stakes are high. It’s still not clear if the deal is completely finalized or if Thursday’s announcement is just the start of formal talks. Either way, this is the first public outcome of Trump’s economic pressure tactics. The UK has been chasing this for years. After Brexit, it lost easy access to European markets and needed new trade routes. A deal with the US was a top priority, but nothing came from the talks under Joe Biden. Things started moving again this year when Prime Minister Keir Starmer met Trump in February at the White House, bringing a formal invite from King Charles III for Trump to make another state visit to Britain. Trump’s interest isn’t new. His team tried to negotiate with the UK in his first term, but never closed the deal. Since getting back in office, Trump’s trade officials have been chasing agreements with other countries like India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. None of those have gone public yet. But on Tuesday, Trump made clear he isn’t in a rush. “We don’t have to sign deals,” he said. “We could sign 25 deals right now, Howard, if we wanted to. They have to sign deals with us.” He was talking to Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary. This trade move is different from the long, full-scope agreements that go through Congress. Those take more than a year and cover nearly every industry. Trump’s approach leans toward smaller, quick-to-announce agreements. These don’t require votes in Washington. In his first term, Trump replaced NAFTA, reworked a deal with South Korea, and signed a bunch of what he called “mini-deals,” targeting just a few sectors like farm goods or tech taxes. Even as the UK was closing this new deal with the US, it also signed a trade pact with India on Tuesday. That agreement lowers tariffs between the two and gives British companies better access to India’s insurance and banking sectors. It followed nearly three years of talks. British officials are also still negotiating with the European Union, meaning the country is moving on multiple fronts to build stronger trade ties after Brexit left it exposed. But the deal with Trump might be the most high-profile one yet — not because of the details, but because of what it says politically.

44310536,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158319,1746681657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Anthropic Unveils Powerful Claude AI Web Search API for Developers,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anthropic-claude-web-search/,"In the fast-evolving world where artificial intelligence intersects with technology and even touches on areas relevant to cryptocurrency markets – particularly concerning data analysis and automation – staying updated is key. A significant development comes from Anthropic, which has just rolled out a new API that grants its Claude AI models the capability to search the web. Anthropic Enhances Claude AI with Real-Time Data Anthropic announced the launch of an API designed to allow developers to integrate web search functionality directly into applications powered by their Claude AI models. This means Claude can now access and process current information from the internet, moving beyond its pre-trained knowledge cut-off date. According to Anthropic, this enhancement is a direct response to the growing need for AI models to provide users with the most up-to-date, real-world data. This move aligns with a broader trend among AI companies seeking to augment their models’ capabilities to attract a wider range of users and use cases. Just last week, Anthropic also introduced a tool for connecting applications to Claude and expanded its “deep research” feature, enabling Claude to search enterprise accounts, websites, and other specific data sources. What the Web Search API Means for Developers The introduction of the web search API is a game-changer for developers building applications with Claude. Previously, getting current information into a Claude-powered app required developers to manage their own data pipelines or search infrastructure. With this new API, that complexity is significantly reduced. Here’s how it works when the web search feature is enabled via the API: Claude uses its reasoning abilities to determine if a user’s request would benefit from up-to-date or specialized web information. If a web search is deemed necessary, Claude automatically generates search queries. It retrieves search results, analyzes the content, and synthesizes an answer. Crucially, Claude provides citations for the information it retrieves from the web. The model can refine its search strategy, conducting multiple searches based on previous results to get a more comprehensive understanding. Developers also have granular control over the feature. They can customize search behavior, specify domains that Claude is allowed or not allowed to search, and even enable or prohibit web search use at an organizational level. Integrating Web Search into AI Models The ability to integrate web search into AI models like Claude is a significant step towards creating more dynamic and reliable AI assistants. For instance, Anthropic is already bringing this capability to Claude Code, its tool designed to assist developers with coding tasks. With web search enabled, Claude Code can access the latest API documentation, technical articles, and information on development libraries and tools, ensuring it provides assistance based on current standards and practices. This enhancement allows AI models to tackle tasks that require knowledge of recent events, current market data (potentially relevant for crypto analysis), or rapidly changing technical specifications, making them more valuable in a wider array of applications. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Claude AI and its Ecosystem Anthropic’s launch of the web search API for Claude AI is a notable development that empowers developers to build more sophisticated and informed applications. By giving Claude the ability to access and process real-time information from the web, Anthropic is enhancing the model’s utility and expanding the possibilities for its use across various industries. This move underscores the ongoing innovation in the AI space, constantly pushing the boundaries of what these powerful models can achieve.

33767162,[object Object],1746682222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Crypto Analyst Says “Altseason Is Dawning” As Bitcoin Dominance Reaches HTF Resistance, What To Expect",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-dominance-at-htf-barrier/,"The Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) has made an unexpected climb into a historically strong resistance zone, now hovering near the 64.7% mark in the High Time Frame (HTF). This sharp move has sparked considerable interest among analysts and traders, with key technical indicators and chart formations suggesting a potential turning point that could usher in the long-awaited 2025 altcoin season . Bitcoin Dominance Faces HTF Resistance The Bitcoin Dominance has been steadily climbing for almost 3 years, underscoring the flagship cryptocurrency’s enduring influence over the broader market. Notably, crypto analyst Gert van Lagen has unveiled an unexpected uptick in BTC.D. The analyst shared a technical chart analysis of Bitcoin Dominance, highlighting a confluence of bearish signals that mirror the 2021 market cycle — a period that led to a dramatic shift in capital from BTC to alternative cryptocurrencies. The analyst has pointed out that Bitcoin Dominance has now reached a key HTF resistance zone of around 64%-76 %. The current chart also shows a rising wedge pattern, a typical indicator of market exhaustion before a potential trend reversal. This crucial wedge pattern has formed within the same HTF resistance zone where BTC.D topped out in past cycles, including the 2021 peak. Adding to the bearish outlook, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is flashing a regular bearish divergence. While Bitcoin Dominance is pushing higher, RSI is failing to do the same, indicating weakening momentum. A similar setup occurred in 2021, where exaggerated bearish divergence foreshadowed the eventual breakdown of BTC.D and paved the way for an altseason . If history is any guide, the market could be approaching another inflection point. As in the last cycle, Lagen believes that the actual top in Bitcoin Dominance might not be confirmed until the uptrend structure breaks — a move that would likely shift attention to altcoins. Expanding on the Bitcoin Dominance recent rise, other analysts like Ijaz Awan on X disclosed that BTC.D is currently approaching a major resistance zone between 71.38% and 73.06%. The analyst highlights that this area has been a strong turning point in the past , acting as a top back in 2017, 2019 and 2021. With Bitcoin Dominance nearing past peaks, the analyst predicts a potential start of the altcoin season. Is The Altcoin Season Really Coming? In his post, Lagen concluded his analysis by stating that the altcoin season is dawning. Other prominent analysts share this view, believing that Bitcoin’s Dominance serves as a key indicator of an impending altcoin season. Notably, Karman Asghar, a crypto trader and analyst, confirmed in an X post that a new altcoin season is brewing in 2025 as the Bitcoin Dominance chart flashes familiar warning signs. The analyst shared two parallel charts, comparing similar Bitcoin Dominance in 2021 and 2025 . Both charts displayed BTC.D forming a double top, with a clear bearish RSI divergence. While the bearish RSI divergence isn’t a guaranteed trigger, its recurrence combined with historical market behaviour gives credibility to the idea that the market may be on the brink of another major altcoin season.",Altcoins|Altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin Season|altcoins|Altcoins news|altseason|bitcoin|Bitcoin dominance|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTC.D|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Gert Van Lagen|High Time Frame|HTF Resistance|Ijaz Awan|relative strength index|RSI|RSI Divergence,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-08 05:30:22
44310887,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158320,1746682244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breakthrough AI Drug Evaluation: OpenAI and FDA Discuss Speeding Approvals,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-fda-ai-evaluation/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology and health, a significant discussion is underway that could impact how quickly new treatments reach patients. OpenAI, a leader in artificial intelligence research, is reportedly in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the potential use of AI for AI drug evaluation . For those following the intersection of tech and industry, this development signals a growing interest in leveraging advanced AI capabilities in highly regulated sectors like healthcare. Why is AI Drug Evaluation a Hot Topic? Traditional drug development is a notoriously lengthy and expensive process. Bringing a new drug from initial research to market can often take over a decade. A significant portion of this timeline is dedicated to clinical trials and the subsequent regulatory review and evaluation by bodies like the FDA. Accelerating this latter phase, the evaluation process, could dramatically reduce the time patients wait for potentially life-saving therapies. This is where AI drug evaluation comes into play. AI models have the potential to process and analyze vast amounts of complex data – from clinical trial results to patient data and scientific literature – far faster than human reviewers alone. The goal isn’t to replace human expertise but to augment it, providing insights and flagging critical information more efficiently. What’s Happening Between OpenAI FDA ? Reports indicate that OpenAI officials have met with the FDA to explore how the agency could utilize AI to expedite the drug evaluation timeline. While drug development involves many stages where AI could theoretically be applied (like drug discovery or trial design), these discussions reportedly focus on accelerating the final stages of the process – the regulatory review itself. According to sources, the talks have included discussions around a project potentially named ‘cderGPT’. This name suggests an AI tool specifically designed for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the division within the FDA responsible for regulating prescription and over-the-counter drugs in the U.S. There were also unconfirmed reports mentioning associates from Elon Musk’s DOGE being part of the talks. Given ‘DOGE’ typically refers to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, this detail is likely a misunderstanding or typo and should be treated with caution. Discussions would more plausibly involve individuals associated with Musk’s AI or health-focused ventures like xAI or Neuralink, if true. The Potential Impact on Drug Development Speed The primary objective of this potential collaboration is to increase drug development speed , specifically at the regulatory bottleneck. Imagine the ability to shave months or even years off the evaluation period for critical medications. This could mean faster access for patients to treatments for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s, or rare genetic conditions. Potential benefits of integrating AI into FDA evaluation include: Faster processing of application documents. Improved identification of safety signals or efficacy trends in trial data. More efficient comparison of new drugs to existing treatments. Reducing the administrative burden on human reviewers. However, it’s crucial to understand that AI is not a magic bullet. While it can accelerate data processing, the final decision-making and nuanced evaluation require human judgment and expertise. Challenges and Considerations for AI in Healthcare Regulation While the promise of faster evaluations is exciting, significant challenges remain when integrating AI in healthcare regulation, particularly at an agency like the FDA: AI Reliability and ‘Black Box’ Problem: AI models, especially complex deep learning systems, can sometimes arrive at conclusions through processes that are not easily understood or explained (the ‘black box’ issue). For regulatory decisions impacting public health, transparency and explainability are paramount. Validation and Trust: How can the FDA validate that an AI tool is consistently accurate, unbiased, and reliable when evaluating sensitive drug data? Building trust in AI outputs is essential before widespread adoption. Data Privacy and Security: Handling vast amounts of confidential clinical trial data requires robust security measures. Regulatory Frameworks: Existing regulatory frameworks were not designed with advanced AI in mind. New guidelines and standards will be needed to govern the use of AI in this context. Addressing these challenges will require close collaboration between AI developers, regulatory experts, and the pharmaceutical industry. The Future of FDA AI Integration The discussions between OpenAI and the FDA represent an important step towards formalizing the role of AI in drug regulation. While a project like ‘cderGPT’ is likely in its very early stages, the fact that such conversations are happening at this level indicates a serious commitment to exploring these possibilities. The success of integrating FDA AI tools will depend on rigorous testing, validation, and the establishment of clear guidelines to ensure safety, efficacy, and fairness in the evaluation process. This collaboration could serve as a model for how other regulatory bodies worldwide might approach the integration of AI into their critical functions, ultimately benefiting public health by potentially accelerating access to new and improved medical treatments.

While he didn’t provide exact figures, he confirmed it’s a major personal investment. Eric’s remarks echo Donald Trump’s growing support for crypto . The president has stated multiple times that he wants crypto to succeed, especially as a competitive edge against China. He even praised Bitcoin’s resilience during April’s financial market dip, saying it held up better than traditional markets. Trump’s administration has already made moves to back crypto beyond just words. In March, Trump signed executive orders to consolidate seized Bitcoin into a U.S. crypto reserve, halting government selloffs. He also ordered the creation of a broader crypto stockpile, which includes altcoins, from forfeited assets. The aim is to maximize value without draining taxpayer funds. U.S. Crypto Reserve in the Making To further support the crypto sector, Trump appointed Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair . Atkins is tasked with delivering clear, crypto-friendly regulations, a sharp contrast to the previous administration’s more skeptical approach. Even before his presidency resumed, Trump made headlines with NFT launches and the meme coin TRUMP. Though the coin’s value soared briefly to a $75 billion market cap, it later crashed over 90%. Trump, however, denied any financial involvement, insisting he wasn’t profiting from the hype. Whether through executive orders, regulatory changes, or direct ownership, the Trumps are going all-in on Bitcoin, betting big on a crypto-powered future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Finally Approaches $100K After Almost 100 Days, New ATHS Soon? , Trump Family Under Fire Since returning to the office, President Trump’s conflicts of interest have reportedly escalated, with a spotlight on his ties to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial. According to New York Times journalist Eric Lipton , Trump has aggressively blurred the line between personal profit and public policy. After pushing for the GENIUS Act, which favors stablecoin businesses , Trump’s family crypto company quickly launched its stablecoin, becoming a top global issuer. This prompted Senate Democrats to launch an inquiry into what they call “Trump crypto corruption,” and to propose the End Crypto Corruption Act, aiming to block top officials and their families from profiting off crypto endorsements or issuances. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This uptick in profit-taking mirrors investor behavior typically seen during the late stages of a bull market. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Rises – A Cause For Worry? Bitcoin’s 7-day moving average (MA) net realized profit/loss has mostly remained positive since early 2024. The metric surged as high as $1 billion a day as the flagship cryptocurrency pushed towards new all-time highs (ATH) last year. Although BTC experienced a sharp downturn between March and April 2025, profit-taking remained robust as Bitcoin recovered most of its losses. The asset is currently trading in the mid-$90,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashing Pre-Rally Signals Seen Before Major 2024 Breakouts, Analyst Says CryptoQuant contributor Kripto Mevsimi noted that such strong realized profits – even as prices rise – typically signal a late-stage bull market. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 market cycle, Mevsimi pointed out that similar patterns preceded a local top. However, the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024 has altered the market structure to a great extent. That said, investor psychology has remained the same in that profit-taking patterns still align with historical patterns, though now with greater speed and volume. Mevsimi shared several possible scenarios that may play out in the market. First, If realized profits remain high, the likelihood of a sharp correction increases. This may push BTC back toward $90,000. On the contrary, if profit-taking declines, it could indicate the start of a market cycle transition. Either way, short-term volatility is expected to rise. The post adds: The signal is not calling a full macro top, but it’s flashing a local caution zone. As always: zoom out, and follow behavior — not just price. BTC Could See A Temporary Pullback Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned that BTC may retest the $97,700 resistance ahead of today’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which could trigger another short-term pullback. Additionally, Bitcoin’s supply scarcity narrative is being questioned. While exchange reserves continue to dwindle, recent on-chain data suggests a supply squeeze is unlikely in the near term.

Recent data shows that market participants are still favoring short-term speculation over holding BTC for the long-term. That said, momentum indicators like the Bitcoin Stochastic RSI are showing renewed strength, bolstering the case for BTC to reach a new ATH. At press time, BTC trades at $97,248, up 3.4% in the past 24 hours.

Trump said in a May 7 Truth Social post that a “major trade deal” with a “big, and highly respected, country” would be announced on May 8, which The New York Times reported would be the UK, citing three people familiar with the plans. Bitcoin inches toward $100,000 When Trump published his post, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at around $97,759 and has since crept up closer to the psychological $100,000 price level to trade at $99,140 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is trading at $99,140 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap Several Bitcoiners and analysts are crediting the rally toward $100,000 to speculation surrounding the trade deal. Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets’ head of finance, Charlie Sherry, told Cointelegraph that “as everyone else was looking down and calling for lower,” Bitcoin’s price did the opposite. “As is often the case in markets, just when consensus leans heavily bearish, price bottoms form and new market structures start to emerge.” Sherry said it is possible that the trade deal is already getting priced into Bitcoin. “While we may see psychological resistance at the $100k mark, it seems inevitable Bitcoin puts another zero on the board,” Sherry added. FOMO21 co-founder Neil Jacobs said on X that the Bitcoin rally was primarily due to Trump’s announcement. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said the incoming trade deal “means odds are increasing we hit new all-time highs in 2025.” Bitcoin reached its current all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20, just hours before Trump’s inauguration. Pandora CEO Sahib Anandsongvit said that he “can’t stop to think” how Bitcoin was $80,000 only a few weeks ago, pointing out Bitcoin’s $98,000 price at the time of the post and reiterating Trump’s looming trade deal. Bitcoin last traded at the $80,000 price level on April 11 and only reclaimed $90,000 on April 22. Related: Bitcoin returns to $98K as Fed holds rates steady despite Trump’s demand Trump’s post came just hours after the US Federal Reserve announced that it would keep interest rates at 4.25% to 4.50% despite mounting pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Bitcoin has not hit $100,000 since Feb. 1 after Trump proposed import tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Meanwhile, crypto market participants appear to be more bullish on the overall market, with the Crypto & Fear Index reading a “Greed” score of 65. Bitcoin’s 3% increase over the past 24 hours has led to approximately $96 million in short positions liquidated, according to CoinGlass data.

The approval comes days after Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed another crypto bill – the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act ( S.B. 1025 ). This legislation would have allowed the state treasurer and retirement system to invest 10% of available funds in crypto. Arizona’s House Bill 2749 is ‘Budget-Neutral’ Governor Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law on Wednesday. This marks Arizona the second US state to create a formal framework for holding crypto, after New Hampshire, which enacted legislation to allow government investments in cryptocurrency reserves. “Arizona just showed the country how to turn forgotten assets into a fortress against inflation,” Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, said in an announcement. ARIZONA SIGNS STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE INTO LAW! pic.twitter.com/xQXsm2fEXQ — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 8, 2025 The move is a “win for fiscal responsibility,” he said. Additionally, the state establishes a “forward-thinking, budget-neutral way to future-proof its treasury.” In a separate thread, Porter said that the bill’s budget-neutral feature makes it different from the one previously vetoed. “There were 4 bills. The Gov liked this one the most,” he wrote. State Takes Ownership of Unclaimed Crypto for Three Years Per the official release , assets are left abandoned if the rightful owner fails to respond to communications for three years. Therefore, the state’s qualified custodians are authorized to stake these crypto to earn rewards or receive airdrops. Further, these rewards earned on unclaimed crypto held for three years will be deposited into the new fund. The bill passed both Legislative chambers the bipartisan support and is championed by House Commerce Committee Chair Rep. Jeff Weninger. “This law ensures Arizona doesn’t leave value sitting on the table and puts us in a position to lead the country in how we secure, manage, and ultimately benefit from abandoned digital currency,” said Rep. Weninger. He further said that the structure protects property rights, respects ownership, and gives Arizona tools to account for a new category of value in the economy. “It’s exactly the kind of policy we should be leading on—modern, precise, and built with an understanding of where technology and finance are heading.” The post Arizona Governor Officially Enacts Bill to Create State-Managed Fund to Hold Unclaimed Crypto appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Arizona|Bitcoin Reserve|Crypto bill,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-08 05:37:18

The announcement was made early Tuesday on the company’s official X account, stating unequivocally that Manche’s employment and affiliations had been terminated “effective immediately.” The firm has not yet named a successor or shared details regarding how it plans to restructure governance in the wake of the leadership shake-up. Report Uncovers Secret MOVE Token Deals Tied to Movement Labs The move comes in response to a recent investigative report, which exposed a series of undisclosed deals between Movement-affiliated entities and third-party market makers during the MOVE token’s launch phase. The report detailed the existence of so-called “shadow advisors,” covert payment arrangements, and hidden allocations of MOVE tokens—all of which pointed back to Manche. Manche had been suspended on May 2 , shortly after Coinbase delisted the MOVE token. Movement Labs has terminated Rushi Manche. Movement will continue under different leadership. Details on leadership changes and a revamped governance structure will be coming soon. — Movement (@movementlabsxyz) May 7, 2025 That delisting was prompted by increasing community scrutiny over transparency and operational practices at Movement Labs. The market reaction has been swift. MOVE tokens fell 8.5% in the 24 hours following Manche’s removal and are down 35% over the past week, reflecting broader investor unease. Market makers often play a crucial role in the early success of digital assets by providing liquidity and facilitating access to major exchanges. However, when misused, these partnerships can spell disaster. A mid-April analysis warned that mishandled market-making arrangements could undermine confidence and derail projects entirely. Rising Concerns Over Market Manipulation Notably, concerns about manipulation in crypto markets have grown in recent months. Data from summer 2024 revealed that as many as 78% of new token launches since April had suffered from problematic or poorly disclosed market-making deals. 3) Furthermore to make things clear – we are not a charity (or foundation ).

Creditors of defunct crypto lender Celsius Network alleged that Wintermute, a leading market maker, engaged in wash trading of the CEL token. Likewise, Fracture Labs filed a lawsuit in late 2024 accusing Jump Crypto of manipulating the value of its in-game token, DIO. Meanwhile, DWF Labs faced accusations of inflating trading volumes through undisclosed arrangements—allegations both it and Binance have denied. In response to growing concerns, U.S. regulators have ramped up enforcement, even launching a sting operation with a fake token to catch bad actors.

The latest news from the digital asset space brings a significant development: Galaxy Digital , a leading provider of financial services and investment management in the digital asset, blockchain, and cryptocurrency sectors, has joined forces with Zodia Custody , a reputable institutional-grade crypto custodian. What Does This Galaxy Digital and Zodia Custody Partnership Mean? This collaboration marks a crucial step in expanding institutional access to crypto opportunities, particularly in Europe. At its core, the partnership allows Zodia Custody’s institutional clients to directly access Galaxy Digital’s comprehensive staking services. This is a game-changer because it addresses one of the primary concerns for large financial institutions: maintaining control and security over their digital assets while participating in yield-generating activities like staking. Think of it this way: Institutions want the benefits of crypto (like potential yield from staking) but need the robust security and regulatory clarity they are accustomed to in traditional finance. Zodia Custody provides that secure, compliant foundation, and now, through this integration, they can seamlessly offer their clients access to Galaxy Digital’s proven staking infrastructure. Unlocking Institutional Crypto Staking Opportunities Institutional crypto adoption is a major theme shaping the market today. As more large players – asset managers, hedge funds, corporate treasuries – eye digital assets, the demand for secure, compliant, and scalable services grows exponentially. Staking, which involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a proof-of-stake blockchain network and earn rewards, has become a popular way for holders to generate passive income on their assets. However, institutional participation in staking has historically been challenging due to concerns around: Security: Protecting large sums of digital assets from theft or loss. Custody: Who holds the private keys? Institutions prefer qualified custodians. Compliance: Navigating complex and evolving regulatory landscapes across different jurisdictions. Operational Complexity: Setting up and managing staking infrastructure requires technical expertise. This partnership directly tackles these hurdles. Zodia Custody, with its backing from financial giants like Standard Chartered and Northern Trust, brings the institutional-grade security and compliance framework that its clients require. By integrating with Galaxy Digital, a firm with significant expertise in digital asset markets and staking operations (managing approximately $4.2 billion in staked assets), Zodia’s clients get access to staking rewards without having to move their assets out of Zodia’s secure custody environment. This is a significant benefit – earning yield while retaining asset custody . Why Zodia Custody and Galaxy Digital? The choice of partners here is strategic. Zodia Custody is known for its focus on regulatory compliance and security, building trust with traditional financial institutions. Their backing by major banks lends significant credibility in the institutional space. Galaxy Digital, on the other hand, brings deep expertise in digital asset markets and infrastructure. They are a major player, highlighted by their position as the top validator on the Solana network, one of the prominent proof-of-stake blockchains. Their extensive experience in managing staked assets provides the operational backbone needed to deliver reliable staking services. What’s Next for This Partnership and European Expansion? The initial focus of this collaboration is on enhancing staking services for Zodia’s European clientele. This aligns with Galaxy Digital’s broader strategy of expanding its footprint in the European market, recognizing the growing interest and potential for digital asset adoption in the region. Looking ahead, the partnership could pave the way for further joint initiatives. The report from The Block suggests potential future collaborations involving more complex financial products, such as exchange-traded products (ETPs) and various yield-bearing instruments built on digital assets. This indicates a shared vision to offer a wider range of institutional-grade crypto products and services, moving beyond just spot trading and basic custody. For Galaxy Digital, this partnership is also timely as the firm reportedly plans to uplist to the Nasdaq stock exchange in May. Such a move would likely increase its visibility and potentially attract more traditional investors, further solidifying its position as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights This partnership is more than just a news headline; it offers valuable insights into the evolving institutional crypto landscape: Custody is King (and Staking is the Queen): For institutions, secure and compliant custody is non-negotiable. The ability to stake assets while keeping them with a trusted custodian like Zodia removes a major barrier to entry. Partnerships Drive Innovation: Collaborations between specialized firms (custodians like Zodia and asset managers/service providers like Galaxy Digital) are essential for building the necessary infrastructure for institutional adoption. Europe is a Growth Market: Both firms are clearly targeting the European market, indicating significant potential for institutional digital asset growth in the region. Yield is a Key Driver: The demand for yield in a low-interest-rate environment (though rates have risen, the search for alternative yield persists) makes staking an attractive proposition for institutions, provided it can be accessed securely and compliantly. Future Products on the Horizon: Keep an eye on potential future offerings like ETPs and other structured products that leverage digital assets, facilitated by such partnerships. A Compelling Step Forward for Institutional Crypto The partnership between Galaxy Digital and Zodia Custody represents a significant and positive development for the institutional crypto market, particularly in Europe. By combining Zodia’s robust, compliant custody solutions with Galaxy Digital’s extensive staking expertise, the two firms are making it easier and safer for large financial institutions to participate in the yield opportunities offered by proof-of-stake networks. This collaboration not only enhances current offerings but also lays the groundwork for future innovation in institutional digital asset products. As institutional crypto continues its trajectory towards mainstream adoption, partnerships like this are fundamental to building the trusted infrastructure required for growth.

Wallet activity sparks rumors ahead of planned May 14 ecosystem update,https://crypto.news/is-binance-listing-pi-network-soon-wallet-activity-sparks-rumors-ahead-of-planned-may-14-ecosystem-update/,"Speculation around a possible Pi Network listing on Binance has picked up again after users spotted activity involving a wallet connected to the exchange. On May 7 onchain analyst Moon Jeff reported on X that small amounts of Pi Coin ( PI ) were observed moving through Binance’s Stellar deposit wallet. The wallet address, already associated with Binance in earlier transactions, appeared to be conducting test transfers, prompting fresh speculation about integration. https://twitter.com/cryptoad00/status/1920065139836924224?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The timing has drawn attention, although neither Binance nor the Pi Network team has provided an official confirmation. Pi Network is set to make a major announcement on May 14, which many believe could include details on new listings. On May 8, the Pi Core Team posted on X, hinting at upcoming ecosystem updates without offering specifics. A Pi ecosystem announcement will be released on May 14. Tune in to find out what's coming next! pic.twitter.com/5jn7m5mlmD — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) May 7, 2025 You might also like: Pi Network price outlook: will Binance listing push PI to new highs? What adds weight to the speculation is the specific wallet involved, which is used by Binance to handle Stellar-based assets. The address was used for testing transactions during Pi Network’s early testnet phase, when it still ran on a version of the Stellar Consensus Protocol. Even though Pi now has its own mainnet , it still shares many key design elements with Stellar. Because of this similarity, Binance’s Stellar-based deposit infrastructure may still be compatible with Pi Coin, making it a logical choice for internal testing involving deposit or settlement functionality. PI is currently listed on smaller exchanges like OKX and Bitget but remains absent from major platforms like Binance and Coinbase. A past community vote on Binance showed that 86% of users support a PI listing, adding to current hopes. Market data points to a resurgence of interest. PI is up 8% in the last 24 hours, trading at around $0.63 as of press time. According to the crypto.news price tracker , trading volume has risen by 119% to $117.5 million. Technical signs point to a slight bullish trend. Short-term moving averages suggest buy signals, and the relative strength index and MACD are both on an upward trend. The price may rise towards $0.75 if it breaks above $0.68. PI Coin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news However, PI continues to face certain risks. More than 1.4 billion PI tokens, valued at over $850 million, will be unlocked over the next year, including 231 million this month alone. Without new exchange listings or rising demand, this could put pressure on prices. If PI loses key support, a drop toward $0.59 or lower is possible.

This move, reported by Reuters, signals a potential recalibration of Ukraine’s economic alignment and could have wide-ranging implications. Why Consider a Hryvnia Euro Peg Now? For years, the Ukrainian Hryvnia has often been managed with a view towards the US dollar, reflecting historical trade ties and the dollar’s role as a global reserve currency. However, the ongoing geopolitical situation and Ukraine’s aspirations for closer integration with the European Union are powerful drivers behind the potential pivot to a Hryvnia euro peg . Several factors contribute to this consideration: Increased Trade with the EU: The European Union is Ukraine’s largest trading partner. Pegging the Hryvnia to the euro could reduce exchange rate volatility for Ukrainian exporters and importers dealing with the Eurozone, making trade smoother and more predictable. EU Candidacy Status: As Ukraine progresses on its path towards potential EU membership, aligning its monetary policy and currency framework with the Eurozone makes strategic sense. It could be seen as a step towards future economic integration. Macroeconomic Stability: Linking to a major currency like the euro, backed by the European Central Bank (ECB), might be perceived as enhancing the credibility and stability of the Ukraine currency in the long term, particularly in the current volatile environment. Reduced Dependence on the Dollar: Diversifying away from a primary focus on the US dollar could be part of a broader strategy to strengthen economic sovereignty and resilience. Impacts on the Ukraine Economy A shift towards a Hryvnia euro peg would not be merely a technical adjustment; it would have tangible effects on the Ukraine economy . While aiming for stability, the transition and the peg itself present both opportunities and challenges. Potential Benefits: Boost to EU Trade: As mentioned, reduced currency risk could stimulate trade and investment flows between Ukraine and the Eurozone. Inflation Control: Pegging to a stable currency like the euro could potentially help anchor inflation expectations, although this depends heavily on domestic economic management. Investor Confidence: A clear commitment to aligning with the euro might be viewed positively by foreign investors from the Eurozone, potentially attracting capital. Potential Challenges: Loss of Monetary Autonomy: Pegging limits the National Bank of Ukraine’s ability to use exchange rate policy independently to respond to domestic economic shocks. Interest rate policy would also need to be carefully managed to maintain the peg. Vulnerability to Eurozone Shocks: The Ukraine economy would become more susceptible to economic fluctuations and policy decisions originating within the Eurozone. Implementation Risks: The transition itself would require careful management to avoid market disruption and maintain confidence in the Ukraine currency . How This Affects the Forex Market Ukraine The forex market Ukraine operates within would see significant changes if a euro peg is implemented. The dynamics of Hryvnia trading would shift. Currently, the USD/UAH pair is a primary focus. Under a euro peg, the EUR/UAH pair would become central. The National Bank would likely intervene in the forex market Ukraine to maintain the exchange rate within a specified band relative to the euro. This would mean buying Hryvnia with euros when the Hryvnia weakens against the euro, and selling Hryvnia for euros when it strengthens. Traders and businesses operating in the forex market Ukraine would need to adjust their strategies, focusing more on EUR/UAH movements and less on USD/UAH, although cross rates would still be relevant. The success of maintaining such a peg in the forex market Ukraine would depend on several factors: The level at which the peg is set. The National Bank’s foreign currency reserves (especially euro reserves). The credibility of the commitment to the peg. Overall macroeconomic performance and capital flows. Pursuing Currency Stability : Benefits and Challenges The primary stated goal behind considering a Hryvnia euro peg is likely to enhance currency stability . In times of conflict and economic uncertainty, a stable exchange rate can provide a crucial anchor, helping businesses plan and protecting citizens’ purchasing power (at least in terms of imported goods from the peg currency area). However, achieving and maintaining currency stability through a peg is not without its difficulties. As seen in the challenges section regarding the Ukraine economy, it requires disciplined fiscal and monetary policy. If domestic inflation rates diverge significantly from the Eurozone, or if external shocks hit Ukraine disproportionately, maintaining the peg can become challenging and costly, potentially leading to a build-up of pressure for a devaluation or revaluation. Historically, currency pegs have had mixed success globally. They can provide stability when economic conditions are aligned, but can also lead to severe crises if the peg becomes unsustainable due to fundamental economic imbalances. Looking Ahead: The Future of Ukraine Currency The discussion around potentially linking the Ukraine currency to the euro is still in its exploratory phase, according to the reports. It represents a strategic contemplation of Ukraine’s future economic direction and its place in the global financial system. The decision will involve careful weighing of the economic benefits of closer Eurozone alignment against the challenges of surrendering monetary flexibility. For those following the broader financial markets, including cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. Changes in major fiat currencies and their relationships can influence global liquidity, capital flows, and risk sentiment, which in turn can impact digital asset markets. The future trajectory of the Ukraine currency , whether it remains managed against the dollar or shifts towards the euro, will be a key indicator of Ukraine’s economic strategy and its deepening ties with Europe.

According to CoinPedia’s Ethereum price prediction, ETH could hit $5,925 by the end of 2025, with a potential average price around $4,392. Long-term projections suggest Ethereum may reach up to $15,575 by 2030, depending on network upgrades, DeFi adoption, and broader market trends.

Price is above the 9-day SMA, and RSI is rising at 63.86, indicating growing strength. A potential rounding bottom pattern is forming, suggesting a trend reversal. Consolidation between $1,600 and $1,900 shows accumulation. If ETH breaks above $1,900, further upside toward $2,200 is possible. RSI above 60 supports the bullish outlook if momentum sustains. High Price : $2,200 Low Price : $1,600 Average Price : $1,800 Why ETH Price Will Surge in Q2-2025? Pectra Upgrade Launching May 7: Ethereum will roll out the Pectra upgrade, a merge of the Prague and Electra upgrades. Vitalik Buterin Proposes RISC-V : Ethereum’s co-founder has suggested replacing the EVM bytecode with the RISC-V instruction set, making Ethereum more adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. Base Layer Activity Drops: Despite innovations, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees, with average gas fees at $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. This has raised sustainability concerns but is also making the network more accessible. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 If Ethereum manages to stay above this support, it could gradually rise towards $2,400 or more by the end of 2025, especially if the market becomes more positive. However, Ethereum will face resistance around $2,500, so it may take time to break through this level. The Ethereum price is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and form higher highs. Furthermore, with increased adoption, newer upgrades, and network growth, the ETH coin price can smash the $5k mark and hit a new all-time high of $5,925. Conversely, rising uncertainty or any unfavorable global economic events could pull the ETH price toward its annual low of $2,917. Considering the market sentiments, the average price could settle at around $3,392.

Perhaps the most notable reason behind this surge is a big teaser published by the Core Team on X. It’s safe to say that PI’s price trajectory was quite painful for a long time. Even though the asset bounced off its all-time low at $0.4 marked on April 5, it has still struggled to post a meaningful recovery. Its price failed to recapture the momentum of most of the crypto market, where even larger-cap alts soared impressively. PI spent the majority of the past seven days below $0.6. However, it finally recorded an impressive uptick on a daily scale. Its price is up by roughly 7% in one of the more notable green candles in about a month. Thus, the current price tag of $0.62 means that PI now sits at a two-week peak. PI Token Price.

Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza will dominate discussions, but North Korea’s increasing cyber threats and crypto hacks have become a major concern requiring a coordinated international response, Bloomberg reported on May 7, citing people familiar with the plans. The people said North Korea’s nefarious cyber operations are alarming, as the stolen crypto has become a key funding source for the regime and its programs. North Korean-affiliated hacking groups such as the Lazarus Group have already stolen billions of dollars worth of crypto this year, including pulling off the $1.4 billion hack on Bybit in February, the largest ever for the crypto industry. North Korean-linked hackers also stole more than $1.3 billion through 47 crypto heists during 2024, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The US, Japan and South Korea warned in January that North Korea also deployed tech workers to infiltrate crypto companies as insider threats. North Korea’s crypto-related hacking activity by year. Source: Chainalysis North Korean “information technology (IT) workers also present an insider threat to private sector partners,” the statement read. The illicit proceeds from these high-profile hacks have helped the hermit kingdom circumvent international sanctions and fund its weapons development programs, according to a US Treasury report in September. Related: North Korean crypto attacks rising in sophistication, actors — Paradigm In April, a group affiliated with Lazarus set up three shell companies , with two in the US, to deliver malware to unsuspecting users and scam crypto developers. Attempt to infiltrate crypto exchange Earlier this month, crypto exchange Kraken detailed how it foiled an attempt by a North Korean hacker to infiltrate its organization. Kraken’s chief security officer, Nick Percoco, conducted trap identity verification tests that the candidate failed, confirming the deception. Cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and blockchain security researcher, Heiner Garcia, also uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected North Korean operative, who accidentally shared details that linked him to the nation’s crypto scams.

However, the firm missed revenue expectations, as income dropped amid declining mining yields and a shift in business strategy. According to the company’s May 7 earnings release , total revenue for Q1 reached $79.5 million, falling short of Zacks analyst estimates by over 8%. This marked a significant decline from the $179.3 million Core Scientific posted during the same period last year. Core Scientific’s Q1 Revenue Dominated by Self-Mining at $67.2M The bulk of its earnings came from $67.2 million in self-mining revenue, while hosted mining and colocation contributed $3.8 million and $8.6 million, respectively. The revenue shortfall follows the April 2024 Bitcoin halving, which cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively reducing mining income. Core Scientific also cited its ongoing operational transition toward high-performance computing (HPC) hosting—especially for artificial intelligence applications—as a contributing factor to the revenue dip. Still, some losses were mitigated by favorable market conditions. Bitcoin’s average price rose 74% during the quarter, and the firm benefited from a 33% reduction in power costs due to lower energy rates and improved efficiency. A key part of Core Scientific’s future growth strategy is its pivot to AI-focused infrastructure. In February, the company secured a $1.2 billion agreement with AI firm CoreWeave to expand data center capacity. This move is expected to significantly bolster colocation revenue, with projections pointing to an annualized figure of $360 million by 2026. Core Scientific has announced its First Quarter 2025 Results! – On track to deliver 250MW of billable capacity to CoreWeave by the end of this year and anticipate entering 2026 with annualized colocation revenue of approximately $360 million. – First tranche of 8MW of billable… pic.twitter.com/cHt5xSA74Y — Core Scientific (@Core_Scientific) May 7, 2025 CEO Adam Sullivan called Q1 an “inflection point” for the company, emphasizing its strategic positioning within the rapidly growing demand for high-performance data services. “We’re at the center of one of the most important shifts in modern computing,” Sullivan said in a statement. Shares in Core Scientific (CORZ) closed down 1% at $8.90 on May 7 but rose to $9.24 in after-hours trading. The shift to HPC is gaining momentum across the crypto mining sector. Companies like Hive Digital, Hut 8, Iris Energy, and TeraWulf have all begun reallocating mining resources toward AI infrastructure, signaling a broader trend reshaping the future of digital asset operations. Bitcoin Mining’s Sustainable Energy Usage Rises to 52% A recent study from Cambridge University shows that sustainable energy now powers 52.4% of Bitcoin mining , a significant increase from 37.6% reported in 2022. According to the report, 42.6% of Bitcoin mining’s sustainable energy comes from renewables like wind and hydropower, while 9.8% is sourced from nuclear energy. Natural gas has now overtaken coal as the largest energy contributor to Bitcoin mining, with usage rising to 38.2%, compared to 25% in 2022. Coal’s share, meanwhile, has fallen sharply to 8.9% from 36.6%. The United States became a global leader in Bitcoin mining following China’s 2021 crackdown on the crypto industry. With cheap electricity and strong capital markets, American mining firms quickly gained dominance, and the election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump initially fueled optimism for continued growth.

With this new service , companies can hold, receive, and hold US-dollar stablecoin account balances, similar to how a traditional fiat bank account works.” The accounts will support USDC and USDB, a newer stablecoin issued by Bridge, a lending platform for stablecoins that Stripe acquired earlier this year. These multi-currency accounts allow users to hold GBP, EUR, and USD funds. By offering a more secure way to store value, the financial services firm enables businesses—especially those in regions with fragile banking infrastructure—to transact more easily globally. Stripe expands its role to become a global financial network Stripe built its reputation by helping online businesses accept credit card payments, but this new offering signals a significant evolution in its vision. With the introduction of stablecoin accounts, the firm emphasizes that it’s no longer just a payment processor—it’s laying the foundation for a seamless, borderless global financial system. This launch comes at a time when stablecoins are increasingly seen as a store of value and a medium of exchange, especially in regions without critical financial and communication infrastructure. This transition puts Stripe in a digital financial ecosystem where companies can not only take payments but also hold money, make vendor payments, manage treasury operations, and now, do it all with fiat and crypto assets. John Collison, co-founder and president of Stripe, pointed to persistent problems like invoice fraud, phishing attacks, and splintered payment rails. He argues that the firm’s advancement into stablecoins presents a safer, more productive, and programmable future for business finance. For example, stablecoins, which were once mainly the domain of crypto traders, are increasingly viewed as a tool for real-world commerce. They offer speedy settlement, lower costs, and protection against swings in the value of a currency — particularly helpful in markets susceptible to hyperinflation or banking instability. Bridge , Stripe’s in-house stablecoin platform, is the core premise behind the new service. Bridge facilitates currency exchange among regular businesses who want to operate across crypto and fiat payment rail without fearing what’s happening under the hood. Ramp and Visa team up with Stripe to streamline stablecoin use Corporate partners are already embracing Stripe’s entry into stablecoins. Ramp, a fast-growing startup that sells corporate cards, is one of the first to offer the product. Ramp is launching corporate cards backed by stablecoin to meet companies’ demand for faster settlement times, reduced FX fees, and protection against local currency depreciation. These cards will connect to Ramp’s digital wallets, with Stripe’s Bridge providing behind-the-scenes currency conversions. A partnership with global payments giant Visa also backs the effort. Visa will facilitate broadening the reach of these stablecoin cards, permitting companies to transact everywhere Visa is accepted, even if the backend payment uses stablecoins. This partnership is one piece of Stripe’s overall strategy to transform itself into a platform for programmable, interoperable money. In addition to its stablecoin work, Stripe is entering the artificial intelligence world. At Stripe Sessions, the company also introduced a new AI tool that developers can use to integrate AI-powered agents into apps. These agents can make user purchases — features such as automatically turning to-do list items into one-click, AI-initiated purchases could be made possible. Stripe will also become the key payment partner for Visa’s AI agent program. Gaybrick described artificial intelligence and stablecoins as the “twin revolutions,” noting that AI is transforming how people live and work, while stablecoins represent the first truly global and fully programmable form of money ever seen.

44311845,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158323,1746684013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bernstein Warns: Charles Schwab & Morgan Stanley Face Fierce Crypto Market Battle as Latecomers,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/charles-schwab-crypto-challenge/,"Major financial players like Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley are finally stepping into the cryptocurrency arena, a move long anticipated by the market. However, a recent Bernstein report offers a sobering perspective: they might be arriving a bit late to the party, facing significant crypto market competition . Bernstein Report: Charles Schwab & Morgan Stanley Enter the Crypto Market According to analysts at Bernstein, the entry of financial giants like Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley into the crypto sector marks a significant moment for institutional adoption. Charles Schwab recently made waves by announcing plans to offer spot trading services for Bitcoin and Ethereum later this year. Not to be left behind, Morgan Stanley is also reportedly integrating cryptocurrency trading services onto its popular online securities platform, E-Trade. While their entry is noteworthy, Bernstein’s analysis points out a crucial challenge: their timing. Compared to established crypto-native platforms, these traditional powerhouses are considered latecomers. Navigating Fierce Crypto Market Competition The cryptocurrency landscape isn’t an empty field waiting for Wall Street giants to claim their territory. It’s a bustling marketplace with formidable competitors who have spent years building their infrastructure, user base, and brand loyalty. Platforms like: Coinbase: A leading US-based exchange with a large retail and institutional client base. Kraken: Another long-standing exchange known for its security and range of trading options. Robinhood: Popular for its user-friendly interface and early integration of crypto trading alongside stocks. Bernstein analysts emphasize that these early movers have gained a significant competitive advantage. They’ve refined their technology, navigated regulatory uncertainties, and cultivated communities of crypto enthusiasts. Competing directly with these established players on their home turf will be a challenge for Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley. They will need to quickly innovate and adapt to the unique demands and expectations of crypto users. The Advantage of Institutional Crypto Giants Despite their late start in the direct crypto trading space, the Bernstein report isn’t entirely bearish on the prospects for Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley. Traditional financial institutions possess inherent advantages that shouldn’t be underestimated, particularly when it comes to institutional crypto adoption and attracting a specific demographic. Their key strengths include: Massive Scale: Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley manage trillions in client assets and have millions of existing customers. This built-in user base is a significant asset. Deep Pockets: They have the financial resources to invest heavily in technology, security, and compliance infrastructure necessary for crypto operations. Established Trust and Brand Recognition: Decades of operation have built immense trust among investors, especially older generations who may be hesitant to use newer, unfamiliar crypto exchanges. Integrated Services: Offering crypto alongside traditional investments on platforms like E-Trade provides convenience for existing clients. Bernstein concedes that these factors give them the potential to take away market share, particularly from retail-focused platforms. Older investors, for instance, who are curious about Bitcoin or Ethereum but are uncomfortable opening new accounts on dedicated crypto exchanges, might find the option to trade within their existing Charles Schwab or Morgan Stanley accounts highly appealing. What This Means for the Future of Crypto Adoption The entry of Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley, even as latecomers, signals a broader trend of institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies. While they face stiff crypto market competition , their scale and existing client relationships position them to capture a significant segment of the market, especially from less crypto-savvy investors. The battle for market share in the US crypto space is heating up. While Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood have a head start, the entry of Wall Street heavyweights like Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley will undoubtedly reshape the competitive landscape and potentially accelerate mainstream adoption of digital assets. Conclusion: A Challenging but Promising Entry In summary, the Bernstein report provides a balanced view of Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley’s foray into crypto. They are indeed late compared to native crypto platforms and face a challenging environment of fierce competition. However, their inherent strengths – vast scale, deep resources, and established trust – give them a powerful edge, particularly in attracting traditional investors looking for a familiar gateway into the world of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their entry is a significant validation for the crypto market, even as it intensifies the battle for users and trading volume.

The firm plans to join the growing list of companies pivoting to Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset thanks to rising institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin-backed lending is also gaining traction, with Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca pointing out the shift in investor mindset. Holders are increasingly borrowing against their BTC instead of selling, due to rising confidence and ETF-related tailwinds. Meanwhile, Hive Digital Technologies is expanding its mining operations in Paraguay, attracted by low-cost hydro power and a pro-investment environment. The firm wants to boost capacity to 300 MW and 25 EH/s by September 2025. Strive Asset Management Goes All In on Bitcoin Strive Asset Management, which was founded by entrepreneur and former US presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, announced plans to become a Bitcoin treasury company. On May 7, the firm revealed that it will go public via a reverse merger with Asset Entities, a Nasdaq-listed social media marketing company. The merged entity will continue under the Strive brand and leverage its public market access to finance large-scale Bitcoin purchases. Strive’s announcement Strive plans to raise roughly $1 billion through a combination of equity and debt and use the proceeds to build a large Bitcoin reserve. The company stated that it plans to take advantage of all available mechanisms to develop a Bitcoin “war chest” and pursue a long-term strategy that could outperform Bitcoin itself. Additionally, Strive said it will offer Bitcoin holders a path to exchange their holdings for public stock in a structure designed to be tax-free. Strive manages around $2 billion in net assets across its investment funds. The company also previously filed to list an ETF focused on convertible bonds from major corporate Bitcoin holders like Strategy. The move was made during a time of growing interest in corporate Bitcoin treasuries, which is a trend that accelerated since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Companies adopting this strategy, like Strategy, have seen their stock prices soar. Some even rose as much as 350% in 2024 alone. Analysts, including those at Fidelity Digital Assets, argue that Bitcoin can serve as a valuable hedge against macroeconomic instability, including currency debasement and fiscal deficits. Bitcoin treasuries data (Source: Bitcointreasuries.net ) Corporate Bitcoin treasuries now collectively hold approximately $74 billion in BTC, based on data from Bitcointreasuries.net . Ramaswamy launched Strive in 2022 with a mission to ”harness the power of capitalism,” and maintained a close political alignment with President-elect Donald Trump. Although he ran against Trump in the 2023 Republican primaries, he ultimately endorsed him. Bitcoin Hodlers Turn to Loans Instead of Selling Bitcoin treasuries are not the only new hot trend in the crypto space. Bitcoin holders are increasingly turning to crypto-backed loans as confidence in the market grows. This is according to Seamus Rocca, CEO of Gibraltar-based Xapo Bank. At the Token2049 event in Dubai, Rocca explained that with Bitcoin hovering around $98,000 and institutional interest rising, investors are adopting a more long-term view and are more comfortable using their BTC as collateral. This is a major shift from a few years ago when such confidence in borrowing against crypto assets was lacking. Seamus Rocca at Token2049 In March, Xapo Bank introduced a new lending product that allows qualified users to borrow up to $1 million in US dollars against their Bitcoin holdings. Rocca attributed the growing demand for this service to the mood of long-term adoption and stability in the crypto sector. He explained that the current environment, which is boosted by developments like Bitcoin ETFs, is encouraging a sense of security that reduces fears of sharp price crashes and liquidation events. The bank offers loan-to-value ratios of 20%, 30%, and 40%, which allows clients to access liquidity while still minimizing risk. Rocca pointed out that even with a conservative 20% LTV ratio, early adopters with large Bitcoin holdings can borrow large sums without having to sell their assets. In such cases, Bitcoin will need to fall below $40,000 to trigger liquidation. (Source: Unchained ) Rocca said that these loans provide a practical alternative for holders who may need funds for unexpected expenses. Instead of selling Bitcoin and potentially missing out on future gains, borrowers can retain their exposure to BTC and simply pay interest on their loans. This strategy helps investors manage real-life financial needs without compromising their long-term crypto positions. With institutional adoption accelerating and the crypto market continuing to mature, Rocca believes more Bitcoin holders will look to access liquidity through borrowing rather than selling. Hive Digital Taps Paraguay’s Hydro Power for BTC Growth In other Bitcoin-related news, Hive Digital Technologies is placing a strategic bet on Latin America to expand its Bitcoin mining operations. The company is doing this despite the fact that most other crypto firms are contemplating returning to the United States due to geopolitical uncertainties. In a recent interview , Hive’s president and CEO Aydin Kilic specifically pointed to Paraguay as a particularly promising location, due to its geopolitical stability, low-cost hydroelectric power, and a government receptive to foreign investment. The company recently acquired Bitfarms’ 200 megawatt Yguazú facility for $56 million and completed the first phase of a 100 MW data center, which already supports five exahashes per second of ASIC mining. Hive plans to scale operations in Paraguay to 300 MW and increase its hashrate to 25 EH/s by September of 2025. Kilic fully believes in the importance of local engagement, and explained that Hive prioritized hiring, training, and vendor relationships to create a stable support ecosystem that enhances efficiency. Despite a proposed mining ban in Paraguay due to concerns over electricity consumption and potential rate hikes, Hive is in active dialogue with local policymakers to shape more favorable regulatory outcomes. While doubling down on Latin America, Hive is also diversifying globally with operations in Canada, Sweden, and now a new headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. Kilic said this geographical spread helps mitigate risks tied to global trade tensions and regional instability. For example, the company is reducing reliance on Chinese suppliers by securing ASIC and electrical components from multiple regions. To support its ambitious scaling plans, Hive secured ASIC orders, locked in long-term power purchase agreements, and increased engineering capacity across three continents. Kilic described Bitcoin mining profitability as a “physics equation,” where controlling variables like operational expenses, power costs, and machine uptime is crucial when it comes to driving consistent performance. He added that regardless of scale, whether an operator runs a single rig or ten thousand, the key to success lies in maximizing efficiency and maintaining disciplined treasury management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-08 06:07:10

New $0.0000002 Cryptocurrency Set To Take Over Before Elon Musk-Backed GROK,https://nulltx.com/is-pepe-done-new-0-0000002-cryptocurrency-set-to-take-over-before-elon-musk-backed-grok/,"Pepe (PEPE) may have led the meme coin wave, but its momentum is starting to slow, leaving investors wondering if its best days are behind it or if Elon Musk’s new GROK meme coin could overtake it. As investors hunt for the next breakout star in the cryptocurrency market, a new contender priced at just $0.0000002 is gaining serious attention, set to surpass even Elon Musk’s GROK cryptocurrency. With advanced AI tools, meme-to-earn feature, and a fast-growing community, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is being touted as the meme coin poised to dethrone Pepe (PEPE) and GROK. Here’s why this newcomer could be the biggest meme cryptocurrency story of 2025. Can PEPE Still Deliver Gains? According to CoinGecko data , PEPE has remained largely stagnant around the $0.05 mark over the past year. Recently, PEPE has fallen 12.61% over the past week, including a 4.59% drop in the last 24 hours. But, on the price chart, PEPE has broken out of a long-standing falling wedge pattern, which is generally considered a positive indicator for future price movement. If this breakout holds, the short-term price target lies around $0.000011000. On the flip side, if PEPE fails to maintain support at the wedge (currently around $0.000007895), the coin could fall back into the pattern, with a potential drop to the $0.00000600–$0.000005 demand zone, which would invalidate the bullish outlook. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Meme Coin With Better Utilities Than PEPE And GROK PEPE previously soared to a $11 billion market cap in one year, largely due to viral momentum tied to the iconic meme frog. Now, investors demand more than just buzz—they want substance, utility, and unique functionalities. That’s where FloppyPepe (FPPE) comes in, quietly developing one of the most promising projects in the space. What sets this cryptocurrency apart from others like PEPE and Elon Musk-backed GROK is its unique combination of meme culture and advanced AI technology. Its AI-powered agents, like the FloppyX and FloppyAI , continuously scan the cryptocurrency landscape, monitoring social sentiment, on-chain activity, DEX trading patterns, and live market data, to uncover real trading opportunities. The SolidProof-audited project also offers gas-fee-free transactions and staking up to 7.9% of its 120 trillion token supply. TRY FLOPPYAI NOW!! GROK, Sparks Frenzy After Explosive Surge Grok (GROK) , a new meme coin launched on the Solana network on May 1, has made headlines after nearly doubling in value to trade around $0.06274. Sharing its name with Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, GROK has fueled speculation that it may have been created by Elon Musk’s xAI team as a parody of the original AI model. This rumor has driven a massive spike in search interest, pushing GROK to the top of CoinGecko’s trending meme coins list, highlighting the intense FOMO surrounding the Elon Musk-backed token. Although its market cap has pulled back from a peak of $72 million to about $16 million at press time, experts believe there’s more upside potential for GROK. Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is The Next Big Meme Coin FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency has already created serious FOMO. Notably, top analyst GIGA has endorsed the cryptocurrency, predicting a 100x surge. Even ahead of its official launch, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has raised more than $2 million in presale funding, a strong signal that experienced investors are taking notice early. The project is also gearing up to launch on major blockchains like Binance Smart Chain and Solana. When combined with rising investor interest and viral momentum, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has a real shot at surpassing not only Elon Musk-backed GROK but even dethroning PEPE itself. Missed Out On PEPE? Don’t Miss Out On FloppyPepe (FPPE) PEPE and the Elon Musk-backed GROK both began as low-priced presale tokens. Despite having little real utility, they attracted massive investor interest, turning small stakes into millions. Now, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to do the same, with the added advantage of real utility and AI integration. The presale is still in its early phase at just $0.0000002 , with up to 80% in bonuses using the code FLOPPY80 . This could be the next major breakout—now’s the time to get in early.

History is quietly preparing to repeat itself as FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quietly rising through the crypto ranks, with all the right elements to ignite another generational wealth wave and become the Bitcoin (BTC) of the AI age. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Coin Redefining Value Where meme coins once lived and died by hype alone, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has taken a bold leap beyond the predictable. Offering a complete ecosystem that merges decentralized finance with artificial intelligence. In a market craving both cultural virality and technical utility, this unique token is the first of its kind: a next-gen meme coin engineered for long-term value. And the infrastructure is already in place. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is expanding across major blockchains, including Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, allowing hassle-free, multichain access and scalability. With a comprehensive smart contract audited by SolidProof, bug bounty programs, and multi-signature wallets, it also provides ironclad security that guarantees long-term sustainability, not flash-in-the-pan hype. Advanced AI Utility For Community Engagement As artificial intelligence dominates the crypto space . From trading bots to AI-driven analytics, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is built from the ground up to thrive in it. Its ecosystem uses AI agents like Floppy Agent to deliver high-impact, real-time market intelligence, giving traders an unprecedented edge in fast-moving markets. Users can engage with this technology right away. But FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) real magic lies in its other AI-powered utility. The FloppyX agent crafts cinematic-quality videos using intelligent pipelines, while the Meme-o-Matic allows users to create viral memes like the one below using simple prompts. These tools don’t just engage the community, they create endless viral potential. An Incomparable Floppynomics What’s more? FloppyPepe (FPPE) introduces game-changing mechanics into its tokenomics. Its burn system, which permanently eliminates 1% of every transaction, mirrors the deflationary logic of Bitcoin (BTC) halving events, driving scarcity while increasing long-term value. Simultaneously, 3% of every transaction is automatically redistributed to holders, turning passive holding into an income stream. With staking options, a growing liquidity pool, and an 80% bonus with code “FLOPPY80,” currently in play, the math is explosive. Let’s look at the numbers. Dogecoin (DOGE) rose 200,000%. Shiba Inu (SHIB) skyrocketed over 1,000,000%. Analysts now project that FloppyPepe (FPPE) could rally 130,000%–150,000% or more from its presale price of $0.0000002 . With the current presale offering an 80% bonus, a $1,000 investment doesn’t just buy tokens; it buys early access to a future market leader. With the 80% bonus, your $1,000 essentially behaves like $1,800. If FPPE hits its projected high, you’re not just mimicking Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory, you’re accelerating it. Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise And Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Might Be Next Bitcoin’s (BTC) origin story is legendary: from cents to tens of thousands of dollars. Yet its astronomical climb was not due to hype; it was due to early belief. Bitcoin (BTC) didn’t advertise itself. It didn’t promise Lambos or instant millions. Bitcoin (BTC) offered technology, scarcity, and community. And its intrinsic value continues to keep faithfuls like SantinoCryptoE optimistic of an incoming $150,000 price. Back then, few understood what Bitcoin (BTC) could become. That same uncertainty today surrounds FloppyPepe (FPPE), and for early believers, that’s the signal, not the noise. Don’t Miss the Next Bitcoin Moment, It’s Coming With An 80% Early Adopter Bonus FloppyPepe (FPPE) is opening up a world far more receptive to crypto, to memes, and to AI. Designed to be the first intelligent meme coin engineered to build wealth while creating content, community, and culture. Investors will be buying into AI infrastructure and smart tokenomics. In a world where utility and virality collide, this meme coin is uniquely positioned to lead the charge. Those who missed Bitcoin (BTC) now have the chance to correct their mistakes.

The bill, titled “Stop Presidential Profiteering from Digital Assets Act”, includes tough measures against possible abuses, especially in the memecoin and stablecoin space. According to the bill, the president, vice president, members of Congress, federal officials appointed by the president or confirmed by the Senate, and their immediate family members will not be able to directly or indirectly profit from digital assets. In particular, the creation, promotion, advertising, and sale of digital assets that use the names, faces, or similar distinguishing features of said individuals will be prohibited.

Torres stated that the main purpose of the bill is to prevent public officials from abusing their positions and making unfair gains in cryptocurrency markets. This move is likely a response to US President Donald Trump launching his own memecoin and also his sons being actively involved in the cryptocurrency market. *This is not investment advice.

The largest cryptocurrency is getting closer to the $100,000 mark, while several altcoins are testing important resistance levels. One of the performers is Pi Coin, which has jumped 8% in the last 24 hours. The token is now eyeing the $0.70 mark — and if it breaks through, the path to $0.90 and $1 could open up. Adding to this are fresh rumors about Pi possibly getting listed on Binance. These speculations started when Binance’s Stellar deposit wallet, which also serves as its Pi wallet, began testing transactions on the Pi blockchain. On top of that, the Pi Network team has a major announcement planned for May 14. The big reveal might take place at the Consensus Summit in Toronto, marking the project’s first official global event. Pi founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis is also expected to speak, sharing updates on the project’s Open Mainnet, which officially launched in February 2025. What’s Next For Pi Coin? Analyst Dr. Altcoin believes Pi Coin could pick up momentum after the Summit takes place. With over 70 million users worldwide, Pi Network is too big to be ignored by major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. He also said that Binance advertising on the Pi app could mean something. However, the Pi coin is down by more than 3% in the last 2 weeks. There is a constant sell-off pressure due to the ongoing token unlocks. As per data from Pi Scan , 10.3 million tokens will be unlocked today. Recently, its trading volume dropped below $40 million, but it has since bounced to $123 million. The next few weeks will be important and could determine where Pi Coin’s price is headed. Pi Coin’s RSI is neutral, with no strong momentum in either direction. The MACD is giving a buy signal, which is a good sign. Moving averages are also neutral, showing the market is uncertain.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-08 06:10:10

Acting comptroller Rodney Hood said in a May 7 letter that banks and federal savings associations can buy and sell crypto they hold in custody at customers’ direction. The OCC added in a press release that financial institutions can also outsource bank-permissible crypto activities , including custody and execution services, to third parties in compliance with applicable law. “Additionally, these banks may provide other custody services, including record keeping, tax or reporting services for their customers,” Hood said in a May 7 video posted to X.

Previously, the OCC eased its stance on how banks can engage with crypto on March 7 by giving the green light for crypto-asset custody, some stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as distributed ledgers. “More than 50 million Americans hold some form of cryptocurrency. This digitalization of financial services is not a trend; it is a transformation,” Hood said. The OCC is an independent bureau within the US Department of the Treasury that regulates and supervises all national banks and also the federal branches of foreign banks. Industry supports the OCC letters Katherine Kirkpatrick Bos, general counsel at ZK-rollup developer StarkWare, said the letters signal a “shift in the OCC’s approach,” which now appears to favor a focus on integrating crypto within banking frameworks. “More guidance will give further clarity [and] will allow banks to re-enter crypto [without] the fear of existential regulatory risk,” she said. She added the OCC’s “explicit permission today allowing banks to outsource bank-permissible crypto-assets is a boon to regulated crypto native service providers.” Source: Katherine Kirkpatrick Bos Chief policy officer at crypto exchange Coinbase, Faryar Shirzad, also applauded the move, saying in a May 7 post to X, Hood’s commitment to “regulatory clarity, as well as his adherence to supervisory best practices and the letter of the law,” is appreciated. The Trump administration has taken a friendlier attitude toward crypto since coming into power in January. Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearings In April, the US Federal Reserve announced it was withdrawing guidance that was created to deter banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities.

In a thread on X, Pumpius stated that “$2 XRP is a lie,” and described the current market as a “controlled simulation” orchestrated by banks, exchanges, and regulators instead of the product of supply and demand. Pumpius believes XRP is a critical piece of future global finance infrastructure, and therefore faces different treatment from the rest of the crypto market. “XRP is the only asset they need suppressed,” he stated , asserting that financial entities deliberately keep the price low in preparation for a future system shift. The XRP Price is Artificial: Controlled by a Global Banking Cartel $2 XRP is a lie. This isn’t a market. It’s a controlled simulation. Designed by a cartel of banks, exchanges, and regulators. pic.twitter.com/4xr6a7biBq — Pumpius (@pumpius) May 6, 2025 Accumulation Behind the Scenes Pumpius alleges that institutions quietly accumulate XRP while the retail price is kept low through manipulation. This assertion adds credence to statements from another expert suggesting that BlackRock and similar institutions want to buy tokens at discounted retail prices . Pumpius suggests that live corridors and ongoing bank partnerships are concealed under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), hiding the scale of adoption. This claim is supported by recent reports that Ripple has over 1,700 NDAs , and Pumpius believes the plan is to continue the suppression until global systems adopt ISO 20022 standards, as this shift would activate XRP’s role. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He points to consistent price stagnation despite real-world usage as evidence. Ripple has reported dozens of active partnerships with financial institutions, but the market price of XRP has not reflected these developments. For Pumpius, the lack of correlation is a consequence of deliberate containment. Exchange Manipulation and False Volatility Part of the alleged strategy involves manipulation by crypto exchanges. Pumpius accuses them of wash trading, spoofing order books, and using automated bots to trigger panic and fake momentum. He insists that what appears to be normal volatility is a controlled strategy to keep XRP unattractive to average investors. He says this creates the illusion that XRP is underperforming compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are allowed to grow unchecked. He claims that XRP, being too integrated and regulatory-compliant, cannot rise without threatening the legacy financial order. Control Before Activation Pumpius’s core argument is that the suppression is temporary and ends once the underlying infrastructure goes live. He believes the banking establishment aims to control the system fully before public recognition of XRP’s true value occurs. Crypto experts have advised investors to hold their XRP in cold wallets and not on public exchanges so they can fully control the tokens when the market shifts.

44312469,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158317,1746685233,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breakthrough: Bipartisan US Stablecoin Bill Agreement Reached,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stablecoin-bill-agreement/,"The world of cryptocurrency is often unpredictable, but a recent development out of Washington D.C. has injected a significant dose of optimism. After months, if not years, of debate and legislative maneuvering, U.S. politicians have reportedly reached a bipartisan agreement on crucial stablecoin regulation . This is big news, and it signals a potentially clearer path forward for a vital part of the digital asset ecosystem. A Rare Moment: What Does This Bipartisan Crypto Bill Agreement Signify? In the often-polarized landscape of U.S. politics, achieving bipartisan consensus on complex issues is a rare feat. The fact that Republicans and Democrats have found common ground on a bipartisan crypto bill is noteworthy in itself. According to a report by U.Today, this agreement centers around a bill known as the GENIUS Act. Previously, efforts to regulate stablecoins faced opposition from various corners, including some pro-cryptocurrency lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who had differing views on how best to approach the technology. The reported breakthrough suggests that key sticking points may have been resolved, paving the way for potential legislative action. The next immediate step, as reported, is that Republicans plan to push for a vote on this agreed-upon text in the Senate sometime this week. Understanding the Focus: Why is a US Stablecoin Bill a Priority? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a traditional currency like the U.S. dollar, or sometimes to commodities or algorithms. Their potential uses are vast, from facilitating faster and cheaper payments to enabling seamless trading within the crypto market. However, their growing importance and connection to traditional finance have raised concerns among regulators worldwide, including in the United States. A dedicated US stablecoin bill is seen as necessary to address several key areas: Financial Stability: Ensuring that stablecoin issuers hold adequate reserves and operate transparently to prevent ‘runs’ similar to bank runs, which could potentially impact the broader financial system. Consumer Protection: Establishing rules to safeguard users’ funds and provide clarity on the rights and responsibilities of stablecoin holders and issuers. Preventing Illicit Finance: Implementing measures to prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities. Fostering Innovation: Providing regulatory certainty allows legitimate businesses to build and innovate using stablecoins with clear guidelines. Without clear federal rules, the regulatory landscape for stablecoins in the U.S. has been fragmented, relying on a mix of state-level licensing and existing financial regulations that weren’t specifically designed for digital assets. What Might the GENIUS Act Entail? (Based on Previous Discussions) While the specific text of the agreed-upon GENIUS Act has not yet been publicly released, previous legislative proposals and discussions around stablecoin regulation offer clues about what it might include. Common themes in past bills have involved: Issuance Requirements: Mandating that stablecoin issuers obtain specific charters or licenses, potentially from federal or state regulators, or both. Reserve Standards: Requiring stablecoins pegged to the dollar to be fully backed by high-quality, liquid assets (like cash, cash equivalents, or short-term government bonds) held in segregated accounts, subject to regular audits and public attestation. Oversight Authority: Designating which federal agencies (like the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, SEC, or CFTC) will have primary oversight responsibilities, potentially in coordination with state regulators. Prohibitions or Restrictions: Some proposals have considered restrictions or outright prohibitions on certain types of stablecoins, such as purely algorithmic stablecoins that lack traditional asset backing. Interoperability: Rules potentially aimed at ensuring different stablecoins can interact and be transferred easily across different platforms and blockchains. The agreement suggests that compromises have been reached on these potentially contentious points, finding a balance that satisfies a majority of lawmakers involved in the negotiations. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation in the US? This development around the GENIUS Act is a significant step, but it’s important to remember that it’s not the final word on crypto regulation US . The process involves several more hurdles: Senate Vote: The bill must pass the Senate. While the bipartisan agreement is positive, passage is not guaranteed and could still face procedural challenges or amendments. House Action: A similar or identical bill would need to pass the House of Representatives. If the House passes a different version, the two chambers would need to reconcile their differences in a conference committee. Presidential Assent: The final, identical bill passed by both the Senate and the House must be signed into law by the President. Even if the GENIUS Act becomes law, it primarily focuses on stablecoins. However, its passage could set a precedent and potentially build momentum for addressing other areas of crypto regulation, such as exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi), or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Challenges and Opportunities on the Horizon While the prospect of clear stablecoin regulation is widely seen as beneficial for fostering legitimacy and adoption, challenges remain. Critics might argue about the specifics of the bill’s requirements, potential burdens on smaller innovators, or the balance of power between federal and state regulators. The exact details, once released, will be crucial for assessing the bill’s full impact. However, the opportunity for the U.S. to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins is immense. It could enhance financial stability, protect consumers, and solidify the country’s position in the evolving global digital economy. A Step Forward for the US Stablecoin Bill The reported bipartisan agreement on the US stablecoin bill , the GENIUS Act, represents a potential breakthrough moment for crypto regulation in the U.S. It demonstrates that consensus is possible on digital asset policy and sets the stage for potential legislative action soon. While the details of the bill and its path through Congress are still unfolding, this development is a clear signal that policymakers are serious about establishing rules for this critical component of the crypto market. The coming days, particularly with the planned Senate vote, will be crucial in determining the immediate future of this significant legislative effort.

In a world where volatility is the norm, HTX DeepThink aims to help readers “ Find Order in Chaos .” What does Trump’s emerging token plan mean for crypto markets? Why is the Fed holding rates steady, and what will it take to shift course? Behind Bitcoin’s rebound, are hidden risks lurking? In this edition of HTX DeepThink, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research breaks it all down. Trump’s Media Group to Launch “Utility Token,” Potentially Ushering in a New Era of U.S. Equity Tokenization On April 30, 2025, the Trump Media & Technology Group announced in a shareholder letter that it would collaborate with the Truth digital wallet to launch a new utility token called DJT . Initially, DJT will be used for payments on the Truth+ subscription service, with plans to expand into broader use cases across the Truth ecosystem, including tipping and transactional functions. The DJT trademark already spans digital wallets, crypto payments, and digital asset platforms, and Truth Social’s official account has rebranded with the “DJT” suffix—signaling deep integration between the token and the social platform. This marks the first time a publicly listed U.S. media company is launching a utility token tied to a real-world product ecosystem, signifying a historic convergence between traditional equities and on-chain asset formats. Although the team has yet to announce a release date, blockchain platform, or tokenomics, the rollout appears to follow Trump’s classic strategy: hype first, details later . Market participants expect a multi-phase, media-driven launch to maximize attention and adoption. At a time when memecoin mania is cooling and narratives are shifting toward utility and payment integration, DJT is hitting the market at just the right moment. Similar to HTX’s recent listing of WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin, demand for “practical crypto assets” is surging. DJT combines powerful political branding with real ecosystem support, offering long-term value potential far beyond that of short-lived meme-driven tokens. U.S.-China Rapprochement Fuels Risk Appetite, But Core Frictions Persist This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Besant and Trade Representative Jamison Greer will meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Geneva, marking the first high-level U.S.-China trade talks since tensions escalated in spring 2025. Key discussion points include the rollback of 145% tariffs, updates to export control policies, and restoring duty-free treatment for small cross-border parcels. Although both sides still dispute who initiated the talks, the meeting alone sends a strong signal of reengagement and diplomatic thawing . With tariffs at historic highs, markets are interpreting the summit as a short-term de-escalation of geopolitical risks—sparking a relief rally in risk assets. Following the news, Bitcoin rose by approximately 3.6%, briefly surpassing $97,000. This reflects how sensitive capital flows remain to macro-level easing signals. While structural differences between the two nations are far from resolved, the current window of policy détente may offer a short-term liquidity boost for digital assets, gold, and tech stocks . Powell Throws : “Now Is Not the Time to Cut Rates” On May 8, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% for the third consecutive meeting. While this outcome was widely expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a noticeably more cautious tone during the press conference: “Now is not the time for us to lead with a rate cut.” “The cost of waiting is relatively low.” “Whether we cut this year depends on how things develop.” Powell emphasized that the U.S. is still grappling with stubborn inflation and that trade-related factors—especially tariffs—could add fresh upward pressure on prices. The Fed is currently caught in a “dual bind” : on one hand, disinflation has stalled, with PCE and CPI both above the 2% target. On the other, the central bank’s fiscal position is deteriorating. In FY2024, the Fed paid $226.8 billion in interest on reserves and reverse repos, but only earned $158.8 billion in interest income from its Treasury and MBS holdings—resulting in a $77.5 billion annual loss. A 25–30 bps rate cut could shave another $20 billion off annual income, further reducing remittances to the Treasury and raising concerns over the Fed’s policy independence. As a result, despite markets currently pricing in three rate cuts in 2025, the Fed is more likely to take a “data-driven, delayed transition” approach. Investors should be cautious of emotional trades that outpace macro fundamentals, particularly as key economic indicators have yet to show clear deterioration. Labor Market Resilience Delays Policy Shift: Powell Says Unemployment Will Be Key Trigger In April, U.S. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000—beating expectations—with the unemployment rate steady at 4.2%. Job gains were concentrated in healthcare, finance, and transportation. Although federal employment declined by 9,000 due to budget tightening, the labor market overall remains strong, showing no signs of systemic weakness. Against this backdrop, Powell reiterated that unemployment, not just inflation, will be the primary trigger for any policy pivot : “I can’t say what level of unemployment would be tolerable.” “We’ll assess overall labor market softness using comprehensive data.” This clearly sets the policy floor: only a material drop in payrolls or a sharp rise in unemployment (above 4.5%) could justify cutting rates even if inflation remains above target . BTC Stalls Near $99K: Options Market Shows No Clear Trend, Macro Data Will Dictate Direction Despite BTC rebounding to around $99,000 on geopolitical and monetary optimism, the options market is not confirming a strong directional bias. Deribit data shows implied volatility on June and July calls rising only modestly, while 25d risk reversals remain neutral to slightly bearish , and skew curves are relatively flat. Notably, large Gamma exposures are clustered around the $95,000–$100,000 range, indicating that BTC is currently trapped in a “high-volatility, low-conviction” zone awaiting macro catalysts. If CPI and jobs data for May–June remain hot, the Fed may push back on rate cut expectations— risking a BTC pullback . Conversely, if inflation cools and unemployment ticks up, Powell may pivot dovishly, providing a green light for BTC to break out of its volatility compression range and resume its bullish trend. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

44313755,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158307,1746687604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Powell’s Crucial Warning: US Tariffs Threaten Rate Cuts & Economic Outlook,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/powell-tariffs-rate-cuts/,"In the dynamic world of finance and cryptocurrency, understanding the signals from global economic leaders is paramount. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently delivered a significant update that casts a shadow of uncertainty over future economic policy, directly impacting the broader market sentiment that influences crypto valuations. His remarks focused heavily on the potential impact of ongoing trade negotiations and US tariffs , suggesting these policies could create headwinds for the economy and complicate the path forward for monetary policy. What Did Jerome Powell Say About Tariffs and Rate Cuts? Speaking on the current economic climate, Chairman Powell highlighted the unpredictable nature of tariff policies. He noted that while ongoing negotiations provide some data points, the persistence of high tariffs introduces a significant variable. Here are the core takeaways from his statement: Tariffs and 2025 Goals: Powell warned that persistent tariff policies have the potential to delay the Federal Reserve’s ability to meet its economic targets set for 2025. These targets typically involve goals related to inflation, employment, and stable economic growth. Trade barriers can disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and dampen economic activity, making these goals harder to achieve on schedule. Interest Rate Cuts Unlikely Now: Given the high level of uncertainty introduced by trade policy, Powell stated that preemptive interest rate cuts would be difficult under current conditions. The Fed prefers to have a clearer economic picture before making significant policy shifts like lowering borrowing costs. Uncertainty makes it harder to forecast the economic impact of rate changes. Prepared to Respond: Despite the uncertainty, Powell assured that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and is prepared to respond quickly should economic issues arise or conditions change significantly. This indicates the central bank is monitoring the situation closely and has tools ready if needed. Why Do US Tariffs Create Economic Uncertainty? Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, introduce uncertainty into the economic outlook for several reasons: Firstly, they can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, escalating trade disputes. This creates instability for businesses involved in international trade, affecting export markets and global supply chains. Companies may delay investment decisions due to unpredictable costs and market access. Secondly, tariffs can increase the cost of imported raw materials and components for domestic producers, potentially leading to higher consumer prices (inflation) or reduced profit margins. This complicates the Fed’s inflation management goals. Thirdly, the outcome and duration of tariff negotiations are often unclear, making it difficult for economists and businesses to forecast future trade flows and economic growth accurately. This lack of clarity is precisely what Jerome Powell emphasized as a barrier to policy adjustments like cutting interest rates. How Does Federal Reserve Policy Impact Crypto? While Powell’s comments are about traditional economics, the actions and signals from the Federal Reserve have a profound impact on financial markets globally, including cryptocurrencies. Here’s the connection: Interest rate policy influences the cost of capital and the attractiveness of different asset classes. When interest rates are low (or expected to be cut), traditional low-yield investments like bonds become less appealing. This can push investors towards riskier assets like stocks and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies, in search of higher returns. Conversely, higher rates can make safer assets more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Economic uncertainty, as highlighted by Powell regarding tariffs, can also influence investor behavior. High uncertainty might lead to risk-off sentiment, where investors sell riskier assets (like crypto) and move into safer havens. However, prolonged uncertainty or economic slowdowns could also potentially strengthen the narrative for decentralized assets like Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Challenges Posed by Tariffs to 2025 Goals The challenges tariffs pose to the Fed’s 2025 objectives are multifaceted: Inflation Volatility: Tariffs can cause sudden price spikes for specific goods, making it harder for the Fed to manage overall inflation towards its target. Slower Growth: Reduced trade and investment due to tariffs can dampen overall economic growth, making full employment targets harder to reach. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses may struggle to adapt quickly to changing trade rules, leading to inefficiencies and impacting productivity. Reduced Business Confidence: Uncertainty about future trade policy can erode confidence, leading to reduced capital expenditure and hiring. These factors collectively make the economic environment less predictable, complicating the precise calibration of monetary policy needed to achieve stable growth and price stability by 2025. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Reader What does this mean for those navigating the cryptocurrency market? Firstly, stay informed about macroeconomics. Signals from the Federal Reserve and discussions around policies like US tariffs are not isolated events; they are crucial indicators of the broader economic health and liquidity environment that impacts crypto markets. Secondly, understand that periods of increased economic uncertainty often lead to higher market volatility across all asset classes, including crypto. Be prepared for potential price swings driven by shifts in global sentiment. Finally, consider how different economic scenarios (e.g., prolonged uncertainty, potential future rate cuts if conditions change) might affect your investment strategy. This isn’t financial advice, but a prompt to think critically about the macro backdrop. Summary: Navigating Uncertainty Jerome Powell ‘s recent comments underscore a critical point: trade policy, specifically the use of tariffs, is a significant source of economic uncertainty right now. This uncertainty makes it difficult for the Federal Reserve to commit to near-term policy easing like interest rate cuts and could potentially delay the achievement of key economic goals by 2025. For the cryptocurrency community, these developments are a reminder that the performance of digital assets is often intertwined with the health and stability of the traditional financial system and the macroeconomic policies that govern it. Staying aware of these signals from policymakers is essential for understanding the broader market context.

At the time of writing, the asset trades at $97,005, reflecting a modest 2.6% gain over the past seven days and a 3.3% increase in the last 24 hours. While volatility remains subdued, recent on-chain data highlights a steady rise in investor activity that could hint at future price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin In The Middle Of A Decision Point, Analyst Says—Here’s Why Bitcoin Investor Confidence Reflected in On-Chain Metrics CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alemán has outlined an ongoing trend that points to sustained investor interest. In a recent QuickTake post, Alemán noted that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, representing the aggregate value of coins based on their last movement, has reached an all-time high for the third consecutive week. The metric, calculated by multiplying each unspent transaction output (UTXO) by its purchase price, rose to $890.7 billion, indicating growing capital inflow into the asset. According to Alemán, the consistent climb in Bitcoin’s Realized Cap demonstrates a continuation of accumulation by both long-term and short-term holders. The increased capital invested in BTC over the past few weeks suggests that market participants are positioning themselves for a potential price breakout. This pattern of capital inflow may be laying the groundwork for a stronger bullish phase if sustained investment continues. Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs) appear to be increasing their stakes during this consolidation period. Alemán emphasized that the rising Realized Cap does more than reflect price, as it also captures market conviction. The metric signals a growing belief in Bitcoin’s longer-term value proposition when paired with steady accumulation trends. If historical patterns repeat, the market may be in the early stages of forming a new uptrend. Coinbase Premium Gap Signals Localized Pressure Despite the on-chain optimism, other indicators suggest reasons for caution. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Abramchart, recently highlighted the Coinbase Premium Gap as a sign of regional bearish sentiment. The gap, which was at -5.07 at the time of reporting, means Bitcoin is trading lower on Coinbase, an exchange largely dominated by US investors, compared to global platforms. This negative gap is often interpreted as an indicator of selling pressure from American participants. Abramchart noted that although the premium had previously recovered, the recent decline aligns with Bitcoin’s failure to push beyond the $97,000 level. Persistent negative values in the premium gap typically signal weak demand in the US market, which could act as a headwind to upward momentum. If the gap continues to trend downward, it may reinforce current price stagnation despite broader accumulation trends.

CZ, once the crypto world’s golden boy, said on the Farokh Radio podcast aired on Tuesday that he “wouldn’t mind” a pardon and that his lawyers had filed the paperwork on his behalf two weeks ago. “We only submitted after the Bloomberg article and the Wall Street Journal article came out,” Zhao posited. He was referring to two stories published in March that reported he was seeking a pardon from President Trump amid discussions of a potential business deal between the Trump family and Binance.US. The Binance founder refuted the reports at the time but did not rule out the possibility of seeking a pardon. He claimed that seeing the news reports prompted the application for clemency. “If they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply,” he said on the recent podcast. He further noted that the President’s pardon of three co-founders of the BitMEX crypto exchange , including Arthur Hayes, encouraged him to also seek a pardon. CZ pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in 2023, agreeing to step down as CEO and receiving a lifetime ban from “managing or operating” Binance. He was released from a 4-month stint in prison in September after also agreeing to pay a $50 million fine, while Binance agreed to pay a record-setting $4.3 billion . After stepping down, CZ was replaced by former Abu Dhabi regulator Richard Teng, who has led Binance to invest heavily in regulatory compliance, which he described as “Binance 2.0.” No Plans To Return As Binance CEO In the U.S., the President can forgive individuals convicted of crimes in what is called a ‘pardon.’ If pardoned, it will not effectively wipe Zhao’s money laundering conviction from his record; however, it could potentially allow him to return as CEO of Binance. However, CZ clarified during the podcast that he has no interest in returning to the CEO position despite seeking a presidential pardon. “I’m not really looking to become CEO of Binance again,” quipped Zhao. Regardless, he remains Binance’s biggest shareholder, owning an estimated 90% stake in the world’s largest digital asset exchange.",Cryptocurrency|News|Binance|Changpeng Zhao|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-08 07:01:47

Eurizon SLJ Capital’s analysts Stephen Jen and Joana Freireat say in a new investment note that Asian investors have accumulated a massive pile of USD that could be ditched en masse if trade wars intensify and the dollar weakens, reports Bloomberg. According to the analysts, if the US-driven trade conflict grows, a significant number of Asian investors could bring substantial capital back home or seek to bolster their defenses against a declining USD. That, they warn, could leave the dollar facing a $2.5 trillion “avalanche” of selling. “We suspect these dollar hoardings by Asian exporters and institutional investors may be extremely large – possibly on the order of $2.5 trillion or so – and pose sharp downside risks to the dollar vis-à-vis these Asian currencies.” Bloomberg says its dollar gauge has dropped about 8% from a February high. Meanwhile, Asian currencies have strengthened versus the greenback in the past month. President Trump signed an executive order in April that imposed a 10% tariff on all imported goods entering the US, with the stated aim of increasing domestic manufacturing. The President also issued a proclamation that slapped reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries. The Trump administration says it is currently engaging with more than a dozen countries around the world to craft new trade deals. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are set to meet with their Chinese counterparts to discuss trade and economic issues in Switzerland this week.

The surge follows a May 8 announcement on Truth Social by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he would host a press conference in the Oval Office the following day to announce a “major trade deal” with a “big” and “highly respected” country. Trump described the deal as “the first of many,” suggesting more international agreements could follow. Although Trump didn’t mention a specific country, The New York Times reported it is expected to be the United Kingdom, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. Traders welcomed the update as a potential step toward easing global trade pressures. Tariffs have been a key concern for markets in recent months, with earlier moves by the Trump administration leading to volatility across equities and crypto. You might also like: Trump adviser hints China tariffs could drop ‘within weeks’ as Bitcoin rallies Bitcoin ( BTC ) last reached an all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20, shortly before Trump’s inauguration. The asset fell sharply after the U.S. raised tariffs on China in April, dropping from over $88,000 to a low of $74,500. It has since rebounded steadily, buoyed by renewed exchange-traded funds inflows, a weaker dollar, and improving investor sentiment. In a separate but related development, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is also slated to meet with Chinese top officials in Switzerland this week. This is a significant development as U.S.-China relations have remained tense following mutual tariff hikes in April. The meeting marks the first formal attempt to ease the tariffs stalemate, which had dragged Bitcoin down below $75,000 before its current rebound. Bitcoin’s recent recovery has also been supported by other macro tailwinds. The Federal Reserve’s May 7 decision to hold interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50% gave markets some relief, even as Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited “heightened uncertainty” due to Trump’s trade policy. Powell stressed the economy’s resilience and low unemployment as reasons to hold off on tightening further. He also acknowledged that inflation is still above target. With momentum growing and macro conditions stabilizing, a break above $100,000 for Bitcoin now appears to be achievable in the coming days. Bulls are watching closely as the asset tests a key psychological level.

For those following the disruptive potential of AI and automation, the latest development from the e-commerce giant offers a fascinating glimpse into the future of supply chains and logistics. Amazon has unveiled a new addition to its growing fleet of Amazon warehouse robots that brings a unique capability: a sense of touch. Introducing the Amazon Vulcan Robot Amazon’s newest creation, named Vulcan, is designed to tackle some of the more complex tasks within its vast storage facilities. Unlike previous generations of robots primarily focused on moving entire shelves or simple pick-and-place operations, the Amazon Vulcan robot is engineered for finer manipulation. Its standout feature is its ability to ‘feel’ the items it interacts with, thanks to integrated force sensors. Here’s a closer look at what makes Vulcan unique: Dual-Arm Design: Vulcan features two distinct arms. One is used for rearranging items within storage compartments, clearing space or organizing. Advanced Grasping: The second arm is equipped with both a camera for visual identification and a suction cup gripper. This combination allows it to locate and pick specific items. Tactile Feedback: The crucial innovation lies in the force sensors. These provide the robot with tactile feedback, allowing it to sense contact and potentially adjust its grip or movement based on the pressure it feels. This is a significant step towards more dexterous robotic manipulation. AI Training: Amazon states that Vulcan was trained using physical data, including force and touch feedback. This training enables it to pick approximately 75% of Amazon’s diverse stock. Self-Improvement: The robot is also designed with the capacity for self-improvement over time, suggesting a machine learning component that allows it to refine its picking strategies based on experience. AI Robotics in Action: Deployment and Performance The Amazon Vulcan robot isn’t just a lab prototype; it’s already being deployed in real-world warehouse environments. Amazon has placed Vulcan robots in operation in Spokane, Washington, and Hamburg, Germany. These early deployments are already showing promising results. According to Amazon, the Vulcan robots have processed half a million orders to date across these locations. This demonstrates their capability to handle actual customer fulfillment tasks and integrate into existing logistics workflows. The deployment highlights the practical application of AI robotics in enhancing operational efficiency. The Bigger Picture: Warehouse Automation at Amazon Vulcan is merely the latest iteration in Amazon’s extensive investment in warehouse automation. The company utilizes hundreds of thousands of robots globally to assist in fulfilling customer orders. These range from Kiva robots that move entire shelves to robotic arms that sort packages. The goal of this widespread warehouse automation is multi-faceted. It aims to increase the speed and accuracy of order fulfillment, reduce operational costs, and potentially improve safety by handling repetitive or heavy lifting tasks. The introduction of more sophisticated AI robotics like Vulcan signifies a move towards automating tasks that previously required human dexterity and judgment. Logistics AI and the Future Workforce The increasing integration of AI and robotics, particularly in areas like logistics AI, often sparks debate about the impact on human employment. Critics frequently express concern that Amazon’s substantial investments in automation are primarily aimed at replacing human workers. Amazon, however, counters this perspective. The company argues that robots like Vulcan serve to make warehouses safer places for human employees. By automating tasks that might involve repetitive strain, awkward movements, or working in confined spaces, they can potentially reduce workplace injuries. Amazon maintains that these robots work alongside human employees, handling specific tasks while people focus on others that require more complex problem-solving, judgment, or direct interaction. While the long-term impact on the workforce remains a subject of ongoing discussion, the immediate focus for Amazon appears to be on augmenting capabilities and enhancing efficiency through advanced AI robotics and warehouse automation. Conclusion The debut of the Amazon Vulcan robot marks a significant step forward in AI robotics, bringing a sense of ‘touch’ to warehouse automation. This capability allows the robot to handle a wider variety of items with greater precision, integrating tactile feedback into its operations. As the Amazon Vulcan robot is deployed and learns in real-world environments, it demonstrates the practical application of advanced logistics AI in optimizing fulfillment processes. While the debate surrounding automation and jobs continues, Amazon positions these developments as enhancing safety and efficiency within its vast network of Amazon warehouse robots, pointing towards a future where humans and advanced machines collaborate to meet the demands of global e-commerce.

Geoff Kendrick, the head of research at Standard Chartered Bank, disclosed his bullish outlook for the altcoin in a report shared on Tuesday. Kendrick notably asserts that BNB, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could hit a $2,775 price point by 2028. The price forecast, slightly bold, suggests that BNB bulls could accumulate gains going up to 364.047% over three years. As the analyst wrote in the research report; “BNB has traded almost exactly in line with an unweighted basket of bitcoin and ether since May 2021 in terms of both returns and volatility,” Kendrick’s optimistic outlook centers on the success of the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which he believes has armed the BNB token with long-term potential. With Binance maintaining its position as one of the top exchanges, “BNB’s value drivers are unlikely to change anytime soon,” the analyst added. The recent BNB spot-based ETF filing from VanEck has bolstered trust among key players, who are confident that an approval from the U.S. SEC could catalyze a major price rally. Despite upholding a bullish sentiment, Standard Chartered maintains that the asset faces many risks and market barriers. The bank observed that regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and macro instability could extensively affect growth. Meanwhile, BNB has entered the new week with bulls reclaiming buying power. As a result, the asset has cleared off losses from the previous weekend and is now emerging as the best performer within the top 5 category.

Both tokens are missing important safety details, have no verified on-chain data, lack proper audits, and offer no information about their creators. This has raised concerns that these projects could be rug pulls or misleading schemes, aiming to trap unsuspecting investors. What’s more worrying is that these token names are linked to sensitive recent events in India. ‘Operation Sindoor’ refers to an Indian military strike on terror camps in Pakistan, carried out after a deadly terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir. Using these high-profile, emotional events to name crypto tokens seems like an attempt to exploit public sentiment and current news trends — a tactic sadly seen before in the crypto world. Concerns Over Pump and Dump Schemes Most of these tokens have small market caps and low trading volumes. Some of these appeared just hours after India launched the precision strikes on Tuesday. This has led to concerns over possible rug pulls or misleading schemes that may involve risks of pump-and-dump schemes. Memecoins, especially the ones launched on platforms like Solana’s Pump.fun, often see volatile price swings. These memecoins lack any intrinsic value and heavily depend on the hype and social media trends. Investors should be careful and avoid interacting with such unverified tokens, with no proper safety measures, that use trending or sensitive names to draw attention. CZ Shares A Peace Message Binance’s Changpeng Zhao shared a message of unity, as he called for peace and requested focus on economic growth and tech innovations to bring communities together. After the attack, Bitcoin’s price quickly fell below $96,300 on Tuesday. It is currently trading at $99,032, up 2.5% in the past day.

The venture, named Nakamoto after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin , Satoshi Nakamoto, aims to become a publicly traded company focused on acquiring and holding the cryptocurrency, CNBC reported , citing people familiar with the matter. The Information was first to cover the story. The funding round, which has been quietly in motion since January, includes $200 million in equity and $100 million in convertible debt, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC. While the firm has not officially announced the raise, an official reveal and merger with a Nasdaq-listed company is expected as early as next week. The combined entity is set to go public this summer, per the report. “No comment,” Bailey wrote in a May 7 post on X, apparently in response to the news about the Bitcoin ( BTC ) investment firm. Source: David Bailey Related: Texas House committee passes Bitcoin reserve bill for full floor vote New Bitcoin firms are launching Nakamoto’s strategy is modeled on that of companies like Strategy, which transformed itself into a Bitcoin-holding powerhouse under Michael Saylor. The firm will invest in and acquire businesses globally, in countries such as Brazil, Thailand and South Africa, while deploying Bitcoin as part of its capital structure. The venture is reportedly backed by high-profile investors and includes an advisory board featuring several prominent figures from the financial and crypto sectors. Bailey’s move comes amid renewed enthusiasm for institutional Bitcoin investment, following a series of major fundraising announcements from firms like Twenty One and Strive Asset Management. Related: Trump-linked Strive files for ‘Bitcoin Bond’ ETF On April 24, Twenty One Capital, led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald, said it was looking to supplant Saylor’s Strategy to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” On May 7, Strive Asset Management, founded by entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, also revealed plans to transition into a Bitcoin treasury company. Source: David Bailey The firm is going public through a reverse merger and plans to use the combined company’s stock to accumulate Bitcoin. Once the deal closes, Strive plans to issue about $1 billion in equity and debt and use the proceeds to accumulate BTC. “The pace of these new BTC companies launching is accelerating,” crypto influencer TylerD said in a post on X.

44314477,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158329,1746688835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shockwave: SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony Enters Not Guilty Plea in Federal Court,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/safemoon-ceo-not-guilty/,"The legal troubles surrounding the popular yet controversial cryptocurrency project SafeMoon continue to unfold. In a significant development, the former SafeMoon CEO , Braden John Karony, has formally entered a not guilty plea in a federal court, pushing forward a trial that will scrutinize the operations and financial handling of the company’s assets. What Charges Does the Former SafeMoon CEO Face? Braden John Karony is facing serious allegations brought forth by U.S. federal prosecutors. The charges against him are grave and center on financial misconduct within the cryptocurrency space: Securities Fraud Conspiracy: Alleging that he conspired to defraud investors in connection with the offer and sale of SafeMoon securities. Wire Fraud Conspiracy: Accusing him of conspiring to commit wire fraud, typically involving the use of electronic communications to facilitate a fraudulent scheme. Money Laundering Conspiracy: Charging him with conspiring to launder money derived from illegal activities, specifically the alleged fraud and embezzlement of SFM token funds. These charges paint a picture of alleged deliberate actions to deceive investors and misuse funds intended for the project’s development or held by the company. The Road to the Not Guilty Plea: The Background SafeMoon gained significant traction in the cryptocurrency market in 2021, attracting a large community of investors drawn to its unique tokenomics, which included static rewards, LP acquisition, and manual burns. However, the project was plagued by accusations of being a pump-and-dump scheme and concerns over the safety of its liquidity pool, which was allegedly not fully locked as initially claimed. Investigations into SafeMoon’s practices intensified, leading to the arrest of key figures, including Braden Karony. The core of the government’s case revolves around allegations that millions of dollars worth of SFM tokens , which investors believed were secure or being used for legitimate project purposes, were instead embezzled and used for personal gain or other unauthorized activities between March 2021 and November 2022. Inside the Courtroom: Braden Karony’s Defense By entering a not guilty plea , Braden Karony asserts his innocence against all charges. This means his defense team will challenge the government’s evidence and narrative during the trial. The trial is currently underway in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, located in Brooklyn. The proceedings are expected to delve deep into SafeMoon’s internal workings, financial records, and communications among its leadership. The defense will likely argue that Karony did not engage in fraudulent conspiracies or money laundering, that the funds were handled appropriately according to company practices, or that the government’s interpretation of events is incorrect. Court trials involving complex financial instruments like cryptocurrencies and alleged large-scale fraud can be lengthy and intricate, requiring expert testimony and detailed examination of digital trails. What Does This Mean for SFM Token Holders and the Crypto Community? For holders of the SFM token , the trial’s outcome is of paramount importance. A conviction could further damage the token’s already precarious standing and potentially impact any future recovery or legal actions taken by investors. Conversely, an acquittal could provide a degree of vindication, although the project’s reputation has already suffered significant damage due to the allegations and associated crypto fraud concerns. More broadly, this case, like others involving high-profile crypto projects and their leaders, highlights the increasing scrutiny from regulatory bodies on the cryptocurrency space. It serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in investing in unregulated or less-regulated projects and the potential for malfeasance by those in positions of power within these organizations. The outcome could set precedents for how similar cases of alleged crypto fraud are handled in the future. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Investors The SafeMoon saga presents several challenges and offers crucial insights for anyone involved in cryptocurrency: Lack of Transparency: Many crypto projects, including SafeMoon, have been criticized for a lack of clear, verifiable transparency regarding fund management and project development. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape means that legal interpretations of crypto activities, especially regarding securities laws, are still being shaped. Due Diligence is Crucial: Investors must conduct thorough research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research) before investing. Look for audits, clear documentation, transparent teams, and verifiable use of funds. Be Wary of Hype: Projects promising unrealistic returns or relying heavily on marketing buzz without substance should be approached with extreme caution. This case underscores the need for vigilance in the crypto market. While innovation abounds, so do potential pitfalls. The Trial Continues The trial of the former SafeMoon CEO , Braden John Karony, is scheduled to run until May 26th. As proceedings continue, more details are expected to emerge regarding the government’s evidence and the defense’s strategy. The verdict will undoubtedly be a significant event for the SafeMoon community and will resonate within the broader discussion about accountability and investor protection in the digital asset space. Summary: A High-Stakes Legal Battle In summary, the legal battle involving former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony is a critical development for the project and the crypto world. His not guilty plea sets the stage for a federal trial addressing serious allegations of securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracies tied to the alleged embezzlement of SFM token funds. This case highlights ongoing concerns about crypto fraud and the importance of regulatory oversight and investor caution in the fast-paced digital asset market. The outcome will be closely watched as it could influence future legal approaches to similar cases.

As a result, the stock market has recorded massive losses over the past weeks. On the flip side, the crypto market has managed to stay afloat, with the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin outpacing stocks on multiple occasions. As David Duong, the Head of Research at Coinbase Institution, observed in a recent interview with Ash Bennington, the trend kicked off on Liberation Day, after April 2nd. As Juong is quoted as saying; “Stocks were trading down like 4 to 5 Standard Deviations lower. Whereas Bitcoin was moving maybe one and a half Standard Deviations Lower. And it happens not just for one day, but for several.” The development further suggests that Bitcoin, a somewhat volatile asset, has managed to maintain stability through the ongoing market chaos. “So you’re seeing that really from a risk-adjusted perspective, crypto in general and Bitcoin specifically is actually doing a lot better than we’ve been seeing inside traditional assets,” Juong observed. Bitcoin forges ahead as bulls prepare to test the $100,000 price mark The big bull has remained on course, with bullish momentum sustained over the past week, propelling bulls to attempt to reclaim the $100,000 price level. Data from Glassnode shows that Bitcoin has successfully tapped $97,900, a price level last seen two months ago. The rebound in Bitcoin’s price has strengthened investors’ confidence, bolstering optimism amongst market participants ahead of the coming days.

Top Analyst Predicts a 100x Rally to $2.50,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-mutuum-finance-take-on-shiba-inu-in-the-upcoming-bull-run-top-analyst-predicts-a-100x-rally-to-2-50/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be the reigning meme coin marvel, but its dominance could be challenged in the next bull run by a fast-rising DeFi coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently priced at just $0.025, top analysts are predicting a staggering 10,000% rally that could see MUTM hit $2.50 in 2025 from its current price. At $0.025 in its Phase 4 presale, Mutuum Finance has already enrolled over 9,600 investors and has raked in $7.8 million. With more than half of this round already gone, a 20% price hike to $0.03 is just around the corner as Phase 5 looms. Phase 4 investors can now stand to gain as much as 140% once the token goes live at its projected $0.06 opening price. As investor interest rapidly builds and presale phases fill up fast, the question isn’t whether MUTM can match SHIB’s momentum, but whether it might just outpace it entirely. Presale Momentum and Launch Day Valuation Confirmation Mutuum Finance is in presale at $0.025 and thus a very sought-after token among investors. Phase 4 token holders will be rewarded with a 20% increase in value when the token hits Phase 5. Although the starting price when the token will go live will be $0.06, there are certain crypto experts who are predicting a stunning spike, by as much as $2.5, in the near future when the token goes on sale. This vicious price prediction compared to current presale value is the reason why MUTM continues to stir passionate debate among low-price DeFi project supporters. Driving DeFi Innovation with a Next-Gen Lending System Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in the DeFi arena through its two-model lending approach. Through its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) architecture, users can lend stablecoins to smart contract pools for returns. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) option permits borrowers and lenders to communicate with one another without intermediaries, generating a more agile lending platform. This twin mechanism offers an effortless and decentralized experience for users who want stability and returns. A full Certik audit is ongoing to further verify Mutuum Finance’s smart contract design. Along with its open-source status, the audit should increase transparency and improve confidence as the platform grows. Encouraging Community Development through Strategic Incentives To promote long-term engagement, Mutuum Finance has launched several reward schemes. An ongoing $100,000 giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. There is also a referral scheme that promotes community expansion by rewarding users who invite others to the platform. Early adopters also get access to feature updates and platform enhancements, promoting long-term user engagement and loyalty. Mutuum Finance also seeks to mitigate the volatility associated with algorithmic stablecoins by launching a fully USD-backed, over-collateralized stablecoin. The stablecoin will provide more predictability and a stable base for lending and borrowing operations on the platform. Smart Tokenomics With Long-Term Focus One of the revolutionary aspects of the Mutuum Finance model is its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. The Buy-and-Distribute mechanism is to purchase tokens in the open market and redistribute them to stakers, which ensures frequent user engagement and sustains the tokenomics of the project. By matching supply and rewarding users on a regular basis, the strategy entices committed, long-term investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been the face of meme coins, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a serious coin. At just $0.025 during its Phase 4 presale, analysts are predicting a 10,000% rally, potentially sending MUTM to $2.50 by 2025. With $7.8 million already raised and 9,600+ investors, MUTM is gaining momentum fast. As Phase 4 nears its end, the price will rise 20%, and Phase 5 will see even higher gains for early adopters. Now is the time to act before it hits the next big wave.

44314734,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158326,1746689401,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US OCC Gives Banks Green Light for Trading Crypto Assets: A Pivotal Shift,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-occ-banks-crypto/,"Big news shaking up the intersection of traditional finance and the digital asset world! The US OCC , the primary regulator for national banks in the United States, has issued guidance that could fundamentally change how financial institutions crypto services are offered. If you’ve been wondering when your bank might finally offer easy ways to access digital currencies, this development is a significant step forward. What Did the US OCC Announce Regarding Banks and Crypto? In a notable shift from previous, more cautious stances, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has clarified its position on national banks engaging with cryptocurrency. According to recent statements, the OCC confirms that banks operating under its charter have the authority to act upon customer requests to buy and sell cryptocurrency assets. Key takeaways from the OCC’s guidance include: Execution of Trades: Banks can facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies when directed by their customers. This isn’t about banks trading on their own books speculatively, but rather acting as agents for their clients. Custody Services: The guidance reinforces banks’ ability to hold cryptocurrency assets in custody for customers, a position the OCC had previously indicated. Outsourcing Capabilities: Banks are explicitly allowed to partner with third parties to handle the technical aspects of custody and trade execution. This acknowledges the specialized infrastructure often required for digital assets. The OCC stressed that these activities must be conducted within the bounds of safety and soundness requirements. Essentially, while granting more freedom, the regulator still expects banks to manage risks appropriately. Why is This US OCC Stance Important for Trading Crypto? This regulatory clarity from the US OCC is crucial for the broader adoption and legitimization of trading crypto within traditional financial frameworks. For years, banks have been hesitant to dive deep into crypto services due to perceived regulatory ambiguity and risk aversion. This guidance provides a clearer path forward. Here’s why it matters: Increased Access: For everyday consumers and institutional investors, accessing crypto through their existing banking relationships could become significantly easier and potentially safer compared to navigating potentially less regulated crypto-native platforms. Institutional Confidence: More explicit permission from a major regulator like the OCC can boost confidence among financial institutions crypto departments, encouraging them to invest in the necessary infrastructure and compliance frameworks. Market Liquidity: As more traditional players enter the space, it could potentially increase liquidity in the crypto markets. Enhanced Security: Banks are accustomed to robust security and compliance protocols. Integrating crypto services into this environment could offer customers a higher level of security and consumer protection. This builds upon previous actions by the OCC, such as lifting a ban on banks providing cryptocurrency services and easing regulations that were seen as discriminatory against certain crypto-related businesses. The trend indicates a move towards integrating digital assets into the traditional banking system, albeit cautiously. What Challenges Do Banks Still Face with Crypto Regulation? While the OCC’s stance is positive for banks crypto integration, significant challenges remain. Navigating the complex landscape of crypto regulation involves more than just the OCC. Key challenges include: Regulatory Patchwork: Banks must contend with rules from multiple agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, FinCEN, and potentially the SEC and CFTC depending on the nature of the digital asset. Harmonizing these different regulatory perspectives is complex. Compliance Costs: Implementing robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures for crypto assets is technically demanding and expensive. Banks need systems to monitor transactions on public blockchains and identify associated risks. Technology Integration: Safely integrating blockchain technology and crypto asset management systems into existing banking infrastructure requires significant investment and technical expertise. Risk Management: Banks must develop sophisticated risk management frameworks to address the volatility of crypto assets, cybersecurity threats specific to digital wallets, and operational risks associated with new technologies. Talent Acquisition: Finding and retaining talent with expertise in both traditional finance and blockchain technology is crucial. Despite the OCC’s green light, the path for financial institutions crypto services is not without hurdles. Each bank will need to carefully assess its capabilities and risk appetite before offering extensive crypto services. Examples and Actionable Insights for Financial Institutions Following the OCC’s guidance, we are likely to see more banks exploring or expanding their crypto offerings. While specific examples of major banks launching extensive trading crypto services directly to retail customers are still emerging, many have already begun with: Custody Services: Offering institutional clients secure storage for digital assets. Blockchain Technology Exploration: Using blockchain for internal processes like payments or trade finance. Investment Products: Providing access to crypto investment products like futures or trusts (often through brokerage arms). For banks considering entering this space or expanding their footprint, actionable insights include: Understand the Regulatory Landscape: Go beyond the OCC and understand the expectations of all relevant regulators. Develop Robust Compliance Programs: Build out AML/KYC and transaction monitoring systems specifically tailored for crypto assets. Invest in Secure Technology: Prioritize secure custody solutions and reliable trading infrastructure, whether built in-house or outsourced to trusted partners. Educate Staff: Ensure employees understand the basics of crypto assets and associated risks. Start Small and Scale: Consider starting with limited offerings, such as custody for institutional clients, before moving into more complex areas like retail trading. The move by the US OCC is a signal that the regulatory environment is evolving, making it increasingly viable for financial institutions crypto strategies to move from theoretical discussions to practical implementation. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation and Banks? The OCC’s guidance is a significant piece of the puzzle but not the final word on crypto regulation for banks. Future developments will likely include: Further Clarity from Other Regulators: The Federal Reserve and FDIC are expected to provide more detailed guidance on specific crypto activities. Potential Legislation: Congress may introduce legislation to create a more unified framework for digital assets. International Coordination: Regulators globally are working on frameworks, and U.S. rules will need to consider international standards. Focus on Specific Asset Types: Regulations may differentiate more clearly between stablecoins, utility tokens, and other digital asset categories. The trajectory suggests a future where banks crypto services are more common, but the pace and nature of adoption will be heavily influenced by ongoing regulatory developments and how effectively banks manage the inherent risks of trading crypto . Conclusion: A New Era for Banks and Digital Assets The U.S. OCC’s confirmation that national banks can act on customer requests to buy and sell crypto assets marks a pivotal moment. It signals a growing acceptance of digital assets within the traditional financial system and provides a clearer regulatory runway for financial institutions crypto strategies. While challenges related to compliance, technology, and the broader regulatory landscape remain, this guidance is a strong indicator that accessing and trading crypto through established banking channels is becoming a tangible reality. This move by the US OCC doesn’t just affect banks; it has implications for investors, consumers, and the future direction of crypto regulation in the United States.

According to Bill Morgan, the long-standing battle between the U.S. regulatory body and the cryptocurrency firm Ripple has not officially come to an end. The lawyer’s notation has left market players more uncertain, as Ripple participants had already begun to celebrate Ripple’s perceived victory over the previous weeks. Notably, the four-year legal battle reportedly came to a close after Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, made a big revelation in April, stating that the case against the company had been dissolved. “Today is a victory—and a long overdue surrender by the SEC,” he remarked. Ripple proponents were understandably convinced that the firm had emerged victorious, mainly because the SEC had dropped multiple investigations and lawsuits filed against other notable cryptocurrency companies. Remarkably, the regulator is yet to acknowledge and affirm Garlinghouse’s statement officially, although market participants have continued to maintain optimism. However, as the lawyer observed, certainty can only be guaranteed after court proceedings have been carried out. “It [the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit] is not over yet. Things need to happen first in court”. He wrote . In a follow-up post, the lawyer further highlighted Ripple’s Q1 2025 quarterly market report, noting that the crypto firm has officially referenced the lawsuit. “I think this is the first explicit public reference by Ripple that the SEC agreed to request that the Court vacate the permanent injunction.” Bill Morgan raised concerns over notations on the report, stating that the SEC has officially withdrawn its appeal, despite the SEC commissioner not making any formal statement on the situation. https://twitter.com/belisarius2020/status/1919703964276105438?s=46&t=qzsvHvtDB3yjTaoaylh-2g The lawyer’s assertion comes as Ripple’s CLO Stuart Aldertoty reiterated that the SEC’s lawsuit was filed without proper legal justification.

The leak included a MySQL database dump shared publicly online. It contained crypto-related information that could help blockchain analysts trace the group’s illicit financial flows. Ransomware is a type of malware used by malicious actors. It locks its target’s files or computer systems, making them inaccessible. The attackers typically demand a ransom payment, often in digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), in exchange for a decryption key to unlock the files. LockBit is one of the most notorious crypto ransomware groups. In February 2024, 10 countries launched a joint operation to disrupt the group, saying that the organization had caused billions in damages to key infrastructure. Source: ReyXBF No Bitcoin private keys leaked While almost 60,000 Bitcoin wallets were leaked, no private keys were included. One X user shared a conversation with a LockBit operator, confirming the breach. However, the LockBit person said no private keys or data were lost. Despite this, analysts at Bleeping Computer said the database contained 20 tables, including a “builds” table. This included individual ransomware builds created by the organization’s affiliates. The data also identified some of the target companies for the builds. In addition, the leaked database also included a “chats” table. This table contained over 4,400 negotiation messages between victims and the ransomware organization. Related: Crypto crime in 2024 likely exceeded $51B, far higher than reported: Chainalysis LockBit hack tied to Everest ransomware breach It’s unclear who was behind the breach and how they got into LockBit’s operations, but Bleeping Computer analysts said the message used in the Everest ransomware site breach matched the one used in LockBit. The analysts suggested that there may be a link between the two incidents. The breach highlighted the role that crypto plays in the ransomware economy. Each victim is usually assigned an address to pay their ransom, allowing the affiliates to monitor payments while attempting to obscure ties to their main wallets. The exposure of the addresses allows law enforcement and blockchain investigators to track patterns and potentially link past ransom payments to known wallets.

In a recent post on X, Peterson said the Fed has made a big mistake by tightening monetary policy too much. According to him, this move is hurting the U.S. economy—and stopping Bitcoin from reaching its true potential. Is the Fed Making the Economy Worse? Peterson explained that the Fed has reduced the money supply too aggressively, which is now causing deflation. He pointed out that falling prices, lower spending, and slowing growth are signs that the economy is weakening—not strengthening. “The Fed still doesn’t realize the real issue is its own policy,” Peterson wrote. He believes the U.S. economy is shrinking because there isn’t enough money circulating. This situation makes it harder for both businesses and consumers to thrive. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Advances to $100K-Has The BTC Bull Run Begun?

Investors, he says, should be cautious and make selective decisions moving forward. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

XRP price action has shown notable volatility, with price moving from support levels around $2.10 to test the upper resistance zone near $2.20.

Senate Bill 21 (SB 21)—which proposes creating a Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve—has passed the House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency with a 9-4 vote, split along party lines. The bill was previously approved by the Texas Senate in March and now moves to a full floor vote. If passed, it heads to Governor Greg Abbott, a long-time crypto supporter who accepted Bitcoin donations back in 2014 and has repeatedly expressed his vision to make Texas the “crypto capital” of the U.S. Texas Bill Details and Scope Filed by Republican Senator Charles Schwertner in January, SB 21 initially focused solely on Bitcoin. However, it was later revised to include other digital assets with a market cap of $500 billion or more—a threshold that currently includes only Bitcoin. The reserve would be overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar. The Texas House committee has approved SB 21, next steps a Texas House vote by all members and the governor’s signature. It looks likely that Texas will have a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the big open question is how much BTC will be acquired. https://t.co/vXq5bqNw0d pic.twitter.com/FGONjPLzWT — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) May 8, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Finally Approaches $100K After Almost 100 Days, New ATHS Soon? , Arizona and New Hampshire Lead the Way While Texas inches forward, Arizona has already made its move . Governor Katie Hobbs signed legislation establishing a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund, independent of taxpayer money. Arizona can now stake unclaimed crypto, earn staking rewards, and receive airdrops to grow the fund. Just one day earlier, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 302, allowing the state treasury to invest in top cryptocurrencies with a $500 billion+ market cap —currently meaning Bitcoin-only. Mixed Reactions From Other States Momentum is growing, but not all states are on board. Florida suddenly pulled two Bitcoin reserve bills from its legislative schedule on May 3—the same day it passed over 230 unrelated measures, including bans on school smartphone use and fluoride in water. Meanwhile, Sweden is also exploring the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve, with a Swedish MP proposing the initiative to the country’s finance minister. With the Texas legislative session ending on June 2, the countdown is on. All eyes are now on whether SB 21 will make it through the final vote and officially place Bitcoin in Texas’ treasury strategy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Among the most insightful indicators for investors looking to gauge future price movements is the flow of stablecoins onto exchanges. Recent activity on Binance , one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has caught the attention of analysts, suggesting a potential shift in Crypto Market Sentiment . What Do These Stablecoin Inflows Mean for Crypto Market Sentiment? When large amounts of stablecoins, such as USDT, USDC, or FDUSD, move onto cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance , it’s often interpreted as a sign that investors are preparing to buy crypto assets. Unlike fiat currency deposits, stablecoins are already within the crypto ecosystem, making them readily available to trade for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins. Therefore, a significant increase in Stablecoin Inflows can indicate growing buying pressure and, consequently, a more optimistic market outlook. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost recently highlighted a substantial uptick in stablecoin flows specifically directed towards Binance over a three-day period. This observation is particularly noteworthy because Binance holds significant market share, making its activity a strong proxy for overall market sentiment. The analyst’s findings suggest that after a period of consolidation or perhaps even decline, confidence among market participants might be improving. This influx of capital, specifically earmarked for potential crypto purchases, provides tangible evidence that market participants are not just holding their positions but are actively positioning themselves to enter or increase their exposure to the Cryptocurrency market. This shift from a holding or withdrawing pattern to one of depositing stablecoins is a key indicator that analysts watch closely. Deep Dive into Binance’s Recent Activity The data from CryptoQuant paints a clear picture: significant capital is flowing into Binance. The analyst Darkfost specifically pointed out that May 6th recorded the largest daily stablecoin inflow since April, hitting a staggering $1 billion entering the platform in just 24 hours. This single-day figure is a powerful illustration of the scale of capital ready to be deployed. Over the preceding three days, the cumulative inflow was even more substantial. Such concentrated inflows suggest deliberate positioning by a large number of investors or significant entities. This isn’t just small retail traders making minor deposits; the volume points towards substantial capital movements, potentially by larger players or institutions using stablecoins as their preferred on-ramp onto major exchanges like Binance. Comparing this inflow volume to previous periods provides context. The fact that May 6th’s inflow was the largest since April indicates a notable change in pace. April saw periods of market volatility and price corrections, which might have led to stablecoin outflows or holding off-exchange. The reversal of this trend in early May, particularly with such a significant spike, strongly supports the narrative of improving Crypto Market Sentiment and renewed interest in acquiring crypto assets. Understanding the specific exchange where these inflows occur is also vital. Binance’s global reach and liquidity make it a primary venue for large trades. Therefore, activity on Binance is often seen as a bellwether for the broader Cryptocurrency market. Why Stablecoins are Key Crypto Trends Indicators Stablecoins play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Their value is pegged to a stable asset, usually the US dollar, minimizing price fluctuations. This stability makes them ideal for several purposes: Trading Pairs: Most crypto assets are traded against stablecoins (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDC). This liquidity is essential for market function. On-Ramps and Off-Ramps: Stablecoins facilitate easy entry into and exit from the crypto market without needing to constantly convert back to fiat currency. Storing Value During Volatility: Traders often convert volatile assets into stablecoins during periods of uncertainty, essentially moving to the sidelines without leaving the crypto ecosystem entirely. Yield Generation: Stablecoins can be used in DeFi protocols to earn interest, providing an alternative to traditional savings accounts. Because stablecoins are the primary medium for buying volatile crypto assets on exchanges, tracking their movement is a critical part of analyzing Crypto Trends . Inflows suggest intent to buy, while outflows might suggest intent to sell or move funds off-exchange for holding or other purposes. The recent surge in stablecoin deposits onto Binance is a clear signal that a significant amount of ‘dry powder’ is being positioned on the exchange, ready to potentially fuel upward price movements. This makes monitoring stablecoin flows a vital tool for anyone navigating the Cryptocurrency market. Navigating the Current Cryptocurrency Landscape The recent Stablecoin Inflows into Binance are a compelling piece of the puzzle, but they are just one factor in the complex Cryptocurrency landscape. While the analyst points to growing optimism, it’s important to consider the broader context: Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rates, and inflation all influence investor risk appetite, which in turn affects the crypto market. Regulatory Developments: News regarding crypto regulation in major economies can significantly impact sentiment and market flows. Specific Asset News: Developments related to Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum upgrades, or news about specific altcoins can drive targeted buying or selling pressure. Technical Analysis: Price charts and technical indicators provide insights into market structure and potential future movements, complementing fundamental analysis based on flows. The surge in stablecoin inflows suggests underlying demand is strengthening, which is generally a positive sign for Crypto Market Sentiment . However, investors should always conduct their own research and consider multiple data points before making investment decisions. While the ‘dry powder’ is on the exchange, it still needs to be deployed to impact prices. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights For those interested in Crypto Trends , the recent activity on Binance offers several takeaways: Acknowledge the Signal: Recognize that significant stablecoin inflows are historically associated with potential buying pressure. Stay Informed: Continue monitoring exchange flows, particularly on major platforms like Binance, as they provide real-time insights into market positioning. Combine Indicators: Don’t rely solely on stablecoin flows. Look at trading volume, price action, on-chain data, and broader news to form a comprehensive view of Crypto Market Sentiment . Consider Your Strategy: If you were waiting on the sidelines during a downturn, increased stablecoin inflows might align with your criteria for re-entering or increasing your position in the Cryptocurrency market, but ensure it fits your risk tolerance and investment plan. Be Patient: Inflows indicate *potential* buying. The actual execution of trades takes time and can be influenced by market events. The presence of substantial stablecoin reserves on exchanges like Binance creates the potential for upward price movement, but it’s not a guarantee. It signifies readiness to buy, driven by what appears to be improving sentiment among participants in the Cryptocurrency space. Summary: A Glimmer of Optimism on Binance In conclusion, the recent analysis highlighting a significant surge in Stablecoin Inflows onto Binance , including a $1 billion inflow on May 6th, is a compelling indicator of potentially improving Crypto Market Sentiment . This influx of capital suggests that market participants are positioning themselves to acquire Cryptocurrency assets, viewing the current landscape with renewed optimism after a period of uncertainty. While stablecoin flows are just one metric among many, they offer valuable insight into the readiness of capital to enter the market. This notable trend on one of the world’s largest exchanges reinforces the idea that positive Crypto Trends may be emerging. Investors and enthusiasts alike should view this development as a strong signal worth monitoring closely as the market continues to evolve.

On May 7, the Texas House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency approved Senate Bill 21 in a 9-4 vote , clearing one of the final hurdles before it can land on Governor Greg Abbott’s desk. Initially introduced by Republican Senator Charles Schwertner in January as a Bitcoin ( BTC ) only proposal, SB 21 was later refiled in February to allow for other digital assets with a minimum $500 billion market cap over the past 12 months. Bitcoin is currently the only digital currency to meet this criterion. If passed into law, the bill would allow the state comptroller to manage the reserve and invest state funds in eligible crypto assets. The bill had previously passed the Texas Senate on March 6 with a 25-5 vote. According to data from Bitcoin legislation tracker Bitcoin Laws, SB 21 is not the only crypto-related legislation Texas lawmakers have introduced this year. In March, HB 4258 was proposed to permit the state comptroller to invest up to $250 million of the Economic Stabilization Fund into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, SB 778 , introduced in February this year, focuses on accepting taxes and donations in crypto and imposes a minimum five-year holding period for any Bitcoin acquired by the state.

A day before SB 21 passed the committee in Texas, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs signed HB 2749 into law, creating a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund funded by unclaimed digital assets. On the same day, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte signed HB 302 , making it the first state to legally authorize public fund investment in Bitcoin and other qualifying assets. Up to 10% of the state’s general fund can now be invested in digital assets exceeding a $500 billion market cap, again effectively limiting it to Bitcoin. Currently, 37 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills are under review across 18 U.S. states. The number was initially higher, but many proposals have failed to gain legislative support. Florida became the latest to shelve its Bitcoin reserve plans on May 6, joining Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma, all of which saw similar bills rejected in recent House or Senate votes.

The move has been widely celebrated within the cryptoverse. “Second state in two weeks. Not a fickle decision. A law. Bitcoin is entering the mainstream,” Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley observed in a post on the X social media site. Arizona Approves Unclaimed Crypto Law The bill, sponsored by House Commerce Committee Chairman Jeff Weninger, establishes a reserve fund for unclaimed digital assets if the owner fails to respond to communications over a three-year period. Qualified custodians can stake the reserve assets to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which can then be deposited into what Arizona has dubbed a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund. “This law ensures Arizona doesn’t leave value sitting on the table and puts us in a position to lead the country in how we secure, manage, and ultimately benefit from abandoned digital currency,” Weninger postulated in a May 7 statement . The signing comes shortly after Hobbs vetoed a separate bill, SB 1025, which would have allowed Arizona’s treasury and retirement systems to invest up to 10% of their assets in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In her veto message, the governor stressed that “Arizonans’ retirement system is strong because it sticks to proven investment strategies,” and that it’s inappropriate to expose the state’s retirement funds to untested investments like cryptocurrencies. Multiple states in the US are weighing strategic reserve legislation, though many have stumbled into roadblocks. New Hampshire, however, beat several others to the punch this year after its Governor Kelly Ayotte approved a strategic Bitcoin reserve bill on May 6. The New Hampshire bill authorizes the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of public funds in a digital asset that has at least $500 billion in market capitalization. Bitcoin is currently the only crypto that meets that threshold. The state-level efforts to establish Bitcoin reserves come amid a push from President Donald and Republican lawmakers to do the same in the federal government. Trump signed an executive order in March authorizing the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate Digital Asset stockpile.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|arizona|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-08 07:57:21

While global conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza are anticipated to dominate the discussions, Bloomberg reported on May 7 that North Korea’s increasingly sophisticated cyber operations have become a pressing concern for G7 nations. The stolen digital assets are believed to be a crucial funding source for the country’s weapons programs, prompting calls for coordinated international action. Lazarus Group Leads North Korea’s Surge in High-Profile Crypto Hacks North Korean hacking groups, particularly the notorious Lazarus Group, have been linked to numerous high-profile attacks. The group was reportedly behind a $1.4 billion heist targeting crypto exchange Bybit in February—the largest known crypto theft to date. In total, North Korean-affiliated actors are believed to have stolen over $1.3 billion across 47 incidents in 2024 alone, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. In addition to external breaches, North Korea has employed subtler strategies such as infiltrating crypto companies through rogue IT workers posing as freelance developers. In January, the United States, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint warning about this insider threat. These tactics, experts say, are part of a broader effort to bypass international sanctions and funnel illicit proceeds into the country’s missile development programs.

In April, operatives linked to Lazarus reportedly established three shell companies—including two in the U.S.—to distribute malware targeting crypto developers. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Kraken recently revealed it had uncovered and blocked an infiltration attempt by a suspected North Korean agent posing as a job candidate. The candidate failed a series of identity verification traps set by the company’s security team. Adding to the growing body of evidence, cybersecurity researcher Heiner Garcia staged a dummy job interview with another suspected North Korean operative. The individual inadvertently disclosed clues that linked him to past crypto scams tied to the regime. Crypto Hacks Surge in 2025 as Losses Top $1.74 Billion in Four Months Hackers stole over $92.4 million from crypto projects in April 2025 alone, according to blockchain security firm Immunefi . The figure represents a 27.3% year-over-year increase and more than double the losses reported in March. April’s attacks occurred across 15 incidents, with two major exploits accounting for the bulk of the damage. UPCX, an open-source platform, lost $70 million in a single attack, while decentralized exchange KiloEx was hit for $7.5 million. Other affected projects included Loopscale, ZKsync, Term Labs, and Bitcoin Mission, each experiencing losses exceeding $1 million. Cumulatively, the first four months of 2025 have already seen $1.74 billion in crypto losses—more than all of 2024, which totaled $1.49 billion. Immunefi previously noted that Q1 2025 was the worst quarter for hacks in crypto history, driven largely by massive breaches of centralized exchanges Phemex and Bybit.

Citing sources close to the project, Bloomberg reported on May 7 that Robinhood’s upcoming initiative would enable users in Europe to trade tokenized versions of U.S. securities—potentially a game-changer in the world of cross-border investing. Tokenized Stocks The move comes as Robinhood continues to deepen its European footprint. Just last month, the company secured a brokerage license in Lithuania, a strategic gateway that enables operations across the EU. With an earlier deal in 2024 to acquire crypto exchange Bitstamp, the groundwork for this expansion has been steadily taking shape. Now, with blockchain at the center of its next phase, Robinhood appears ready to challenge conventional finance yet again. Two crypto-native firms—Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation—are reportedly in the running to partner with Robinhood on the infrastructure side. While none of the involved parties have confirmed the collaboration, the implications are significant. Tokenization: A Financial Revolution in the Making Tokenization, the process of converting real-world assets like stocks into blockchain-based tokens, is increasingly being explored by financial institutions. For Robinhood, this technology could allow them to bypass some of the bottlenecks associated with traditional market structures—such as slow settlement times, restricted trading hours, and high operational costs. CEO Vladimir Tenev echoed the sentiment in a recent interview, contrasting the rigid IPO process with the fluidity of digital assets: “You can sit down in front of some software, create a coin and have it be trading in 5 minutes That’s a scary thing. It’s also an incredibly powerful thing.” While the project’s details are still under wraps, the timing is strategic. European investors have long faced hurdles in accessing U.S. securities. If Robinhood successfully implements blockchain-based tokenized trading, it could offer a streamlined and cost-effective solution—potentially reshaping how retail investors interact with global markets. On May 7, Robinhood’s shares gained 2.7% on the Nasdaq, possibly buoyed by news of its crypto and blockchain ambitions.

44315739,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158380,1746691254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Crypto Regulation: Treasury Holds Crucial Roundtables on Future Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-regulation-treasury/,"Big news is brewing in the world of US Crypto Regulation ! The U.S. Department of the Treasury is set to host a series of private roundtables next week, bringing together key players from the cryptocurrency industry. This isn’t just a casual chat; these discussions are poised to delve into critical areas that will likely shape the future landscape for digital assets in America. Reported initially by Token Relations co-founder Jacquelyn Melinek and reposted by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, these meetings signal a significant step towards more direct engagement between regulators and the innovators building the decentralized future. Why is the Treasury Crypto Roundtable So Important? When the Treasury Crypto division decides to sit down with industry experts, everyone in the crypto space pays attention. These aren’t public hearings, but private, focused discussions aimed at fostering a deeper understanding and potentially paving the way for clearer guidelines or regulations. The fact that the Treasury is initiating these talks underscores the growing importance and complexity of the crypto ecosystem in the national and global financial system. These roundtables provide a crucial platform for: Direct Communication: Industry leaders can share their perspectives, challenges, and innovations directly with policymakers. Information Gathering: The Treasury can gain firsthand insights into how decentralized technologies actually work and are being used. Identifying Key Issues: Discussions will pinpoint the most pressing concerns from both the regulatory and industry standpoints. The outcomes of such meetings, while not immediately resulting in policy, often inform future regulatory approaches, legislative proposals, and enforcement priorities. For anyone involved in or watching the crypto space, understanding the topics on the agenda is key. Exploring the Core Topics: Decentralized Finance, Banking, and Cybersecurity The reports indicate the discussions will center around three major pillars: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) , Banking, and Cybersecurity. These areas represent some of the most dynamic, yet challenging, aspects of the crypto world from a regulatory perspective. What’s on the Table for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)? Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has exploded in popularity, offering services like lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries. However, its decentralized nature also presents unique regulatory puzzles. Discussions around DeFi will likely cover: Identifying Responsible Parties: How do you regulate protocols that are governed by code or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)? Consumer Protection: How can users be protected from risks like smart contract bugs, rug pulls, and impermanent loss in a permissionless environment? Illicit Finance Risks: How can DeFi platforms mitigate risks associated with money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion? Market Integrity: How do you ensure fair and transparent markets when activities occur across numerous protocols globally? Industry participants will likely advocate for approaches that foster innovation while addressing these risks, perhaps proposing industry best practices or limited regulatory touchpoints that don’t stifle growth. Navigating the Intersection of Crypto Banking The relationship between traditional banking and crypto is evolving rapidly. More banks are exploring offering crypto services, while crypto native firms are seeking access to banking infrastructure. The term Crypto Banking encompasses various interactions, from banks holding crypto assets to stablecoin reserves and payments. Key points in these discussions might include: Stablecoin Regulation: How should stablecoins, particularly large-scale ones, be regulated to ensure stability and protect users? Are they deposits, securities, or something else? Bank Exposure to Crypto: What are the prudential risks for banks engaging with crypto assets? How should capital and liquidity requirements be adjusted? On- and Off-Ramps: Ensuring clear, compliant pathways for converting between fiat and crypto is crucial for market functioning and preventing illicit activity. Custody of Digital Assets: What are the standards and requirements for financial institutions holding crypto on behalf of clients? Achieving clarity in Crypto Banking is essential for both traditional finance seeking to enter the space and crypto companies needing reliable financial services. Strengthening Cybersecurity in the Digital Asset Space Cybersecurity is not unique to crypto, but the immutable nature of blockchain transactions and the value stored in digital wallets make robust security paramount. High-profile hacks and exploits underscore the need for constant vigilance. Treasury’s focus on cybersecurity likely involves: Infrastructure Security: Protecting exchanges, custodians, and other critical market infrastructure from attacks. Wallet Security: Discussing best practices for securing private keys and protecting user funds. Threat Intelligence Sharing: How can government and industry collaborate to identify and mitigate emerging cyber threats? Incident Response: Planning for how to respond effectively when security breaches occur. Enhancing cybersecurity is a shared goal that benefits users, businesses, and the stability of the financial system as a whole. These discussions are vital for building trust and resilience in the crypto ecosystem. The Broader Context of US Crypto Policy These roundtables fit into a larger picture of evolving Crypto Policy in the United States. Various government agencies, including the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the CFTC, are grappling with how to appropriately oversee this rapidly developing sector. Executive Orders have called for a coordinated approach, and reports from different agencies have outlined potential risks and recommendations. The Treasury’s role is particularly significant given its mandate covering financial stability, sanctions, and combating financial crime. Their engagement with the industry suggests a move towards more informed and potentially more tailored regulatory actions rather than broad, sweeping mandates. For industry participants, these meetings are an opportunity to educate policymakers and advocate for frameworks that support responsible innovation. For regulators, they are a chance to understand the practical implications of potential rules and identify areas where clarity is most needed. What Could Be the Potential Outcomes? While these are private, non-policy-making discussions, they are foundational. Insights gained here could influence: Future Guidance: The Treasury or other agencies might issue clarifying guidance on existing regulations as they apply to crypto. Legislative Proposals: The information could inform recommendations to Congress for new laws specifically addressing crypto, DeFi, or stablecoins. Enforcement Priorities: A better understanding of the landscape helps regulators identify areas of highest risk requiring enforcement attention. International Collaboration: The U.S. approach often influences global standards, making these domestic discussions relevant internationally. The path forward for US Crypto Regulation is still being charted, and these Treasury roundtables are undoubtedly a crucial step in that process. In Conclusion: A Step Towards Clarity? The U.S. Treasury’s decision to host private roundtables with the crypto industry on topics like Decentralized Finance , Crypto Banking , and cybersecurity is a positive sign of increased engagement. It indicates a recognition of the complexity and importance of the digital asset space and a willingness to seek direct input from those building within it. While the immediate impact remains to be seen, these discussions are vital for fostering a more informed approach to Crypto Policy . Industry participants have a chance to educate, and regulators have an opportunity to gain clarity, potentially paving the way for more effective and balanced regulation in the future.

Here’s what you need to know,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/can-you-mine-bitcoin-with-a-gaming-pc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Is your gaming PC capable of mining crypto? As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing. From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight. And if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily. It’s a fair question: Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC? The short answer: Yes, but it won’t be worth it. The long answer: Understanding Bitcoin mining Mining is the process that adds new BTC to circulation. More importantly, it’s how the Bitcoin network stays secure and functions without a central authority. Every time someone sends or receives Bitcoin, miners verify and record that transaction. This is all powered by proof-of-work (PoW) , a consensus mechanism where miners race to encode transactions in a format that is acceptable to the network. It’s essentially just a massive guessing game, where miners try different inputs until one generates a hash with enough leading zeroes to meet the network’s current difficulty target. For example, a valid Bitcoin block might start with something like 00000000000000000000956e9ff76455.... The first miner to hit that valid hash wins the reward: currently 3.125 BTC, plus transaction fees. The issue is, to generate that many leading zeroes in 2025, you’re looking at around 10³¹ hash attempts on average to produce a valid hash. As you can imagine, that takes a lot of power. Did you know? The energy used to mine a single Bitcoin block today could power an average US household for over 10 years. That’s the cost of making sure the network stays decentralized and tamper-proof. From CPUs to ASICs: How mining hardware evolved It didn’t use to be this hard to mine Bitcoin. As more miners joined the network and the total computing power surged, the protocol automatically ramped up the difficulty. That’s by design. Bitcoin adjusts to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, no matter how much horsepower is thrown at it. Back in 2009, Bitcoin mining for beginners meant using a regular laptop CPU. Then came the rise of GPUs — graphics cards originally built for gaming — which dramatically improved mining performance. But then came ASICs, application-specific integrated circuits , designed solely to mine Bitcoin. These machines are vastly more powerful and energy-efficient than any GPU. By 2015, they had effectively taken over the mining scene. Fast forward to 2025: ASICs still reign supreme. If you’re wondering about the best setup for mining Bitcoin on PC, know that ASIC vs. GPU mining isn’t a fair fight anymore. That doesn’t mean your gaming rig is useless, but it does mean you’ll want to consider alternative strategies. Did you know? After Sept. 30, 2025, 4GB GPUs will no longer work due to DAG size limits . Gaming PCs vs. ASIC miners Bitcoin mining with a gaming PC, even with a high-end GPU like the RTX 4090, is inefficient and unlikely to be profitable due to low performance, high energy costs and hardware wear-and-tear compared to ASIC miners. Performance: Can your GPU keep up? Let’s say you’re using an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 — top of the line. Sounds heavy-duty, right? Not for Bitcoin GPU mining. That card might do well on other algorithms like Ethash (used in Ethereum Classic ), but when it comes to Bitcoin’s SHA-256, it barely scratches the surface. Even the mighty RTX 4090 gets crushed by ASICs. A high-end ASIC like the Antminer S21 Pro pumps out 200 terahashes per second (TH/s) — that’s trillions of hashes per second, compared to maybe a few hundred megahashes per second from a GPU. That’s a millionfold difference. Efficiency: The electricity bill tells the real story Let’s talk about power. A GPU like the 4090 pulls around 450 watts. But the hashing performance it delivers is minuscule compared to the watts consumed. ASICs, by contrast, draw more power (e.g., 3,500 watts) but deliver far better output — roughly 17.5 joules per terahash. In short, even if you’re mining Bitcoin on a gaming PC 24/7, the energy cost per dollar earned is painful. Is Bitcoin mining profitable with a gaming PC? Not really. Especially when you factor in cooling, hardware strain and your local energy prices. Economics: Does it make any sense? Even with low electricity rates, the ROI on mining Bitcoin from home with a gaming computer is near zero — if not outright negative. Solo mining ? Forget it. The chances of hitting a block are microscopic. Pool mining ? Your contribution is so small compared to ASIC farms that the payouts will be negligible. And then there’s the wear and tear. GPUs weren’t designed to run at full capacity around the clock. Long-term mining can shorten their lifespan and may void warranties. Did you know? WhatToMine is a useful site that shows what coins are most profitable to mine with your exact setup. Just plug in your GPU, and it does the rest. Alternative cryptocurrencies for gaming PCs If Bitcoin mining on PC feels like bringing a Nerf gun to a tank fight, don’t lose hope. There are still coins designed to be mined with GPUs in 2025 — and some even reward users fairly for it. Let’s take a look at such cryptocurrencies: Ethereum Classic (ETC): GPU-friendly legacy chain Still using the Ethash algorithm, Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) is a solid option for GPU miners. Blocks are mined every 13 seconds with a 3.2 ETC reward. Ravencoin (RVN): Built for the people Ravencoin uses KAWPOW , an algorithm specifically designed to resist ASIC domination. It’s friendly to GPU miners and offers quick one-minute blocks with 2,500 Ravencoin ( RVN ) rewards. Mining altcoins with GPU setups is still very viable here. Monero (XMR): Privacy-first and CPU/GPU accessible Monero relies on the RandomX algorithm, making it accessible to both CPU and GPU miners. You won’t get rich, but it’s a way to earn passively, especially if you’ve got cheap electricity and want passive income from mining.",Mine Bitcoin|Gaming PC|GPU|ASIC,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETC|MINING|XMR,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-08 08:01:00

One day you’re soaring, the next you’re bracing for impact. Understanding the collective mood of the market is crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes in. This widely-watched indicator offers a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , helping investors gauge whether the market is currently driven by irrational exuberance (Greed) or excessive caution (Fear). As of May 8th, the index, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 65. While this is a two-point drop from the previous day, it firmly keeps the market in the ‘Greed’ territory. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Tell Us? The index is essentially a meter that attempts to quantify the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Indicates investors are highly worried, potentially leading to panic selling. This can sometimes signal a buying opportunity for contrarians. 25-49: Fear – Sentiment is negative, caution prevails. 50: Neutral – The market is relatively balanced in sentiment. 51-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic and eager, potentially leading to increased buying pressure. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Suggests the market is potentially overheated, with investors exhibiting FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This could signal a potential correction. The idea is rooted in basic market psychology: when the market is experiencing ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be undervalued due to panic, while ‘Extreme Greed’ could indicate an overvalued market ripe for a pullback. Warren Buffett famously advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” The index aims to provide a tool to help identify these moments. How is the Index Calculated? Exploring the Factors The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from analyzing several different data points. Understanding these factors gives you insight into what’s truly influencing the market’s mood. The index considers six key factors, each with a specific weighting: Let’s break down the components: Factor Weighting What it Measures How it Influences the Score Volatility 25% Measures the current price fluctuations of Bitcoin (BTC) and compares it to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market, pushing the score lower. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current trading volume and market momentum (how strong price movements are) compared to average values. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greedy or optimistic behavior, increasing the score. Low volume or selling pressure suggests fear, decreasing the score. Social Media 15% Scans posts on platforms like Twitter, looking for specific keywords related to cryptocurrency and analyzing the sentiment of these posts. Increased positive sentiment and high engagement often correlate with greed, boosting the score. Negative sentiment lowers it. Surveys 15% (Currently paused) This factor previously incorporated weekly crypto polls, asking people about their market outlook. The results of these polls directly reflected public sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors move from riskier altcoins into the perceived relative safety of BTC. Decreasing dominance might suggest greed, as investors take on more risk in altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. A surge in search volume for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin crash” indicates fear, lowering the score. Terms like “buy Bitcoin” or high interest in general crypto topics during a rally can indicate greed, raising the score. Each of these factors provides a piece of the puzzle, and their combined weightings produce the final index score. It’s a sophisticated way to aggregate diverse data points into a single, understandable metric for crypto market sentiment . Why Did the Index Drop Two Points to 65? A two-point drop, while keeping the index firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests a slight cooling off in market exuberance compared to the previous day. This small shift could be attributed to minor changes in one or more of the contributing factors. Perhaps there was a slight increase in short-term cryptocurrency volatility , a minor dip in market momentum , a shift in social media sentiment, or a subtle change in Bitcoin dominance or Google Trends. Without a detailed breakdown of the daily changes in each component from the provider, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the two-point move, but it indicates a marginal decrease in the overall positive pressure on the market. Interpreting the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 65 Mean for Investors? A score of 65 sits comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone (51-74). This typically suggests that investors are feeling optimistic. Prices have likely been performing well recently, attracting new buyers and encouraging existing holders to hold or even buy more, driven by positive price action and news. However, being in the ‘Greed’ zone also comes with a note of caution. Key aspects of the ‘Greed’ zone: Increased Optimism: Investors are generally bullish and expecting prices to rise further. Potential for FOMO: The fear of missing out on potential gains can drive irrational buying. Higher Risk: Markets driven by greed can be more susceptible to sharp pullbacks or corrections as sentiment can shift quickly. Focus on Gains: The focus tends to be on potential profits rather than the underlying fundamentals or risks. While 65 is not ‘Extreme Greed’ (75+), it indicates a market where caution is warranted. It’s a time when investors should be particularly mindful of their risk management strategies and avoid making decisions based solely on emotion. Benefits and Challenges of Using the Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a popular tool, but like any indicator, it has its pros and cons. Benefits: Simplicity: Provides a single, easy-to-understand number representing overall market sentiment. Historical Context: Allows investors to compare current sentiment to past market cycles. Contrarian Signal: Can help identify potential opportunities for contrarian investors (buying during extreme fear, considering selling during extreme greed). Aggregation: Combines multiple data points into one metric, saving time on individual analysis. Challenges: Not a Perfect Predictor: Sentiment alone doesn’t dictate price movements; macroeconomic factors, regulations, and technological developments also play significant roles. Lagging Indicator: The index reflects *current* sentiment, which might change rapidly. Bitcoin-Centric: While it includes factors like Bitcoin dominance, the index is heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and sentiment, which might not always perfectly reflect the broader altcoin market. Weighting Subjectivity: The specific weightings of the factors are determined by the index provider and could be debated. Data Limitations: Some data sources, like social media sentiment analysis, can be complex and potentially prone to manipulation or misinterpretation. Therefore, the index should be used as one tool among many in an investor’s analysis toolkit, not as the sole basis for investment decisions. Actionable Insights: How Can Investors Use the Index? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can provide valuable insights, but how do you translate that into action? Here are a few ways investors might use the current reading of 65: Given the index is in the ‘Greed’ zone: Exercise Caution: Avoid making impulsive buys driven by FOMO. Prices may be elevated. Review Your Portfolio: Consider taking some profits, rebalancing, or setting stop-loss orders to protect against potential pullbacks. Stick to Your Strategy: Don’t let the prevailing ‘Greed’ sentiment derail your long-term investment plan. Research Diligently: During periods of high optimism, it’s even more important to research projects thoroughly rather than buying based on hype. Look for Relative Value: While the overall market sentiment is greedy, individual assets might still present opportunities based on fundamentals. Conversely, if the index were to plummet into ‘Fear’ or ‘Extreme Fear’, contrarian investors might see this as a potential opportunity to accumulate assets at discounted prices, provided their fundamental analysis supports the investment. Looking Ahead: What Could Shift the Sentiment? The current state of 65 in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is dynamic. Several factors could cause it to shift significantly: Major Price Movements: A significant rally would likely push the index higher into ‘Extreme Greed’, while a sharp downturn would quickly send it towards ‘Fear’. Regulatory News: Positive or negative news from regulators globally can have a profound impact on investor confidence. Macroeconomic Environment: Changes in inflation rates, interest rates, or global economic stability influence investor risk appetite across all markets, including crypto. Technological Developments: Breakthroughs or issues within major blockchain networks (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) can affect sentiment. Geopolitical Events: Global conflicts or political instability can lead investors to seek safety or shed risky assets. Monitoring these external factors alongside the index’s movement provides a more holistic view of the market landscape. For instance, an increase in cryptocurrency volatility coupled with negative regulatory news would almost certainly drive the index lower. Conclusion: Navigating the Emotions of the Crypto Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable barometer for understanding the collective emotional state of the market. While it currently sits in the ‘Greed’ zone at 65, a slight dip from the previous day reminds us that sentiment is fluid. It’s a tool that aggregates complex data points like volatility , market momentum , social buzz, and even Bitcoin dominance into a single, digestible number. For investors, the current reading is a signal to proceed with awareness rather than abandon ship. It suggests optimism is high, but it also flags the increased potential for volatility and the need for disciplined risk management. By understanding what the index measures and how to interpret its signals in conjunction with other analysis methods, you can better navigate the often-turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market and make more informed decisions.

Sei Labs, a core development team behind the S e i blockchain, has unveiled a new proposal to ditch Cosmos transactions and CosmWasm contracts and go all-in on EVM to make the blockchain simpler and easier to build on. The proposal , Sei Improvement Proposal-3, is the second to be submitted under the new SIP governance process. If passed, it would mean Sei becomes an EVM-only chain, moving away from its current dual support for both EVM and Cosmos accounts. “As EVM usage continues to dominate activity on Sei, this proposal reflects a clear path forward: a streamlined, EVM-first architecture designed to scale the next generation of DeFi, gaming, and real-world applications.” Jay Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs According to the proposal, only EVM addresses will be able to send transactions on Sei. CosmWasm contracts and Cosmos message handling would be removed, while staking and governance features will remain available through EVM precompiles.

Sei Labs said the current dual setup has created friction for users and developers, with users having to manage and link “both EVM and native addresses.” If the proposal goes through, infrastructure providers will need to switch to EVM-only APIs. Users will also need to move assets to EVM-native wallets or bridge out Cosmos assets, and CosmWasm developers will have to port their apps to EVM, the team noted. According to Sei Labs, shifting to an EVM-only setup will “significantly simplify the Sei developer and user experience, reduce infrastructure overhead, and position Sei more strongly within the broader EVM ecosystem.” Still, there’s no clear timeline for when the proposal might take effect. Amid the announcement, SEI ( SEI ) price jumped 6% to $0.2, while trading volume surged 17.27%, according to data from crypto price aggregator platforms.
