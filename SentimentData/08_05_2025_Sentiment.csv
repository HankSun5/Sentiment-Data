The global interest in tokenized assets is on the rise, and among other companies, Robinhood is buying into the wave with its plan to launch a blockchain-based platform that allows its customers to trade tokenized assets. Robinhood to launch a blockchain platform Robinhood Markets Inc. is currently working to claim its stake in global finance by developing a blockchain-based platform that will allow European retail investors to trade U.S. securities. According to individuals familiar with the matter, Robinhood, based in Menlo Park, California, is currently in talks to build the platform in partnership with a digital asset company. Two blockchains under consideration for the collaboration are Arbitrum and Solana. Arbitrum operates as a layer-2 solution on the Ethereum network, and Solana is known for its fast transaction speeds and low costs. Discussions are still ongoing, and no official agreement has been reached. A spokesperson for Robinhood declined to comment on the ongoing discussions, and Offchain Labs, the developer behind Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, both followed suit and refrained from responding to media inquiries. Robinhood’s proposed platform would tokenize U.S. stocks and potentially other securities, while giving investors in the European Union access to trade them 24/7 with increased efficiency and lower settlement costs. At present, Robinhood’s customers within the European Union only have access to cryptocurrency trading. However, the company recently secured a brokerage license in Lithuania, which allows it to offer traditional stock trading services across the EU. This development is expected to pave the way for the blockchain venture . Tokenized securities Tokenized securities are digital representations of traditional financial assets like stocks, bonds, or real estate that are recorded on blockchain networks. The technology offers greater efficiency, faster settlement times, and significantly lower infrastructure costs. A 2023 report by the Global Financial Markets Association (GFMA) showed that distributed ledger technology (DLT) could cut global clearing and settlement costs by up to $20B annually. These saved expenses come from reducing the reliance on centralized agents and complex reconciliation processes, which often delay trading. Several major financial institutions are buying into the tokenization wave. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, known as BUIDL , has attracted over $2B in assets since its launch. Franklin Templeton and Apollo have each launched their own tokenized investment products in recent years. Even Coinbase has expressed interest in offering tokenized securities. The CEO of Robinhood, Vlad Tenev, publicly shared his enthusiasm for the potential of tokenized assets. Speaking on a podcast in March, he said, “Tokenized securities can really push forward U.S. company dominance in the global market. Right now, it’s very difficult to invest in a U.S. company if you’re overseas.” This challenge is precisely what Robinhood’s blockchain platform seeks to solve as European investors face regulatory and operational hurdles when they try to invest directly in U.S.-listed securities. Robinhood ’s acquisition of Bitstamp, a well-established European cryptocurrency exchange, is also critical to its expansion into the EU. Bitstamp’s MiFID-compliant multilateral trading facility (MTF) license would allow Robinhood to offer crypto-linked derivatives and potentially even tokenized securities. Once the deal closes, Robinhood could use Bitstamp’s infrastructure and licensing to bring its tokenized platform to the European market faster and more securely.

The trading platform is likely to tap into Solana (SOL) and Arbitrum (ARB) chains for its planned development. Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ: HOOD), an established electronic trading platform, is ostensibly planning to develop a blockchain tokenization platform to enable European retail investors to participate in the United States securities market. Reportedly, Robinhood plans to collaborate with Arbitrum (ARB) and Solana (SOL) networks to enable the tokenization of U.S. securities. Currently, Robinhood provides cryptocurrency trading services to several EU countries and stock trading services to retail investors in the United Kingdom. Once finalized, the new tokenization platform by Robinhood will help democratize the mainstream adoption of U.S. securities via the blockchain technology. Robinhood Taps Blockchain to Remain Profitable In the recently released first-quarter earnings report, Robinhood noted that crypto trading remained a significant contributor to its overall revenue. During the first three months of 2025, Robinhood reported a revenue of about $252 million from crypto trading services. However, Robinhood highlighted that its crypto trading services dropped by 35 percent from the fourth quarter of 2024. As a result, the trading platform is compelled to diversify its products to ensure a sustainable revenue source for its shareholders. The company has laid significant emphasis on blockchain technology to ensure transparency and seamless adoption of its services globally. Last month, Robinhood secured a brokerage license in Lithuania, which will play a crucial role in its entry into the EU market, particularly in the tokenization and trading of U.S. stock securities. Furthermore, Robinhood acquired Bitstamp cryptocurrency exchange to enhance its legalities in more jurisdictions in the near future.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING|ARB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-07 22:58:38

But another project with a unique vision is getting attention from the blockchain and AI communities. Enter Ruvi AI, a pioneering platform that combines AI with blockchain to solve real world problems and open up new innovation pathways. What is Ruvi AI’s Vision Ruvi AI is at the forefront of technological convergence by combining the robust, transparent network of blockchain with advanced AI capabilities. It’s designed to deliver solutions across industries like healthcare, supply chain management and finance. By leveraging blockchain’s immutable data and AI’s predictive power, Ruvi AI allows users to unlock new insights. One of Ruvi AI’s key features is its accessibility. The platform prioritizes user friendly interfaces so its tools are available to organizations that may not have deep knowledge of blockchain. Whether it’s predicting financial risks or optimizing logistics networks, Ruvi AI makes its solutions intuitive and effective. By doing so, the project has positioned itself as the go to platform for businesses looking to leverage next gen tech. Presale Success Ruvi AI’s presale launch is a huge success. Within days of launching Phase 1, the project has sold over 10 million tokens and raised over $100,000. This is a testament to the community’s confidence and enthusiasm for the project’s roadmap and potential. Right now, Ruvi AI tokens are priced at $0.01 in Phase 1. Investors can still get in before Phase 2 starts but time is running out as Phase 2 will have a 50% price increase to $0.015 per token. And to add to the confidence, the beta platform will be released shortly after the presale so the development team is committed to delivering on their timelines. VIP Tiers for Investors To reward early believers, Ruvi AI has VIP tiers with extra bonuses and returns . Two tiers stand out for their benefits: VIP Tier 3 VIP Tier 3 requires a $1,000 investment and gets 100,000 tokens in Phase 1. It also gets a 60% bonus so 160,000 tokens. At $0.07 listing price, these tokens would be worth $11,200. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, Tier 3 investors could see returns of $160,000. VIP Tier 5 For larger investments, VIP Tier 5 is the way to go. With a $5,000 investment, you get 500,000 tokens plus 100% bonus so 1,000,000 tokens. At $0.07 listing price, this is $70,000. If Ruvi AI reaches $1, Tier 5 investors could see returns of $1,000,000. Both tiers show Ruvi AI’s investor first approach, delivering massive long term gains and building trust with its growing community. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Supporters Ruvi AI goes beyond traditional rewards by offering leaderboard rewards to top supporters during the presale. The updated reward structure means everyone gets a chance to benefit: Top 10 get 500,000 tokens each. At $0.07, tokens are worth $35,000, which could be $500,000 if the $1 valuation is reached. Top 50 get 250,000 tokens each. Tokens are worth $17,500 at $0.07 and $250,000 at $1. Top 100 get 100,000 tokens each, worth $7,000 at $0.07 and $100,000 at $1. Top 200 get 75,000 tokens, worth $5,250 at $0.07 and $75,000 at $1. Top 500 get 40,000 tokens, worth $2,800 at $0.07 and $40,000 at $1. Top 1000 get 20,000 tokens, worth $1,400 at $0.07 and $20,000 at $1.This structure rewards participation at all levels, creates a strong and active community and maximizes value for Ruvi AI supporters. Building the Future of Blockchain and AI While Avalanche is funding the future of blockchain, Ruvi AI is building its own by combining blockchain with AI to solve real world problems. From the successful presale to the VIP tiers and leaderboard rewards, Ruvi AI is setting new standards for transparency, innovation and investment. The Ruvi AI project is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of a movement that will change the way technology integrates. Whether you’re a tech enthusiast, business leader or early stage investor, Ruvi AI promises not only groundbreaking solutions but also massive growth.

Right now, Pepe (PEPE) is drawing attention with signs of a potential trend reversal, while Cardano (ADA) continues to earn credibility through consistent upgrades and a research-driven roadmap. Both projects offer compelling cases, but Unstaked ($UNSD) is taking a different route, one focused on real-world utility and automation. Its AI-powered agents and on-chain Proof of Intelligence system bring measurable, verifiable engagement to the forefront of blockchain functionality. With its crypto presale still underway, Unstaked positions itself as a standout among emerging coins. For those seeking early access to utility-driven growth, it’s a strategic opportunity worth watching. Pepe (PEPE) Sets the Stage for a Breakout Move Pepe (PEPE) is turning heads as technical signals continue to align in its favor. The token has established a firm base and recently confirmed a double-bottom formation, a bullish pattern that often precedes trend reversals. Coupled with consistent buying pressure and well-defended support zones, this setup is attracting renewed interest from traders who see momentum building beneath the surface. With resistance levels clearly in sight, a breakout could trigger sharp upward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rebounding from oversold territory, adding further strength to the case for bullish continuation. If PEPE sustains its current consolidation and breaks through overhead resistance, the next leg up could arrive faster than expected. Cardano (ADA) Reclaims Attention with Strategic Strength Cardano (ADA) is regaining momentum as community interest picks up, largely fueled by recent insights from founder Charles Hoskinson. His pointed commentary on competitors has cast a spotlight on Cardano’s disciplined approach to blockchain development, renewing confidence in ADA’s long-term vision. Unlike hype-driven projects, Cardano continues to win support through its academic rigor and commitment to security and scalability. Its steady development and methodical rollouts are starting to resonate with a broader audience. As attention shifts toward sustainable, research-backed platforms, ADA’s rise is becoming a key storyline in the search for next-generation blockchain solutions. Unstaked Could Follow the Footsteps of Crypto’s Biggest 100x Winners Some of the biggest gains in crypto history have come from early-stage bets on platforms that combined utility with perfect timing. Projects like Solana and Polygon delivered 100x to 500x returns once their ecosystems took off, while AI-driven networks such as Fetch.ai proved that real-world functionality can be just as powerful as hype. In this context, Unstaked is starting to mirror that same trajectory. Currently priced at just $0.006695 in Stage 2 of its crypto presale , the project has already raised over $1 million, signaling strong early demand. What makes Unstaked stand out isn’t just its presale numbers but the functionality it’s building. The platform allows users to deploy AI agents that autonomously manage, moderate, and grow digital communities on Telegram and X. These agents are not theoretical; they’ll go live right after launch, delivering immediate utility and solving a major pain point in the Web3 ecosystem. Unstaked’s infrastructure is powered by its Proof of Intelligence protocol, which tracks every agent action on-chain and distributes rewards based on verified engagement. That adds a layer of transparency and merit-based earning that most projects simply don’t offer. The UNSD token plays a central role in governance, utility, and access across this ecosystem. With real AI use cases, strong early traction, and on-chain performance baked in from day one, Unstaked offers more than a speculative bet. It presents an early opportunity to back a platform designed for long-term utility. As demand for AI-integrated tools rises, history suggests platforms like Unstaked could be the next 100x story, if you get in before the crowd. Quick Recap While Pepe (PEPE) flashes promising technical signals and Cardano (ADA) continues its methodical climb, Unstaked offers a fundamentally different value proposition, one grounded in active utility and verifiable performance. Its AI-driven agents and on-chain Proof of Intelligence system go beyond market speculation, delivering a platform built for real engagement and scalable results. With its presale gaining traction and utility ready to activate post-launch, Unstaked ($UNSD) is quickly emerging as a serious contender among emerging crypto coins. For those prioritizing long-term functionality over short-term hype, Unstaked presents a compelling entry point ahead of broader adoption.

Kaspa is preparing for a major speed upgrade, XRP is seeing less network activity, and another project is making progress with practical tools instead of short-term hype. Web3 ai takes a different path. It does not focus on protocol changes or short-term rallies. Instead, it uses AI to help users with trading choices. Its $WAI token powers tools that run around the clock to monitor markets, spot scams, shift assets, and improve DeFi activity. For anyone looking at the next top bullish crypto, attention is moving from promises to actual tools. Web3 ai is part of that shift. Kaspa Upgrade Could Unlock New Network Speed The new Kaspa (KAS) upgrade, named Crescendo, is set to change how the network performs. Scheduled for May 5, this update will increase block speed from one per second to ten. This shift is more than just faster times. It boosts the network’s ability to handle more transactions while keeping its core values of security and decentralization. From a market view, this upgrade may trigger price growth. Analysts are focused on the $0.0990 level as a key point. A close above that could start a stronger upward move. If it breaks $0.15, the trend could strengthen further. With better performance and growing interest, Kaspa’s update is one of the top stories in the space right now. XRP Activity Drop Adds Pressure to Price Trend New XRP data shows a big drop in network use, with active addresses falling 44% in just a few days. This change matches a slide in price, raising concerns about a short-term pullback. Even though XRP is trading above $0.50, the lower user activity adds to bearish signals. Current charts are showing stress as XRP stays near support zones. If sellers increase and buyers don’t return, the price could test the $0.47 to $0.48 area. Still, if XRP holds above current levels, it may stay in a sideways trend, delaying any bigger price changes. $WAI Powers a Nonstop AI Trading System Web3 ai runs at all hours, and so does the system behind it. While traders rest, $WAI holders stay connected through an AI-driven engine that tracks market changes, spots scams, adjusts portfolios, and finds high-yield DeFi options. This is not just a group of features. It is a full-time crypto system, always on and ready to act. At the center of this setup is the $WAI token, available at $0.0003 in presale batch 1. With a planned listing price of $0.005242, early users may see gains up to 1,747%. But its value goes beyond that. $WAI powers everything from AI trade bots and price scanners to fraud alerts and lending tools. It is the main link to a smart, automated dashboard made to help you every second. Unlike tokens that just sit unused, $WAI drives a system made to take action. Whether it’s adjusting your assets during market swings or pointing out new presale risks, Web3 ai works like a full-time quant analyst that doesn’t stop. For those searching for the top bullish crypto with a clear use case and 24/7 function, $WAI stands out as a working product, not just an idea. The ai crypto presale is still active, but not for long. When it closes, access to one of the most advanced AI systems for retail traders may close with it. Functionality Could Define the Next Bullish Trend Kaspa is focused on faster blocks, and XRP is dealing with lower user numbers. Web3 ai is moving in a different direction, focusing on performance instead of price changes. Its system, powered by $WAI, monitors the market, controls risk, and manages assets in real time. These tools are often used by professionals, but now available to regular traders. What makes this different is not the promise of future gains, but what is already in motion. As more users look for long-term tools that can work in any market, platforms like Web3 ai may be what separates the next top bullish crypto from the rest.

On April 29, the project witnessed one of its most heated Buyer Battles so far, selling over 59.15 million BDAG coins within a single day. At the heart of this surge was wallet 0x8e7a…d25, which led the charge by purchasing 1.63 million BDAG, earning the additional unsold coins from the 25 million daily allocation pool. This intense competition shows how BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles are changing user behavior. Participants are not simply buying coins; they are engaging strategically, aiming for daily wins as well. As May 13 approaches, marking the final chance to secure BDAG at $0.0019 before the exchange listing, interest continues to build rapidly. For those tracking crypto ICOs with clear momentum and a growing user base, BlockDAG is proving difficult to ignore. Buyer Battles Reshape Coin Accumulation Tactics April 29’s record-breaking sales day highlighted more than just high volume. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles have created an exciting and strategic element in the presale. Unlike traditional crypto ICO structures that rely on simple buying incentives, BlockDAG rewards the highest daily buyer with leftover coins from the daily 25 million BDAG allocation. Wallet 0x8e7a…d25 showcased this perfectly, securing 1.63 million BDAG and claiming the coveted bonus. This reflects more than luck. It is part of a calculated strategy that has become increasingly common as buyers seek maximum advantage before public trading begins. While other crypto ICOs often stick with standard presale models, BlockDAG’s competitive approach has created daily excitement. Each 24-hour cycle is now a new opportunity, encouraging bigger and more aggressive purchases. This has directly contributed to BlockDAG’s impressive $227.5.5 million raised to date and over 19.7 billion BDAG coins sold. In batch 28, BDAG is priced at $0.0262, but early buyers still have a chance to grab coins for just $0.0019 before May 13. Combining urgency, strategy, and community-driven participation, BlockDAG stands out among top crypto ICOs as a project where buyers are actively shaping the market. The Final Countdown: Why May 13 Matters As BlockDAG’s presale races toward its close, time has become a critical factor. With May 13 fast approaching, buyers face a shrinking window to secure BDAG coins at $0.0019. Once this offer expires and the exchange listing goes live, prices are expected to enter open market dynamics, where higher valuations and increased demand could quickly reshape the landscape. Buyer Battles are becoming more intense as this deadline draws near. Participants are now competing with greater determination to claim daily bonuses, positioning themselves ahead of potential price surges. For newcomers and crypto veterans alike, the appeal is clear. Early access and the chance to win additional BDAG create powerful incentives. BlockDAG’s value proposition extends beyond its presale mechanics. Featuring hybrid Proof-of-Work combined with Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, the platform aims to offer scalability and efficiency. This makes it attractive to miners, developers, and long-term holders alike. Additionally, BlockDAG’s 25% referral bonus and 5% buyer bonus add layers of opportunity. These programs reward users who help expand the community and encourage rapid adoption. Together, they highlight why BlockDAG’s final presale days are so crucial for those seeking crypto ICOs with a combination of short-term rewards and future growth potential. Why BlockDAG Dominates the Crypto ICO Discussion in 2025 With countless projects launching daily, standing out in the crowded crypto ICO market is no easy task. BlockDAG, however, has managed to capture and hold attention through a strategy focused on rewarding active participation. Unlike projects that rely solely on speculation or vague promises, BlockDAG has tied meaningful rewards to user engagement. The April 29 victory by wallet 0x8e7a…d25 is a clear example. Buyers are no longer passive. They are competing daily, shaping outcomes, and driving volume higher. This dynamic has helped BlockDAG surpass $227.5.5 million in presale funds raised and push total coins sold beyond 19.6 billion. The passed CertiK audit adds further credibility, confirming that BlockDAG’s infrastructure has met stringent security standards. As exchange listings draw closer, this assurance will likely boost buyer confidence even more. Ultimately, BlockDAG’s structure encourages ongoing participation and builds a loyal community. From Buyer Battles to referral bonuses, it is clear why BlockDAG is seen as one of the most impactful crypto ICOs right now. Those who act before May 13 stand to be part of a select group with early access to what could become a major player in the market. Final Thoughts April 29 set a new benchmark in BlockDAG’s growing presale story. Wallet 0x8e7a…d25’s acquisition of 1.63 million BDAG coins and the intense Buyer Battle that unfolded reflect a community eager to compete and accumulate ahead of exchange listings. As May 13 nears, the chance to buy at $0.0019 and claim daily bonuses will soon end. For anyone comparing crypto ICOs, BlockDAG offers a rare blend of real-time rewards, proven ROI of 2,520%, and a user-driven ecosystem supported by a successful CertiK audit. For those still on the sidelines, now is the moment to explore BlockDAG. The final presale days offer a limited opportunity to enter at favorable prices before the market reshapes valuations in public trading.

While the move has reaffirmed confidence in asset-backed on-chain ecosystems, it has also triggered renewed interest in utility tokens with real value proposition. Analysts are now singling out Qubetics , Polygon, and Render as the top contenders benefiting from this macro-level shift. Qubetics ($TICS), a new entrant shaking up the crypto scene, appears to be riding this institutional wave with smart positioning around interoperability and dev-focused innovation. Its $16.7 million presale success and a unique dual-pronged ecosystem—featuring QubeQode and Qubetics IDE—set it apart from peers. Unlike conventional tokens banking only on hype, Qubetics is structuring itself as an infrastructure layer for creators, entrepreneurs, and devs building across chains. Qubetics’ Tech Suite Could Be a Power Play for Developers and Multi-Chain Builders Qubetics has stepped into the limelight with tools designed to serve blockchain-native developers and mainstream coders alike. Through its flagship QubeQode and the integrated Qubetics IDE, the platform streamlines smart contract development and deployment across multiple blockchain networks. In an industry where fragmented ecosystems slow down adoption, Qubetics offers the Web3 equivalent of unified development environments seen in traditional tech. The platform serves both solo devs and corporate teams aiming to deploy decentralized applications without hitting chain-specific walls. Whether you’re building a lending protocol on Ethereum, a gaming dApp on Avalanche, or an RWA dashboard on Stellar, QubeQode’s flexibility ensures seamless output across chains. That’s not just convenient—it’s critical in 2025, where interoperability is no longer a bonus, but a necessity. Use cases range from enterprise finance tools that need rapid multi-chain deployments to individual smart contract writers looking to test and iterate on their logic using Qubetics’ visual testing environment. This kind of development-first approach is being recognized as a foundational infrastructure play, positioning Qubetics as a top crypto presale worth serious attention. Qubetics Presale ROI Potential: The Math Behind the Hype For those scanning today’s markets for the top crypto presale, Qubetics continues to check the right boxes—and not just on tech. The presale is now in Stage 33, priced at $0.2302 per $TICS token, and will enter a price jump every Sunday at 12 a.m. as part of its 7-day rotating cycle. With over 511 million tokens sold and more than 25,900 token holders already on board, the project has raised over $16.7 million, underlining community confidence. The projections are compelling. A $100 buy-in at today’s price would yield the following ROI possibilities if $TICS reaches post-launch targets: At $1, the ROI equals 334.33%, turning $100 into $434.33 At $5, the ROI jumps to 2,071.63%, reaching $2,171.63 At $10, it’s a massive 4,243.26% return, totaling $4,343.26 And at $15, the ROI spikes to 6,414.90%, netting $6,514.90 These figures place Qubetics not only among the top crypto presale projects in terms of utility but also in terms of raw profit potential. The presale momentum isn’t showing signs of slowing, especially with the Qubetics mainnet launch confirmed for Q2 2025. For many early participants, this project is shaping up as the best crypto pre sale for lifecycle growth and long-term hold strategies alike. Render Explores Gateway to Apple Vision Pro and Nvidia AI Push According to the latest CoinMarketCap Academy briefing, Render (RNDR) is advancing its position by enabling decentralized rendering for AI and high-fidelity digital environments. CEO Jules Urbach stated that Render Network’s integration plans are now centered around providing GPU compute power to Apple’s Vision Pro ecosystem and Nvidia’s AI stack. The Render Foundation is also backing the Open Compute Language initiative, which promotes interoperability across GPUs, a narrative that could significantly strengthen RNDR’s value proposition. Additionally, Render’s upcoming RNP-006 governance proposal hints at further decentralizing node validation and compute task routing. This model mirrors Ethereum’s staking economy but focused on GPU cycles instead of just financial validation. Render’s positioning as a computational layer for spatial computing, metaverse use, and machine learning makes it a strong companion to the growing appetite for on-chain utility. This layered growth strategy, supported by increasing developer incentives and integrations, reinforces its potential for longer-term relevance beyond market cycles. Polygon’s Steady Price Action Masks Growing DeFi Momentum In recent analysis published by The Cryptonomist, Polygon (MATIC) is experiencing subtle but consistent momentum despite relative price stability. Over the past week, MATIC posted 1.44% gains and saw trading volumes increase by 2.52%. What’s catching analysts’ attention isn’t the price, but the underlying DeFi growth on the Polygon chain. Specifically, over 50% of MATIC wallets holding for over a year are still active—a statistic that signals long-term conviction in the network’s future. Moreover, on-chain metrics suggest that the number of daily active users has continued to climb, even without flashy token spikes. The analysis highlighted Polygon’s increasingly vital role in hosting DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces that prioritize transaction speed and gas efficiency. Amid Ethereum’s congestion concerns, many developers continue to migrate liquidity and dApp activity to L2s like Polygon. For those considering allocation into longer-term value protocols, Polygon’s fundamentals suggest it remains a core DeFi infrastructure piece. Its quiet strength could be preparing it for a more aggressive breakout later this year, particularly as Ethereum’s roadmap unfolds. Conclusion: Are These Three the Smartest Bets for 2025 Short-Term Strategy? With real-world asset narratives capturing institutional interest, the entire landscape for altcoin valuation is shifting. Qubetics has firmly established itself as the top crypto presale by blending deep utility with ROI potential. Its dev-focused ecosystem, 10% weekly price jumps, and projections north of 6,000% have made it a magnet for serious capital. Render continues to earn its place in the conversation through unique integrations with Apple and Nvidia and by pioneering decentralized GPU utility, while Polygon’s on-chain usage metrics prove that developer ecosystems are increasingly leaning toward its speed and cost-effectiveness. For early adopters prioritizing fundamentals, tech stack relevance, and tokenomics that work, these three projects offer compelling short-term entry points and long-term promise. Those aiming to ride the next market rotation would be wise to watch these plays closely—and to view Qubetics not only as a dev tool or RWA hub but possibly as the best crypto presale of this cycle.

Per the South Korean newspaper Noksek Gyungjae Shinmun , crypto exchanges think Lee’s promise to “lower crypto transaction fees” could result in lower profits for their platforms. South Korean Crypto Exchanges: Commission Fee Fears Lee made the pledge this week, along with a promise to green-light Bitcoin spot ETFs . He appears to have been responding to a slew of crypto-related manifesto promises from his main rival, the People Power Party’s Kim Moon-soon. Kim, earlier this month, promised to let the country’s sovereign wealth and state pension funds buy BTC and other tokens. South Korea goes to the ballot booth on June 3.

(Source: MBN News/Screenshot) However, Lee leads Kim by around 20 percentage points in most opinion polls. And exchanges fear that if he wins power in early June, they could be hit in the pocket. The media outlet wrote that the entire crypto industry was now “expressing concerns” about Lee’s “fee reduction plan.” One exchange official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the newspaper: “Domestic crypto exchange fees commission fees are already very low compared to overseas platforms. Additional reductions could have a significant impact on exchanges’ profitability.” A senior executive at a non-fiat trading South Korean crypto exchange spoke to Cryptonews.com on May 7. Also speaking on condition of anonymity, the executive said: “Exchanges are already over-regulated as things stand in this country. A commission fee cap will hurt everyone in the sector more, particularly smaller operators.” Lee, meanwhile, is reportedly “reviewing a plan” that involves cutting crypto transaction fees in order “to establish parity with domestic stock market transactions.” BOK expected to lower key rates this month amid deepening economic downturn https://t.co/1NpTm1uPRT — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) May 6, 2025 South Korean Fees ‘Are Already Lower Than Those of International Rivals’ The media outlet said that, per its calculations, South Korean crypto exchanges charge an average of 0.05% in commission fees. Lee’s plan would see fees capped at 0.015%, a reduction of around 70%. The media outlet wrote that Binance commission fees stand at 0.1%, although it offers a 25% discount (0.075%) for transactions involving its own coins. The United States-based Coinbase trading platform, meanwhile, charges a fee of 0.5% for transactions worth less than $10,000. Advocates of Lee’s policy say that the move is part of a wider effort to protect crypto investors. They also say it will increase transparency and boost transaction volumes. South Korea’s high court delayed its first hearing on leading presidential candidate Lee Jae-myung’s election violation case until June 18, two weeks after the election date, ensuring he will be able to run for the country’s top office https://t.co/jl13YC7th5 — Bloomberg (@business) May 7, 2025 S Korean Exchanges Face Other Limiting Factors, Claim Industry Insiders South Korean industry insiders also complained that domestic exchanges experience limitations when it comes to diversifying their profit structures. While many overseas exchanges can offer profit-generating services such as crypto derivatives and margin trading, domestic platforms are restricted by tight regulations. As such, any sort of transaction fee cap would hurt South Korean crypto exchanges’ main revenue flow. This could prove to be “a huge burden,” crypto exchange officials claimed. Insiders called on politicians to hold “consultation sessions with the industry” and “consider the market’s unique characteristics.” The post South Korean Crypto Exchanges Fret Over Commission Fee Cap Fears appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Crypto Exchange|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-07 23:30:00

Among the most ambitious claims is the idea that the XRP price could skyrocket to $1,000 or even beyond. In response to these projections, a crypto analyst has outlined several key factors that would need to align for XRP to reach such a target. Factors Needed To Take The XRP Price To $1,000 While it’s tempting to imagine XRP hitting a four-digit price target, X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Jasmin argues that the numbers don’t support such a prediction. For the XRP price to reach $1,000, it would need to climb as high as 46,848%, accompanied by key factors like a significant rise in global adoption, especially by financial institutions. Related Reading: XRP Price To $1,000: Analyst Reveals Target For When Banks Start Using XRP Although Ripple, a blockchain company, has made progress in partnering with global banks and fintech firms for cross-border payments, that level of adoption is still nowhere near enough to support a $1,000 XRP price tag. To even approach this level, XRP would need to become a fundamental part of the global financial structure across different sectors, particularly in banking, remittance, and investment. But beyond simple adoption, XRP would have to be deeply integrated into major economies in such a way that it becomes an indispensable currency for daily transactions. For this to happen, Jasmin reveals that the cryptocurrency would need widespread regulatory clarity to ensure that it can be used in multiple jurisdictions without any legal barriers. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the US SEC has already created years’ worth of uncertainty around XRP’s legal status. Until this issue is resolved favorably, the cryptocurrency’s potential for mainstream adoption remains limited. Jasmin has also highlighted that XRP would have to incorporate mechanisms that would drastically reduce its circulating supply. While the cryptocurrency’s price could grow with more aggressive token burns, a jump to $1,000 still seems unlikely. Such a high valuation would also need massive speculative trading activities, which are usually seen during bull markets. How Market Cap Influences A $1,000 Projection Based on Jasmin’s analysis, the most significant factor that makes a $1,000 XRP price projection unrealistic is its market capitalization. Currently, XRP has a market cap of about $125.15 billion, and for its price to hit a four-digit level, its total market valuation would need to reach $50 trillion. Related Reading: XRP Price Cross That Led To 20x Rally In 2017 Returns To put this in perspective, the global crypto market capitalization today is $3.09 trillion, according to CoinGecko data. This would mean that XRP alone would need a market cap over 15x higher than the entire crypto market. Furthermore, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has never even come close to reaching a $10 trillion market cap. BTC’s market valuation currently sits at $1.92 trillion, meaning XRP would have to surpass it by over 25x to get a $50 trillion market cap. Due to these extreme market cap requirements, Jasmin argues that a $1,000 or even $10,000 target is highly unrealistic. However, she acknowledges that a price surge to $5 or even $10 is a far more attainable goal.

44299923,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158218,1746661810,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,UBS Forecast: USD/ZAR Could Plummet on Rising Risk Appetite,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usd-zar-ubs-forecast/,"For those tracking global markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, shifts in major currency pairs like the USD/ZAR can offer valuable insights into broader economic sentiment. Recent analysis from UBS suggests a notable potential movement for this pair, indicating that conditions are aligning for the US Dollar to weaken against the South African Rand. This outlook is significantly tied to increasing trade deal optimism and a corresponding rise in global investor risk appetite . What is Driving the UBS Forecast on USD/ZAR? UBS analysts point to specific factors underpinning their view that the USD/ZAR exchange rate may decline. A lower USD/ZAR rate means it takes fewer US Dollars to buy one South African Rand, effectively indicating a strengthening ZAR relative to the USD. The primary drivers identified are: Trade Deal Progress: Positive developments or the anticipation of favorable outcomes in major international trade negotiations tend to reduce global economic uncertainty. This encourages investors to move away from traditional safe-haven assets, like the US Dollar, towards currencies associated with emerging markets, such as the South African Rand. Increased Risk Appetite: When investor confidence is high and global economic prospects appear brighter, there is a greater willingness to take on more risk. Emerging market currencies and assets often benefit disproportionately from this shift, as they typically offer higher yields but also carry greater perceived risk. A surge in risk appetite directly supports the ZAR. These two factors are often intertwined. Successful trade talks signal improved global economic health, which in turn boosts confidence and encourages risk-taking in the Forex market and beyond. How Does Trade Deal Optimism Impact Emerging Markets? Emerging markets, like South Africa, are often highly sensitive to global trade flows and investor sentiment. Here’s why trade deal optimism is particularly impactful: Export Potential: Better trade relations can open up or expand export markets for South African goods, boosting economic activity and potentially improving the country’s trade balance. Foreign Investment: Reduced trade tensions create a more stable and predictable global environment, making emerging markets more attractive destinations for foreign direct investment and portfolio flows. This inflow of capital increases demand for the local currency (ZAR). Commodity Prices: Many emerging economies are significant commodity exporters. Improved global trade often correlates with stronger demand for commodities, pushing prices up. As a major exporter of minerals and other commodities, South Africa’s economy benefits from higher prices, which supports the Rand. This positive feedback loop reinforces the case for a stronger ZAR when trade prospects improve, influencing the USD/ZAR pair. Understanding the Role of Risk Appetite in Forex Risk appetite is a key metric for understanding capital flows in the Forex market . It describes the level of risk that investors are willing to take on. When risk appetite is high, investors seek higher returns, often found in assets perceived as riskier, such as: Emerging market currencies (like ZAR) Stocks in developing economies Certain commodities Conversely, when risk appetite is low (during periods of uncertainty or fear), investors flock to safe havens like: The US Dollar (often considered a primary safe haven) Japanese Yen Swiss Franc Government bonds from stable economies Gold The current environment, characterized by increasing trade deal optimism , is fostering higher risk appetite . This dynamic directly impacts the USD/ZAR pair, as capital flows move out of the safe-haven USD and into the higher-yielding, risk-sensitive ZAR. What Does a Weakening USD/ZAR Mean for the Market? A weakening USD/ZAR rate has several implications for different market participants: For South Africa: Makes imports cheaper (potentially reducing inflation). Makes exports more expensive for international buyers (could impact competitiveness unless commodity prices are rising). Attracts foreign investment seeking exposure to a strengthening currency and potentially higher local returns. Can improve the country’s external debt profile if denominated in USD. For USD Holders/Investors: Investments in ZAR-denominated assets become more valuable when converted back to USD. Travel to South Africa becomes less expensive. For the Forex Market: Increased trading activity around the USD/ZAR pair. Potential for volatility as sentiment shifts. May signal broader trends for other emerging market currencies against the USD. Are There Challenges or Risks to This Outlook? While the UBS forecast highlights the potential for USD/ZAR to weaken, it’s crucial to remember that Forex markets are influenced by numerous factors. Potential challenges or risks include: Reversal in Trade Optimism: Any breakdown or negative turn in trade negotiations could quickly reverse sentiment and strengthen the USD. Domestic Issues in South Africa: Local political instability, economic challenges (like power shortages or high unemployment), or changes in monetary policy by the South African Reserve Bank could negatively impact the ZAR regardless of global sentiment. Unexpected Global Events: Geopolitical shocks, new economic data from major economies (US inflation, Federal Reserve policy), or other unforeseen events can rapidly shift risk appetite and currency valuations. Commodity Price Volatility: While often linked to trade, commodity prices have their own dynamics and significant declines could hurt the ZAR. Therefore, while the current environment supports the UBS forecast , continuous monitoring of global and local developments is essential. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Given the UBS forecast and the factors at play, what should market participants consider? Monitor Trade Headlines: Keep a close eye on news related to major international trade negotiations. Positive headlines reinforce the trend; negative ones pose a risk. Track Risk Appetite Indicators: Observe broader market movements. Are stock markets rising globally? Are traditional safe havens like gold or the Yen weakening? These can be signs of increasing risk appetite . Analyze South African Fundamentals: Pay attention to South Africa’s economic data releases (inflation, growth, unemployment) and political developments. These domestic factors play a significant role in the ZAR’s strength. Consider Volatility: Emerging market currencies can be volatile. Risk management is crucial if trading the USD/ZAR pair. Look for Confirmation: While UBS has a view, look for analysis from other major banks and research institutions to see if there is a consensus forming in the Forex market . This environment driven by trade deal optimism and rising risk appetite presents potential opportunities but also requires careful analysis and awareness of potential pitfalls. In conclusion, UBS’s outlook for a potentially weaker USD/ZAR pair is strongly linked to the positive momentum generated by trade deal optimism and the resulting increase in global investor risk appetite . These factors create a favorable environment for emerging market currencies like the South African Rand. However, market participants must remain vigilant, as the complex interplay of global events, domestic conditions, and shifts in sentiment can quickly alter the trajectory of currency pairs in the volatile Forex market .

44300157,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158219,1746662151,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI in Gaming Startup Sett Secures $27M for Revolutionary Game Development AI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-gaming-startup-funding/,"For those tracking the convergence of technology and digital economies, the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence are creating ripples across various sectors, including the booming world of gaming. Just as GPUs evolved to power complex game graphics and now fuel AI computations, AI itself is becoming integral to how games are built and promoted. This intersection is precisely where a new player, Sett, is making its mark, emerging from stealth with significant startup funding to apply AI to the mobile game landscape. What Problem is Sett Solving with AI in Gaming? The mobile gaming market is fiercely competitive. Building a game might be accessible, but making it stand out and succeed is a monumental challenge. Companies pour billions into user acquisition marketing, yet the content needed for this, like engaging playable ads, is costly and time-consuming to produce. This is the core pain point Sett targets. They’ve developed AI agents specifically designed to tackle the complexities of getting games noticed in a crowded marketplace. How is Sett Revolutionizing Mobile Game Marketing? Sett’s primary focus is on enhancing mobile game marketing through AI-driven automation. With changes in user tracking on platforms like iOS, the emphasis has shifted to ‘creative content’ – interactive marketing materials and in-game moments that draw users in. These ‘playable’ ads, while effective, are often as complex and expensive to create as mini-games themselves. Sett claims its AI platform can generate this crucial marketing content significantly faster and cheaper than traditional methods. Early customers include major names like Zynga, Scopely, and Rovio, indicating strong initial traction. Exploring the Impact of Game Development AI on Efficiency The startup asserts a dramatic improvement in efficiency for creating marketing assets. By leveraging their game development AI agents, Sett suggests the process can be up to 15 times faster and 25 times cheaper compared to manual creation. This level of automation could fundamentally change how game publishers approach their marketing efforts, allowing for more experimentation and scale in reaching potential players. The company’s technology includes a custom game engine and an agentic layer designed to generate code, providing a flexible foundation for their AI tools. What Does This Funding Mean for Gaming Industry News? Sett’s emergence and substantial startup funding highlight a key trend in the gaming sector: the increasing reliance on AI to solve operational challenges. The investment, totaling $27 million across seed and Series A rounds led by firms like Bessemer Venture Partners, signals strong investor confidence in Sett’s approach. This news adds another layer to the dynamic gaming industry news landscape, especially considering parallel developments like AppLovin selling its gaming assets, which were reportedly used, in part, to train their own AI models for ad tech. Sett’s funding will be used to expand their team of engineers and AI specialists to meet demand, as they already have over 100 studios on a waiting list. Is AI Set to Replace Human Creativity in Game Development? While Sett’s current focus is on marketing and in-game content generation, the broader question of AI’s role in full game development AI looms. Sett’s CEO, Amit Carmi, believes building AI agents for end-to-end development and marketing is possible, though he notes this might not be Sett’s ultimate direction. Investors and founders suggest that while AI can automate parts of production and distribution, especially marketing content, the human element remains crucial for the high level of detail and creativity needed to make truly successful, stand-out games in a crowded market. The consensus seems to be that AI will serve as a powerful tool and co-pilot rather than a complete replacement for human designers and developers in the foreseeable future. In summary, Sett’s $27 million funding round marks a significant moment for the application of AI in gaming . By focusing on AI agents for automated marketing content creation, the company addresses a critical need for efficiency and cost reduction in mobile game marketing . This development is a notable piece of gaming industry news , demonstrating how substantial startup funding is flowing into AI solutions that promise to reshape parts of the game creation and promotion pipeline. While the full scope of game development AI is still unfolding, Sett is positioned to play a key role in making mobile games more visible and viable.

Technical indicators are bullish, and the approval odds of a much-anticipated Cardano ETF are boosting investor confidence. However, while traders are keeping a close eye on ADA, another project is quietly stealing the spotlight with an even greater potential for explosive growth. Enter Ruvi , the AI-powered cryptocurrency set to redefine blockchain innovation. If Cardano’s steady rise excites you, Ruvi’s massive upside potential will leave you speechless. Here’s why Ruvi could be your ticket to crypto millions. Cardano eyes a $1 break, but will it deliver? Cardano has seen a resurgence in investor sentiment, thanks to well-aligned technical patterns. The formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders and a successful test of a descending wedge suggest ADA might soar beyond key resistance levels of $0.88 and $1. Notably, speculation around the approval of a Cardano ETF is injecting the market with optimism, presenting ADA as a strong play for long-term investors. But even if Cardano reaches $1 and beyond, ADA’s established position caps its growth compared to earlier stages. For those looking for multiplier-level returns, early-stage projects like Ruvi represent the ultimate growth opportunity. Why Ruvi is outshining the competition Ruvi isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s a full-fledged ecosystem revolutionizing industries through artificial intelligence. Designed for maximum impact and sustained growth, Ruvi merges cutting-edge AI with blockchain, driving solutions in predictive analytics, fraud detection, and logistics optimization. Key reasons Ruvi outshines other tokens: Fixed supply creates scarcity Unlike inflationary tokens, Ruvi’s hard cap of 1.5 billion tokens fuels demand, ensuring sustained price appreciation. Real-world AI application Ruvi isn’t just theoretical. Its integration of AI delivers measurable results across industries. Unmatched presale bonuses The Ruvi presale is designed to reward early supporters, offering unparalleled bonuses that multiply investor returns. Ruvi presale structure Ruvi’s presale provides an irresistible opportunity to secure tokens at just $0.01 each, with tailored bonuses designed to amplify your investment: $200-$500 investment: 20% bonus $500-$1,000 investment: 40% bonus $1,000-$2,000 investment: 60% bonus $2,000-$5,000 investment: 80% bonus Investments over $5,000: 100% bonus Real examples of Ruvi’s ROI potential Entry-level ($300 Investment) Investing $300 secures 30,000 tokens at $0.01 each. With a 20% bonus, you get an extra 6,000 tokens, taking your total to 36,000 tokens. If Ruvi hits $1.90, your initial $300 investment could yield an impressive $68,400. Mid-tier ($1,500 Investment) A $1,500 investment gets you 150,000 tokens. With a 60% bonus, you gain an additional 90,000 tokens, totaling 240,000 tokens. Should Ruvi reach $3.50, your portfolio could balloon to $840,000! High-tier ($7,000 Investment) At $7,000, you receive 700,000 tokens, and with a 100% bonus, this doubles to 1.4 million tokens. If Ruvi climbs to $5.00, your initial stake could skyrocket to $7 million! Why timing is critical While Cardano navigates the crowded crypto market, Ruvi offers something rare in today’s environment—first-mover rewards. Investing during its presale phase not only secures tokens at the lowest price but also locks in generous bonuses. Every day you delay, Ruvi edges closer to higher valuations, reducing the phenomenal ROI currently within reach. Take action before it’s too late Cardano’s potential surge to $1 promises gains for its holders. But in a world where gains are measured in multiples, Ruvi offers the kind of groundbreaking opportunity usually reserved for the earliest movers in the crypto space. Don’t sit on the sidelines while others seize this once-in-a-lifetime chance to multiply their investments.

If Not, There’s Still Time to Earn at $0.0019 Before BDAG Hits Exchanges",https://thecoinrise.com/heard-about-blockdags-25-referral-rewards-if-not-theres-still-time-to-earn-at-0-0019-before-bdag-hits-exchanges/,"In a world where crypto earnings often take time or complex steps, BlockDAG (BDAG) keeps it simple. Refer someone, and you get 25% of their BDAG buy right away. It’s not delayed or locked up. It’s fast, direct, and happens the moment the transaction goes through. Even better, the person you refer earns a 5% BDAG bonus too. Every referral becomes a shared win. With BDAG priced at $0.0019 until May 13 and exchange listings going live the same day, there’s not much time left. For those searching for the top crypto to invest in now, BlockDAG’s mix of easy rewards and early pricing stands out. Fast Payouts, Simple Steps, Real Rewards BlockDAG’s referral setup works fast. As soon as you sign up, you get your own referral link. Share it, and when someone uses it to buy, you receive 25% of their purchase in BDAG right away. They get 5% more BDAG too, which makes it easy to share and benefit together. What makes this system different is how quick and clear it is. There’s no long wait, no extra steps, and no spending limits. Just use your code, earn coins, and repeat as many times as you like. That’s what makes BlockDAG feel different right now. If you’re looking for a crypto to invest in now without needing big funds or advanced skills, this is one to watch. Countdown to $0.0019: Final Chance Before May 13 The referral rewards are exciting, but timing is what makes this moment stand out. BDAG is currently available at a limited price of $0.0019, a sharp drop from the current batch 28 rate of $0.0262. This special offer ends on May 13, along with the chance to buy before listings go live. After that, exchange updates will roll out and prices will shift based on the market. That means buyers later on could pay much more per coin. Right now, the numbers line up well for users sharing referral links. For anyone seeking a crypto to invest in now, it’s a simple equation: buy low, earn 25% BDAG from each referral, and help others earn their 5% bonus too. Three wins in one move. Momentum Backed by Real Numbers BlockDAG’s referral setup works even better because of how far the presale has come. With $227.5 million already raised and over 19.7 billion BDAG sold across 28 batches, this is a project already in action. The ROI from the very first batch now stands at 2,520%, showing that those who joined early made strong gains. The current price gives new users a shot at getting in near those levels before listings change the game. The referral program is also powering fast organic growth. As more users hear about it and join, it becomes easier to keep earning 25% BDAG through new sign-ups. That’s why many see this as a solid crypto to invest in now. It’s simple, and both buyers and sharers benefit immediately. Last Say BlockDAG is showing how earning in crypto can work without delay. The 25% referral bonus pays right away, and the person you bring in gets 5% extra. Combine that with the $0.0019 limited price valid until May 13, and it creates a short-term opening that’s getting harder to ignore. With $227.5 million raised, 19.7 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% gain since batch one, this is no longer just early speculation. Whether you’re new to crypto or want to grow fast by sharing a referral code, BlockDAG brings speed and access. If you’re aiming for a crypto to invest in now with real earning potential, this may be one of the clearest moves of 2025. But the window is closing, and once May 13 passes, the game could change completely.

The US government reportedly uses modified apps to archive messages. A Reuters photo last week revealed that Michael Waltz, the recently ousted national security adviser, was using TeleMessage to communicate with colleagues during a Trump administration cabinet meeting. Trump said last week on Truth Social that he plans to nominate Waltz to serve as the US ambassador to the United Nations. The former national security adviser fell into hot water earlier this year for accidentally adding a journalist to a sensitive Signal chat about war plans between top Trump administration figures. The identity of the hacker remains unknown, but 404 Media viewed the hacked material that was anonymously provided. The hacker also anonymously noted that the hack took 15-20 minutes and “wasn’t much effort at all.” The hacker didn’t access Waltz’s messages specifically, but the thief did access data related to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the crypto exchange Coinbase, as well as other financial institutions. A screenshot shows that the hacker was able to access a TeleMessage panel that lists the names, phone numbers and email addresses of CPB employees. The screenshot also shows an option to select 747 entries, suggesting that the attacker has access to the data of hundreds of US government employees.

44300281,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158220,1746662451,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Treasury Powerhouse: Asset Entities and Strive Merge for Public BTC Play,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asset-entities-bitcoin-treasury/,"Big news is hitting the wires for those following the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency. Asset Entities (NASDAQ: ASST), a company already listed on the NASDAQ exchange, is set to merge with Strive Asset Management. The strategic goal? To create a new kind of entity on the public markets: a dedicated Bitcoin treasury company. This move signals a potentially significant shift, offering investors a novel way to gain exposure to the leading digital asset. What is a Public Bitcoin Treasury Company? Before diving into the specifics of the Asset Entities and Strive Asset Management deal, let’s clarify what a public Bitcoin company focused on treasury operations actually entails. Unlike companies that mine Bitcoin or provide crypto services, a Bitcoin treasury company primarily holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a significant asset. The core objective is often to provide shareholders with direct exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin through the company’s stock. Key characteristics typically include: Primary Asset Holding: A substantial portion of the company’s assets consists of Bitcoin. Strategic Focus: Management is focused on strategies related to acquiring, holding, and potentially managing their Bitcoin reserves. Shareholder Value: The value proposition to shareholders is often tied directly to the performance of their Bitcoin holdings. Public Listing: Being listed on a major exchange like NASDAQ allows broader investor access compared to private funds or direct crypto ownership. The most prominent example of this model is MicroStrategy, an operating software company that has famously adopted a corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, accumulating significant amounts of BTC over time. Asset Entities ASST and Strive Asset Management: The Merger Explained According to a GlobeNewswire press release, Asset Entities (NASDAQ: ASST) is merging with Strive Asset Management. The new combined entity will operate under the Strive brand and will remain listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. This is a crucial point – the existing public listing of Asset Entities provides a direct path for the new, Bitcoin-focused venture to immediately trade on a major U.S. exchange. Strive Asset Management, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, has positioned itself as an asset manager focusing on a different approach to investing, often emphasizing a focus on profit over political or social agendas (often referred to as ‘anti-ESG’). Their move into the Bitcoin treasury space via this merger with Asset Entities ASST indicates a strategic decision to embrace digital assets as a core component of their future offerings. The press release highlights that the new entity will focus on maximizing Bitcoin (BTC) exposure and long-term value for shareholders. This suggests a dedicated strategy towards accumulating and holding Bitcoin, making the company’s stock a proxy for direct BTC investment, albeit with the added layers of corporate structure, management decisions, and market dynamics. Why This Strategic Move? Benefits for the New Entity and Investors The decision by Asset Entities and Strive Asset Management to merge and focus on becoming a NASDAQ listed Bitcoin company offers several potential benefits: Immediate Public Access: Leveraging Asset Entities’ existing NASDAQ listing bypasses the traditional IPO process for Strive’s new venture, allowing them to hit the ground running on a major exchange. Clear Market Positioning: Positioning the new entity explicitly as a ‘Bitcoin treasury company’ provides a clear and understandable value proposition for investors interested in Bitcoin exposure through traditional equity markets. Strive’s Brand and Expertise: Operating under the Strive brand brings their established identity and asset management expertise to the venture, potentially attracting their existing investor base and new capital. Potential for Capital Raising: Being publicly listed can facilitate easier access to capital markets for potential future fundraising, which could be used to acquire more Bitcoin. Shareholder Access to BTC: Provides traditional investors, who may be hesitant or unable to directly hold Bitcoin, with a regulated and familiar avenue for exposure via stock ownership. This merger creates a unique vehicle that combines the accessibility of a public stock with the investment focus on a volatile, high-growth asset class like Bitcoin. What Are the Potential Challenges and Risks? While the prospects are exciting, establishing a dedicated Bitcoin treasury company on a major exchange like NASDAQ also comes with significant challenges and risks: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The most obvious risk. The value of the company’s primary asset, and therefore its stock price, will be highly sensitive to the volatile price swings of Bitcoin. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally and within the U.S. Changes in regulations could impact the company’s operations, reporting requirements, or even the ability to hold Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Management and Operational Challenges: Successfully managing a corporate treasury of a volatile digital asset requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Market Perception and Premium/Discount: The stock price might trade at a premium or discount to the underlying value of its Bitcoin holdings (often referred to as Net Asset Value or NAV), influenced by market sentiment, management performance, and liquidity. Investors considering the new Strive entity will need to weigh these risks carefully against the potential benefits of Bitcoin exposure. Comparing to Other Public Bitcoin Companies How does this new venture compare to existing public Bitcoin company examples? As mentioned, MicroStrategy is the benchmark. However, MicroStrategy is primarily a software company whose core business generates revenue, and its Bitcoin treasury is a corporate strategy layered on top. While its stock price is heavily influenced by its BTC holdings, it still has an underlying operational business. The new Strive entity, emerging from the merger of Asset Entities and Strive Asset Management, appears to be positioning itself with a much more explicit and central focus on the Bitcoin treasury function from its inception. This might make it a more direct, albeit potentially more volatile, proxy for Bitcoin compared to companies with diversified operations. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching this development, here are some points to consider: Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Investing in a company whose value is closely tied to Bitcoin’s price means accepting significant volatility. Research the New Entity: Once the merger is complete and the new entity is fully operational under the Strive brand, thoroughly research their specific strategy for managing their Bitcoin treasury, their security protocols, and their management team. Understand the Premium/Discount: Pay attention to whether the stock is trading at a premium or discount to the value of its underlying Bitcoin holdings. This can indicate market sentiment and potential mispricing. Diversification: Consider how this investment fits into your overall portfolio diversification strategy. Stay Informed: Keep up with news regarding both the company’s performance and broader Bitcoin and crypto market developments. The creation of a dedicated NASDAQ listed Bitcoin company is a notable event, expanding the options for investors seeking regulated exposure to the digital asset space. A Compelling New Avenue for Bitcoin Exposure The merger between Asset Entities (ASST) and Strive Asset Management to form a public Bitcoin treasury company under the Strive brand is a significant development in the evolving landscape of crypto adoption within traditional finance. By creating a dedicated entity focused on maximizing Bitcoin exposure while remaining listed on NASDAQ, they are offering investors a clear and accessible pathway to participate in the potential growth of BTC. While the inherent volatility of Bitcoin and the operational challenges of managing a large digital asset treasury present risks, the strategic vision to create a focused public Bitcoin company could resonate with a growing segment of investors looking for regulated exposure. This move by Strive Asset Management and Asset Entities ASST marks another step towards bridging the gap between traditional equity markets and the innovative world of cryptocurrencies, potentially setting a precedent for future similar ventures.

Zhao, also known as CZ, said on a Farokh Radio podcast episode aired May 6 that he “wouldn’t mind” a pardon and that his lawyers have already filed the paperwork on his behalf “I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said, adding that he submitted the request after Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal reported in March that he was seeking a pardon from Trump amid discussions of a business deal between the Trump family and Binance.US. Zhao denied the reports at the time, but said on the podcast that he thought “if they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply.” He added that Trump’s pardon of three BitMEX founders, including Arthur Hayes, also motivated him to submit an application. Zhao said the application was submitted about two weeks ago. Changpeng Zhao (right) speaking with Farokh Sarmad (left). Source: Farokh Radio Zhao said at the time of the Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal reports that “no felon would mind a pardon,” and claimed he is the only person in US history to serve prison time for a Bank Secrecy Act charge. Zhao pleaded guilty to a money laundering charge in November 2023 as part of a deal Binance reached with US authorities, which saw it pay a $4.3 billion fine , to which Zhao contributed $50 million. He was also forced to step down as CEO . Zhao was later sentenced to four months in prison and was prohibited from working at Binance as part of his plea deal.

While our primary focus is the exciting world of digital assets, it’s crucial to keep an eye on traditional financial markets. Why? Because movements in the US stock market often offer valuable insights into broader economic trends and overall investor sentiment , which can indirectly influence the crypto landscape. Today, we’re seeing a notable positive signal from Wall Street. What’s Happening with the Stock Market Opening? The stock market opening today brought good news for traditional investors, with major indices kicking off the trading session on a higher note. This follows a period where markets have been closely watching economic data and corporate earnings reports. Here’s a quick look at how the key indices performed right out of the gate: S&P 500: Started the day up +0.13% NASDAQ: Opened with a gain of +0.07% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Saw the strongest initial momentum, rising +0.31% These early gains, though modest, suggest a positive start to the trading day, indicating that market participants are feeling a degree of optimism. Why Should Crypto Investors Care About the S&P 500 and NASDAQ? You might wonder, ‘I’m here for Bitcoin and Ethereum, why talk about the S&P 500 and NASDAQ ?’ That’s a fair question! The connection lies in the concept of risk appetite and market liquidity. Historically, there has been a correlation between the performance of tech stocks (heavily represented in the NASDAQ) and risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. When investors feel confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk, both tech stocks and crypto often benefit. Conversely, during periods of uncertainty or fear, investors tend to move towards safer assets, sometimes leading to sell-offs in both markets. The NASDAQ , in particular, is home to many growth-oriented technology companies. Its performance is often seen as a barometer for investor confidence in future innovation and economic expansion – themes that also resonate strongly within the crypto space. Similarly, the S&P 500 , representing the 500 largest US publicly traded companies, provides a broader snapshot of the overall health and direction of the US economy. When these major indices show strength, it can signal a more favorable macroeconomic environment for risk assets globally, including digital currencies. Understanding Investor Sentiment: A Key Driver At its core, the positive stock market opening reflects improving investor sentiment . Sentiment is essentially the overall attitude of investors towards a particular market or financial instrument. It’s driven by a mix of factors, including economic data releases, corporate earnings, geopolitical events, and even news headlines. Positive sentiment in traditional markets can spill over into the crypto market for several reasons: Increased Risk Appetite: When investors feel optimistic, they are more likely to allocate capital to higher-risk, potentially higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Liquidity: A strong stock market can indicate healthy overall market liquidity, meaning there’s more capital flowing through the financial system, some of which can find its way into crypto. Confidence Boost: General economic confidence, reflected in stock market gains, can indirectly boost confidence in newer, less-established asset classes like digital assets. Conversely, negative sentiment stemming from stock market downturns often correlates with crypto price drops, as investors become risk-averse and potentially liquidate crypto holdings to cover losses or increase cash positions elsewhere. What Might Be Driving This Positive Start? While the initial report is brief, several factors could be contributing to this morning’s positive momentum: Positive Economic Data: Recent reports on inflation, employment, or consumer spending might have exceeded expectations, boosting confidence in the economic outlook. Strong Corporate Earnings: If companies are reporting better-than-expected profits, it signals underlying business strength. Federal Reserve Outlook: Any indications that the Federal Reserve might be nearing the end of its rate-hiking cycle or considering future cuts can be positive for markets. Geopolitical Stability: A reduction in major geopolitical tensions can decrease uncertainty and encourage investment. It’s important to remember that market movements are complex and influenced by a multitude of factors. The initial stock market opening is just one data point in a continuous trading day. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how should you, as a crypto investor, use this information? Stay Informed: Recognize the interconnectedness. While crypto has its unique drivers, global macroeconomic conditions and traditional market sentiment matter. Watch for Correlation: Observe how Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies react throughout the day. Do they track the stock market’s movements, or are they following their own narrative? Assess Risk Appetite: A positive US stock market can indicate higher overall risk appetite. This might be a favorable environment for altcoins or higher-beta crypto assets, but always conduct your own research. Diversify Your Information Sources: Don’t rely solely on stock market news, but integrate it into your broader understanding of the financial landscape. This morning’s positive start in the US stock market , including gains in the S&P 500 and NASDAQ , is a signal of potentially improving investor sentiment in traditional finance. While not a direct predictor of crypto prices, it’s a data point worth considering as part of the larger global economic picture that influences all asset classes. Concluding Thoughts The higher stock market opening today provides a glimmer of optimism in the broader financial world. For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding these traditional market movements is like having an extra compass. It helps gauge the prevailing winds of investor sentiment and global risk appetite, factors that can subtly, yet significantly, impact the path of digital assets. Keep watching how this sentiment evolves throughout the day and week, and how the crypto market responds.

While the United States has emerged as a significant player in the global Bitcoin mining industry , its reliance on hardware manufactured predominantly overseas, particularly in China, presents a critical vulnerability. This situation is forcing companies to rethink strategies, potentially altering the competitive balance on a global scale. Why Are Tariffs a Major Concern for US Bitcoin Miners ? At the heart of the challenge is the simple fact that high-performance application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, the backbone of modern Bitcoin mining operations, are not widely produced domestically. For years, China dominated both the manufacturing and operation sides of the Bitcoin mining industry . While crackdowns in China led to a mass migration of miners to other regions, including the U.S., the manufacturing base largely remained concentrated in Asia. This dependency means that American mining companies must import the vast majority of their Bitcoin mining equipment . Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, directly increase the cost of acquiring these machines. For an industry with already tight margins, heavily influenced by energy costs and Bitcoin price volatility, added expenses on core infrastructure can be devastating. Think of it like this: Higher Upfront Costs: Tariffs add a percentage onto the purchase price of every mining rig imported. Reduced Profitability: Increased capital expenditure means a longer time to recoup investment, impacting overall profitability. Competitive Disadvantage: Miners in regions without similar tariffs can acquire the same equipment at a lower cost, giving them an edge. The imposition of significant crypto tariffs specifically targeting mining hardware could fundamentally alter the economic viability of mining operations within the United States. The Current State of Mining Hardware Tariffs The issue of mining hardware tariffs has been a point of contention for some time. Under previous administrations, tariffs were placed on a wide range of goods imported from China, including electronics that could be classified as computing hardware used for mining. The Trump administration, despite its leader’s later expressed interest in crypto, was the one that initially implemented these tariffs. Recently, there was a temporary reprieve. A 90-day pause on certain tariffs provided a brief window of relief for US Bitcoin miners . This pause allowed companies to potentially accelerate hardware imports at pre-tariff prices, a strategic move to stock up before the potential resumption of higher costs. However, as The Block reported, this relief was temporary, and uncertainty looms large as the July deadline approaches. The potential re-imposition of tariffs creates significant planning challenges. Companies must weigh the risk of waiting against the cost of buying now, even if they don’t immediately need the equipment. This uncertainty is perhaps as damaging as the tariffs themselves, making long-term capital planning difficult for the Bitcoin mining industry in the U.S. Key Points on the Tariff Situation: Tariffs apply to imported ASIC mining machines. These tariffs originated from broader trade policies with countries like China. A temporary 90-day pause offered brief relief. The potential resumption of tariffs in July is causing significant concern and strategic adjustments. The specific tariff rates can vary based on classification, but the impact is a direct increase in hardware cost. The Global Ripple Effect: Who Stands to Gain from High Crypto Tariffs in the U.S.? When costs for US Bitcoin miners rise due to tariffs, it inevitably shifts the global competitive landscape. Mining is a global endeavor, and capital tends to flow to regions where it can operate most efficiently and profitably. If the U.S. becomes a more expensive place to set up or expand mining operations, other regions become relatively more attractive. As the source article notes, Russia is one country that stands to gain. Why? Access to energy costs is a major factor in mining profitability, and Russia often boasts competitive energy prices. Furthermore, if they can acquire the same Bitcoin mining equipment without facing the same tariff burdens as U.S. companies, their operational costs become significantly lower on a per-machine basis. This cost advantage allows Russian firms to potentially expand more rapidly or operate profitably at lower Bitcoin price points than their American counterparts. But it’s not just Russia. The report highlights that global miners are increasingly eyeing alternative markets. Regions in Africa and South America are emerging as potential new hubs for the Bitcoin mining industry . These areas often offer: Lower Energy Costs: Access to abundant and cheap sources of electricity, sometimes from renewable sources. Developing Infrastructure: Opportunities to build out mining infrastructure from the ground up. Potentially Favorable Regulations: Some countries are actively seeking to attract crypto businesses. Access to Hardware: Potentially less friction or lower costs for importing Bitcoin mining equipment compared to a high-tariff environment like the potential one in the U.S. This global diversification is a natural response to economic pressures. While tariffs might be intended to protect or encourage domestic industries, in a globally connected industry like Bitcoin mining, they can inadvertently push activity (and hash rate) to other parts of the world, potentially undermining the goal of establishing the U.S. as a dominant mining center. Strategic Adjustments: How US Bitcoin Miners Are Responding Facing the dual challenge of existing tariffs and potential increases, US Bitcoin miners are not sitting idle. They are actively adjusting their strategies to mitigate risks and maintain competitiveness. These adjustments span several areas: 1. Accelerated Hardware Procurement: During the temporary tariff pause, many companies likely rushed to import as much Bitcoin mining equipment as possible to lock in lower prices before the potential resumption of higher mining hardware tariffs . This involves significant capital outlay upfront but hedges against future cost increases. 2. Diversifying Suppliers (Where Possible): While major ASIC manufacturers are concentrated, miners may explore options from different producers or look into secondary markets, though the latter comes with its own risks regarding machine lifespan and efficiency. 3. Exploring Domestic Manufacturing: Although currently limited, there is ongoing discussion and nascent effort within the U.S. to develop domestic manufacturing capabilities for mining hardware. This is a long-term strategy that requires significant investment and technological development to compete with established foreign producers. 4. Geographic Relocation/Expansion: As mentioned, some U.S. companies are looking at expanding or relocating parts of their operations to more favorable jurisdictions, both domestically (seeking lower energy costs in states like Texas or those with abundant hydro power) and internationally (exploring the opportunities in Africa, South America, or other regions with lower crypto tariffs and energy prices). 5. Lobbying and Advocacy: The Bitcoin mining industry is increasingly engaging with policymakers in Washington D.C. to educate them about the industry’s needs and the potential negative consequences of tariffs on its growth and competitiveness within the U.S. 6. Focusing on Efficiency and Innovation: Regardless of hardware costs, improving operational efficiency (energy use, cooling, uptime) becomes even more critical when capital expenses are high. Investment in infrastructure and operational best practices is key. These strategic shifts highlight the resilience and adaptability of the US Bitcoin miners , but they also underscore the significant pressure the industry is under due to external economic and trade policies. Challenges and Opportunities for the Bitcoin Mining Industry in the U.S. The tariff situation presents a clear set of challenges but also potential, albeit difficult, opportunities for the Bitcoin mining industry in the United States. Challenges: Increased operational costs and reduced profitability. Difficulty in competing with miners in regions with lower hardware costs. Uncertainty hindering long-term investment and expansion planning. Potential for slower growth or even contraction of U.S. hash rate share. Risk of pushing innovation and investment in mining infrastructure to other countries. Opportunities: Potential impetus for developing a domestic Bitcoin mining equipment manufacturing industry (long-term). Increased focus on energy efficiency and utilization of renewable energy sources to offset other costs. Development of innovative financing and operational models to adapt to cost pressures. Strengthened industry lobbying efforts to create a more favorable regulatory environment. Driving diversification into regions with untapped potential, contributing to the global decentralization of hash rate. Navigating these challenges requires a combination of smart business strategy, technological adaptation, and effective engagement with the political process. The future trajectory of the Bitcoin mining industry in the U.S. is heavily dependent on how these factors play out, particularly regarding the duration and level of crypto tariffs . Looking Ahead: The Future of US Bitcoin Miners and Tariffs The coming months are crucial for US Bitcoin miners . The decision regarding the resumption of mining hardware tariffs in July will be a pivotal moment. If tariffs return at significant levels, the pressure on U.S. operations will intensify, likely accelerating the strategic shifts already underway, including potential moves to more favorable international locations. Conversely, if the tariffs are removed or significantly reduced, it would provide a much-needed boost to the competitiveness of the Bitcoin mining industry within the U.S., potentially attracting more investment and encouraging expansion. The outcome will depend on a complex interplay of trade policy objectives, domestic economic considerations, and the growing recognition of the strategic importance of the Bitcoin network and the infrastructure that supports it. The situation also highlights a broader theme: the interconnectedness of global trade policy and the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, traditional economic levers like tariffs have unexpected and significant impacts on nascent but important industries like Bitcoin mining. For investors and observers of the crypto space, understanding the implications of these tariffs is vital. It’s not just a technical issue; it’s an economic and geopolitical one that affects the distribution of hash rate, the profitability of mining companies, and the overall health and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for the U.S. Mining Landscape The potential return of significant tariffs on imported Bitcoin mining equipment represents a critical juncture for US Bitcoin miners . While a temporary pause offered brief relief, the underlying dependency on foreign hardware and the threat of increased crypto tariffs pose substantial challenges to the growth and competitiveness of the Bitcoin mining industry in the United States. This situation not only impacts American firms but also creates opportunities for international competitors, such as those in Russia, and drives diversification into new global markets like Africa and South America. The strategic responses of U.S. miners—from accelerated procurement to exploring international expansion and lobbying efforts—underscore the high stakes involved. The coming decision on tariffs will significantly shape the future landscape of Bitcoin mining, determining whether the U.S. can solidify its position as a global leader or if economic pressures will continue to push this vital industry towards more favorable shores.

44300899,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158226,1746663635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Michael Saylor: Boldly Urges Microsoft to Choose Bitcoin Over Stock Buybacks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-bitcoin-saylor-advice/,"Imagine one of the world’s largest and most influential technology companies making a radical shift in its financial strategy. That’s precisely the bold suggestion recently put forward by none other than Michael Saylor , the outspoken founder of MicroStrategy and a staunch advocate for Bitcoin. Speaking at Strategy World 2025, Saylor delivered a compelling argument aimed squarely at Microsoft: abandon the traditional practice of stock buybacks and instead, channel that capital into a significant Bitcoin investment . Michael Saylor’s Vision: A Blueprint for Corporate Treasury? Michael Saylor is not new to advocating for corporate Bitcoin adoption . His own company, MicroStrategy, famously holds a substantial amount of BTC on its balance sheet, making it one of the pioneers and largest corporate holders globally. This strategic move, initiated years ago, was a direct result of Saylor’s deep conviction that traditional fiat currencies are depreciating assets over the long term and that Bitcoin is the only viable long-term store of value in the digital age. His appearance at Strategy World 2025 provided a platform to bring this conviction to a wider audience of corporate strategists and finance leaders, specifically targeting a company with the financial might and forward-looking reputation of Microsoft. Saylor’s vision is clear: corporations need to fundamentally rethink their treasury strategies for the 21st century, and that involves embracing hard digital assets like Bitcoin as primary reserve assets rather than liabilities or simply low-yield cash. Why a Microsoft Bitcoin Strategy Could Be Transformative The idea of Microsoft , a company synonymous with mainstream technology, stability, and immense financial resources, allocating a portion of its vast cash reserves to Bitcoin is significant. A Microsoft Bitcoin strategy, even a relatively small one compared to their total assets, could send a powerful signal across the entire corporate world. It has the potential to legitimize Bitcoin investment strategy for countless other large companies that might be hesitant to be early movers. Beyond the symbolic impact, holding Bitcoin could serve practical purposes for Microsoft. It could act as a powerful hedge against inflation, which erodes the value of large cash holdings. It could also diversify their treasury holdings away from traditional dollar-denominated assets and potentially offer significant upside appreciation in a rapidly evolving global economy. However, such a move is complex and not without its challenges. Microsoft would need to navigate potential shareholder skepticism, address concerns about Bitcoin’s price volatility, and build or acquire the necessary infrastructure and expertise for secure custody and management of digital assets, all while understanding the evolving regulatory landscape. Evaluating the Bitcoin Investment Strategy for Corporations Let’s delve deeper into the core of Saylor’s argument: performance. He presented a clear, data-driven case based on historical returns. According to reports, he cited a dramatic difference in average annual returns over a specific period: Bitcoin (BTC): An impressive average annual return of approximately 62%. Microsoft Stock (MSFT): A respectable, but significantly lower, average annual return of approximately 18%. This significant gap is the crux of Saylor’s recommendation. He suggests that capital deployed into a Bitcoin investment strategy could generate far greater returns for shareholders over the long term than capital used for activities like stock buybacks or simply holding cash. A corporate Bitcoin investment isn’t just about buying BTC; it involves a comprehensive assessment of risk tolerance, determining an appropriate allocation size relative to the company’s balance sheet, and establishing robust, secure custody solutions to protect the asset. It requires a fundamental shift in how a corporate finance department views reserve assets – moving from low-yield, stable instruments to a high-growth, volatile, but potentially more rewarding digital asset class. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption While Microsoft hasn’t publicly announced plans for such a move (yet), the landscape of corporate Bitcoin adoption is undeniably expanding. A growing number of public and private companies, spanning various sectors, are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset. Their motivations are diverse but often include several key factors: Inflation Hedge: Seeking to protect the purchasing power of their cash reserves against currency debasement. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Diversifying away from traditional financial assets perceived as being at risk in the current global economic climate. Potential Appreciation: Believing that Bitcoin’s unique properties and limited supply will lead to significant value appreciation over the long term. Attracting Talent and Signalling Innovation: Positioning the company as forward-thinking and adaptable in the digital age. This trend, championed early on by figures like Michael Saylor , is moving from the fringe to the mainstream, prompting more corporate boards and finance committees to seriously consider the asset class as a legitimate component of their treasury strategy. Stock Buybacks vs Bitcoin: A Strategic Showdown Stock buybacks are a widely used corporate finance tool. Companies repurchase their own shares from the open market, which reduces the number of outstanding shares. This action is intended to increase the earnings per share (EPS) and potentially boost the stock price, thereby returning value to shareholders. It’s often seen as an efficient way to deploy excess cash when a company believes its own stock is undervalued or sees limited opportunities for higher returns by reinvesting directly in the business. Saylor’s argument creates a direct and provocative comparison: is the return generated by reducing share count (and hoping the market responds positively) truly superior to the potential return and balance sheet protection offered by holding a rapidly appreciating, decentralized asset like Bitcoin ? He clearly believes the latter offers a more compelling path for long-term value creation and preservation in the current economic and monetary environment. This debate highlights a fundamental strategic choice companies face regarding capital allocation – stick with traditional methods or embrace innovative digital asset strategies. Actionable Insights & Considerations for Corporations: For any company considering Saylor’s advice, whether it’s Microsoft or another large corporation, the path forward involves rigorous due diligence and strategic planning: Comprehensive Research: Understand Bitcoin’s technology, its role in the global economy, market dynamics, and historical performance beyond simple percentage returns. Thorough Risk Assessment: Evaluate volatility risks, regulatory uncertainty across different jurisdictions, and the operational security needs for holding significant digital assets. Custody Solutions: Explore and implement secure, institutional-grade custody solutions to protect the invested capital. Shareholder Communication: Prepare a clear and convincing rationale to explain the strategy and its potential benefits and risks to investors and the market. Long-Term Perspective: Approach a Bitcoin investment strategy with a long-term view, accepting short-term price volatility as part of the asset’s nature. Summary: Michael Saylor ‘s call for Microsoft to abandon stock buybacks in favor of a Microsoft Bitcoin strategy is a bold and significant challenge to conventional corporate finance wisdom. Backed by compelling data showing Bitcoin’s significant historical outperformance compared to traditional assets like Microsoft stock, his argument positions Bitcoin as essential “digital capital” for the modern era, offering a powerful hedge against traditional market frailties and monetary inflation. While a move of this magnitude by a company the size of Microsoft would be monumental and involve navigating complex internal and external factors, Saylor’s persistent advocacy, rooted in his own company’s pioneering and successful corporate Bitcoin adoption , forces a critical conversation about the best way for corporations to preserve and grow value in an increasingly digital, volatile, and unpredictable world. The strategic debate between traditional capital allocation methods like stock buybacks and innovative digital asset strategies is far from settled, but Michael Saylor has certainly ensured it remains front and center for the corporate elite.

44301110,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158227,1746663922,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolut Unleashes Rapid Bitcoin Lightning Payments in Europe,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/revolut-bitcoin-lightning-payments/,"Exciting news for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and Revolut users across the UK and parts of Europe! The popular British financial app, Revolut, is making a significant leap into the future of digital transactions by integrating Bitcoin payments powered by the Lightning Network. This move, facilitated by Lightspark’s advanced infrastructure, promises to transform how users interact with Bitcoin within the Revolut ecosystem. What is the Bitcoin Lightning Network and Why Does it Matter? For those new to the world of Bitcoin, transactions on the main blockchain can sometimes be slow and costly, especially during periods of high network congestion. The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a ‘Layer 2’ payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Think of it as adding extra lanes to a busy highway. Instead of processing every small transaction directly on the main, slower blockchain (Layer 1), the Lightning Network allows users to create secure payment channels off-chain. Within these channels, multiple transactions can occur instantly and with minimal fees. Only the final balances are settled on the main Bitcoin blockchain, significantly reducing the load and increasing efficiency. The key benefits of using the Lightning Network include: Speed: Transactions are near-instant, often settling in milliseconds. Lower Fees: Fees are typically fractions of a cent, making small transactions economically viable. Scalability: It allows for a much higher volume of transactions than the base Bitcoin layer can handle alone. Enhanced Privacy: While not completely private, off-chain transactions offer a degree of privacy as they aren’t broadcast to the entire network immediately. Revolut and Lightspark: Powering Faster Crypto Payments This strategic integration positions Revolut at the forefront of fintech innovation. By adopting the Lightning Network, Revolut is directly addressing some of the long-standing pain points associated with using Bitcoin for everyday transactions – namely, speed and cost. This makes Bitcoin more practical for payments, not just as a store of value. The integration is being powered by Lightspark , a company founded by former Meta executive David Marcus. Lightspark specializes in providing infrastructure and services to facilitate enterprise-grade access to the Lightning Network. Their technology helps companies like Revolut connect reliably and efficiently to the Lightning network, abstracting away much of the technical complexity. Lightspark’s role is crucial. They provide the backend technology that allows Revolut to send and receive Bitcoin payments over the Lightning Network seamlessly and securely. This partnership is a testament to the growing maturity of the Lightning ecosystem and its readiness for mainstream adoption by large financial platforms. How This Impacts Revolut Users in the UK and Europe The rollout in the UK and select European countries means millions of Revolut users will soon have access to significantly improved Bitcoin transaction capabilities. While the initial report from CoinDesk didn’t specify the exact use cases (e.g., sending Bitcoin to friends, paying merchants), the underlying technology enables: Faster transfers of Bitcoin between Lightning-enabled wallets. Potentially lower fees for sending Bitcoin compared to traditional on-chain transfers. A more responsive and user-friendly experience when dealing with Bitcoin within the app. This development is particularly significant for the Fintech sector. Revolut is one of the largest digital banks globally, and its adoption of the Lightning Network sends a strong signal about the potential of this technology.

According to an X post by Trader Tardigrade, such patterns often form around the time of a price bottom. #Dogecoin 's daily chart appears to be forming a ""Diamond Bottom"" Reversal Pattern, suggesting a potential shift for $Doge from a recent downtrend to an uptrend. pic.twitter.com/6aSlEfUSMg — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) May 6, 2025 Trader Tardigrade’s bullish thesis was echoed by fellow trader Galaxy, who argued in an X post that the Dogecoin price’s weekly chart has started to form higher highs and higher lows following its 2024 breakout from a 600 day accumulation period.

Dogecoin Price Prediction – Explosion Higher Coming? Macro conditions currently aren’t conducive to a renewed altcoins /meme season. As highlighted by the Fed at today’s FOMC policy announcement , US economic conditions remain highly uncertain. The Fed didn't use the word ""stagflation"", but that's what it's warning about. Never a good moment when your central bank says that it's worried about *both* higher unemployment and higher inflation. That's a problem that monetary policy alone can't solve. pic.twitter.com/myxRG1CDmk — Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) May 7, 2025 US President Trump’s trade war has added upside risks to inflation and downside risks to growth, creating a potential “stagflation” scenario for the US economy for the first time in over 50 years. In such an environment, risk assets, which Dogecoin is very much one of, aren’t expected to perform particularly well. Thanks to its growing narrative as “digital gold” and a safe haven, Bitcoin is looking perky, and nearing a retest of $100,000. That, plus the aforementioned favorable chart patterns, could suggest that a medium-term bottom is in for the Dogecoin price. If Bitcoin pushes back above $100,000 and towards a retest of its record highs around $108,000, the Dogecoin price can continue to recover. If it can break above $0.20 resistance, a move back to $0.28 would be on the cards. However, for a new meme season to emerge, a big positive catalyst is going to be needed. That could be something like upside risks to US inflation subsiding, opening the door for significant rate cuts from the Fed. Altcoins / meme coins have historically thrived in times of easing financial conditions, after all. Until then, the Dogecoin price is unlikely to see explosive moves to the upside. The current market environment should be viewed by crypto investors as a good time to steadily add to their DOGE bags. Better Alternative for Fast Gains – Solaxy (SOLX)?

The state’s Senate has taken a significant step forward with the passage of a key piece of legislation: the Arizona Bitcoin Bill , officially known as SB 1373. This development signals a growing interest among state-level policymakers in exploring the potential roles of digital assets like Bitcoin within state financial operations. But what exactly does this bill propose, and what does it mean for the future of Arizona Crypto initiatives? Understanding the Arizona Bitcoin Bill SB 1373 At its core, SB 1373 is designed to establish a digital asset reserve for the state of Arizona. This isn’t just a theoretical concept; the bill outlines the creation of a specific mechanism for holding and managing certain digital assets. According to reports, this reserve would be under the stewardship of the state treasurer’s office. Key components of the proposed reserve include: Legislature-Set Funds: The reserve could include funds specifically allocated by the Arizona legislature for the purpose of acquiring digital assets. This suggests a potential pathway for the state to invest directly in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Seized Cryptocurrencies: The bill also provides for the inclusion of cryptocurrencies that have been seized by law enforcement. This is a practical consideration, as authorities increasingly encounter digital assets in criminal investigations. The passage of SB 1373 through the Senate is a crucial legislative hurdle cleared, pushing Arizona closer to potentially becoming one of the first states with a formal mechanism for managing digital assets at this level. Why Consider a State Bitcoin Reserve? The concept of a State Bitcoin Reserve raises questions about the motivations behind such a move. Proponents often highlight several potential benefits: Store of Value: Bitcoin is often viewed as a potential hedge against inflation and a store of value, similar to gold. A reserve could offer a way for the state to diversify its treasury holdings. Attracting Innovation: By embracing digital assets, Arizona could position itself as a forward-thinking state, potentially attracting blockchain companies and talent. Future Preparedness: As digital assets become more integrated into the global economy, having a framework for managing them could be seen as preparing for the future. Managing Seized Assets: A formal reserve provides a clear process for handling cryptocurrencies seized in legal proceedings, ensuring they are managed responsibly. However, establishing a State Bitcoin Reserve is not without its challenges and risks, including price volatility, security concerns related to custody, and the evolving regulatory landscape. The Path to Governor Hobbs With the Senate’s approval, the Arizona Bitcoin Bill now moves to the desk of Governor Hobbs for her final decision. This is a critical stage in the legislative process, as the Governor holds veto power. The journey of SB 1373 is particularly noteworthy because it follows a previous attempt to pass similar legislation. Earlier this year, Governor Hobbs vetoed SB 1025, a bill that also aimed to establish a state digital asset reserve. The reasons cited for that veto included concerns about the bill’s potential financial risks and operational complexities. The fact that a similar bill has passed the Senate again suggests that proponents have either addressed previous concerns in the new version (SB 1373) or are making another strong push for the concept. All eyes are now on Governor Hobbs to see if she will sign this iteration into law or issue another veto. Arizona Crypto Landscape: A Look Back at SB 1025 Understanding the context of Arizona Crypto legislation requires looking back at SB 1025. While the specifics of why it was vetoed are relevant, the key takeaway is that the idea of a state digital asset reserve has faced executive resistance previously. This history adds an element of uncertainty to the fate of SB 1373 . It’s important for citizens and stakeholders interested in Arizona Crypto policy to consider: What were the precise differences between SB 1025 and SB 1373? (This information might not be in the original snippet but is crucial for a comprehensive understanding). Have the concerns raised during the SB 1025 debate been adequately addressed in the new bill? What is the current stance of Governor Hobbs and her administration on digital asset policy? The legislative process is often one of iteration, and the reintroduction and passage of a bill like SB 1373 demonstrate persistence from its supporters. What Happens Next? The future of the Arizona Bitcoin Bill rests solely with Governor Hobbs . Her decision will determine whether Arizona takes this potentially pioneering step into holding digital assets in its treasury. If signed, the bill would likely require significant planning and infrastructure development by the state treasurer’s office to safely and effectively manage the reserve. This development is being watched closely by other states and by the wider cryptocurrency community, as it could set a precedent for state-level adoption and management of digital assets. The journey from Senate passage to gubernatorial approval is the final, critical hurdle for SB 1373 . Conclusion: Awaiting the Governor’s Decision The passage of the Arizona Bitcoin Bill , SB 1373, by the state Senate marks a significant moment in the ongoing conversation about integrating digital assets into state finances. The bill proposes the creation of a State Bitcoin Reserve , comprising both allocated funds and seized cryptocurrencies. While the concept holds potential benefits like portfolio diversification and fostering innovation in the Arizona Crypto space, it also faces challenges. Having overcome the Senate, the bill now awaits the decision of Governor Hobbs . Her previous veto of a similar bill, SB 1025, adds a layer of anticipation and uncertainty to the outcome. The coming days or weeks will reveal whether Arizona will move forward with establishing this novel digital asset reserve.

44301582,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158239,1746664821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,USDT Mint: 1 Billion Tether Unleashed – What it Means for Bitcoin and the Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usdt-tether-crypto-impact/,"In a significant development that captured the attention of traders and analysts worldwide, the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert recently reported a massive issuance: 1,000,000,000 USDT was minted at the Tether Treasury. This substantial injection of liquidity into the ecosystem is not an everyday occurrence and often sparks intense discussion and speculation within the crypto market . What does such a large USDT mint signify, and what potential effects could it have on assets like Bitcoin and the broader landscape? Understanding the Basics: What is USDT and Tether Treasury? Before diving into the implications of this colossal mint, it’s crucial to understand the entities involved. USDT is the largest and most widely used stablecoin in the cryptocurrency space. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable price, typically pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar. Tether is the company behind USDT . They claim that each USDT token is backed by reserves, which historically have included a mix of cash, cash equivalents, loans, and other assets. The goal is for 1 USDT to always be worth approximately 1 US dollar. The Tether Treasury is essentially the wallet or address controlled by Tether where new USDT tokens are generated (minted) and from which they are distributed. Minting new tokens does not automatically mean they are put into circulation. Often, newly minted USDT sits in the Treasury wallet until it is needed for distribution to exchanges or other large entities based on actual demand. Why Mint 1 Billion USDT? Exploring the Potential Reasons A mint of this size is a powerful signal, but its meaning can be interpreted in several ways. Here are some of the most common reasons why Tether might mint such a large amount of USDT : Meeting Market Demand: The most straightforward reason is increased demand for USDT on cryptocurrency exchanges or in over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Large traders, institutions, or even retail investors looking to enter the market or seeking a stable store of value often buy USDT with fiat currency. When demand outstrips the available supply on exchanges, Tether mints new tokens to meet this demand. Inventory for Exchanges: Centralized exchanges require a sufficient supply of USDT to facilitate trading pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT). Tether might mint tokens to replenish the inventories of major exchanges, ensuring smooth trading operations and liquidity. Swaps and Chain Migrations: Sometimes, Tether mints tokens on one blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) to facilitate a swap or migration to another blockchain (e.g., Tron, Solana). While this is a mint, it doesn’t necessarily increase the total circulating supply if an equivalent amount is burned on another chain. However, large mints often precede or coincide with such rebalancing acts. Preparing for Institutional Inflow: A large mint could potentially signal anticipated large purchases by institutional players who prefer to acquire crypto assets using USDT or need USDT for other purposes within the crypto ecosystem. Internal Treasury Management: Less often discussed, but Tether might mint tokens for internal management purposes, though distribution is the key factor for market impact. It’s important to note that a mint itself doesn’t inject money into the system; it’s the distribution of that minted USDT from the Treasury that matters. The tokens sitting in the Treasury wallet are not yet in active circulation. The Potential Impact on Bitcoin and the Crypto Market Historically, large USDT mints have often been followed by positive price movements in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market . This correlation has led to theories (and sometimes accusations) that Tether mints are used to prop up prices. However, a more widely accepted interpretation among analysts is that large mints are a *reaction* to existing or anticipated demand. If there’s high demand for USDT , it often means people are bringing fiat currency into the crypto ecosystem specifically to buy cryptocurrencies. They buy USDT first because it’s easy to move between exchanges and stable. The act of buying USDT with fiat increases the demand for USDT , prompting Tether to mint more. This influx of fiat-backed USDT then provides the liquidity for traders to buy Bitcoin , Ethereum, and other altcoins, potentially driving prices up. Does More USDT Always Mean Higher Bitcoin Prices? Not necessarily. While the correlation has been observed, it’s not a direct cause-and-effect where Tether simply prints money to buy Bitcoin . The sequence is generally understood as: Increased external demand for crypto assets brings fiat into the ecosystem. Fiat is often converted into USDT for ease of trading. High demand for USDT leads to Tether minting more to meet that demand. The newly acquired USDT is then used by buyers to purchase Bitcoin and altcoins. So, the mint is often a symptom of bullish sentiment and incoming capital, rather than the sole cause of price increases. However, the presence of large amounts of readily available USDT does provide significant liquidity, making it easier for large buy orders to be filled without causing massive price swings, which can facilitate upward trends. Tether’s Role and Transparency in the Stablecoin Landscape Tether’s position as the dominant stablecoin issuer gives it significant influence, but also attracts scrutiny. The company has faced questions regarding the composition and sufficiency of its reserves for years. While they have increased their reporting frequency and undergone some audits/attestations, concerns about transparency and the potential risks associated with their reserve holdings (like commercial paper) persist. The minting of 1 billion USDT , while routine in terms of meeting demand, highlights the sheer scale of Tether’s operations and its importance to the liquidity of the global crypto market . The health and stability of Tether are therefore critical to the broader ecosystem. Market Sentiment and Reaction to Large USDT Mints When Whale Alert reports a large USDT mint from the Tether Treasury , the reaction in the crypto community is often mixed: Optimists: View it as a bullish signal, indicating strong demand for crypto assets and potential for upward price movement. They see it as fuel for the next rally. Skeptics: Express concerns about potential market manipulation or question the legitimacy of the reserves backing the newly minted tokens. They worry about the systemic risk Tether poses. Analysts: Typically look for subsequent movements of the minted USDT out of the Treasury wallet and onto exchanges to confirm if it’s entering active circulation and being used for trading. The reporting of the mint itself creates buzz and can influence short-term trading sentiment as market participants try to front-run the potential impact. Benefits and Challenges of Large Liquidity Injections Injecting 1 billion USDT into the potential supply has both positive and negative aspects for the crypto market : Benefits: Increased Liquidity: Provides ample USDT for traders on exchanges, reducing slippage on large orders and facilitating smoother trading. Facilitates Inflow: Makes it easier for new capital (fiat) to enter the market and be deployed into crypto assets like Bitcoin . Supports Growth: A healthy, liquid stablecoin market is essential infrastructure for the growth of the entire crypto ecosystem, including DeFi and other applications. Challenges: Transparency Concerns: Fuels ongoing questions about Tether’s reserves and whether the minted USDT is fully backed. Potential for Manipulation: While often debated, the possibility that large, opaque issuances could be used to influence market prices remains a concern for some. Centralization Risk: The dominance of a single entity like Tether in the stablecoin market represents a point of centralization risk for the decentralized crypto ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Market Participants For anyone involved in the crypto market , a large USDT mint from the Tether Treasury is a data point worth considering. Here’s what you might do: Monitor Distribution: Don’t just note the mint; watch if and when the 1 billion USDT moves out of the Treasury wallet to exchanges. This indicates it’s entering circulation and is more likely to impact trading. Observe Market Reaction: See how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react in the hours and days following the distribution. Does buying pressure increase? Consider the Broader Context: Is this mint happening during a bullish trend, a consolidation phase, or a downturn? The market environment heavily influences the impact. Stay Informed on Tether: Keep track of news and reports regarding Tether’s reserves and regulatory status, as these factors can affect confidence in USDT . Understand It’s Not Guaranteed Pump: Recognize that a mint provides *potential* liquidity and is often a *signal* of demand, but it doesn’t guarantee price increases. Other market factors are always at play. Concluding Thoughts: A Billion-Dollar Signal The minting of 1 billion USDT by the Tether Treasury is a significant event in the daily flow of the crypto market . It underscores the vital role USDT plays as the primary liquidity provider and gateway for capital entering the space. While it often correlates with periods of increased market activity and potential upward price movement for assets like Bitcoin , it’s essential to view it within the larger context of market demand, capital flows, and Tether’s operational dynamics. It’s a billion-dollar signal that the wheels of the crypto economy are turning, driven by demand that necessitates the issuance of more stablecoin fuel.

However, recent reports paint a concerning picture for one of the leading Layer 2 solutions: Arbitrum. The Arbitrum governance system is seeing a significant decline in voter turnout, coinciding with a substantial drop in the ARB price . What’s Happening with Arbitrum Governance? DL News recently highlighted a worrying trend: participation in Arbitrum’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting has reportedly tumbled. This comes at a time when the ARB token’s value has seen considerable depreciation. Low Voter Turnout: The core issue is the dwindling number of token holders casting votes on important proposals that shape the future of the Arbitrum network. Impact on Proposals: Low participation makes it harder for proposals to meet the required quorum or passage thresholds, potentially stalling development or necessary changes. Community Discussion: The community is actively discussing potential remedies, including a proposal to lower the governance proposal passage rate from the current 5% of eligible voting power to 4.5%. This situation isn’t unique to Arbitrum, as other projects relying on crypto governance are also exploring ways to boost engagement and improve voting incentives. How Has the ARB Price Reacted? The market performance of the ARB token has been challenging over the past year. According to reports, the ARB unit price has fallen significantly, around 71% in the last year. While correlation doesn’t always equal causation, it’s difficult to ignore the timing of the price decline alongside the drop in governance activity. A lack of active governance could be perceived by the market as a sign of apathy, potential centralization risks (if only a few large holders vote), or slow decision-making, which could negatively impact investor confidence and the ARB price . As of a recent check, ARB was trading at approximately $0.3031, showing a modest gain of 0.42% over the preceding 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. However, this minor short-term uptick doesn’t negate the larger trend of depreciation and the underlying concerns about governance health. Why is Active DeFi Voting Important? In the realm of DeFi and decentralized networks, DeFi voting through governance tokens is fundamental. It’s the mechanism by which token holders collectively make decisions about the protocol’s parameters, upgrades, treasury spending, and overall direction. Active participation ensures: Decentralization: Prevents control from being concentrated in the hands of a few. Community Alignment: Decisions reflect the broader interests of the token holders and users. Protocol Health & Evolution: Allows the network to adapt, improve, and remain competitive. Legitimacy: A well-governed protocol instills confidence in users and developers. When Arbitrum governance sees low participation, it raises questions about how effectively the DAO can steer the project, potentially hindering its long-term growth and stability. Addressing the Challenges: The Arbitrum DAO Responds The proposed reduction in the passage threshold from 5% to 4.5% is a direct response to the challenge of meeting quorum requirements with lower turnout. While seemingly a small change, it aims to make it easier for proposals to pass, preventing governance gridlock. However, this approach also has potential drawbacks. Lowering the threshold might allow proposals to pass with even less broad community consensus, potentially increasing the influence of smaller, more active factions or large individual holders. The discussion within the Arbitrum DAO is crucial. They need to weigh the need for efficient decision-making against the principle of broad decentralized participation. Beyond just lowering thresholds, other strategies being considered across the crypto space to boost DeFi voting include: Voter Incentives: Rewarding participants with small amounts of tokens, NFTs, or other benefits for casting votes. Delegation: Making it easier and more intuitive for token holders to delegate their voting power to trusted representatives who are more engaged. Simplified Interfaces: Improving the user experience for accessing governance forums and voting mechanisms. Education: Better communication about the importance of proposals and the voting process. Gamification: Introducing elements that make voting more engaging or competitive. Actionable Insights for ARB Holders If you hold ARB tokens, your participation matters. Even if you have a small amount, contributing to the voting process or delegating your vote helps strengthen Arbitrum governance . Stay informed about ongoing proposals in the Arbitrum DAO forums and consider casting your vote on issues that impact the network’s future and, potentially, the ARB price . Low participation is a challenge, but it’s one that the Arbitrum community is actively trying to address. The success of these efforts will be vital for the long-term health and decentralization of the network. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Arbitrum Arbitrum stands at a critical juncture. The confluence of a significant ARB price drop and declining Arbitrum governance participation presents a clear challenge. While the proposal to lower the passage threshold is a step towards addressing governance efficiency, the deeper issue of voter apathy requires more comprehensive solutions. The community’s ability to re-engage token holders in the DeFi voting process will be key to ensuring the network remains decentralized, adaptable, and resilient in the competitive Layer 2 landscape. The health of the Arbitrum DAO is intrinsically linked to the potential for future growth and stability.

Yet in 2025 Solana lingers at $150.46 grappling with network congestion and regulatory shadows dimming hopes for a repeat performance. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol, is surging through its presale, amassing $7.6 million and 9,500 holders. Currently in phase 4 at $0.025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) promises a 140% return at its $0.06 listing. Let’s unpack Solana’s past glory and Mutuum Finance’s rising potential, spotlighting why the latter may outshine in 2025. Solana’s 2021 Triumph Fades Solana’s 2021 ascent was a spectacle. Starting below $2, it climbed to $257, driven by its high-throughput blockchain and low fees. Developers flocked to its ecosystem, boosting DeFi integrations. However, 2025 paints a different picture. Trading at $150.46, Solana faces hurdles. Network congestion slows transactions, and regulatory pressures loom. Analysts note its failure to breach the $165 resistance, with some predicting a slide to $100. Solana’s reliance on external adoption falters as competing blockchains emerge. Its once-vibrant momentum now wanes, leaving investors cautious. Attention shifts to newer projects, like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), offering fresher prospects. This transition highlights the crypto market’s relentless evolution. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gains Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform revolutionizing lending in the crypto market. It offers peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending allowing users to deposit assets like ETH or DAI to earn passive income through interest-accruing mtTokens. These tokens remain liquid and transferable across DeFi ecosystems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in decentralized finance. Its presale, now in phase 4, has raised $7.6 million, with 443 million tokens sold and 9,500 holders onboard. Priced at $0.025, phase 4 is 57% filled, signaling brisk demand. The next phase will see a 20% price hike to $0.03, granting current investors a 20% gain. At listing, the token hits $0.06, securing a 140% return. Analysts project a post-launch surge to $3, promising a 11,900% ROI. The team is finalizing a Certik smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social media, bolstering trust. This momentum underscores Mutuum Finance’s allure as phase 4 nears its close. Innovative Lending Fuels Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its dual-lending model. Lenders deposit assets into liquidity pools, earning interest via mtTokens, which grow in value over time. Borrowers access funds by posting overcollateralized assets, ensuring stability. A buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers, creating steady buy pressure. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. This gamified incentive sparks competition, deepening engagement. As phase 4 tokens dwindle, the urgency to join intensifies, positioning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a high-yield opportunity in DeFi’s next wave. A New Dawn in DeFi Solana’s 2021 rally captivated the crypto market, but its 2025 struggles signal a shift. Network woes and regulatory clouds dim its luster, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a beacon. Its presale success, with $7.6 million raised and a 140% listing return, draws eager investors. The projected $3 post-launch price fuels excitement, offering a potential 11,900% ROI. As phase 4 races toward completion, the 20% price jump to $0.03 looms. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s audited smart contracts and innovative lending model promise stability and growth. Investors seeking the next big win should explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now, before phase 5 tightens the entry window.

44302174,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158243,1746666021,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Ethereum Security Status: Shocking Revelation from NY AG’s Push to SEC,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ny-ag-ethereum-security/,"A significant development has surfaced from the ongoing debate surrounding the regulatory classification of cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum (ETH). Newly revealed documents shed light on a direct push from the New York Attorney General’s (NY AG) office to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the Ethereum security status . This revelation, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Coinbase, highlights the complex and often conflicting views among regulators on how to categorize and oversee digital assets. The Core Revelation: NY AG Pushed for Ethereum Security Status At the heart of this story is the disclosure that, during New York’s 2023 case against the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin, the state’s top law enforcement office explicitly urged the SEC to formally declare Ethereum (ETH) a security. This is a crucial point because the SEC has historically avoided making a definitive public statement on whether ETH, in its current form, constitutes a security under U.S. law. While past comments from SEC officials, notably former Director William Hinman, suggested ETH was sufficiently decentralized not to be a security, the agency has never issued a formal, binding determination. The NY AG’s request, buried within documents recently made public by Coinbase, underscores the pressure state regulators can exert on federal bodies and reveals a potentially different perspective on ETH’s classification at the state level compared to the federal one. This internal communication brings into sharp focus the lack of regulatory clarity that has long plagued the crypto industry. Unpacking the KuCoin Case and the NY AG’s Stance The context for the NY AG’s push was the lawsuit filed against KuCoin in March 2023. The NY AG alleged that KuCoin was operating as an unregistered securities and commodities broker or dealer in New York, violating the state’s Martin Act. The case listed ETH, along with LUNA and other tokens, as examples of cryptocurrencies that the NY AG considered securities or commodities requiring registration. By urging the SEC to label ETH a security, the NY AG’s office was likely seeking alignment or validation from the primary federal securities regulator. This would have significantly strengthened their case against KuCoin by leveraging a federal determination. However, the documents indicate the SEC did not publicly adopt this position in response to the NY AG’s request related to the KuCoin proceedings. The SEC’s Response (or Lack Thereof) to the Push The documents released by Coinbase, which include internal SEC discussions, do not show the SEC issuing a public declaration that ETH is a security following the NY AG’s request. This non-action (at least publicly within the context of the KuCoin case) is consistent with the SEC’s broader approach to ETH’s classification – maintaining ambiguity despite numerous opportunities and calls for clarity. Why the SEC chose not to publicly label ETH a security in this instance, despite the NY AG’s urging, remains a subject of speculation. Possible reasons include: Ongoing internal debate within the SEC itself. A strategic decision to avoid a definitive statement that could have wide-ranging implications for the entire crypto market. Differing legal interpretations or priorities between the federal and state levels. The SEC’s continued silence on ETH’s status, especially after being directly prompted by a state regulator in a significant enforcement action, adds another layer of complexity to the SEC crypto regulation narrative. How Coinbase FOIA Documents Brought This to Light This revelation did not come from an official regulatory announcement but from documents obtained by Coinbase through a Freedom of Information Act request. Coinbase, currently engaged in its own high-stakes legal battle with the SEC, has been actively seeking information regarding the SEC’s internal deliberations and communications concerning cryptocurrency classifications. The FOIA process allows the public (including companies facing regulatory action) to request access to government records. Coinbase’s success in obtaining these specific documents highlights their strategic effort to uncover information that could potentially be relevant to their defense or shed light on the SEC’s regulatory process. The release of these Coinbase FOIA documents provides a rare glimpse into the inter-agency communications and internal thinking that shape crypto regulation in the U.S. Why the SEC Crypto Regulation Debate Matters for Everyone The debate over whether cryptocurrencies, particularly major ones like Ethereum, are securities is not merely a technical legal argument. It has profound implications for the entire digital asset ecosystem: For Projects and Developers: If a token is deemed a security, it faces stringent registration requirements under securities law, which can be costly and complex, potentially stifling innovation. For Exchanges and Platforms: Trading platforms dealing with securities must register as securities exchanges or broker-dealers, subjecting them to extensive regulations regarding market surveillance, customer protection, and more. For Investors: Classification impacts disclosure requirements, investor protections, and the venues where assets can be legally traded. For the Market: Regulatory uncertainty creates volatility and can deter institutional investment, hindering mainstream adoption. The disagreement or lack of clear alignment between the NY AG and the SEC on ETH’s status, as revealed by these documents, exemplifies the fragmented regulatory landscape that the industry currently navigates. Clear and consistent SEC crypto regulation is crucial for the healthy development of the market. Implications of a Potential Ethereum Security Designation While the SEC didn’t act on the NY AG’s specific request in the KuCoin case, the possibility of Ethereum eventually being labeled a security by the SEC remains a significant overhang for the market. Such a designation, particularly for a network as large and fundamental as Ethereum, would likely trigger substantial upheaval: Exchanges might delist ETH in the U.S. if they cannot comply with securities trading rules. DeFi protocols interacting with ETH could face intense scrutiny. The ETH staking landscape could be impacted, as staking services might be viewed as offering unregistered securities. It could set a precedent for classifying other proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. The NY AG’s past action, now public knowledge thanks to the FOIA documents, serves as a stark reminder that while the SEC has remained publicly cagey, other powerful regulators view ETH through the lens of securities law. The Broader Landscape: NY AG vs. SEC on Ethereum and Other Assets The tension revealed in the FOIA documents is part of a larger picture where state regulators, like the NY AG, have often taken aggressive enforcement action against crypto firms operating within their borders, sometimes stepping into areas where federal clarity is lacking. The NY AG’s office has been particularly active in pursuing cases against crypto companies for allegedly violating state securities and commodities laws. This contrasts with the SEC’s approach, which has primarily focused on classifying tokens offered through initial coin offerings (ICOs) as securities and pursuing enforcement against platforms allegedly trading unregistered securities. The difference in approach, or at least the difference in public statements and actions regarding assets like Ethereum, highlights the potential for a patchwork of state and federal regulations if a unified federal framework isn’t established. What the KuCoin Settlement Tells Us About State vs. Federal Action Ultimately, the KuCoin case concluded with a $22 million settlement with the NY AG’s office, including $5 million allocated for compliance monitorship. This settlement resolved the state’s allegations that KuCoin operated illegally in New York. While the settlement itself didn’t result in a federal declaration on ETH’s status, the fact that the NY AG included ETH in their allegations and sought federal backing underscores the legal theories being pursued at the state level. The KuCoin settlement demonstrates the power of state regulators to enforce their interpretations of existing laws against crypto entities, even in the absence of explicit federal crypto legislation or clear federal guidance on specific assets like ETH. It’s a reminder that crypto firms must navigate not just federal regulations but also those at the state level. Actionable Insights: Navigating Regulatory Uncertainty For investors, developers, and businesses in the crypto space, the key takeaway from this revelation is the continued presence of significant regulatory uncertainty, particularly regarding the classification of major assets like Ethereum. While the SEC hasn’t made a move, the fact that a powerful state regulator like the NY AG urged them to classify ETH as a security is noteworthy. What can you do? Stay Informed: Follow regulatory developments closely, both at the federal (SEC, CFTC, Congress) and state levels. Understand the Risks: Be aware that the regulatory status of many digital assets, including ETH, is not definitively settled in the U.S., which carries potential risks for market access and stability. Consider Compliance: For businesses, prioritizing legal and compliance frameworks is crucial, acknowledging the potential for assets to be viewed differently by various regulatory bodies. Conclusion The disclosure that the New York Attorney General’s office pushed the SEC to label Ethereum a security during the 2023 KuCoin case is a significant piece of the complex U.S. crypto regulatory puzzle. Revealed through Coinbase’s FOIA efforts, it highlights the differing views and pressures within the regulatory landscape and underscores the persistent lack of clarity surrounding the Ethereum security status at the federal level. While the SEC did not publicly adopt the NY AG’s position in that context, the revelation serves as a potent reminder that the debate over ETH’s classification is far from over and continues to be a point of contention among powerful regulatory bodies. This ongoing uncertainty in SEC crypto regulation , exemplified by this interaction and the resulting KuCoin settlement , remains a critical factor shaping the future of the digital asset market in the United States.

LINK Holds Near $15 While ETH Price Stuggles,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-successfully-clears-certik-audit-link-holds-near-15-while-eth-price-stuggles/,"Some cryptocurrencies are facing tough resistance. Chainlink (LINK) is showing some strength but is yet to break past $15.30. Ethereum (ETH) has dropped to $1,780, shaking confidence among traders. While these assets await signs of a rebound, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining ground steadily. The project recently cleared its CertiK audit, confirming strong smart contract security, and has already distributed over 19.7 billion BDAG coins. In contrast to LINK and ETH, BlockDAG is not relying on market rebounds, it’s producing consistent results. With a 2520% ROI already recorded and a $0.0019 entry valid through May 13, it stands out as the top crypto to buy now. Chainlink (LINK) Price Update: Can It Break Through $15.30? Recent Chainlink (LINK) price movement suggests a potential breakout, with the coin hovering at $15.02. The $15.30 resistance remains a key level. If LINK crosses this mark, it may aim for $17. Technicals support this outlook, with an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern and a bullish EMA crossover, both indicating growing buyer interest. Still, confirmation is needed with a strong move above $15.30; if not, LINK may stay in the $14.50 to $15.30 band. From an on-chain perspective, LINK exchange reserves declined 1.03%, a positive signal, though a 37.46% surge in netflows suggests some near-term selling pressure. For now, traders remain cautiously optimistic about the next Chainlink (LINK) price update. Ethereum (ETH) Price Drop Triggered by 2.59% Daily Fall On April 30, 2025, Ethereum (ETH) saw a 2.59% drop, pulling its price to $1,780.25 during a low-volume session, creating further uncertainty. This decrease also brought ETH’s market cap down 2.70% to $214.93 billion. Trading volume dipped by almost 10%, pointing to reduced activity. RSI levels have moved into neutral territory, and the total ETH supply held at 120.73 million, showing no immediate inflation concern. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC pair recovered slightly from a low of 0.0180 BTC and now sits above 0.0185 BTC. This range is considered crucial; holding it could open the path for Ethereum to test higher zones, although volatility remains high. BlockDAG Clears CertiK Audit, Securing Strong Smart Contract Protections BlockDAG has officially passed CertiK’s audit, marking a significant moment in its security roadmap. CertiK, a top name in blockchain audits, lends credibility to BDAG’s development goals. This audit wasn’t a simple review, it’s part of a broader three-layered security plan safeguarding both treasury and vesting contracts. Beyond code checks, the team implements internal protocols, operational controls, and maintains a standing partnership with CertiK for ongoing analysis and surveillance. Security forms the backbone of BlockDAG’s system. Regular audits and strict screening for listings prove the team’s long-term focus on building a trustworthy network. Such preparation before launch places BlockDAG in a class of its own. The metrics reinforce this position. Over 19.7 billion BDAG coins have been distributed so far, and $227.5 million has been raised. From Batch 1 to 28, returns have reached 2520%. With a projected launch value of $0.05, the current limited-time price of $0.0019 (valid till May 13) is gaining attention. Based on current growth and security credentials, BlockDAG remains a top crypto to buy right now . Final Say! Chainlink (LINK) shows signs of recovery but still struggles to surpass $15.30. Ethereum (ETH) is stabilizing after a sharp drop, yet no strong recovery trend is visible so far. During this period of uncertainty, BlockDAG continues to report solid achievements. Completion of its CertiK audit confirms its technical resilience. With more than 19.7 billion coins distributed and a 2520% return recorded across presale batches, momentum is strong. The current $0.0019 entry option is available until May 13, presenting a final chance before listings start. Among current projects, BlockDAG stands out based on real results rather than market noise.

For the first time in weeks, bulls appear firmly in control, reclaiming momentum and building a case for a sustained uptrend. After a prolonged period of uncertainty, BTC is now trading within a pivotal range that could shape its next major move. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates As Accumulation Trend Develops – New Bullish Phase Ahead? A drop below the $90,000 support zone would threaten the current structure and potentially confirm bearish momentum. On the other hand, a clean breakout and daily close above $100,000 would likely open the door to a powerful rally and renewed market confidence. This makes the coming sessions especially critical for traders and investors alike. Top analyst Big Cheds recently highlighted Bitcoin’s strong technical setup, pointing to the 4-hour chart where BTC is showing “beautiful strength” as it tests the upper bounds of its trading range. This could be the beginning of a breakout phase if bulls can maintain pressure and flip resistance into support. Bitcoin Triggers Investor Frustration As $100K Breakout Remains Elusive Bitcoin is testing investors’ patience once again as it continues to struggle below the key psychological level of $100,000. Despite strong price action in recent weeks, BTC has failed to reclaim this milestone, leaving the market divided over what comes next. While some analysts maintain that the bull run is far from over and expect Bitcoin to break its previous all-time high at $109K, others argue that this current rally is nothing more than a relief bounce within a broader bear market structure. Following months of heavy selling pressure and macro uncertainty, Bitcoin has shown renewed strength, reclaiming key support levels and climbing back above $97K. This move has reignited bullish hopes, especially as price action forms higher lows and approaches the top of a multi-week range. Cheds has weighed in with a more optimistic take, highlighting Bitcoin’s “beautiful 4H strength” as the price continues to press against range highs. Cheds noted that BTC is showing more resilience than he initially expected, a sign that bulls still have control, at least for now. However, the $100K level remains a major resistance zone. A confirmed breakout above it could validate a full-scale continuation of the bull market. Until then, the market remains at a standstill, caught between anticipation and doubt. Traders are watching closely for either a breakout above $100K to trigger new upside momentum, or a breakdown below $92K–$90K to confirm a deeper correction.

Whether this is a setup for new highs or the calm before renewed downside remains to be seen, the next move could define sentiment for the months ahead. Technical Details: BTC Testing Critical Supply Bitcoin is trading at $96,959 after bouncing strongly from support near $94,000 and reclaiming short-term momentum. The 4-hour chart shows a clear attempt by bulls to retest the $98,000 level, a key resistance zone just below the psychological $100K barrier. Price is trending well above both the 200-period simple moving average (SMA) at $88,387 and the 200-period exponential moving average (EMA) at $90,723, reinforcing the bullish structure that has been developing since mid-April. The recent move confirms higher lows and a sustained bullish trend, as BTC continues to build upward pressure against range highs. Volume has picked up slightly during the latest breakout attempt, suggesting fresh demand entering the market. However, the $98K–$100K area has historically triggered selling interest, so a decisive break and close above $100K will be essential to confirm a true breakout.

On the downside, holding above the $94K–$95K zone will be critical to preserving bullish momentum. For now, Bitcoin appears to be setting the stage for a breakout, but traders should watch closely as price compresses just under resistance. The next move will likely set the tone for the broader market.

For those following the digital landscape, including the dynamic crypto space often influenced by major tech shifts, a significant development has emerged: Microsoft is embracing a new open standard from Google aimed at improving how AI ‘agents’ interact. This move is set to enhance the capabilities of Microsoft AI agents , making them more collaborative and versatile. Microsoft Embraces Google A2A Protocol Microsoft recently announced its support for Google’s newly launched Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. This open standard is designed to allow AI agents, which are semi-autonomous programs powered by AI, to communicate and work together across different platforms, applications, and services. Think of it as creating a common language for AI assistants and tools. Google unveiled the Google A2A protocol in early April, proposing a framework where agents can securely exchange goals, invoke actions, and collaborate on tasks. This is a crucial step towards building more complex and capable AI systems that aren’t limited to a single environment. Microsoft’s commitment goes beyond just verbal support. The company is actively integrating the A2A specification into two of its key AI development platforms: Azure AI Foundry: A platform for building, training, and deploying AI models. Copilot Studio: A tool for creating custom copilots and AI agents. Furthermore, Microsoft has joined the A2A working group on GitHub, signaling its intention to contribute to the protocol’s development and related tooling. This collaborative approach underscores a broader industry push towards open standards for AI. Enhancing Microsoft AI Agents with Interoperability The integration of the A2A protocol into Microsoft’s platforms is a game-changer for developers and enterprises using Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio . Once A2A support is fully implemented, agents built on these platforms will gain the ability to seamlessly interact with external agents, regardless of whether those agents were created using different tools or are hosted outside Microsoft’s ecosystem. This means that a Microsoft AI agents could initiate a task that requires assistance from an agent running on Google Cloud or another third-party service. For example, a Microsoft-built agent handling calendar management could coordinate with a Google-built agent specializing in drafting emails to schedule a meeting and send out invitations automatically. This level of cross-platform functionality is what AI agent interoperability aims to achieve. Microsoft stated, “By supporting A2A and building on our open orchestration platform, we’re laying the foundation for the next generation of software — collaborative, observable, and adaptive by design.” They envision a future where “The best agents won’t live in one app or cloud; they’ll operate in the flow of work, spanning models, domains, and ecosystems.” Why AI Agent Interoperability Matters for Enterprise The move towards shared AI agent protocols is particularly significant for enterprise customers. Businesses are increasingly experimenting with AI agents to boost productivity, with a recent KPMG survey indicating that 65% of companies are exploring this technology. The ability for agents to work together across internal systems, partner tools, and production infrastructure is essential for building complex, automated workflows. Achieving true AI agent interoperability allows enterprises to build more robust and flexible solutions. It ensures that different specialized agents can be combined to handle sophisticated tasks while maintaining necessary governance and service-level agreements (SLAs). This alignment with broader industry efforts for shared protocols is crucial for fostering a healthy, competitive, and innovative AI ecosystem. The AI agent market itself is projected for substantial growth, with Markets and Markets forecasting the segment to grow from $7.84 billion in 2025 to $52.62 billion by 2030. Standards like A2A will play a vital role in enabling this growth by reducing friction and complexity in agent development and deployment. Seamless Collaboration with Copilot Studio Microsoft’s decision to integrate A2A into Copilot Studio follows its earlier support for Anthropic’s MCP standard, which focuses on connecting AI to data systems. This pattern shows Microsoft’s commitment to supporting multiple open standards that facilitate AI collaboration and connectivity. By supporting standards like A2A and MCP, Microsoft is positioning Copilot Studio as a versatile platform capable of interacting with a wide range of external AI models and systems, enhancing the capabilities of custom Microsoft AI agents built within the studio. Conclusion: A Step Towards a Connected AI Future Microsoft’s adoption of Google’s Agent2Agent protocol is a positive step towards a more interconnected and collaborative future for artificial intelligence. By integrating A2A into platforms like Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio, Microsoft is not only enhancing the capabilities of its own Microsoft AI agents but also contributing to the development of open standards that benefit the entire AI ecosystem. This focus on AI agent interoperability is crucial for unlocking the next wave of AI-powered applications and workflows, enabling agents to work together seamlessly across different platforms and services, ultimately driving innovation and productivity.

On the larger time frame, the price is holding above the important support level of $2, but momentum remains weak. The market appears to be in a holding phase, with limited direction in recent days. Experts are watching XRP’s price pattern and believe it’s still going through a correction. At first, it looked like a triangle shape, but now it seems to be forming a more typical pullback pattern called an ABC correction, which could take more time to finish. Important Support and Resistance Levels In the shorter time frame, there’s some speculation that a low may have formed on April 7, but there is not yet enough evidence to confirm this. The recent move up is unclear and could simply be part of a temporary correction within a larger downtrend. Support between $1.74 and $2.30 is being watched. As long as the price stays above $1.74, the potential for a bullish reversal remains. However, traders are looking for a strong move above $2.25 to confirm a new upward trend. This would signal the start of a C-wave rally, possibly leading to higher highs. Until then, the market remains uncertain. XRP briefly broke below a previous support level but has started to recover. While it’s possible that a bottom is in, there is still a chance the price could fall again before turning higher, with $2.30 seen as the next support if that happens. The long-term forecast still includes a possible rally, with targets between $5.00 and $6.60, but these will only come into focus once a clear bottom is confirmed and the market shows strong upward momentum.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-08 01:15:13

MACD 線（藍色） 你可以將其視為您的動量追蹤器。 當價格走勢開始反轉時，它會作出反應，顯示市場是處於能量增強還是放緩的狀態。 2. 訊號線（橘色） 這條線會緊跟著 MACD 線。 當藍線由下而上穿越橘線時，通常表示動能正在轉強（買入訊號）。 當藍線由上而下穿越橘線時，可能表示動能正在轉弱（賣出訊號）。 3. 柱狀圖（紅色或綠色柱體） 這些柱體顯示藍線與橘線之間的距離。 判讀方式： 柱體增長 = 動能增強 柱體縮小 = 動能減弱 綠柱 = 多頭能量（買方需求強勁） 紅柱 = 空頭壓力（賣方壓力大） 為什麼要使用 MACD？ MACD 是用來辨別進出場時機的指標，能提供以下資訊： 何時動能正在增強 何時動能可能反轉 何時應觀望等待 舉例說明： MACD 指標（圖表下方的指標面板） MACD 線 (藍色) : 326 訊號線 (橘色): -279 MACD 線向上穿越訊號線：黃金交叉 柱狀圖轉為綠色並持續增長：動能走強。 交叉發生在零線以下：趨勢走弱，可能是下跌信號。 移動平均線（主圖表） 20日 EMA（藍線）：約 84,067 50日 MA（綠線）：約 84,170 當前比特幣價格為 87,269，且高於兩條均線，顯示買方主導市場，走勢可能會持續上漲。 專業祕訣: 要提升訊號的確定性，可將 MACD 與 EMA 或 SMA 搭配使用。 在關鍵支撐/壓力區附近觀察 MACD 交叉，可提高準確度。 避免在震盪市場中只依賴 MACD 來做判斷 — 容易出現假訊號。 立即在Bitfinex進行實戰演練： 登入 Bitfinex 選擇任一交易對（如 BTC/USD） 在指標欄位新增「MACD」 留意以下訊號： 多頭訊號：MACD 線向上穿越訊號線 空頭訊號：MACD 線向下穿越訊號線 柱狀圖增長：市場趨勢正在增強 柱狀圖縮減：動能減弱，趨勢可能正在放緩 這些練習可以提升判斷準確性，讓你在交易決策時更有信心，減少困惑。 MACD 深受交易者青睞，因為它能在價格反轉之前，提前發出趨勢變化的預警信號。 MACD 與 SMA/EMA 的不同之處 觀看 MACD 實際操作 下一篇圖表解析系列文章 RSI —如何判斷市場是否處於超買或超賣狀態？ The post 圖表解析系列：MACD – 提前掌握進場時機的核心指標 appeared first on Bitfinex blog .",Uncategorized|chart decoder|taiwanese,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitfinex blog', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitfinexblog,2025-05-08 01:16:07
44302801,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158245,1746667200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Binance Reserve Ratio: 30 Months of Unwavering Transparency and User Fund Safety,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/binance-reserve-ratio-safety/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, trust and transparency are paramount. For users entrusting their digital assets to a centralized exchange, knowing that their funds are secure is non-negotiable. This is where the concept of a reserve ratio becomes crucial. Binance, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, recently hit a significant milestone that underscores its commitment to user fund safety and Binance transparency : maintaining a reserve ratio of over 100% for an impressive 30 consecutive months. Understanding the Binance Reserve Ratio: What Does 100%+ Mean? At its core, a reserve ratio for a financial institution, including a crypto exchange , is a measure of the assets it holds compared to the liabilities it owes its customers. A ratio of 1:1, or 100%, means that for every dollar (or crypto equivalent) a customer has deposited, the exchange holds at least one dollar (or crypto equivalent) in reserves. A ratio above 100% indicates that the exchange holds more assets than its customer liabilities. Think of it like a bank account. If you have $100 in your checking account, a traditional bank might only be required to hold a fraction of that in reserve, lending out the rest. In the crypto space, however, the expectation, especially after certain industry events, has shifted dramatically. Users want exchanges to hold all of their deposited assets, and then some. A 100%+ Binance reserve ratio provides a strong signal that the exchange is not using customer funds for risky activities and can meet withdrawal requests even during periods of high demand. The Significance of 30 Consecutive Months Maintaining a reserve ratio above 100% is one thing; doing it consistently for two and a half years (30 months) is quite another. This lengthy streak, as reported by Wu Blockchain via X, highlights several key aspects of Binance’s operations: Operational Stability: It suggests robust internal processes and risk management systems are in place to ensure that customer assets are always backed 1:1 or more. Commitment to Transparency: While the initial impetus for Proof of Reserves came from external pressures, maintaining this standard for so long indicates an institutional commitment rather than a temporary measure. Handling Market Volatility: The past 30 months have included significant market swings, bear markets, and regulatory challenges. Successfully navigating these periods while keeping reserves above 100% is a notable achievement. This consistent performance reinforces confidence among users regarding the security and availability of their funds on the platform. Proof of Reserves: The Engine Behind Binance Transparency How does an exchange prove it holds the reserves it claims? This is where the concept of proof of reserves comes into play. Binance, like several other major exchanges, utilizes a Merkle Tree proof of reserves system. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it generally works: Snapshot of User Balances: The exchange takes a snapshot of all user account balances at a specific point in time. Merkle Tree Construction: These balances are anonymized and hashed into a data structure called a Merkle Tree. Each user’s balance contributes to the final ‘Merkle Root’. Verification for Users: Individual users can then verify that their specific balance was included in the snapshot and correctly incorporated into the Merkle Root, without revealing other users’ balances. Verification of Exchange Holdings: Simultaneously, the exchange provides a list of wallet addresses holding the assets and works with third-party auditors to verify that the total assets held in these wallets match or exceed the total customer liabilities represented by the Merkle Root. This combination of cryptographic proof (Merkle Tree) and third-party verification aims to provide verifiable evidence of the exchange’s crypto exchange reserves . Shifting Holdings: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT The report also noted slight changes in the composition of Binance’s reserves compared to the previous month: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holdings decreased slightly, while USDT increased slightly. What could explain these shifts? User Activity: The most straightforward explanation is user deposits and withdrawals. If users are withdrawing BTC and ETH and depositing or holding more USDT, the reserve composition will naturally shift. Trading Patterns: Increased trading volume between BTC/ETH and stablecoins like USDT could also influence the balances held by the exchange to facilitate these trades. Market Movements: While the total reserve value might be measured against liabilities, the composition in specific assets can change based on price fluctuations and user reactions to them. These minor fluctuations in asset composition are normal for a large, active exchange and don’t necessarily indicate an issue, especially when the overall reserve ratio remains above 100%. Why is Binance Transparency and Proof of Reserves Important for User Fund Safety? For anyone using a centralized crypto exchange, the primary concern is the safety of their deposited assets. Unlike holding crypto in your own self-custody wallet, you are trusting the exchange to safeguard your funds. Here’s why initiatives like a strong Binance reserve ratio and proof of reserves are vital for user fund safety : Mitigating Insolvency Risk: By publicly demonstrating they hold more assets than liabilities, exchanges reduce concerns about potential insolvency or inability to return customer funds. Building Trust: In an industry that has faced trust deficits, verifiable transparency builds confidence among both retail and institutional users. Accountability: Regular proof of reserves reports hold exchanges accountable for managing customer assets responsibly. Differentiation: Exchanges that commit to and consistently demonstrate strong reserve ratios and transparency set themselves apart in a competitive market. While Proof of Reserves is not a complete picture (it doesn’t typically show liabilities like loans the exchange might have taken out), verifying the existence of customer assets is a critical step forward for industry standards and user protection. Challenges and Considerations for Crypto Exchange Reserves While the 30-month streak is positive news, it’s also important to consider the broader context of crypto exchange reserves and proof of reserves systems: Liability Side: As mentioned, most PoR systems focus on the asset side. A full picture requires visibility into liabilities as well. Auditor Independence and Rigor: The quality and independence of the third-party auditors are crucial. Are they conducting thorough audits, or just verifying the data provided by the exchange? Frequency: While monthly checks are good, real-time or more frequent verification would be even better, though technically challenging. Scope: Does the PoR cover all assets and all entities within a large exchange group? These are areas where the industry continues to evolve, aiming for even higher standards of verifiable transparency. Actionable Insight: What Does This Mean for You? For users of Binance, this report serves as a positive indicator of the platform’s financial health and commitment to keeping customer funds backed by reserves. For users of other exchanges, it highlights the importance of looking for platforms that offer regular, verifiable proof of reserves . When choosing or using a crypto exchange, consider: Do they publish Proof of Reserves reports? How frequently are these reports updated? Do they use a verifiable method like a Merkle Tree? Is a reputable third party involved in the verification process? While no system is foolproof, exchanges that proactively address user fund safety through initiatives like strong reserve ratios and proof of reserves are generally demonstrating a higher level of responsibility to their users. Conclusion: A Milestone for Trust in Crypto Binance’s achievement of maintaining a 100%+ reserve ratio for 30 consecutive months is a significant milestone in the ongoing effort to build trust and ensure user fund safety within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Reported by Wu Blockchain, this streak, despite minor fluctuations in specific asset holdings like BTC, ETH, and USDT, underscores the exchange’s operational resilience and commitment to Binance transparency through its proof of reserves system. While transparency efforts in the industry are always evolving, this consistent performance sets a positive example and provides users with a verifiable indicator of the platform’s financial backing of customer assets.

The whale activity now surrounding the token is something that appears to have caught the attention of not just investors but also market analysts. That’s because these large traders seem to be making a significant accumulation of the token over the past couple of months. And it’s not just these traders that appear to be bullish on the token; with 300,000 addresses now in possession of 10,000 or more XRP, it appears a lot of folks in the market are getting pretty confident about this token. The shift in the ecosystem appears to be toward larger $XRP holders who are quietly stockpiling the digital asset in anticipation of some kind of big event. This provides a window of opportunity to rethink the discussion around what the SEC Ripple case has really been about. Over 300,000 addresses now hold 10,000+ $XRP — a sharp jump that screams rising confidence from whales and large holders. Looks like strategic accumulation is back… Are the big players front-running a major move in the XRP ecosystem? pic.twitter.com/ec21oZQQKx — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) May 5, 2025 If you’re enjoying this deep dive into $XRP and its market movements, be sure to subscribe for more detailed analyses, as well as insights, on the fascinating world of digital assets and their ecosystems. Whale Accumulation Points to Growing Confidence In the sphere of cryptocurrency, the behavior of whales often gives us crucial insight into the trends we see in the market. Whales—people or entities that hold a ton of a given cryptocurrency—can sometimes so dramatically affect price levels that they give off signals about the direction the market is headed. And it’s not only the case that some of these whales have been buying up more XRP; the recent data reveals that it is now over 300,000 addresses that hold at least 10,000 XRP, up sharply from previous periods. A development that is really very interesting is happening with XRP. This is pointing to large holders being very confident in the future of this asset. In fact, the recent price action and the uptick in the confidence of large holders are showing signs that something may be happening in the near future with XRP. This may be happening because major players may be anticipating something substantial within the XRP ecosystem, whether it is a significant technological development, regulatory clarity, or other market-moving news. BREAKING Whales Accumulate $1.8 Billion in $XRP in 30 Days WE'RE SO BACK pic.twitter.com/xr3CORnWpT — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 6, 2025 Owning $XRP is also a bet on its future potential. And right now, the $XRP-dominated investments of big players seem to be saying something way beyond the obvious. Whales, by the way, are the Kraken of the crypto world. Historically, they’ve been good at front-running the market, following just behind the major players. If that’s how we should interpret this recent series of $XRP purchases, we might also have to interpret these purchases as being for some potentially big thing that the XRP investment situation is going to do. The Role of Bitcoin and the Broader Market XRP has consistently held a price above $2 when at the same time Bitcoin is trading just over $92,000. This shows that the market is still really strong, considering that Bitcoin’s dominance is kind of undeniable. However, the altcoin market, since this has happened, seems to be getting a lot more attention and capital inflow, so that might be a part of this whole scenario too. XRP holding its price when Bitcoin is just over $92,000 really shows that the overall market is strong. The reality that Bitcoin is still trading well beyond $92,000 gives our broader crypto market a sense of stability and positivity—pushing altcoin investor sentiment in the same direction. With Bitcoin’s dominance leading the market, it’s likely that some of the capital flowing into BTC is also spilling over into other promising assets with recent optimistic stories to tell—like XRP. XRP’s capacity to uphold its price intensity, regardless of how much or how little Bitcoin is worth at any given time, speaks to an asset class maturity around XRP. More than that, though, it may be telling us something about the ecosystem XRP is part of—a maturing ecosystem that appears to be appealing to much more than just retail investors. Is a Major Move Coming for XRP? There is a developing theory that XRP may be on the verge of seeing a considerable price change because of how whales have been acting lately. It appears that these large investors have been accumulating a lot of XRP. In addition to this, large-holder addresses (i.e., those holding over 1 million XRP) have been increasing more substantially than before. This certainly seems to suggest that something might be going on behind the scenes that is influencing these large entities to stock up on XRP. The tactical boost to reserves might also be a clue that these deep-sea divers are getting ready for prices to reassert themselves. Of all cryptocurrencies that are in play, XRP is one of the more entrenched and the one whose price moves are most commonly tied to two kinds of forces: global ones (like looming regulatory decisions) and local ones that have to do with the network itself (like how well that’s operating, or how many people are using it). Recent whale activity in the market has some observers thinking that XRP is about to do something big. These market professionals see XRP as an asset on the verge of a strong rally, whether that rally is powered by institutional adoption, a positive outcome in the cryptocurrency’s ongoing legal battles, or a more general uptrend in altcoins. Conclusion: A Key Indicator for the Future of XRP Whale activity around XRP is now concentrated with the largest players in the crypto market, who look to be quite confident in the asset’s future potential. Since October 1, 2022, over $1.8 billion worth of XRP has been accumulated by these large players, who appear to be positioning themselves for what could be some significant development around the XRP ecosystem. Now, over 300,000 addresses contain large amounts of XRP, and they seem to number among the asset’s ever-growing fan base. XRP is in an awesome place right now. It has taken on some serious adoption, and that is only set to expand greatly. The two major markets for cryptocurrency that are developing right now are China and India (who together account for over 36% of the world’s population). To this point, I reiterate that XRP is one of the key players in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Its adoption is happening rapidly, and in some major ways, and that is certainly no reason for anyone who holds XRP to lose sleep. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44302925,https://nulltx.com/?p=149101,1746667387,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Fractal Bitcoin Dominates as Top Blockchain for Transactions, Sui Network Leads in Volume",https://nulltx.com/fractal-bitcoin-dominates-as-top-blockchain-for-transactions-sui-network-leads-in-volume/,"The previous week held some pivotal developments for both transaction volume and transaction counts across numerous chains . From April 27 to May 3, 2025, transaction activity in Fractal Bitcoin exploded. And while we can’t quite say the same for chains like Polygon and Arbitrum (which experienced some declines), hey — at least we have Base, Sui, and BNB Chain holding it down for us. Oh, and speaking of holding it down, doesn’t that sound like something the number one chain (by transaction count and volume this week) right after BTC, Fractal Bitcoin, would do? Indeed. Top Chains by Transaction Count: Fractal Bitcoin Surges, Polygon and Arbitrum Decline Pacing itself in transaction count, Fractal Bitcoin saw a 106.4 million transaction blockbuster week, a record 89.12% week-over-week uptick that translated to over 200% growth in transaction processing. This not only put Fractal Bitcoin back on the top title as most transacted upon, but it signed off as a clear message that this platform is seeing the kind of user adoption that translates to actual growth in the transaction space. Following closely behind Fractal Bitcoin, Base completed a credible 51.2 million transactions this week, good for a solid 6.12% increase over the previous week’s total. While it didn’t match Fractal Bitcoin’s explosive growth, Base continued to show strong, steady progress, affirming its status as one of the top blockchains in transaction activity. The modest growth seen by the Sui Network can be interpreted as an even more stable sign for this blockchain than for newer projects apparently experiencing growth bursts. The network did accumulate almost a million extra transactions this past week, which seems to suggest a good enough growth signal if you’re an Sui enthusiast. On the other hand, a few projects that have been around for longer than Sui, like Tron and BNB Chain, also added a few extra million extra transactions this past week. Although these two are significant figures, the leaders are doing even better. Polygon and Arbitrum faced downturns in activity counts, but not as bad as Solana’s. My guess is that Solana’s recent news is fueling this narrative, which was already somewhat established. As I’ve previously stated, my interpretation is that if users are leaving Solana, they are largely going to Ethereum or Layer 2s like Arbitrum. I don’t see much evidence for them going to anywhere else. Transaction Volume in USD: Sui Network Continues to Lead, Ethereum Sees a Drop Sui Network took the crown when it came to transaction volume, amassing a staggering $38.8 billion in transaction volume, with a 1.80 percent increase from the previous week. The network’s clear dominance in that area, as well as its rising transaction volume, could be a signal that interest in its platform is sticking around, if not increasing, and that new developments or user adoption could be fueling a fire that’s keeping the platform in play. The second position saw a steep drop for Ethereum, which recorded $$18.6 billion in transaction volume, a 28.07% decline WoW. This downturn could be reflective of broader market dynamics or reduced activity on Ethereum as users migrate to newer or more specialized blockchains. Ethereum, despite this drop, remains one of the key players in the blockchain ecosystem, and such fluctuations may be temporary or periodic market cycles. The first position, the undisputed leader in the race, is occupied by the Bitcoin blockchain. Arbitrum experienced favorable movement in its transaction volume with $3 billion processed during the week, this being an increase of 6.23% from previous volumes. Arbitrum, a tournament-structure scaling solution for Ethereum, has always been a better solution for moving money around. Some speculate that it receiving more transactions than usual may be due to the imminent ETH staking unlock, which we expect could free around $16 billion of collateral for users. This is definitely something to keep an eye on. Other chains like the BNB Chain, Base, Tron, Polygon, and Optimism all suffered sharp declines in transaction volumes. The BNB chain saw its transaction volume tumble to $2 billion, a 53.61% WoW drop, while Base and Tron saw their volumes dive by 13.17% and 25.02%, respectively. Optimism had a 32.85% decrease in transaction volume, while Polygon’s volume took a 46.05% hit. Top 8 Chains by Total Txn & Txn Vol. (Apr 27-May 3) 1/2 @fractal_bitcoin surged to 106.4M transactions (+89.12% WoW), doubling its activity to take the top spot. @base follows with 51.2M (+6.12% WoW), while @SuiNetwork holds steady at 41.9M (+0.14% WoW). @trondao … pic.twitter.com/xwnebzCtQZ — OKX Explorer (@okxexplorer) May 6, 2025 Shifting Blockchain Trends: Fractal Bitcoin’s Dominance and Sui Network’s Stability Examining these trends makes it clear that blockchain activity is becoming richly diversified, with different platforms experiencing distinct growth arcs based on user preferences and network enhancements. Bitcoin’s astonishing surge in transaction counts seems to suggest that strong user demand for its services exists; if Fractal Bitcoin really has that strong user base, it’s likely due either to its unique value proposition or to recent, tantalizing updates to the network. Meanwhile, Sui Network, our next stop on the world tour of dWeb possibilities, is enjoying a moment of something close to transaction volume supremacy. If you want large-scale blockchain operations, it looks like Sui is the place to be. While other blockchain networks such as Polygon and Arbitrum have seen their transaction activity drop, it is essential to remember that blockchain ecosystems are dynamic and often recover quickly from downturns. In what is never a static marketplace, the current data indicate that blockchain projects must consistently invent and reinvent themselves, most often by means of network upgrades, if they are to have any hope of holding onto or significantly enlarging their user bases. So far, Fractal Bitcoin and Sui Network seem to be the top performers of the previous week, and it will be thrilling to see if the trend holds or if other chains will step up to take them on.

44302988,https://nulltx.com/?p=149100,1746667540,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Binance Maintains Dominance in CEX Market, Gate.io and Bitget Secure Top Positions",https://nulltx.com/binance-maintains-dominance-in-cex-market-gate-io-and-bitget-secure-top-positions/,"A recent analysis by CoinGecko has scrutinized the performance of centralized exchanges (CEXs) in order to identify the leaders in the spot trading market. The report, which is based on data from October 1, 2024 to April 30, 2025, provides a very clear picture of who is dominating in this sector, with Binance clearly holding down the first position and doing so by a rather wide margin. However, there’s apparently some very serious competition going on right below the top spot, with exchanges like Gate.io and Bitget solidifying their places as major contenders in the trading market. Binance Continues to Lead with a Stronghold on the Market By April 2025, Binance was still the biggest player in the world of centralized exchanges, with a commanding 38.0% market share of total monthly spot trading volume. Even as the broader cryptocurrency market has experienced its ups and downs, Binance has stayed strong and has actually solidified its dominance by offering consistently competitive fees, a huge number of trading pairs, and a well-rounded set of services that cater to both beginner and expert traders. Even though Binance’s market share has undergone some slight changes recently, it is becoming clear that the platform’s luster has not faded. Its enormous global presence, deep liquidity, and constant rollout of new trading features and tools have not only held but strengthened its leadership position within the crypto space. Beyond just spot trading, Binance has further secured its standing with futures trading, staking, and a host of other offerings, creating an ecosystem that draws a diverse assembly of crypto enthusiasts. Gate.io and Bitget: Rising Competitors While Binance remains the indisputable leader, Gate.io has persistently held the No. 2 spot, commanding in April 2025 a market share of 9.0%. Gate.io earned that place through a combination of low trading fees, a very broad assortment of listed cryptocurrencies, and its standing as one of the most user-friendly exchanges in the industry. Why is this of particular interest? Because even with Binance’s big lead, Gate.io has somehow managed to appeal to traders who like an exchange that’s a bit more straightforward with its trading experience — and yet still has some very advanced features. Gate.io’s ability to keep hold of its position in the pecking order of exchanges, even during periods of real market volatility, has to speak to some very solid user base and a real good reputation. Nipping at the heels of Binance and Bybit is Bitget, which in April 2025 secured 7.2% of the market share. The rapidly rising exchange’s place is reflective of a broader industry movement toward trading platforms specialized in serving certain customer segments. Unlike exchanges that cater to a wide swath of traders, Bitget focuses almost exclusively on serving advanced traders. It mainly offers derivatives and futures contracts and leverages those two offerings to provide high-margin trading opportunities. With an international expansion plan and a promise to add a great many trading products over the next year, it looks like Bitget is well-placed to give the other two exchanges some competition. A Look at Other Notable Exchanges The remainder of the top 10 list shows mostly familiar and a few up-and-coming names. MEXC and OKX are tied at 7.1% market share, putting them in fourth and fifth place, respectively. Both have profited from their extensive product lines (spot trading, futures, staking, and different flavors of derivatives), and it’s very possible these two platforms could place even higher next time, as they seem intent on continuing to innovate and improve their already centralizing services. Another major player in the industry, Coinbase, holds 6.9% of the share in this market, putting it in sixth place. While its focus had been mainly on the U.S. market, it has in recent years broadened its service offerings and now does a considerable amount of business internationally. Its reputation for regulatory compliance and ease of use makes it a go-to platform for new traders, though it continues to face significant competition from Binance and other global exchanges. Exchanges that make up the top 10, with market shares definitely nearing Quintuplets territory, are Bybit, Upbit, Crypto.com, and HTX Global. Bybit brings next-level derivatives trading to the party; Upbit, a full-on cryptocurrency exchange; Crypto.com, an expansive ecosystem that includes a wallet, credit card, crypto-rewards platform, and staking services; and HTX, well, we’ll get back to you on HTX, but it’s obviously pulling its weight because it’s part of this exclusive club. Top 10 CEX by Market Share in April 2025 1. @binance – 38.0% 2. @Gate_io – 9.0% 3. @bitgetglobal – 7.2% 4. @MEXC_Official – 7.1% 5. @okx – 7.1% 6. @coinbase – 6.9% 7. @Bybit_Official – 6.7% 8. @upbitglobal – 6.4% 9. @cryptocom – 6.2% 10. @HTX_Global – 5.4% — CoinGecko (@coingecko) May 6, 2025 Market Dynamics and the Path Forward The centralized exchange market keeps expanding with new entrants and existing platforms fighting for a piece of the action. Binance is the clear leader, but the spot trading market cap is still significantly untapped, and not even the top exchanges are very close to claiming a large majority. Exchanges like Gate.io and Bitget have grown impressively, and their success seems to hint that in 2023, the top site in the spot trading ranking is not even close to being the top dog in most other aspects. The top 10 exchanges are likely to keep shifting as they introduce new features, services, and strategic moves. They will need to continually adapt in order to maintain or grow their market share, and how they do it will vary: – Some will enhance the user experience. – Others will expand into new regions. – And still others will diversify by offering up new kinds of financial products. To sum up, although Binance is by far the dominant player in the centralized exchange market, there are still plenty of opportunities for innovation and growth among its would-be competitors, as evidenced by Bitget and Gate.io, two platforms that are racking up user growth and interest. As the crypto ecosystem continues to evolve, and as these promising competitors put forth their this-is-why-you-should-trade-with-us arguments, the centralized exchange space may well begin to look like something other than an all-Binance, all-the-time proposition.

44303105,https://nulltx.com/?p=149099,1746667684,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Whale Activity and Institutional Investment Surge: Bitcoin Movement and BlackRock’s Massive Purchases,https://nulltx.com/whale-activity-and-institutional-investment-surge-bitcoin-movement-and-blackrocks-massive-purchases/,"In recent hours, a large sum of Bitcoin has been moved after lying still for more than 10 years, provoking wild speculation and excitement across the crypto markets. Two whales, with wallets that hadn’t been touched for nearly 11 years, moved a combined sum of 3,422 BTC (around $325 million), provoking many in the markets to wonder what might have caused these whales to move such a large—really, huge—sum after so long. Was someone, or some entity, just testing out a movement of Bitcoin? Was it a sign of something more sinister at work? Or, to be completely honest, was it the first real whale sighting of 2023? Historic Whale Movements: Over $324 Million in Bitcoin Shifts After 10 Years In a turn of events that has grabbed the cryptocurrency world’s attention, two enormous Bitcoin addresses thought to be inactive have suddenly come back to life after more than a decade of dormancy. Whale “1NWPS” transferred 2,343 BTC worth about $222.2 million to a new wallet after being dormant for over 10 years. And Whale “1PiEK,” which hadn’t been heard from in a staggering 11.75 years, re-emerged to move 1,079 BTC worth approximately $102.5 million. $324.2M in #Bitcoin on the move after over 10 years of dormancy! In the past 3 hours, two Satoshi-era whales, who had been inactive since 2014, transferred 3,422 $BTC ($325M) to new wallets: Whale “1NWPS” woke up after 10.5 years, moving 2,343 $BTC (~$222.2M). Whale… pic.twitter.com/UKb78WJDXp — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) May 6, 2025 For market analysts who analyze movement of Bitcoin, the fact that these transactions involve Bitcoin from the early days of the network—often called “Satoshi-era” Bitcoin—is significant. Those coins are among the first mined in Bitcoin’s infancy, and so they’re highly prized within the community (for better or worse). Everyone knows that addresses associated with these coins should be watched closely, since movement of coins from these addresses is probably a good indicator of potential major market activity. The transfers have raised eyebrows because of the coins’ age and the market situation. Most analysts think that Bitcoins held for that long must be moved for some good reasons. They speculate about the kinds of things that make even the quietest of Bitcoin holders turn active. Factor in that Bitcoin is at a record price, and that these appear to be very large transfers, and you can see why some imaginations might run a little wild. This occurrence syncs well with past large movements of capital in and out of cryptocurrencies, where long-dormant Bitcoin wallets are reactivated during big upswings in the market. When the price of Bitcoin has just broken upwards past $90,000, it does make one wonder if these so-called Bitcoin whales might have been behind that market movement. Be it capitalizing on the current bull run or responding to the heightened volatility of the market and movements of price highs and lows, it remains to be seen what these Bitcoin whales do next. BlackRock’s Aggressive Bitcoin Acquisition: $4.44 Billion in Two Weeks In a different significant development, Bitcoin has seen institutional investments flooding in, with one of the biggest asset managers in the world, BlackRock, aggressively amassing Bitcoin. Over the last couple of weeks, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has taken on another 41,452 BTC—worth approximately $3.92 billion—that brings its total to 620,252 BTC, or roughly $58.51 billion. BlackRock bought another 5,613 $BTC ($529.5M) and now holds 620,252 $BTC ($58.51B). BlackRock has bought a total of 47,064 $BTC ($4.44B) since April 21. https://t.co/pRDoPUTxus pic.twitter.com/gtBs0TMVyg — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 6, 2025 The ongoing collection of Bitcoin by BlackRock emphasizes the swelling institutional focus on digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. Since April 21, the investment firm has amassed 47,064 BTC, converting to $4.44 billion, which it has made apparent is being used to express a bet on Bitcoin’s staying power and its long-term viability as a store of value. With the price of Bitcoin stubbornly remaining near the highs it reached in 2021, BlackRock’s ongoing purchases have not only been noticeable but have also served as a point of conversation for both retail investors and those investing through other institutions. These purchases’ timing is also very interesting. The latest buying spree by BlackRock follows a big rise in Bitcoin’s price and, at the same time, a much more common effort by institutional investors to include digital assets in their portfolios. With these big steps from a major player like BlackRock, it’s becoming ever clearer that Bitcoin is an asset class that might be safe enough to put into irrefutable, legally binding documents. On May 5, Bitcoin ETFs saw a significant net inflow of $425 million, marking three consecutive days of net inflows. This continued flow of capital into Bitcoin-related financial products points to the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the traditional financial system. As more institutional investors gain exposure to Bitcoin through ETFs and other investment vehicles, the potential for Bitcoin to further solidify its position as a “mainstream” asset grows. On May 5, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $425 million, marking three consecutive days of net inflows. All nine spot Ethereum ETFs recorded zero net inflows or outflows throughout the day, showing no movement. https://t.co/Hj2Gs48E6C — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 6, 2025 The Future of Bitcoin: Increased Institutional and Whale Activity A large supply of previously dormant Bitcoin is now on the move, driven by what appears to be an emerging market for the previously inactive crypto. The very fact that Bitcoin—always billed as a scarce and valuable asset—is finding so many previously unaccounted-for coins suddenly available for sale is having a pronounced chilling effect on the price. And it’s happening at the same time that we have some very deep-pocketed institutional players getting into the market for Bitcoin. While Bitcoin’s price remains constant and well above the level of $90,000, and institutional interest in the digital asset keeps ramping up, I can’t help but think that the future of Bitcoin is very bright indeed. Whale activity and institutional buying appear to be steering Bitcoin towards an even more heightened supply/demand dynamic, which I think will end up being a favorable one for Bitcoin’s price in the months ahead. Meanwhile, with even more mainstream financial institutions leaping into the embrace of Bitcoin, I don’t see the very understandable legitimacy problem that the digital currency used to have as existing anymore. To sum up, Bitcoin’s future is increasingly being shaped by such major developments as the whales movin’ and the porpoises buyin’. If those big fellows keep on keepin’ on buyin’ up, what happens next, then, in the next chapter of the Bitcoin story? The secret, I’ve been told, lies in the coming weeks and months.

Six hours ago, identified by the address 0x20D869bA482C6D7a5451Ca1976C655afed01bF67, this Ethereum whale made its first major transaction (since going dormant, that is), withdrawing a substantial amount of the token—1,700 ETH, to be precise, worth around $3.1 million—from a significant cryptocurrency exchange (that is Binance, we should say). Whale Resurfaces—1,700 $ETH Withdrawn from #Binance After 6-Month Silence After a quiet six months, a known Ethereum whale is back in action. Wallet 0x20D869bA482C6D7a5451Ca1976C655afed01bF67 just withdrew 1,700 ETH from Binance, totaling $3.1 million, roughly 6 hours ago. pic.twitter.com/6FLSikOIE8 — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) May 6, 2025 According to the Ethereum Whale Watch Twitter account, this withdrawal is a big deal. The cryptocurrency community is, once again, buzzing over the sudden movement of funds from a previously dormant whale. This latest development has experts speculating about the whale’s next move and what it could mean for the price of Ethereum. There’s even some chatter about the possibility of a stealth fork in Ethereum’s future. Whale’s Return to Action: 1,700 ETH Moved from Binance In the Ethereum ecosystem, the address that this recent withdrawal came from has long been respected as one of the largest and most powerful players it has. Any activity it conducts is usually pretty closely monitored by market analysts, as transactions from large holders—often termed “whales”—can send pretty strong signals about upcoming changes in market sentiment or price direction. Before this transaction, the wallet had not been used for half a year, which makes this transfer that much more dramatic. The 1,700 ETH that came out of Binance represents quite a large cut of the whale’s remaining balance, which is now around 5,000 ETH, or about $9 million at current prices. While it doesn’t seem like a liquidation, it’s still a noticeable shift for a major Ethereum market actor. Despite the substantial size of the recent withdrawal, the whale’s Ethereum holdings are currently sitting on a loss of $3.6 million that isn’t realized yet, given that the price of Ethereum is a lot lower than when the whale first acquired all that Ethereum. The whale’s long-term hold may be responsible for that loss, unless it has somehow managed to engage in long-term Ethereum mining under conditions that might be said to favor miners rather than holders. The whale’s recent price decision to take the plunge and move some Ethereum could suggest that the recent prices tended to favor whales rather than holders. A Broader Look at Ethereum ETFs and Market Activity This whale’s activity coincides with a notably still period concerning the Ethereum ETF market. On May 5, all nine spot Ethereum ETFs registered no net inflows or outflows—meaning the ETFs had zero buying or selling activity for that day. That suggests ETF investors are currently taking a break from making decisions about whether to buy or sell spot Ethereum. On May 5, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $425 million, marking three consecutive days of net inflows. All nine spot Ethereum ETFs recorded zero net inflows or outflows throughout the day, showing no movement. https://t.co/Hj2Gs48E6C — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 6, 2025 Ethereum ETF activity remains quiet. That makes it all the more notable when individual large-scale investors (often called “whales”) shift their own assets. In recent days, one such whale withdrew 1,700 ETH from Binance. What’s that about? Is this investor trying to push down the price of ETH ahead of a further drop by moving a large amount of ETH onto the market? Or is this move a sign of something ostensibly positive for Ethereum’s price in the not-too-distant future? The absence of any meaningful progress with Ethereum ETFs also implies that institutional enthusiasm for Ethereum is perhaps on hold for now. Even with the overall fascination with cryptocurrencies and digital assets pushing ahead, Ethereum-centric financial vehicles are not recording the sort of capital inflow that has been observed in other slices of the crypto market. The ETF deadlock could be down to a combination of things: a skeptical stock market, concerns about ETF performance, and a possible diversion of attention (and investment) from Ethereum to other blockchain platforms. The Bigger Picture: Whale Behavior and Market Impact The return of a significant-holding whale after a long dormancy is always something that gets market participants excited. 1,700 ETH is a lot to move in any direction, so what does this mean for the future of Ethereum? Is this whale reallocating, making a market call, or responding to the current conditions in crypto? Is this whale going to dump E… Price movements can be significantly impacted by whale activity, especially in a market as choppy as cryptocurrency. If the whale keeps dumping its ETH, it’s sure to push the price of ETH down. But if the whale is simply diversifying into other assets or is holding its position (for now), then the immediate effect on the price of Ethereum could be negligible. No matter what this whale had in mind, the fact remains that one of the largest holders of Ethereum has now moved a giant pile of the cryptocurrency. And it is those kinds of moves, along with selling or buying cryptocurrency, that can make a whale look like a market-mover. If a whale moves funds or does something that looks suspicious or impactful, traders and analysts will use the event to try to divine broader market sentiment. Conclusion: Monitoring the Whale and Ethereum’s Next Moves Transferring 1,700 ETH out of Binance is noteworthy in the world of Ethereum. This is especially true for the current state of the market, with a significant whale suddenly making a move after being dormant for a long spell. We still don’t know for certain why it acted now of all times, but the fact that it pulled out a huge amount of ETH may suggest it’s up to some serious business and possibly playing the long game, with all those unrealized losses racked up since the last peak and paying little heed to whatever prices happen to be for it right now. Ethereum ETFs have shown little movement, while the activities of the whales could signal a larger shift in the market. These developments make the next few weeks extremely important for both Ethereum and its investors. If the price movement of Ethereum is going to change, the next week certainly appears to be a crucial one. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44303155,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158246,1746667859,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin: Tim Draper Issues Crucial Warning to Businesses,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-draper-businesses-irresponsible/,"Imagine a world where not holding a specific asset is considered ‘irresponsible’ for a business. According to billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper , that asset is Bitcoin . Speaking at the Financial Times Digital Assets Summit, Draper didn’t mince words, suggesting that companies overlooking Bitcoin in their strategies are making a significant mistake. But why such a strong stance, and what does it mean for the future of commerce and investment? Who is Tim Draper and Why Listen? Tim Draper is a name synonymous with bold predictions and early investments in groundbreaking technologies. As a prominent venture capitalist, his track record includes early bets on companies like Hotmail, Skype, Tesla, and Coinbase. His long-standing bullish view on Bitcoin isn’t new, but his recent remarks carry weight given his influence in both the traditional investment world and the burgeoning crypto space. When Draper speaks, the market and business leaders tend to listen, especially when he frames inaction as ‘irresponsible’. Why is Bitcoin for Businesses Becoming Essential? Draper’s core argument for why businesses should hold Bitcoin centers on its accelerating adoption curve. He highlighted that both governments and corporations are increasingly recognizing and integrating Bitcoin into their operations and reserves. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about acknowledging a global shift towards digital assets. Consider these points that make Bitcoin for businesses a compelling topic: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unpredictable monetary policy, Bitcoin’s fixed supply offers a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power better than depreciating fiat currencies. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin transactions are borderless, enabling easier international payments and access to new markets without traditional banking hurdles or high fees. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets away from purely fiat holdings, potentially enhancing long-term value. Innovation & Brand Image: Embracing Bitcoin signals a forward-thinking approach, appealing to a tech-savvy customer base and talent pool. Growing Infrastructure: The ecosystem supporting Bitcoin (exchanges, payment processors, custody solutions) is maturing rapidly, making integration more feasible for businesses. While challenges remain, such as regulatory uncertainty and price volatility, Draper’s view is that the long-term benefits and the direction of global finance make ignoring Bitcoin a riskier proposition than engaging with it. Understanding Crypto Adoption Beyond Price Draper’s optimism isn’t solely based on price charts. He pointed to a significant shift in developer focus within the crypto world. For years, much innovation seemed centered on alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). However, recent advancements have brought sophisticated capabilities directly to the Bitcoin network. This evolution is critical to understanding growing crypto adoption : Smart Contracts: While historically associated with platforms like Ethereum, smart contract functionality is now expanding on Bitcoin layers, enabling more complex transactions and applications. DeFi on Bitcoin: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications are beginning to emerge on or connected to the Bitcoin network, leveraging its security and liquidity. Ordinals and Runes: These developments allow for the creation of unique digital assets and tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, driving new use cases and developer interest. This technical progress indicates that Bitcoin is not just a store of value but a platform for innovation, further solidifying its foundational role in the digital economy and accelerating broader crypto adoption . Draper’s Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction No discussion with Tim Draper about Bitcoin is complete without his famous price target. He reiterated his belief that Bitcoin will reach $250,000 by the end of 2025 . This prediction, while ambitious, is rooted in his long-term view of Bitcoin replacing or significantly supplementing traditional fiat currencies for everyday transactions and commerce. Factors potentially supporting such a bold Bitcoin price prediction include: Continued institutional and corporate adoption. Increasing global macro-economic uncertainty driving demand for scarce assets. Technological advancements making Bitcoin more usable for payments and applications. Potential regulatory clarity in major economies. Draper also revealed plans to launch a Bitcoin-only fund that will operate using smart contracts, demonstrating his commitment not just to predicting Bitcoin’s future but actively building infrastructure within its ecosystem. Regulatory Hurdles and the Future of Commerce While bullish, Draper did touch upon challenges. He specifically blamed regulatory overreach under the previous U.S. administration for potentially slowing down Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. Unclear or overly restrictive regulations can stifle innovation and adoption. Despite this, his long-term vision remains steadfast: a significant, perhaps even complete, shift from traditional fiat currencies towards Bitcoin-driven commerce . This isn’t just about buying coffee with crypto; it envisions a global economic system where Bitcoin serves as a primary medium of exchange and store of value, underpinned by its decentralized and secure nature. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors Tim Draper’s comments serve as a powerful call to action. For businesses, it’s time to seriously evaluate the potential role of Bitcoin in treasury management, international payments, and customer engagement. This requires due diligence, understanding the risks, and exploring the growing suite of corporate crypto services. For investors, Draper’s $250k Bitcoin price prediction is a reminder of the potential upside many see in this asset, but it should be considered alongside thorough personal research and risk assessment. The emergence of Bitcoin -only funds and increasing on-chain activity highlight the diverse ways to engage with the asset. Conclusion: Is Ignoring Bitcoin Truly Irresponsible? Tim Draper’s assertion that businesses without Bitcoin are ‘being irresponsible’ is a strong statement, but it reflects a growing sentiment among proponents of digital assets. His arguments are compelling, citing increasing global adoption, significant technological advancements enabling new uses for Bitcoin , and its potential as a future backbone of commerce. While regulatory hurdles and volatility remain real considerations, the trend towards integrating Bitcoin into the mainstream financial and business world appears undeniable. Whether his $250,000 prediction materializes by 2025 or not, Draper’s message is clear: the time for businesses to pay serious attention to Bitcoin is now.

Under this new law, Arizona will take profits from old, unclaimed assets — like forgotten bank accounts or uncollected checks — and convert them into Bitcoin. The idea is to protect the state’s money from inflation and build a stronger, more modern financial future, all without touching taxpayer dollars. Getting a lot of questions about the Arizona SBR law singing into law. To be clear: There are 4 bills for SBR in AZ. SB 1025 was vetoed. HB 2749 was signed into law! https://t.co/X7VydTkO9E — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 8, 2025 The law also allows Arizona to collect rewards like interest, airdrops, and staking profits from these digital assets. It ensures that the funds are stored safely through regulated U.S. custody services and diversifies the state’s investment strategy without relying solely on Bitcoin. This important bill was championed by Representative Jeff Weninger, who guided it from draft to signature. Crypto exchange Coinbase also supported the bill by providing expert advice and testimony, helping push it across the finish line. Governor Katie Hobbs’ decision to sign the bill has made Arizona a frontrunner in digital-asset innovation within the United States.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-08 01:31:14

It regained strength and now looks bullish on the daily timeframe. Last month, Litecoin went through a major recovery after declining to its lowest level in five months. That recovery brought the price back in the $90 range, but it failed to sustain momentum higher due to a rejection. This rejection triggered a drop, and the crypto started the new month on a weak note. After five days of pullback, it found solid ground and held the $81 level as support. Resurging from this support level yesterday, the price increased significantly and closed briefly above last month’s high. While that has brought more recovery in the market, it is now looking ready for a big move. The psychological $100 level remains a key hurdle for the bulls. If they scale through it, we can expect a bigger move until the price breaks higher. In the next leg down, it must break below before considering a bearish extension in the mid-term. Following the latest recovery in the crypto space, it saw the biggest gain among the top 50 altcoins, leading the daily altcoin rally at the time of writing. Although Stacks’s STX, Worldcloin’s WLD and Hyperliquid’s HYPE also posting double-digit gain, closely following suit. LTC’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview LTC currently eyes a close resistance level of $96.5. A successful surge above this level could bring a recovery to the $100 and $113 resistance. The $130 and $149 levels are higher resistance to watch for a breakup. The $80 level has managed to hold during last leg down. If the price dips below it, the support level to watch is $73.3, followed by last month’s $63 low.

44303828,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158263,1746669043,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Figma AI Launches Revolutionary Tools: AI Website Builder, App Prototyping & More",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/figma-ai-website-builder/,"In a significant move impacting the world of digital creation, design powerhouse Figma has unveiled a suite of powerful new Figma AI tools. This launch positions the company squarely against established players like Adobe and Canva, as well as emerging AI-first platforms for web and app development. Unlock Creation with Figma AI Design Tools Figma’s new offerings leverage artificial intelligence to streamline various design and development workflows. This expansion aims to empower designers, marketers, and even developers with faster, more intuitive ways to bring their digital ideas to life. The suite includes tools for building websites, creating app prototypes, generating marketing assets in bulk, and enhancing vector illustration capabilities. With these innovations, Figma is not just enhancing its existing platform; it’s venturing into new territories previously dominated by different types of software. This signals a broader ambition to become the central hub for the entire digital product lifecycle, from initial concept to published output. Introducing Figma Sites: Your AI Website Builder One of the headline features is Figma Sites , an integrated AI website builder . Traditionally, designers would use Figma to create high-fidelity mockups and prototypes of websites, which developers would then translate into code. Figma Sites changes this paradigm by allowing users to generate functional websites directly from their Figma designs, powered by AI. Key capabilities of Figma Sites include: AI-Powered Generation: Create initial site structures and designs rapidly based on input. Collaborative Editing: Teams can easily modify site elements in a visual editor without needing complex coding knowledge or prompting. Responsive Design: Ensure sites look great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Interactive Elements: Add transitions, animations, and scroll effects. Built-in CMS (Upcoming): Manage content like blog posts directly within the design environment, including editing text, managing assets, and setting slugs. Custom Code & AI Code Generation: Embed interactive components like stock tickers, either by writing code or using AI to generate it. This tool is particularly valuable for marketing and design teams who have a clear vision for a site and want direct control over its appearance and content, as highlighted by Figma’s Chief Product Officer, Yuki Yamashita. Exploring Ideas with AI App Prototyping: Figma Make Complementing Figma Sites is Figma Make , another AI-powered tool focused on ideation and AI app prototyping . While sharing underlying technology with Sites, Make is geared towards exploring concepts and building interactive prototypes for web applications. How Figma Make works: Prompt-Based Creation: Users can input prompts to generate initial web application prototypes. Collaborative Prototyping: The prototype is collaborative, allowing team members to prompt the AI assistant to modify or add elements. Developer Handoff: Developers can directly access and modify the underlying code of the prototype, facilitating a smoother transition from design to development. Embeddable Components: Generate small, interactive elements (like a clock) that can be embedded into pages published via Figma Sites. Figma Make is designed for higher-fidelity prototyping, allowing teams to add data and test the viability of an idea closer to its final implementation state. Beyond Sites and Make: Marketing & Drawing Tools Figma’s AI push extends beyond websites and app prototypes. The company also announced tools aimed at marketers and illustrators. Figma Buzz: A new tool specifically for marketers. It allows them to leverage designer-created templates with brand-specific elements to generate new creatives easily. Features include inserting AI-generated images, changing backgrounds, and creating assets in bulk using data sources like spreadsheets. This directly challenges tools used for high-volume creative production. Figma Draw: Enhancing vector editing and illustration capabilities within Figma. Previously, complex vector edits often required exporting designs. Figma Draw adds features like text on a path, pattern fill, brushes, multi-vector editing, adding noise and texture, and a lasso selection tool. This positions Figma Draw as a competitor to dedicated illustration software. These additions, along with the existing Figma Slides tool for presentations, create a more comprehensive creative suite within the Figma ecosystem, intensifying competition with companies like Adobe and Canva. How Does Figma AI Stack Up Against the Competition? Figma’s foray into AI-powered creation puts it in direct competition with a diverse set of platforms: Website Builders (Wix, WordPress, Squarespace, Hostinger): These platforms have also been integrating AI tools for site creation, but Figma approaches it from a design-first perspective, integrating directly with existing design workflows. Prototyping/Coding Tools (Replit, Lovable): These tools focus on enabling app creation without deep coding knowledge. Figma Make offers a similar promise but is tightly integrated with the design process. Creative Suites (Adobe, Canva): Figma Buzz and Draw compete with asset creation and illustration tools offered by these giants. Figma’s CPO emphasizes that Figma’s core business is building digital products, and a significant portion of their user base are developers, differentiating their approach from purely creative tools. This isn’t Figma’s first experiment with AI in design; they previously launched a ‘Make Design’ feature that was later pulled. This new launch appears to be a more refined and integrated approach. Pricing and Availability To support these new capabilities, Figma is introducing a new plan called a ‘content seat,’ starting at $8 per month. This plan provides access to Figma Buzz, Slides, FigJam (Figma’s online whiteboard), and the upcoming Sites CMS feature. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Digital Creation Figma’s release of comprehensive Figma AI tools, including the AI website builder Figma Sites and the AI app prototyping tool Figma Make, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of design and development workflows. By integrating AI directly into the creation process, Figma aims to empower users to move from idea to published product faster and more collaboratively than ever before. While facing stiff competition across various sectors, Figma’s focus on a unified platform for digital product creation, bridging the gap between design, marketing, and development, positions it as a formidable player in the future of digital innovation.

IOTA is making moves with its Rebase upgrade and a new custody partner. BNB is tightening into a triangle that could soon resolve upward. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is adding something different: transparency. With a new podcast series and limited-time entry pricing, it’s offering a rare inside look while opening doors before its exchange debut. If you’re asking which is the top crypto to buy in 2025, these updates could point you in the right direction. BNB Eyes $644 as Triangle Pattern Tightens BNB’s price sits around $595.56, forming a symmetrical triangle that suggests price compression ahead of a possible breakout. The pattern shows lower highs and higher lows, creating a tight price range. Traders watching BNB are focused on whether the coin can push past $599, which could lead to new targets at $617 and even $644. If price fails to hold support within this structure, a downward move could follow. Analysts say momentum still favors an upward breakout, but the pressure is building on both ends. This moment of consolidation may end soon with a strong shift in one direction, likely favoring the bulls. IOTA Rebase Upgrade and Zodia Deal Confirmed IOTA has officially moved forward with its Rebase upgrade, which is set to improve network speed and structure. This update includes support for 150 validators and a new staking model to promote decentralization. Alongside Rebase, IOTA has partnered with Zodia Custody to offer regulated asset storage, targeting larger players in the market. The combined launch is designed to attract more attention from institutions, giving IOTA a stronger foundation for future use cases. While these moves signal a technical leap, the price hasn’t reacted much yet. IOTA’s chart shows consolidation between key moving averages after its April rally. Traders expect price action to react once the mainnet Rebase rollout fully activates in the ecosystem. BlockDAG Podcast Unpacks Strategy as Presale Hits $227.5M BlockDAG is doing more than just selling out its presale. The team has launched a podcast series to walk users through its roadmap, presale logic, and upcoming exchange plans. This open format gives new users direct insights into why BlockDAG is gaining so much traction. The platform has already raised over $227.5 million, selling more than 19.7 billion coins. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, far above the limited-time offer of $0.0019 available until May 13. With a public launch price set at $0.05, users tapping into the $0.0019 entry could see gains of 2,520%. The campaign hasn’t just been about coin sales. Over $6.9 million worth of miners have been sold, with 17,310 miners already in circulation. This shows strong belief in the mining side of the project. The recent CertiK audit has also been completed, strengthening trust in the system. The podcast content shares real discussions, not vague promos, giving people access to behind-the-scenes decisions. With listings confirmed and price volatility yet to kick in, BlockDAG is showing clarity in a noisy market. This could be the final shot at entering one of the biggest presales in 2025 before full market exposure takes hold. Which Crypto Stands Out in 2025? BNB shows strong signs of a breakout with its tightening triangle setup around $593. If it clears resistance, it could test levels as high as $644. IOTA has taken a big step with Rebase, adding validator support and locking in a custody deal to attract institutional access. These moves point to network maturity but price remains subdued. Meanwhile, BlockDAG makes a more immediate case. With $227.5 million raised and a current limited-time $0.0019 entry price, the opportunity window is closing fast. The coin’s official launch at $0.05 could reward early buyers heavily. For those searching for the top crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG may be the standout.

At the same time, Shiba Inu’s daily burn rate has soared by over 3200%, even as it clings to key support levels. Both coins are showing movement, but one project is taking a different route: it’s offering real utility from the start. Web3 ai isn’t waiting for market pumps or meme cycles to make progress. Instead, it delivers 12 live AI tools through one streamlined platform, built around the WAI coin. Whether it’s sentiment analysis or trading automation, Web3 ai provides tools that traders usually pay monthly for, at a much lower entry point. At just 0.0003 in Batch 1, WAI gives users access to features that simplify crypto usage and give a competitive edge. It’s not just a crypto presale ; it’s a working platform gaining attention before the public even catches on. Toncoin Could Break Out Soon Based on Key Chart Signals Toncoin has spent weeks in a sideways trend, but technical charts suggest a shift might be coming. The coin is shaping into a classic triangle pattern that often signals a breakout. The resistance near 7.30 is being watched closely by analysts. A decisive move above this point with good volume could drive Toncoin toward the 8.50 level or beyond. Supporting indicators like RSI remain steady, while decreasing volatility hints at a potential price surge. With the market calming down, TON could gain more ground if sentiment improves. Toncoin’s setup presents an early opportunity with a clear breakout level. While it hasn’t caught major attention yet, this silent pattern may soon become a headline mover. Shiba Inu’s Token Burn Skyrockets by 3200% Despite Price Struggles SHIB is holding firm at a vital support area, but a further dip could lead to sharper declines. Behind the scenes, though, a remarkable spike in burn activity, up over 3200%, has grabbed trader interest. Many believe this rapid supply reduction might become the spark SHIB needs for a turnaround. While the price remains under pressure, the token burn rate is climbing fast. Earlier burn events didn’t always impact price, but this sudden jump could shift sentiment if it keeps up. Technicals still point bearish, yet the community’s efforts could help steady the trend. For those willing to watch closely, SHIB’s current range might offer a short-term rebound zone, especially if burn momentum continues. Web3 ai Delivers Full Crypto Tools Suite for Just 0.0003 Traders are moving away from expensive monthly platforms, and the reason is clear. Web3 ai recently rolled out its crypto-focused AI presale, giving access to 12 advanced tools under one roof. No more switching between apps for market insights, trading bots, or portfolio tracking. Through a single dashboard powered by WAI, users get real-time sentiment tools, auto-trading bots, risk management analysis, scam filters, and more. It’s like getting every premium feature in one spot without paying for five different services. Unlike others promising “upcoming” utilities, Web3 ai’s tools will be ready the moment it lists. Right now, the coin is still in Batch 1 at 0.0003. As batches progress, the price climbs to its final 0.005242 listing rate. This means early adopters benefit not only from pricing but also from early tool access. Why juggle multiple subscriptions when Web3 ai wraps it all into one powerful, easy-to-use system? It’s not just a better route, it’s the smarter one. Final Say! TON’s chart hints at a breakout. SHIB’s massive burn could flip market sentiment. But both are relying on future momentum. In contrast, Web3 ai is already offering something functional, attracting traders who want value now, not promises.

Wallet Activity Fuels Hope appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Pi Network community is currently excited after some interesting activity was spotted on Binance’s Stellar deposit wallet — the same wallet used for PI transactions. It seems like Binance has started testing transactions on the Pi Chain, and naturally, this has sparked fresh rumors about a possible listing. The wallet in question, with a long address, recently showed signs of test activity. This couldn’t have come at a better time, with a big Pi ecosystem announcement set to drop on May 14. The Pi Core Team has teased that a bunch of developer applications are under review, and some might even get listed soon. A Pi ecosystem announcement will be released on May 14.

Even after gaining 4% in the last 24 hours, it is still hovering around $0.60, showing very little movement. Market indicators like RSI and OBV show that buying interest is still weak, and unless something major happens — like a Binance listing or a sudden demand spike — analysts think Pi might continue to move sideways or even dip to $0.52 or lower. Since its open mainnet launch back in February 2025, Pi Network has built a strong community of over 60 million users. However, it’s also faced a fair share of challenges. The project has struggled with low liquidity, weak transaction activity, and the lack of smart contract features — which are crucial for building decentralized apps on any blockchain. At its peak, Pi Coin hit $2.90, but concerns over regulatory issues (thanks to its referral-based model) and criticism from crypto leaders — like the Bybit CEO calling it a scam — have kept the project under the spotlight for the wrong reasons. The Pi team, though, has consistently denied those accusations. Now, with May 14 approaching, the Pi Network community is awaiting a big news. Could a Binance listing finally be in the cards?

Here’s how other top coins like Bitcoin and Solana compare. XRP Top Buyers Are The Only Ones In The Green Right Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the situation of the top buyers has been looking for different top digital assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity In Bear Market Zone—Warning Or Opportunity? The indicator of interest here is the “Realized Price,” which keeps track of the cost basis or acquisition level of the average investor on a given cryptocurrency network.When the value of the metric is above the spot price of the asset, the holders as a whole can be assumed to be in a state of net unrealized loss. On the other hand, it being under the token’s price implies the dominance of profit on the network. In the context of the current discussion, the Realized Price of the entire userbase isn’t of relevance, but rather that of only a specific portion of it: the investors who got in during the earlier euphoria phase of December 2024 to January 2025. From today, this period lines up with the 3 months to 6 months old range, so Glassnode has referenced the average cost basis of these mid-term holders. First, here is a chart showing the Realized Price of this cohort for XRP: As is visible in the above graph, the Realized Price of the 3 months to 6 months old XRP investors is currently trading a notable distance under the cryptocurrency’s spot price. Naturally, at least some of the top buyers of the asset would have capitulated by this time, but it would appear that those that still continue to hold are sitting relatively comfortably at a profit margin of 11%. Related Reading: Bitcoin In The Middle Of A Decision Point, Analyst Says—Here’s Why While this may be so for the mid-term holders of XRP, the trend is different for those present on the other major networks. As the below chart shows, Solana’s 3 months to 6 months old hands currently have their cost basis above the spot price. More specifically, SOL’s mid-term investors are holding a net unrealized loss of around 28%. The situation is even worse when it comes to Ethereum, with the cohort sitting about 36% underwater on the blockchain. Even Bitcoin has this group carrying a loss, although the margin is just 1% in the case of the number one cryptocurrency. As for what this trend of the top buyers being underwater could mean, the analytics firm has noted, “price stabilizing below the 3m–6m holders’ cost basis is a clear sign of market weakness.” XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.13, down almost 4% in the last seven days.

The world’s leading economies are zeroing in on a critical threat within the digital asset space. The upcoming G7 Summit , scheduled for mid-June in Alberta, Canada, is set to place a significant spotlight on a pressing issue: North Korea’s crypto hacking activities. This isn’t just about digital assets; it’s about global security and the integrity of the international financial system. Why is the G7 Summit Focusing on Cryptocurrency Theft? The Group of Seven (G7) is an intergovernmental political and economic forum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These nations represent a significant portion of global wealth and influence. When the G7 convenes, their agenda reflects the most critical challenges facing the international community. The inclusion of cryptocurrency theft by rogue states like North Korea on this high-level agenda underscores the severity and scale of the problem. North Korea has increasingly relied on sophisticated cyberattacks, particularly targeting cryptocurrency platforms and exchanges, as a primary means of generating revenue. This revenue is crucial for funding its prohibited weapons programs, including nuclear and ballistic missile development, bypassing international sanctions. The sheer volume of stolen funds has made Pyongyang a major player in the world of state-sponsored cybercrime. Bloomberg recently reported that this topic is expected to be a major point of discussion. The G7 leaders recognize that tackling this issue requires a united front. Isolated efforts by individual nations are simply not enough to counter a threat that operates across borders in the inherently global nature of the internet and cryptocurrency networks. The Scale of North Korea’s Crypto Hacking Operations Estimates from various cybersecurity firms and international bodies like the United Nations paint a concerning picture of the scale of North Korea Crypto Hacking . Reports suggest that the regime has stolen billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency over the past few years. These funds are laundered and used to finance illicit activities, posing a direct threat to international peace and security. Known North Korean hacking groups, such as the infamous Lazarus Group, are notorious for their elaborate schemes. These attacks often involve phishing campaigns, exploiting vulnerabilities in exchange security, or developing sophisticated malware to compromise wallets and platforms. The methods are constantly evolving, making detection and prevention a continuous challenge. The funds acquired through cryptocurrency theft provide a vital lifeline for the North Korean regime, allowing it to circumvent traditional financial sanctions that aim to cut off its access to foreign currency. This makes the G7’s focus on this issue not just about financial crime, but about national security and non-proliferation. Tackling Illicit Financing Through International Cooperation A key outcome expected from the G7 Summit discussion is a commitment to strengthen international cooperation . Why is cooperation so vital in combating illicit financing via crypto? Here are a few reasons: Cross-Border Nature: Cryptocurrency transactions and the platforms handling them operate globally. A hacker in one country can steal from a platform in another, and the funds can be moved through exchanges located worldwide. Information Sharing: Effective tracking and recovery of stolen assets require rapid and seamless information sharing between law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, and cybersecurity experts across different nations. Regulatory Alignment: Harmonizing regulations related to cryptocurrency, particularly Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards, makes it harder for criminals to exploit loopholes in different jurisdictions. Technical Expertise: Sharing technical knowledge about hacking techniques, blockchain analysis tools, and attribution methods enhances the collective ability to identify perpetrators and trace funds. Sanctions Enforcement: Coordinated international sanctions targeting individuals, entities, and wallets associated with North Korean hacking groups are far more effective than unilateral actions. The G7 leaders are expected to discuss concrete steps to enhance this cooperation. This could involve establishing new frameworks for data exchange, conducting joint investigations, and working more closely with the private sector, including cryptocurrency exchanges, blockchain analytics firms, and cybersecurity companies. Challenges in Combating Crypto Theft and Illicit Financing While the commitment from the G7 is a positive step, significant challenges remain in effectively combating illicit financing conducted through cryptocurrencies. Some of these challenges include: Challenge Description Anonymity/Pseudonymity While not fully anonymous, the pseudonymous nature of many cryptocurrencies makes tracing ownership difficult without cooperation from service providers or sophisticated blockchain analysis. Jurisdictional Issues Prosecuting cybercriminals operating from hostile states like North Korea is extremely difficult due to lack of extradition treaties and state sovereignty issues. Technical Sophistication Hackers constantly develop new techniques, exploit zero-day vulnerabilities, and use mixers or tumblers to obfuscate transaction trails. Varying Global Regulations Inconsistent or absent cryptocurrency regulations in some countries create havens for illicit activity. Resource Allocation Tracking complex crypto crime requires significant resources, expertise, and specialized tools, which may not be uniformly available across all nations. Addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach that combines technological solutions, legal frameworks, and robust international cooperation . The G7 discussion is expected to explore how member states can pool resources and expertise to overcome these hurdles. What Actions Might the G7 Consider? Based on the goal of strengthening international cooperation to block illicit financing , the G7 might consider several actions: Enhanced Intelligence Sharing: Formal agreements for faster and more comprehensive sharing of threat intelligence related to North Korean cyber activities and cryptocurrency movements. Coordinated Sanctions: Implementing synchronized sanctions against individuals, entities, and cryptocurrency addresses identified as being involved in North Korean hacking and money laundering. Capacity Building: Assisting countries with less developed capabilities in enhancing their cybersecurity defenses and blockchain analysis skills to better identify and disrupt illicit flows. Engagement with the Crypto Industry: Working with exchanges, wallet providers, and blockchain analytics companies to improve security measures, implement stricter KYC/AML controls, and facilitate the tracing and seizure of illicit funds. Public-Private Partnerships: Fostering collaboration between government agencies and private cybersecurity firms to share threat information and develop countermeasures against sophisticated attacks targeting cryptocurrency theft . Research and Development: Investing in research for advanced blockchain analysis techniques and tools that can help de-anonymize transactions and track funds more effectively. These potential actions highlight the comprehensive strategy needed to counter the complex threat posed by North Korea’s crypto hacking operations. The focus is not just on punishment after the fact, but on building resilience and disrupting the illicit financial flows at various stages. The Impact on the Broader Crypto Ecosystem While the G7’s focus is specifically on state-sponsored malicious activity, discussions around illicit financing naturally bring increased scrutiny to the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This attention from major global powers like the G7 signals a continued trend towards greater regulation and oversight of the crypto space. Responsible actors within the crypto industry, including compliant exchanges and financial institutions dealing with digital assets, are already implementing robust KYC and AML procedures. The G7’s push for strengthened international cooperation could lead to more standardized global regulations, which, while potentially increasing compliance burdens, could also enhance the legitimacy and security of the ecosystem in the long run. By effectively tackling cryptocurrency theft and its use in illicit financing , the G7 can help differentiate legitimate crypto activities from criminal ones, potentially fostering greater trust and adoption. Conclusion: A United Front Against Digital Crime The inclusion of North Korea’s crypto hacking and illicit financing on the agenda for the upcoming G7 Summit is a clear indication of the global significance of this issue. It underscores how digital assets, while offering innovation, can also be exploited by malicious actors to circumvent traditional financial controls and fund dangerous activities. The expected outcome of strengthening international cooperation is a vital step in building a more secure and resilient global financial system in the digital age. Combating cryptocurrency theft on this scale requires a concerted, coordinated effort from the world’s leading nations. The G7’s focus provides hope that concrete strategies and enhanced collaboration will emerge to counter this significant threat, ultimately protecting both national security and the integrity of the global crypto market.

With the next bull cycle on the horizon, timing and project selection matter more than ever. Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) continue to impress with steady development, deep ecosystems, and institutional attention. They’ve proven their staying power, but their size may limit the scale of returns from new entries. On the other hand, Unstaked (UNSD) is just getting started. As an AI-powered crypto project with real utility and a presale price under $0.007, it offers something different: a shot at asymmetric upside through early access and functional tech. Cardano (ADA): Steady Fundamentals, Limited Short-Term Upside Cardano continues to deliver on its research-driven development model, with recent upgrades like decentralized BTC staking and renewed ETF speculation helping sustain long-term bullish sentiment. Analysts point to targets between $2.91 and $5 in the coming years, reinforcing ADA’s role as a solid, technically advanced Layer-1. That said, caution flags are emerging. Whale activity and a falling Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) signal weakening internal conviction. With a large existing market cap, ADA’s ability to multiply sharply is limited. It remains a stable long-term play, but likely won’t match the upside potential of earlier-stage projects like Unstaked. Solana (SOL): Market Momentum Meets Competitive Pressure Solana’s growth story continues, fueled by meme coin activity and rapid stablecoin adoption. Price action has broken through $150, and with institutional names like ARK Invest showing interest, SOL could test $200 soon. Its transaction speed and active developer base remain key competitive edges. However, the Layer-1 field is crowded. With Ethereum, Sui, and Aptos pushing innovation, Solana faces constant pressure to stay ahead. While its performance is strong, the path to outsized gains over five years may be flatter compared to smaller, utility-focused tokens like Unstaked, which offer more room for exponential growth. Unstaked (UNSD): Redefining AI Utility in Web3 from Day One Unstaked (UNSD) is doing more than riding the AI trend, it’s building the infrastructure for a fully decentralized AI agent economy. Unlike many AI-labeled projects, Unstaked’s core offering is tangible: autonomous agents that manage and grow communities on Telegram and X, all tracked on-chain. With its presale live at $0.00689 and a launch target of $0.1819, the setup presents early adopters with a projected 2,600% upside, based on utility that’s already functioning, not hypothetical. At the heart of Unstaked is its “Proof of Intelligence” protocol, which rewards only the most effective AI agents based on real engagement. This creates a performance-driven AI ecosystem where each agent competes to deliver actual value. As these agents scale across platforms, Unstaked becomes more than a tool, it becomes a self-sustaining layer of Web3 automation. The fundamentals behind this project are unusually strong for a presale-stage crypto. There’s no VC manipulation, a $20 million liquidity pool is already secured for launch, and agent deployment is scheduled for immediate post-launch rollout. This isn’t vaporware, it’s functioning infrastructure. Compared to legacy Layer-1s like Cardano and Solana, Unstaked stands out with a first-mover advantage in AI utility. For those scanning the market for asymmetric upside, UNSD represents a rare entry point into a working, scalable AI economy. One Crypto Stands Out Cardano and Solana have proven their strength through robust ecosystems and market share, but their size also means future gains may be incremental rather than exponential. They remain solid, lower-risk plays, but not necessarily high-upside ones for new capital. Unstaked, in contrast, is just getting started. With a functional AI agent network, a unique Proof of Intelligence system, and pricing under a cent, it offers something rare: a real product, real utility, and ground-floor entry. For those eyeing the next wave of breakout projects, a $1000 position in Unstaked ($UNSD) today could deliver the kind of upside most Layer-1s can no longer offer.

44304416,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158268,1746670242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Apple AI Search: Unlocking a New Era for Safari Browsing,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/apple-ai-search-safari/,"The world of technology is constantly evolving, and few companies move the needle quite like Apple. For anyone tracking major shifts in the digital landscape, especially those relevant to innovation and market dynamics like in the cryptocurrency space, Apple’s next potential move is big news. Recent reports indicate that Apple is seriously considering integrating advanced AI search engines directly into its Safari browser. This isn’t just a minor update; it could fundamentally change how millions of users find information online and signal a significant strategic pivot for the tech giant. What Did Eddy Cue’s Testimony Reveal? The catalyst for this revelation came from a surprising source: the courtroom. During his testimony in the U.S. Justice Department’s ongoing antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Eddy Cue , Apple’s Senior Vice President of Services, made a notable disclosure. His appearance was primarily related to the massive, estimated $20 billion-a-year agreement that currently makes Google the default search engine across all Apple Safari devices. This deal is a cornerstone of Apple’s services revenue and a major factor in Google’s search dominance. However, Cue’s testimony went beyond just defending the Google partnership. He revealed that for the first time, searches conducted directly through Safari saw a decline last month. Cue attributed this change directly to the increasing public adoption and use of AI technologies, particularly AI-powered tools that can answer questions directly rather than just providing links. Why Is Apple Looking at AI Search Engines Now? Eddy Cue was quite clear about Apple’s motivation. He stated his belief that providers of AI-powered search will eventually replace traditional search engines like Google. This isn’t just a theoretical idea for Apple; it’s a future they believe is coming, and they want to be prepared. As a result, Apple is now “actively looking” at incorporating these advanced services into Safari. This strategic exploration suggests Apple recognizes the shifting landscape of information retrieval. Users are increasingly seeking summarized answers, conversational interfaces, and AI-driven insights, moving beyond the traditional list of ten blue links. By exploring integration with leading AI search engines , Apple aims to keep Safari relevant and valuable in this evolving environment. Which AI Search Engines Are on Apple’s Radar? According to the Bloomberg report based on Cue’s testimony, Apple is looking at several prominent players in the AI space. The companies mentioned are: OpenAI: Known for ChatGPT, OpenAI is a leader in large language models and conversational AI. Integrating their tech could bring powerful chat-like search capabilities to Safari. Perplexity: This company focuses specifically on building an AI-native search engine that provides direct answers and sources. Cue explicitly mentioned that Apple has already had discussions with Perplexity. This indicates concrete steps are being taken beyond just internal consideration. Anthropic: Creators of the Claude family of models, Anthropic is another major player focused on developing helpful and harmless AI. Their models are known for strong performance in understanding and generating text. Exploring these diverse providers suggests Apple is evaluating different approaches to AI search integration, looking for the best fit for the Safari user experience. What Benefits Could Safari AI Bring to Users? Integrating powerful Safari AI capabilities could unlock a host of new features and benefits for Apple users: Direct Answers: Instead of just showing links, the browser could provide concise, AI-generated answers to complex questions. Information Summarization: AI could quickly summarize long articles or web pages, saving users time. Conversational Search: Users could ask follow-up questions or refine their queries in a natural, conversational manner. Enhanced Research: AI could help users brainstorm ideas, find related information, or even generate outlines based on search topics. Seamless Integration: If implemented well, AI search features could feel like a natural extension of the Safari browsing experience. These potential features represent a significant leap beyond traditional keyword-based search. What Are the Challenges and Considerations for Apple? While the prospect of Apple AI Search is exciting, Eddy Cue also tempered expectations during his testimony. He noted that while Apple is actively looking at these services, they “probably won’t be the default” search option anytime soon. The primary reason he cited is that he believes these services “still need to improve.” Several challenges likely contribute to this cautious approach: Accuracy and Reliability: AI models can sometimes hallucinate or provide incorrect information. Ensuring a high level of accuracy for a core browsing function is critical for Apple’s reputation. Integration Complexity: Seamlessly integrating external AI services into the browser UI and backend infrastructure is technically challenging. Data Privacy and Security: Handling user queries and data with third-party AI services raises significant privacy considerations that Apple, known for its privacy focus, must address carefully. Cost: Running large language models for search is computationally expensive. Integrating these at scale for millions of users would involve substantial costs. Disruption to the Google Deal: Any significant shift towards alternative default search options could impact the lucrative agreement with Google, requiring delicate negotiation or a strategic phase-out. User Adoption: While AI is gaining traction, not all users may immediately embrace a radically different search experience. These factors explain why Apple is exploring but likely taking a measured approach before making any AI service the default in Apple Safari . The Broader Impact: How This Affects the Tech Landscape Apple’s exploration of AI Search Engines sends a strong signal to the entire tech industry. It validates the growing importance of AI-native search and puts further pressure on traditional search providers like Google to innovate rapidly. Google is, of course, heavily invested in its own AI search initiatives (like Search Generative Experience – SGE), but Apple potentially opening its platform to competitors like Perplexity and OpenAI could shake up the market dynamics significantly. For the cryptocurrency and broader tech community, this move is another data point showing how quickly AI is reshaping fundamental digital interactions. Just as AI is impacting areas like trading analysis, smart contract development, and blockchain security, it’s now poised to transform something as ubiquitous as web search. Monitoring how Apple navigates this shift provides insights into future tech trends and potential areas for innovation. Concluding Thoughts: A Glimpse into the Future of Safari Eddy Cue Testimony has provided a rare glimpse into Apple’s strategic thinking regarding the future of search on its platforms. Driven by observed changes in user behavior and a belief in the eventual dominance of AI, Apple is proactively exploring how to bring advanced Safari AI capabilities to its users. While challenges remain, and a default switch isn’t imminent, the fact that Apple is having discussions with companies like Perplexity underscores the seriousness of their intent. This move is not just about adding a new feature; it’s about ensuring Apple Safari remains a leading browser in an age where AI is fundamentally changing how we access and process information online.

As regulators approve pathways for asset-backed tokens and blockchain enters a new phase of real-world deployment, the race to become one of the best cryptos to hold is heating up. These shifts are already reshaping market sentiment and triggering serious interest from enterprises. There are 3 coins already making strides in the market– Qubetics , Aptos, and Polkadot. European and North American regulators released synchronized proposals favoring decentralized custody and RWA (real-world asset) tokenization—pushing platforms that serve utility over speculation into the spotlight. From community-led governance shifts to cross-border partnerships, many leading protocols are growing fast to stay in the race. Qubetics ($TICS), in particular, is emerging as a front-runner among the best cryptos to hold. While Polkadot is updating governance for long-term agility and Aptos is pivoting toward enterprise integrations, Qubetics is already bridging these worlds with enterprise-ready tools and an expanding crypto presale. This article breaks down each project’s progress and future potential. Qubetics: Modular Simplicity Unlocks Practical Blockchain Utility Qubetics’ strategic focus on enterprise-level adoption is not theory—it is in motion. Its ongoing crypto presale , now in Stage 33, has raised over $16.7 million, with more than 511 million tokens sold to 25,900+ holders. At a current price of $0.2302, $TICS is attracting global attention due to its infrastructure-first approach, giving businesses tools that abstract away blockchain complexity. At the core of this momentum are two innovations: QubeQode : A no-code/low-code builder that lets companies deploy dApps without blockchain engineering expertise. Qubetics IDE: A dedicated development suite that allows professional dev teams to deploy secure smart contracts across multiple chains with native interoperability. Why Qubetics Stands Out Traditional chains like Ethereum require substantial technical knowledge and security audits for every dApp iteration. Qubetics eliminates these barriers by offering pre-audited modular templates within QubeQode. These elements let small businesses and enterprise teams alike deploy projects without high overhead. The Qubetics IDE furthers this by integrating smart routing and security frameworks compatible with EVM, Cosmos SDK, and Polkadot Substrate environments. This combination makes $TICS not only one of the best cryptos to hold but also one of the most adaptable in practical deployment. Presale Highlights: Stage: 33 Token Price: $0.2302 Tokens Sold: 511M+ Holders: 25,900+ Raised: $16.7M+ Analyst Projections (Post-Mainnet): $TICS at $1 = 334% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2071% ROI $TICS at $15 = 6414% ROI The Qubetics design proves that when infrastructure meets usability, market adoption follows. It ranks high among the best cryptos to hold for long-term utility.

On May 6th, HTX once again demonstrated its astute operational prowess by becoming the first global exchange to list the USD1 stablecoin. As USD1 generates significant market traction, the next strategic move for HTX appears increasingly clear: WLFI, poised to potentially become the platform’s next high-impact asset. USD1 Debut: A Masterclass in HTX Agility and Execution On May 6th, HTX announced the global debut of the USD1 stablecoin, establishing itself as the pioneering exchange platform to support trading of this asset. USD1 is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, backed by a reserve comprising short-term US Treasury bonds, cash, and cash equivalents. Custody is managed by the established institution BitGo, with regular audits conducted by third-party firms to ensure compliance and transparency. Currently deployed on both the Ethereum and BNB chains, USD1 has achieved a circulating market capitalization exceeding $2.1 billion, positioning it among the top five stablecoins in both centralized and decentralized markets, underscoring its considerable market potential. HTX listed USD1 with remarkable speed: an announcement on May 5th at 11:10, followed by deposit services commencing at 19:30 that evening, and the launch of spot trading pairs the next day at 11:00. Furthermore, the platform concurrently introduced a zero-fee promotion for the USD1/USDT spot trading pair, effective from 11:00 on May 6th, 2025, until 23:59 on December 31st, 2025. This initiative directly enhances the user experience. This series of efficient actions by HTX not only injects significant momentum into the adoption of USD1 but also lays a solid foundation for the further expansion of the WLFI ecosystem. Anticipating WLFI Listing: HTX’s Next Strategic Play? Following the USD1 launch, market attention has swiftly turned to the next potential high-profile project: WLFI. Launched on October 15th, 2024, WLFI successfully raised $550 million across two token sale rounds, attracting participation from over 85,000 investors. Notably, the project has garnered support from influential figures such as Justin Sun, DWF Labs, and Mike Dudas. Consequently, HTX’s next move regarding WLFI has become key topics within the crypto community. After the precedent-setting launch of USD1, could WLFI be the platform’s next significant offering? Historically, HTX has demonstrated a “bold yet meticulous” approach to new asset listings—venturesome in exploring emerging sectors while precisely gauging market sentiment. In the Q1 2025, HTX decisively listed TRUMP amidst market skepticism. This asset subsequently experienced a peak surge of 900%, rapidly generating market attention and user enthusiasm, effectively setting the stage for the surge in “celebrity coins.” Following this, HTX implemented a series of targeted marketing and promotional activities around TRUMP, capitalizing on the prevailing market trend. Similarly, HTX exhibited foresight in the AI concept coin sector, proactively listing VIRTUAL on the BASE chain (gaining 104%), AVAAI on the SOLANA chain (increasing by 256%), and LUNA (rising by 312%), providing investors with prime opportunities to capitalize on emerging trends. This strategy of “pioneering with prudence” has enabled HTX to consistently maintain a leading position in the competitive cryptocurrency market. In this context, the potential listing of WLFI on HTX appears to be a logical progression. Furthermore, the close relationship between Justin Sun and both WLFI and HTX strengthens this anticipation. From TRUMP to USD1, Justin Sun has played an active role in the WLFI ecosystem, with HTX naturally serving as a crucial platform for his strategic initiatives. Clearly, HTX’s approach to being a first mover is not arbitrary. Each selection is carefully considered, capitalizing on network connections, key junctures, and potential advantages. Of significant note, WLFI officially announced on May 7th its plan to test on-chain airdrop functionality via a Snapshot proposal. This initiative aims to distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible $WLFI holders to verify the airdrop system and reward early supporters. This move not only enhances community engagement and project visibility but also adds further tangible basis and speculative potential for WLFI’s potential listing on HTX. WLFI First on HTX? Justin Sun’s Statement Ignites Excitement From TRUMP to USD1, HTX has consistently delivered “debut blockbuster” listings, providing a compelling prelude for the potential launch of WLFI. This time, Justin Sun’s direct statement has further elevated expectations for WLFI’s premiere on HTX. On May 6th, Eric Trump, son of Donald Trump, announced on social media, “#USD1 is now live on HTX!” Justin Sun subsequently retweeted and responded, “WLFI coming soon on HTX.” This single statement has generated significant excitement. It not only provides a clear indication of WLFI’s impending arrival on HTX, also further solidifies HTX’s position as a central platform for WLFI’s strategic execution. It is foreseeable that once WLFI is successfully listed on HTX, the combined influence of “ Justin Sun + HTX ” will likely trigger a new wave of market enthusiasm, potentially establishing WLFI as another “blockbuster” project for HTX in 2025.

This bill directly addresses concerns about government officials potentially profiting from digital assets while simultaneously shaping policy that impacts the cryptocurrency landscape. It’s a topic that touches upon the very core of ethical governance and the rapidly evolving world of digital finance. Why the Push for a Politician Crypto Ban? The core of the proposed legislation, championed by New York State Representative Ritchie Torres, is straightforward: prohibit key federal personnel and their immediate families from trading or otherwise profiting from digital assets. As reported by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett via X, this isn’t just about preventing lucrative personal trades; it’s about ensuring that those who hold positions of power aren’t using insider knowledge or their influence over policy to gain an unfair advantage in the volatile digital asset market. Think about it: Members of Congress, the President, the Vice President, and countless federal employees are privy to discussions, draft legislation, and regulatory decisions that can dramatically affect the value of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and even memecoins. Allowing them to trade these assets creates a clear potential for crypto insider trading – using non-public information for personal gain. This erodes public confidence and calls into question the integrity of the legislative and regulatory processes surrounding digital assets. The increasing integration of digital assets into the global financial system means that decisions made in Washington D.C. have real-world consequences for investors and the industry. A politician crypto ban is seen by proponents as a necessary step to align the rules governing digital asset trading with those already in place for traditional securities, where similar restrictions on insider trading and potential conflicts of interest exist for government officials. Who Would This Federal Employee Crypto Ban Affect? The scope of the proposed bill is broad, targeting those at the highest levels of government down to various federal employees. Here’s a breakdown of the individuals and groups explicitly mentioned as being subject to the prohibition: The President of the United States The Vice President of the United States All Members of Congress (Senators and Representatives) Federal Employees (This category is vast and would likely require specific definitions within the bill itself, but it aims to cover those working across various government agencies) Immediate Family Members of all the above individuals Defining “immediate family members” is often a critical detail in such legislation, typically including spouses, dependent children, and sometimes other close relatives. The intent is to prevent officials from simply trading through proxies to circumvent the rules. The bill aims to cover a wide range of digital assets, including: Major cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) Stablecoins (digital assets pegged to stable values like the USD) Memecoins (cryptocurrencies often based on internet memes or social trends, known for high volatility) Presumably, other forms of digital assets like NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), depending on the final language of the bill. The inclusion of memecoins highlights the bill’s intent to cover the full spectrum of digital assets, regardless of their underlying technology or perceived value, focusing purely on the potential for speculative profit and conflicts of interest. Addressing Digital Asset Ethics in Government The push for this legislation underscores a growing concern about digital asset ethics within governmental bodies. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, the ethical lines regarding officials’ personal investments become blurrier, especially when those officials are involved in crafting regulations or investigating the industry. This bill attempts to draw a clear line in the sand. Consider the potential scenarios: A Member of Congress holds a significant position in a particular altcoin and then sits on a committee discussing legislation that could directly benefit or harm that altcoin’s ecosystem. A Treasury official is involved in drafting stablecoin regulations while their spouse actively trades stablecoins. An SEC employee has investments in a cryptocurrency project that the agency is investigating. These situations, whether or not actual wrongdoing occurs, create the appearance of impropriety and can severely damage public trust in government institutions and the fairness of the financial system. By enacting a politician crypto ban , the bill seeks to proactively eliminate these potential ethical minefields. Comparing Current Rules to Proposed US Crypto Regulation Currently, rules regarding federal officials’ investments vary. While there are ethics guidelines and laws like the STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act) that require disclosure of stock trades and aim to prevent insider trading in traditional markets, the application to digital assets has been less clear or consistent across all levels and branches of government. Some agencies may have internal policies, but a comprehensive, federal-level prohibition specifically for digital assets affecting all branches and their families is a significant step. Here’s a simplified comparison: Aspect Current Situation (General) Proposed Bill (Ritchie Torres Bill) Scope of Assets Focus on traditional securities; crypto rules less uniform/explicit. Explicitly includes cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, memecoins, etc. Covered Individuals Varies by role/agency; STOCK Act covers Congress/Exec branch officials for stocks. Covers President, VP, Congress, Federal Employees, AND their immediate families. Action Prohibited Insider trading on traditional securities; disclosure requirements for trades. Trading or profiting from digital assets (effectively a ban on holding/trading speculative assets). Primary Goal Prevent insider trading & increase transparency for traditional assets. Prevent conflicts of interest & insider trading specifically related to digital assets; enhance public trust. This table highlights how the proposed bill specifically targets the unique challenges presented by digital assets within the context of governmental ethics and US crypto regulation . Challenges and Benefits of a Federal Employee Crypto Ban Like any significant legislation, this bill faces potential challenges and offers clear benefits. Potential Challenges: Definition Clarity: Precisely defining “digital assets” and “immediate family” in a way that is comprehensive yet enforceable can be complex. Enforcement: Monitoring compliance across a vast number of federal employees and their families would require robust systems and resources. How would non-disclosure or violations be detected and penalized? Scope: Should the ban apply to all federal employees, or only those in roles directly related to financial regulation or policy-making? A broad ban might be seen as overly restrictive for employees whose jobs have no connection to digital assets. Existing Holdings: What happens to digital assets already held by these individuals or their families? Would they be forced to sell, or would they be allowed to hold them without further trading? Potential Benefits: Enhanced Public Trust: By removing the potential for personal gain from policy decisions, the bill can significantly improve public confidence in the fairness and integrity of US crypto regulation . Reduced Conflicts of Interest: Directly addresses the ethical dilemmas posed by officials trading assets they regulate or legislate upon. Level Playing Field: Helps ensure that policy is made based on sound principles rather than potentially being influenced by personal financial interests. Sets a Precedent: Could set a standard for ethical conduct regarding novel asset classes in the future. The debate around these points will be crucial as the bill potentially moves through the legislative process. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What does this mean for the average person interested in crypto or involved in the industry? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on this bill and similar legislative efforts. The details of who is covered and what is prohibited matter. Understand the “Why”: Recognize that this isn’t necessarily an attack on crypto itself, but rather an effort to apply ethical standards to government officials within the context of this new asset class. Advocate for Clarity: If you are part of the crypto industry, engage with policymakers to ensure that any resulting legislation is clear, fair, and effectively addresses ethical concerns without unduly hindering legitimate activity or innovation. Monitor Market Reactions: While unlikely to cause massive immediate shifts, the passage of such a bill could be interpreted by some as a sign of increasing regulatory focus, which can influence market sentiment. The conversation around digital asset ethics and preventing crypto insider trading at the governmental level is vital for the long-term health and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market. This proposed bill is a significant step in that ongoing discussion. A Step Towards Ethical Governance in the Digital Age The proposed bill from Representative Ritchie Torres represents a clear effort to apply traditional ethical standards to the modern world of digital assets. By seeking to implement a comprehensive politician crypto ban and extend it to federal employee crypto holdings, the legislation aims to prevent conflicts of interest and potential crypto insider trading , thereby safeguarding public trust in US crypto regulation . While challenges related to definition and enforcement exist, the benefits of clearer ethical boundaries for those in power are undeniable. As this bill progresses, it will be a key indicator of how the U.S. government intends to navigate the intersection of public service, personal finance, and the burgeoning digital asset economy.

Core Scientific’s Q1 2025 results, shared on May 7, saw it more than double its $210 million net income from the year-ago quarter, while its total revenue reached $79.5 million, missing Zacks analysts' estimates by 8.11%, and falling from its $179.3 million in revenues for Q1 2024. The firm’s primary source of revenue came from $67.2 million in self-mining revenue , $3.8 million in hosted mining revenue, and $8.6 million in colocation, formerly listed as high-performance computing (HPC) hosting. Source: Core Scientific Core Scientific said its drop in Bitcoin ( BTC ) mined and revenue was due to the halving on April 20, 2024, when mining rewards were cut from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, and its operational shift to HPC hosting, primarily used for artificial intelligence. However, the losses were partially offset by a 74% increase in the average price of Bitcoin and a 33% decrease in power costs due to lower rates and usage. As part of its HPC hosting shift, Core Scientific inked a deal in February with AI startup CoreWeave for a $1.2 billion data center expansion. As a result, Core Scientific anticipates entering 2026 with annualized colocation revenue of $360 million. Inflection point for miners in AI shift Core Scientific CEO Adam Sullivan said in a statement that its first quarter was an “inflection point,” as the firm positioned itself at the “center of one of the most important shifts in modern computing,” as the demand for high-performance data infrastructure has accelerated.

Source: Google Finance In an August report, asset manager VanEck estimated that if publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies shifted 20% of their energy capacity to AI and HPC by 2027, they could increase additional yearly profits by $13.9 billion over 13 years. Riot Platforms appointed three new directors to its board in February, one of whom has experience converting Bitcoin mining assets toward HPC. Hive Digital, Hut 8 and Iris Energy converted part of their operations to HPC and AI last year, and TeraWulf sold its stake in a Bitcoin mining facility for $92 million in October, with the proceeds marked for hosting AI and building HPC data centers.

Ever feel like the world of traditional finance and central banks is miles away from the fast-paced crypto universe? Think again! Decisions made by institutions like the U.S. Federal Reserve can send significant ripples through all asset classes, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and your favorite altcoins. Right now, a key tool used by traders worldwide, the CME FedWatch tool, is flashing a very clear signal about the upcoming FOMC Meeting in May. According to the latest data, there’s an overwhelming probability – a staggering 97.7% chance – that the Fed will choose to keep Interest Rates exactly where they are. Only a tiny 2.3% chance is assigned to a modest 0.25% rate cut. But what does this high probability hold mean, and more importantly, what could be its Crypto Market Impact ? Decoding the CME FedWatch Tool: Your Window into Fed Expectations Before we dive deeper into the implications of this prediction, let’s quickly touch on what the CME FedWatch tool actually is. It’s not a crystal ball, but it’s pretty close when it comes to gauging market sentiment about the Federal Reserve ‘s next move on Interest Rates . The tool uses real-time data from CME Group’s Fed Funds futures contracts. These are financial instruments where traders essentially bet on the future level of the federal funds rate. By looking at the pricing of these contracts, the FedWatch tool calculates the market’s perceived probability of different rate outcomes at upcoming FOMC Meeting s. It’s a powerful snapshot of collective market expectation, providing valuable insight into how traders are positioning themselves. The May FOMC Meeting Prediction: Stability on the Horizon? The headline from the CME FedWatch tool is loud and clear for the May FOMC Meeting : Stability is the overwhelming expectation. Let’s break down the numbers reported: Probability of Rates Held Steady: 97.7% Probability of a 0.25% Rate Cut: 2.3% Probability of a 0.25% Rate Hike: 0.0% (Effectively zero) This data strongly suggests that the market has largely priced in a scenario where the Federal Reserve maintains the current target range for the federal funds rate (which is currently 5.25% to 5.50%). This level has been in place since July 2023. What does ‘holding rates steady’ mean? It means the Fed isn’t making borrowing money cheaper or more expensive, at least not directly through this key policy rate. They are choosing to observe the current economic conditions and the impact of their previous rate hikes before making another move. Why is the Federal Reserve Leaning Towards a Hold? The Federal Reserve ‘s decisions on Interest Rates are guided by its dual mandate from Congress: to promote maximum employment and stable prices (low inflation). Several economic factors likely contribute to the current high probability of a hold according to the CME FedWatch : Stubborn Inflation: While inflation has come down significantly from its peak, recent data points (like the Consumer Price Index – CPI) have shown it’s not cooling as quickly as the Fed would like. This makes rate cuts less likely in the immediate future. Resilient Labor Market: The U.S. jobs market remains relatively strong, with low unemployment. A robust labor market can contribute to wage pressures, which can, in turn, fuel inflation. A strong economy gives the Fed less urgency to cut rates to stimulate growth. Economic Growth: The U.S. economy has shown surprising resilience. Stronger-than-expected growth means the economy can handle higher Interest Rates for longer without tipping into recession, reducing the need for stimulative cuts. Waiting for More Data: The Fed often prefers to see a consistent trend in economic data before making a policy shift. Holding rates allows them time to assess upcoming reports on inflation, employment, and consumer spending. These factors, among others, paint a picture where the Federal Reserve sees the current monetary policy stance as appropriate for now, justifying the high probability of a hold reflected in the CME FedWatch data. The Ripple Effect of Interest Rates: How Fed Policy Shapes Markets Understanding the Crypto Market Impact of Fed decisions requires first understanding how Interest Rates generally affect financial markets. Higher interest rates typically make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers. This can slow down economic activity. They also make less risky investments, like government bonds or savings accounts, more attractive compared to riskier assets. Conversely, lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. They also make riskier assets relatively more appealing as investors seek higher returns than those offered by low-yield safe investments. Traditional Markets: Stocks: Higher rates can negatively impact stock valuations as future earnings are discounted at a higher rate, and borrowing costs for companies increase. Lower rates generally support higher stock prices. Bonds: Bond prices typically move inversely to interest rates. When rates rise, the value of existing lower-yield bonds falls. When rates fall, existing higher-yield bonds become more valuable. U.S. Dollar: Higher interest rates can make the U.S. dollar more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher yields, potentially strengthening the dollar. Crucial Question: What Does a Fed Rate Hold Mean for the Crypto Market Impact? Now for the part most relevant to you: the potential Crypto Market Impact . The relationship between Interest Rates and crypto isn’t always direct or perfectly correlated, but there are clear mechanisms at play. Cryptocurrencies are often viewed as risk assets, similar to growth stocks or venture capital. When Interest Rates are high and rising, the cost of capital increases across the board. This can: Reduce Liquidity: Less cheap money flowing through the system can mean less capital available to flow into riskier assets like crypto. Increase Opportunity Cost: With higher yields available on safer investments (like Treasury bills), the relative appeal of volatile assets like crypto might decrease for some investors. Impact Tech/Growth Narratives: Many crypto projects are tied to technological innovation and growth narratives, which can be more sensitive to higher borrowing costs and tighter financial conditions. Given the CME FedWatch ‘s prediction of a hold, here’s how the 97.7% probability might influence the Crypto Market Impact : Potential Positives (or ‘Less Negative’): Stability is Priced In: A hold is the highly expected outcome. This means the market has likely already adjusted to the current rate environment. Surprises (like an unexpected hike) tend to cause more volatility than expected outcomes. Avoids Further Tightening: While not a cut, a hold means the Fed isn’t actively making conditions *more* restrictive right now. This avoids adding fresh downward pressure that a hike would likely cause. Focus Shifts to Future Cuts: With a hold expected now, market attention might increasingly turn to *when* the first rate cut might occur later in the year, which is generally seen as bullish for risk assets in the medium term. Potential Negatives (or ‘Continued Headwinds’): No Immediate Stimulus: A hold means no new influx of cheap money into the system, which is what a rate cut would provide. The current higher-rate environment continues to be a factor. Economic Uncertainty Lingers: The reason *why* the Fed is holding (persistent inflation, etc.) indicates underlying economic challenges that could still weigh on investor sentiment for risk assets. Market Could React to Nuances: While the rate decision itself might be a non-event if it’s a hold, the Fed’s statement and Chair Powell’s press conference could contain forward guidance or economic assessments that *do* surprise the market and trigger volatility in crypto. So, while the high probability of a hold suggests the immediate decision itself might not be a shocker for the crypto market, the context surrounding that decision – particularly the Fed’s commentary on inflation and future policy path – will be crucial. Traders will be listening intently for any hints about the timing of potential future rate cuts. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Based on the CME FedWatch outlook and the potential Crypto Market Impact : Expect the Expected (for the Decision): Don’t necessarily anticipate massive volatility *solely* from the rate decision itself if it’s the predicted hold. Focus on the Commentary: Pay close attention to the official FOMC statement released alongside the decision and, more importantly, Chair Powell’s subsequent press conference. Look for language regarding the economic outlook, inflation trends, and any hints about the future path of Interest Rates . Monitor Economic Data: The Fed is data-dependent. Keep an eye on upcoming inflation reports (CPI, PCE) and jobs data, as these will influence future Fed decisions and thus potential Crypto Market Impact later in the year. Risk Management: Regardless of the Fed’s decision, crypto remains a volatile asset class. Maintain a diversified portfolio and practice sound risk management based on your own financial situation and investment goals. In Summary: Navigating the Predicted Hold The latest CME FedWatch data paints a clear picture: the market is overwhelmingly confident (97.7% probability) that the Federal Reserve will keep Interest Rates unchanged at the upcoming May FOMC Meeting . This expectation is likely driven by persistent inflation and a resilient economy, giving the Fed room to maintain its current restrictive stance. For the crypto market, this predicted hold means the immediate environment of higher borrowing costs and tighter liquidity conditions is expected to continue. While the decision itself might not cause major waves if it aligns with expectations, the Fed’s accompanying commentary on the economy and future policy will be key drivers of market sentiment and potential Crypto Market Impact in the days and weeks following the meeting.

The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged comes despite mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump, who just weeks ago threatened to fire Fed chair Jerome Powell for being “too late” in cutting rates. Fed cites higher unemployment, inflation risk Powell said on May 7 that the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee held rates in the 4.25% to 4.50% range due to the rising risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation. He added inflation has “come down a great deal but has been running above our 2% longer objective.” Powell said surveys in households and businesses showed a “sharp decline in sentiment” mainly due to concerns over Trump’s trade policy. However, Powell said that “despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position.” In the days leading up to the announcement, data from CME Group’s FedWatch Tool indicated that the futures market expected minimal odds of a rate cut . Powell said the unemployment rate remains low, and the labor market is “at or near maximum employment.” The market expects the Fed to drop the Fed funds rate to 3.6% by the end of 2025. Bitcoin fell below $96,000 before retracing back above $98,000 just hours later on May 7. Source: CoinMarketCap Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped below $97,000 to $95,866 after Powell’s speech, but it shot up to tap $98,000 for the first time since Feb. 21 just hours later. Bitcoin momentum has been building, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index returning to “Greed” territory, and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) posting inflows of almost $4.41 billion since March 26 . Related: Bitcoin price rallied 1,550% the last time the ‘BTC risk-off’ metric fell this low On March 9, network economist Timothy Peterson warned that if the Fed holds off on rate cuts in 2025, it may cause a broader market downturn, potentially dragging Bitcoin back toward $70,000.

44306050,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158274,1746673222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,OpenAI Launches Ambitious Global AI Partnerships for Infrastructure Growth,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-launches-ai-partnerships/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, where advancements in artificial intelligence are setting the pace, a significant move by a leading AI firm warrants attention, particularly for those tracking major shifts in the digital realm like cryptocurrency enthusiasts. OpenAI has announced a strategic initiative aimed at fostering global AI adoption and building essential infrastructure. This program signals a new era of collaboration between private AI companies and public entities, potentially reshaping the future of AI accessibility and development worldwide. The program, dubbed “OpenAI for Countries,” is designed to work directly with national governments to accelerate the creation of local AI capabilities and infrastructure. Understanding OpenAI for Countries and AI Infrastructure The core objective of the “OpenAI for Countries” program is straightforward yet ambitious: to enable OpenAI to better serve its international customers by establishing local foundations. This involves more than just offering software; it’s about laying the groundwork for AI to function effectively within diverse national contexts. A primary focus is the development of robust AI infrastructure . Building data centers: This is a critical component, requiring significant investment and technical expertise to handle the immense computational needs of AI models. Enhancing connectivity: Ensuring high-speed, reliable network access is vital for distributing AI services and processing data efficiently. Securing power supply: AI data centers consume vast amounts of energy, necessitating stable and sustainable power solutions. By partnering with governments, OpenAI aims to navigate the complexities of developing such infrastructure within different regulatory and environmental landscapes. This collaborative approach is expected to speed up deployment and tailor infrastructure to specific national requirements. The Role of Government Partnerships in AI Development Why are government partnerships central to this initiative? Governments possess unique resources and authority necessary for large-scale infrastructure projects. They can facilitate access to land, permits, and necessary utilities, and often play a key role in shaping national digital strategies. OpenAI’s program seeks to leverage these capabilities to achieve mutual goals. These partnerships extend beyond just physical infrastructure. Governments can assist in: Customizing OpenAI products: Tailoring models like ChatGPT for local languages, cultural nuances, and specific national use cases (e.g., public services, education, healthcare). Navigating regulations: Ensuring AI deployment complies with national data privacy laws, ethical guidelines, and security standards. Promoting adoption: Encouraging the use of AI across government agencies, educational institutions, and local industries. Funding for these projects will be a shared responsibility, with contributions coming from both OpenAI and the participating governments. This co-funding model underscores the commitment required from both sides to make these initiatives successful. Driving AI Development and Global Reach A stated goal of AI development through this program is to “spread democratic AI.” This phrase suggests an effort to promote Western AI models, particularly OpenAI’s, as alternatives to competitors, likely those from China. By establishing a local presence and customizing its offerings, OpenAI aims to make its technology more accessible, relevant, and appealing to countries globally. This strategic push has geopolitical implications, positioning AI technology as a tool of influence and a reflection of different technological philosophies. Connecting to Project Stargate: Expanding OpenAI’s Vision The “OpenAI for Countries” program appears closely linked to OpenAI’s rumored large-scale data center initiative, known as Project Stargate . Project Stargate is reportedly a massive undertaking aimed at building extensive data center capacity, potentially involving significant investment and partnerships, possibly including Microsoft. While initially focused on expanding infrastructure within the U.S., the “OpenAI for Countries” program suggests that Project Stargate’s ambitions extend internationally. It is plausible that the infrastructure built under Project Stargate could support the international projects in the “OpenAI for Countries” program, or that funding sources for Stargate might also contribute to the international expansion efforts. This integrated approach highlights OpenAI’s commitment to securing the vast computational resources needed to train and run increasingly powerful AI models on a global scale. Benefits and Challenges The program offers potential benefits: Accelerated AI adoption and integration in participating countries. Customized AI solutions better suited to local needs. Growth of local technological expertise and job creation. Increased global competition in the AI space. However, challenges exist: Navigating diverse national regulations and political landscapes. Securing substantial and consistent funding from governments. Addressing concerns about data sovereignty and privacy. Ensuring equitable access and preventing a digital divide within countries. Managing competition from other global AI providers. Conclusion OpenAI’s “OpenAI for Countries” program marks a significant strategic shift towards deep international engagement through direct partnerships with governments. By focusing on building local AI infrastructure and customizing its products, OpenAI aims to expand its global footprint, promote its vision of “democratic AI,” and potentially leverage large-scale initiatives like Project Stargate . This ambitious undertaking highlights the increasing importance of government partnerships in shaping the future of AI development and underscores the global race to build the necessary technological foundations for the AI era. The success of these initial 10 projects will likely provide valuable insights into the feasibility and impact of this collaborative model on the worldwide adoption of advanced AI technologies.

BNB Could Spike By 360% The path implies a gain of more than 360% from current levels and, crucially, situates the token in what Kendrick calls “a benchmark-like role” inside the wider crypto capital structure. “BNB has traded almost exactly in line with an unweighted basket of Bitcoin and Ethereum since May 2021 in terms of both returns and volatility,” Kendrick wrote. “We expect this relationship to continue to hold, driving the price from around $600 currently to $2,775 by end-2028.” Related Reading: BNB Textbook Support Rebound Sets The Stage for More Upside – See How Standard Chartered’s broader outlook is unabashedly bullish on the majors: Bitcoin is projected to reach $200,000 in 2025 and $500,000 in 2028, while Ethereum is pencilled in at $4,000 and $7,500 over the same horizons. When those forecasts are translated into cross-asset ratios, they reveal subtle shifts in market share. The BTC-BNB ratio—how many BNB one Bitcoin can buy—is expected to tick up from 157 in 2025 to 180 by 2027, then hold steady, implying that Bitcoin’s dollar appreciation is likely to outrun BNB’s. By contrast, the ETH-BNB ratio is seen slipping from 3.14 in 2025 to 2.70 in 2027, signalling that Ethereum may outperform BNB, but more gently than Bitcoin will. Kendrick acknowledges that BNB “may underperform Bitcoin and Ether both in real terms and as measured by market cap in circulation,” yet he contends that its deflationary tokenomics and deep linkage to the world’s largest centralized exchange “support its long-term value.” The research note scrutinises BNB Chain’s architecture. Its “proof-of-staked authority” model rotates just 45 validators every 24 hours—a sharp contrast to Ethereum’s million-plus validator set. Kendrick describes BNB Chain as “highly centralised relative to other chains,” adding that its developer activity has “stagnated” since the 2021 DeFi surge and now trails networks such as Avalanche and Ethereum. Related Reading: BNB Bulls Target $644 As Classic Chart Formation Emerges Even so, forthcoming technical milestones are expected to expand the ecosystem’s resilience. Kendrick cites the recently completed Pascal hard fork and the looming Maxwell upgrade, due in June, as examples of “incremental but meaningful” incentives for developers. On the demand side, the token’s fortunes remain tethered to Binance’s trading engine. Holders receive tiered fee discounts calculated on their token balance and 30-day volume—a mechanically enforced use-case that has so far “helped the BNB Chain retain activity even as competition from other ecosystems like Solana grows,” Kendrick notes. PancakeSwap, the dominant decentralised exchange on BNB Chain, amplifies that liquidity loop. Meanwhile, regular token burns, coupled with the fixed-limit supply, underpin a structural deflation that Standard Chartered says justifies the premium BNB commands on its market-cap-to-GDP valuation screen—currently “rich” by the bank’s preferred metric. At press time, BNB traded at $605.

The Federal Reserve , specifically its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), just announced a significant decision regarding the Fed Interest Rate . In a move many anticipated but still carries weight, the benchmark interest rate has been frozen. What does this mean for the economy, and more importantly, what could be the Crypto Market Impact ? Despite a backdrop of seemingly solid economic indicators, the central bank opted for a pause rather than another hike. This decision wasn’t made lightly and comes with careful consideration of the current Economic Outlook and incoming Inflation Data . Why Did the Federal Reserve Freeze the Fed Interest Rate? The official statement from the FOMC provides insight into their thinking. While recent months have shown a stable, low unemployment rate and a resilient labor market, the persistent issue of high inflation remains a concern. This creates a complex picture for policymakers. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors influencing the Federal Reserve’s decision: Stable Labor Market: The unemployment rate has held steady at a low level, and job growth has been consistent, indicating underlying economic strength. Stubborn Inflation: Despite previous rate hikes, inflation remains above the Fed’s target, eroding purchasing power. Increased Uncertainty: The FOMC statement explicitly noted a rise in uncertainty regarding the future Economic Outlook . This includes concerns about both the risk of inflation staying high and the potential for increased unemployment. This pause signals a shift from a clear tightening bias to a more data-dependent approach. The Fed will now take more time to assess how past rate hikes are affecting the economy before making further adjustments. Understanding the Economic Outlook and Inflation Data The economic landscape is giving mixed signals. On one hand, consumer spending and business investment show some resilience. On the other hand, the full impact of the rapid rate hikes over the past year is still filtering through the system. The lag effect of monetary policy means that the economy might still slow down considerably in the coming months. The Inflation Data is particularly crucial. While headline inflation has cooled somewhat, core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy prices) has been stickier. The Fed needs to see clear evidence that inflation is sustainably moving towards its 2% target before it can consider cutting rates. The increased uncertainty mentioned by the Federal Reserve stems from various factors, including global economic conditions, geopolitical events, and the unpredictable nature of how inflation will evolve. This complex Economic Outlook makes forecasting difficult for everyone, including investors. What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? This is the question on every crypto investor’s mind. How does the Fed Interest Rate decision influence Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader digital asset space? Historically, periods of aggressive rate hikes have often correlated with downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Higher interest rates make traditional savings and bonds more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from speculative investments like crypto. However, a pause could be interpreted in different ways: Potential Positive: Some might see the pause as a signal that the tightening cycle is nearing its end, potentially leading to increased liquidity in financial markets. More liquidity could flow into risk assets like crypto. Potential Negative: Others might view the pause as an acknowledgment that the economy is weakening significantly, increasing the risk of a recession. A recession could lead to broader market sell-offs, affecting crypto. Volatility: The uncertainty highlighted by the Fed is likely to translate into continued volatility across all markets, including crypto. Price swings could be more pronounced as markets react to every piece of new Inflation Data and economic news. The Crypto Market Impact will ultimately depend on how the economic narrative unfolds from here. Will inflation cool rapidly, allowing the Fed to consider cuts sooner? Or will the economy weaken significantly, leading to recession fears dominating the narrative? Challenges and Risks Highlighted by the Fed The FOMC statement didn’t just announce a pause; it also pointed to rising risks. Specifically, they highlighted that the risks of both high unemployment and high inflation have increased. This is a delicate balancing act for the Federal Reserve . Managing the Economic Outlook involves navigating these dual risks. Aggressively fighting inflation with higher rates could trigger a sharp rise in unemployment. Conversely, easing policy too soon to support employment could allow inflation to become entrenched. These macroeconomic risks are fundamental drivers of market sentiment. Investors in the crypto space need to be aware that the broader economic environment, shaped by the Federal Reserve’s actions and the resulting Inflation Data and employment figures, will continue to play a significant role in crypto price movements. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the current climate of uncertainty following the Fed Interest Rate decision, what steps can crypto investors consider? Firstly, stay informed. Keep a close eye on future Inflation Data , employment reports, and subsequent statements from the Federal Reserve . These will provide clues about the likely direction of monetary policy. Secondly, consider your risk tolerance. The increased uncertainty in the Economic Outlook means that market volatility is likely to persist. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with how much risk you are comfortable taking. Thirdly, think long-term. While short-term price movements are influenced by macro events like the Fed Interest Rate decision, the long-term potential of blockchain technology and specific crypto projects is a separate consideration. Dollar-cost averaging can be a strategy to navigate volatile periods. Finally, diversification is key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different crypto assets and potentially other asset classes can help mitigate risk. Compelling Summary: Navigating the Pause The Federal Reserve’s decision to freeze the Fed Interest Rate marks a pivotal moment. It reflects a complex Economic Outlook where a strong labor market coexists with persistent high inflation and rising uncertainty. The central bank is now in a wait-and-see mode, heavily reliant on future Inflation Data and other economic indicators. For the crypto market, this pause introduces both potential upside from hopes of peak rates and potential downside from increased recession risks. The Crypto Market Impact will be closely tied to how these conflicting forces play out. Staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective are crucial for navigating this uncertain period.

44306653,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158281,1746674415,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Federal Reserve Holds Steady: What This Means for the Cryptocurrency Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-holds-interest-rates/,"The world of finance is constantly reacting to signals from major economic bodies, and few are watched as closely as the U.S. Federal Reserve . Recently, the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) made a decision that, while widely anticipated, carries significant weight for markets globally, including the volatile cryptocurrency market . What Did the Federal Reserve Decide on Interest Rates? In its latest meeting, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25% to 4.50%. This move was largely in line with market expectations, suggesting a period of holding steady after a series of aggressive rate hikes aimed at taming inflation. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key points from the announcement: Rate Stability: The federal funds rate remains unchanged, pausing the tightening cycle for now. Alignment with Expectations: The decision met the consensus view among economists and market participants. Focus on Data: The Fed reiterated that future decisions will depend on incoming economic data, particularly concerning inflation and employment. No Immediate Pivot: While rates are stable, this doesn’t necessarily signal an immediate pivot to rate cuts. The language suggests a readiness to adjust policy as needed. Understanding the Federal Reserve ‘s stance on interest rates is crucial because these rates influence borrowing costs across the entire economy, from mortgages to business loans. This, in turn, impacts consumer spending, investment, and overall economic growth. How Does the FOMC Influence the Cryptocurrency Market? The decisions made by the FOMC have a profound, albeit indirect, impact on the cryptocurrency market . Here’s why: Liquidity: Lower interest rates generally mean more liquidity in the financial system, as borrowing becomes cheaper. This can lead investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Conversely, higher rates tighten liquidity, making riskier assets less attractive. Investor Sentiment: The Fed’s outlook on the economy shapes investor confidence. A stable or optimistic outlook can encourage investment, while concerns about recession or persistent inflation can lead to risk aversion. Dollar Strength: Monetary policy decisions, particularly on rates, affect the strength of the U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes put downward pressure on assets like Bitcoin, which are often seen as alternative stores of value. Inflation Expectations: The Fed’s primary goal is price stability. How the market perceives the Fed’s ability to control inflation influences the narrative around assets like Bitcoin, which some view as an inflation hedge. The decision to hold rates steady, as announced by the FOMC , can be interpreted in several ways by the cryptocurrency market . On one hand, it removes the immediate pressure of another rate hike, which is generally seen as positive for risk assets. On the other hand, it signals that the Fed believes conditions still warrant keeping rates at restrictive levels to combat inflation, which isn’t necessarily bullish. Navigating the Cryptocurrency Market Amidst Monetary Policy Shifts The current phase of monetary policy , characterized by stable but elevated interest rates , presents both opportunities and challenges for participants in the cryptocurrency market . Benefits: Reduced Uncertainty: A predictable Fed decision removes one layer of market anxiety, potentially allowing other factors to drive crypto price action. Stable Macro Backdrop (for now): A pause in rate hikes suggests the Fed is comfortable with the current trajectory, offering a degree of stability in the macroeconomic environment compared to periods of aggressive tightening. Challenges: Continued Tight Conditions: Rates remain high, meaning the cost of capital is still elevated. This can constrain growth in speculative assets and potentially impact crypto-related businesses relying on financing. Data Dependency: The Fed’s future moves are explicitly tied to data. Any negative surprises on inflation or employment could quickly shift the sentiment and policy outlook. Risk-Off Sentiment Lurking: Despite the pause, the underlying economic conditions that led to high rates (inflation) are still being monitored. A resurgence of inflation fears could trigger a return to risk-off behavior. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Pay close attention to future Fed announcements, press conferences, and economic projections (like the dot plot). Monitor Key Data: Keep an eye on inflation reports (CPI, PCE), employment data, and GDP figures, as these will heavily influence the Fed’s next steps. Understand Correlations: Be aware that while crypto has unique drivers, it is not immune to global macroeconomic forces and shifts in monetary policy . Manage Risk: Given the ongoing uncertainty and data dependency, maintaining a disciplined risk management strategy is crucial. The relationship between the Federal Reserve ‘s actions and the cryptocurrency market is complex and constantly evolving. While crypto enthusiasts often focus on technological advancements and adoption, ignoring the broader economic context set by institutions like the FOMC would be unwise. The Role of Monetary Policy in a Digital Age Monetary policy , traditionally focused on managing fiat currencies and banking systems, now operates in an environment where digital assets like cryptocurrencies exist. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve , are increasingly considering the implications of digital currencies, stablecoins, and the broader crypto ecosystem. While the direct tools of monetary policy (like setting interest rates ) primarily target the traditional financial system, their effects ripple outward. The liquidity, risk appetite, and inflation expectations influenced by the Fed’s decisions inevitably spill over into the crypto space. As the crypto market matures and becomes more integrated with traditional finance, this relationship is likely to strengthen. The Fed’s decision to hold rates steady can be seen as a moment of cautious observation. They are likely waiting to see the full effects of previous hikes on inflation and the economy before making their next move. This period of stability in monetary policy could provide a window for the cryptocurrency market to find its footing based on its own fundamentals, but it remains susceptible to shifts in the macro winds. Conclusion: Navigating the Macro Currents The Federal Reserve ‘s decision to keep interest rates unchanged was a non-event in terms of surprise, but a significant signal regarding the current state of monetary policy . The FOMC is in a holding pattern, balancing the need to combat inflation with the risks to economic growth. For the cryptocurrency market , this means the immediate headwind of rising rates has paused, but the broader environment of relatively tight liquidity and data dependency persists. Understanding the nuances of the Federal Reserve ‘s communications and monitoring key economic indicators is essential for anyone navigating the digital asset space. While crypto’s long-term potential is driven by innovation and adoption, its short-to-medium term trajectory will likely remain influenced by the powerful currents of global monetary policy .

Both Arbitrum, a blockchain overlaid on Ethereum, and Solana have been under consideration for the collaboration, though discussions are still ongoing. This move to offer tokenized US securities aligns with a broader trend in the financial industry. As global institutions explore blockchain’s potential, they see an opportunity to cut costs tied to traditional trading infrastructure while benefiting from greater transparency and standardization.

This will allow the company to expand its services within the EU to include stock trading. In addition, Robinhood is in the process of closing a deal to acquire crypto exchange Bitstamp , which would enable the company to offer crypto-linked derivatives under Bitstamp’s MiFID multilateral trading facility license. Despite Crypto Growth, Robinhood Aims to Broaden Revenue Sources The company has enjoyed strong financial performance, with a 50% jump in revenue for the first quarter of the year . A big chunk of this growth came from its cryptocurrency business, driven by a surge in trading volumes as investors sought to hedge against market volatility. As a result, the platform’s profits more than doubled, surpassing analysts’ expectations. Despite its reliance on crypto for now, CEO Vlad Tenev said that Robinhood is working to diversify its business. The company plans to reduce its dependence on crypto transaction volumes over time. “We’re focused on diversifying the business outside of crypto,” Tenev explained during the earnings call. “This will make us less reliant on crypto transaction volumes in the future.” With its latest move, Robinhood aims to tap into the growing interest in blockchain-based financial products. The company’s European expansion, which is backed by Lithuania’s regulatory framework, could serve as a crucial stepping stone in its broader international growth strategy. However, the platform’s success will hinge on its ability to attract a substantial user base and navigate evolving market dynamics in the EU.

Leaked Emails Expose 2021 Doubts About Ripple,https://coinpedia.org/news/did-the-sec-fear-xrps-collapse-leaked-emails-expose-2021-doubts-about-ripple/,"The post Did the SEC Fear XRP’s Collapse? Leaked Emails Expose 2021 Doubts About Ripple appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s long legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may have wrapped up in the company’s favor, but newly released documents show how deeply the agency once worried about the future of XRP. According to a fresh batch of files obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request by Coinbase, SEC officials were actively debating the stability and security classification of various crypto assets back in 2021. Among them, XRP was very much on their radar. As reported by The Block, in one internal email, SEC officials questioned what might happen if Ripple, the company behind XRP, suddenly “walked away” or “disappeared.” The agency appeared concerned about what risks could surface for the XRP blockchain in such a scenario — a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse into how regulators were viewing crypto projects under pressure. At the time, the SEC had already kicked off a major lawsuit against Ripple, accusing it of operating illegally by selling XRP as an unregistered security. While Ripple has since emerged victorious from that battle — even winning back some of the penalties it had previously paid — these newly uncovered emails show just how uncertain regulators were about the decentralization and resilience of the XRP network itself. The revelations come amid a broader series of disclosures this week from Coinbase, which published dozens of SEC communications related to crypto oversight as part of its own ongoing legal standoff with the agency. This isn’t the first time SEC deliberations on crypto assets have made headlines.

A report from the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert highlighted a massive XRP transfer , specifically 300,000,000 tokens, moved directly from Ripple’s wallets to an address currently identified only as ‘unknown’. Valued at approximately $634 million at the time of the transaction, this large XRP transaction has naturally captured the attention of market observers, analysts, and the broader XRP community. Such substantial movements often trigger speculation about their purpose and potential impact on the market dynamics of XRP. What Did the Whale Alert Report Detail? According to the alert disseminated by Whale Alert, a service renowned for tracking significant cryptocurrency movements, the transaction originated from an address known to be associated with Ripple . The destination was flagged as an ‘unknown wallet’. While the term ‘unknown wallet’ might sound mysterious, it simply means the address hasn’t been publicly identified or linked to a specific entity like an exchange or a known company wallet through available blockchain data or public declarations. Here are the key details of the reported transaction: Amount: 300,000,000 XRP Source: Ripple wallet Destination: Unknown wallet Approximate USD Value: $634,000,000 (at the time of transfer) Reporting Service: Whale Alert This isn’t the first time Whale Alert has flagged large movements involving Ripple or XRP, but the sheer size of this particular transfer makes it noteworthy. Large transactions are often scrutinized because they can potentially signal impending activity like sales, distribution, or strategic shifts by major holders or entities like Ripple. Why Does a Large XRP Transfer from Ripple Matter? Movements of this magnitude are significant for several reasons, particularly when they originate from Ripple , a company that holds a substantial amount of the total XRP supply. Here’s why this large XRP transaction is under the spotlight: 1. Potential Market Impact: A transfer of 300 million XRP could potentially signal preparation for a sale. If these tokens are intended for distribution on exchanges or through over-the-counter (OTC) deals, it could introduce selling pressure on the market, affecting XRP’s price. However, it’s crucial to remember that a transfer doesn’t automatically mean a sale is imminent or guaranteed. 2. Ripple’s Strategy: Ripple uses XRP for various purposes, including its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) product, institutional sales, and ecosystem development initiatives. A large transfer could be related to funding an ODL corridor, supplying an institutional partner, or moving funds for operational purposes. Understanding Ripple’s intent behind such a move is key to interpreting its potential implications. 3. Whale Activity: While the destination is an ‘unknown wallet’, large transfers are often associated with ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Tracking whale movements is a common practice among traders and analysts trying to anticipate market trends. Even if the destination is another Ripple-controlled address, it signifies a strategic internal movement. 4. Transparency vs. Ambiguity: The ‘unknown wallet’ designation adds a layer of ambiguity. While blockchain provides transparency regarding the transaction itself (amount, source, destination address), the identity and purpose of the receiving wallet remain undisclosed unless the owner voluntarily reveals themselves or the address is later linked to a known entity. Possible Reasons Behind the 300M XRP Transfer Without an official statement from Ripple, any interpretation of this XRP transfer is speculative. However, based on Ripple’s known activities and the nature of large blockchain transactions, several possibilities emerge: Funding On-Demand Liquidity (ODL): Ripple’s ODL service uses XRP to facilitate cross-border payments. Large amounts of XRP are often moved to exchanges or liquidity providers to ensure sufficient supply for these operations. This is a plausible explanation for a significant outbound transfer from Ripple. Institutional Sales or Distribution: Ripple engages in private sales of XRP to institutions and partners. The transfer could be the movement of tokens destined for such a sale or a planned distribution as part of a business agreement. Internal Treasury Management: Ripple manages vast reserves of XRP. The transfer could simply be an internal reorganization of funds between different Ripple-controlled wallets for security, operational efficiency, or allocation to specific departments or initiatives. Ecosystem Development: Ripple supports various projects and developers building on the XRP Ledger. The transfer might be related to funding grants, investments, or partnerships aimed at expanding the XRP ecosystem. Preparation for Exchange Deposit: Less likely to an ‘unknown’ address unless it’s a new cold storage for an exchange, but large transfers can sometimes precede deposits onto exchanges, often interpreted as preparation for selling. However, moving directly from Ripple to an unknown wallet doesn’t fit the typical pattern of exchange deposits reported by Whale Alert, which usually identify the exchange. It’s important to differentiate between XRP released from escrow and XRP moved from Ripple’s operational wallets. While monthly escrow releases are a known source of XRP entering circulation, this particular transaction was reported as originating directly from a Ripple wallet, suggesting it was part of their actively managed holdings. How Does This Relate to Ripple’s Overall XRP Strategy? Ripple holds a significant portion of the total XRP supply, much of which is locked in escrow. The company strategically releases and utilizes XRP for various purposes aimed at promoting the adoption and utility of the XRP Ledger and the XRP token. These purposes include: Developing the XRP Ledger: Funding core development and improvements. Promoting ODL: Providing liquidity for cross-border payments. Incentivizing Ecosystem Growth: Supporting dApp development, NFTs, and other use cases. Institutional Engagement: Selling XRP to financial institutions and corporate partners. A large XRP transaction like the one reported by Whale Alert is typically aligned with one or more of these strategic pillars. It signifies active management of their reserves and execution of their business plan. The market often watches these movements closely for clues about Ripple’s near-term intentions and the health of its business operations. Keeping Tabs: The Role of Whale Alert and Blockchain Trackers Services like Whale Alert play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem by providing transparency into large on-chain movements. By automatically detecting and reporting transactions exceeding a certain threshold, they enable market participants to stay informed about significant shifts in token holdings and flows. While these alerts don’t provide the ‘why’ behind a transaction, they provide the ‘what, when, and how much’, allowing the community to analyze and speculate on the potential implications. For an asset like XRP , with a significant portion held by a single entity like Ripple, tracking these movements is particularly relevant for understanding supply dynamics and potential market events. Conclusion: Awaiting Clarity on the Massive XRP Transfer The movement of 300 million XRP from Ripple to an unknown wallet, as reported by Whale Alert, is a significant event by volume and value. While the transaction itself is confirmed on the blockchain, the precise reason behind this large XRP transaction remains undisclosed. It could be linked to Ripple’s strategic business operations, such as funding ODL corridors, executing an institutional sale, or simply managing internal treasury movements. Until Ripple provides an official explanation, the crypto community will continue to analyze and speculate on the purpose and potential market effects of this substantial XRP transfer . Events like these underscore the importance of on-chain monitoring in the transparent yet often mysterious world of cryptocurrency.

But buyers emerged at around $94,000, halting the decline and allowing BTC to recover fast. Then, the coin started rising again, piercing through pivotal levels that had earlier served as resistance. Related Reading: Tether’s $1 Billion Mint Powers Tron — Is A Breakout Brewing? Key Resistance Levels Broken As Bulls Step In Bitcoin didn’t remain down for long. It broke above $94,600 and even broke a bearish trendline at around $94,755. That opened the doors for another break higher. It continued to breach above $96,500 and is now trading inching closer to the $97k level. The 100-hour Simple Moving Average is also below the current price, which is generally a bullish indicator for momentum. Currently, traders are waiting to see whether BTC will break above $97,000. If that occurs, the next target might be $98,800 or even $100,000. This price level has been a top target for most traders in the last few months. Whales Add Over 81,000 BTC In Six Weeks Large holders, or whales, are gaining confidence. Wallets that hold between 10 and 10,000 BTC have accumulated more than 81k BTC in the last six weeks. Such wallets tend to belong to institutions or long-term investors who prefer to buy when prices are relatively stable or low. 🐳 As May progresses, Bitcoin’s key stakeholders are mostly moving in the right direction if you’re rooting for $100K $BTC in the near future.

The difference in behavior between large and small holders is catching attention. In the past, similar trends have been followed by strong price surges. $734M In Shorts Wiped Out Many short sellers who were making bets on lower prices got caught out around $95,600. Coinglass analytics indicate that short positions exceeding $730 million were swept out when Bitcoin broke above that level. It had been resistance for days. But once buyers retook it, the price exploded and traded as high as $97,200. That move lifted morale among bullish traders and generated fresh momentum within the market. Further liquidations might occur if BTC continues to climb. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Gain Over $300 Billion From Companies In Next 5 Years, Analysts Say Derivatives Reflect Bulls in Charge The derivatives market is likewise turning bullish. Coinglass indicates long positions come out at approximately $2.14 billion, versus $2 billion in short positions. That discrepancy won’t be gigantic, but it’s sufficient to tip the balance towards the bulls. If Bitcoin cannot remain above $97,750, then it could fall slightly. Support is approximately $96,650. If that gives way, then it could move down to $95,400 or $95,200. Further support awaits at $94,400 and then $93,100. But for now, the sentiment is upbeat, and everyone is watching that $100K barrier.

This marks a departure from earlier resistance and comes as part of an updated policy to facilitate banks’ involvement in crypto-asset custody services. The OCC’s clarification, released on Wednesday, extends the scope of services banks can provide, including the ability to outsource crypto custody and execution services to third parties. However, these services must meet the OCC’s stringent safety and soundness criteria to ensure proper oversight and risk management. OCC-regulated banks may buy and sell assets held in custody and are permitted to outsource bank-permissible crypto-asset activities, including custody and execution services. https://t.co/0ScQdgNaS6 pic.twitter.com/J5dEkx4WUL — OCC (@USOCC) May 7, 2025 New OCC Regulations Allow Banks to Act as Custodians for Digital Assets This shift is in line with the OCC’s previous guidance, which recognized that crypto-asset custody is an extension of traditional banking activities. Banks, under this new framework, can act as custodians of digital assets, offering services such as exchange facilitation, trade execution and asset management. Additionally, they may use sub-custodians to handle these tasks, provided there are adequate internal controls in place. The move is a big step towards mainstreaming cryptocurrency within the banking sector. By offering a regulatory framework for crypto custody, the OCC aims to integrate digital assets into traditional banking services, thus ensuring both innovation and protection for customers. With these clarifications, the OCC has further enabled national banks to operate within the evolving digital asset market, ensuring that they remain compliant with legal and financial regulations while meeting customer demands. Banks Set to Expand Crypto Services Under Clearer Regulatory Oversight This development comes as the regulatory landscape around cryptocurrencies continues to evolve, with increasing pressure to create clear guidelines for traditional financial institutions. For banks, this means a broader role in managing crypto assets, potentially enhancing their revenue streams while adhering to the required risk management practices. The regulatory backing gives them the confidence to explore crypto services without fear of regulatory uncertainty, fostering a safer and more integrated approach to crypto-asset transactions. Despite earlier hesitations, the OCC’s decision signals a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency within the mainstream financial system. However, the full implementation of these policies will depend on how effectively banks can balance innovation with the safeguards required to protect investors and maintain financial stability.

According to CNBC , Bailey has already secured $300m in funding for the venture, while The Information reported that he is still seeking the funds through private equity and convertible debt. This funding package is expected to consist of $200m in equity and $100m in convertible debt, with plans to use the capital for acquisitions and investments. David Bailey, who advised Trump on crypto policy, is raising $300M to launch a publicly traded bitcoin investment firm, aiming to follow the successful path of Strategy.

As a result, Bailey’s company, Nakamoto, will merge with an existing Nasdaq-listed firm. The merger announcement is expected early next week. Following that, the company’s public listing is anticipated later this summer. Bailey’s company, named after the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, will focus on acquiring and holding Bitcoin. This strategy will provide a new avenue for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. Moreover, Nakamoto plans to expand globally. Specifically, it aims to invest in companies across countries like Brazil, Thailand, and South Africa. Nakamoto Attracts High-Profile Investors and Advisory Board to Back Bitcoin Strategy The venture has already attracted a lineup of prominent investors. It will also feature a high-profile advisory board. Bitcoin investment firms like Nakamoto raise significant capital through a combination of equity and debt. This capital is used to buy and hold Bitcoin, offering investors an indirect way to bet on the asset’s price fluctuations. Bailey’s approach is aligned with the strategy popularized by Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). In 2020, Saylor began converting the company’s cash reserves into Bitcoin. This shift transformed MicroStrategy into a Bitcoin holding company. As a result, its stock price soared alongside Bitcoin’s value. Today, MicroStrategy ranks among the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin. This sets the stage for Nakamoto to follow suit and capitalize on the growing demand for Bitcoin investment opportunities.

The deal, set to be revealed early morning during a press event inside the Oval, would be the first confirmed agreement since Trump hit dozens of US trading partners with broad tariffs. The president didn’t name the country in his Wednesday night post, but the announcement confirms that Britain is the first. Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Big News Conference tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., The Oval Office, concerning a MAJOR TRADE DEAL WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF A BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY. THE FIRST OF MANY!!!” That’s all the White House has said so far. Trump reboots trade strategy with UK at the front No other country has landed a deal yet. Britain now becomes the first, and the stakes are high. It’s still not clear if the deal is completely finalized or if Thursday’s announcement is just the start of formal talks. Either way, this is the first public outcome of Trump’s economic pressure tactics. The UK has been chasing this for years. After Brexit, it lost easy access to European markets and needed new trade routes. A deal with the US was a top priority, but nothing came from the talks under Joe Biden. Things started moving again this year when Prime Minister Keir Starmer met Trump in February at the White House, bringing a formal invite from King Charles III for Trump to make another state visit to Britain. Trump’s interest isn’t new. His team tried to negotiate with the UK in his first term, but never closed the deal. Since getting back in office, Trump’s trade officials have been chasing agreements with other countries like India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam. None of those have gone public yet. But on Tuesday, Trump made clear he isn’t in a rush. “We don’t have to sign deals,” he said. “We could sign 25 deals right now, Howard, if we wanted to. They have to sign deals with us.” He was talking to Howard Lutnick, the Commerce Secretary. This trade move is different from the long, full-scope agreements that go through Congress. Those take more than a year and cover nearly every industry. Trump’s approach leans toward smaller, quick-to-announce agreements. These don’t require votes in Washington. In his first term, Trump replaced NAFTA, reworked a deal with South Korea, and signed a bunch of what he called “mini-deals,” targeting just a few sectors like farm goods or tech taxes. Even as the UK was closing this new deal with the US, it also signed a trade pact with India on Tuesday. That agreement lowers tariffs between the two and gives British companies better access to India’s insurance and banking sectors. It followed nearly three years of talks. British officials are also still negotiating with the European Union, meaning the country is moving on multiple fronts to build stronger trade ties after Brexit left it exposed. But the deal with Trump might be the most high-profile one yet — not because of the details, but because of what it says politically.

44310536,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158319,1746681657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Anthropic Unveils Powerful Claude AI Web Search API for Developers,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/anthropic-claude-web-search/,"In the fast-evolving world where artificial intelligence intersects with technology and even touches on areas relevant to cryptocurrency markets – particularly concerning data analysis and automation – staying updated is key. A significant development comes from Anthropic, which has just rolled out a new API that grants its Claude AI models the capability to search the web. Anthropic Enhances Claude AI with Real-Time Data Anthropic announced the launch of an API designed to allow developers to integrate web search functionality directly into applications powered by their Claude AI models. This means Claude can now access and process current information from the internet, moving beyond its pre-trained knowledge cut-off date. According to Anthropic, this enhancement is a direct response to the growing need for AI models to provide users with the most up-to-date, real-world data. This move aligns with a broader trend among AI companies seeking to augment their models’ capabilities to attract a wider range of users and use cases. Just last week, Anthropic also introduced a tool for connecting applications to Claude and expanded its “deep research” feature, enabling Claude to search enterprise accounts, websites, and other specific data sources. What the Web Search API Means for Developers The introduction of the web search API is a game-changer for developers building applications with Claude. Previously, getting current information into a Claude-powered app required developers to manage their own data pipelines or search infrastructure. With this new API, that complexity is significantly reduced. Here’s how it works when the web search feature is enabled via the API: Claude uses its reasoning abilities to determine if a user’s request would benefit from up-to-date or specialized web information. If a web search is deemed necessary, Claude automatically generates search queries. It retrieves search results, analyzes the content, and synthesizes an answer. Crucially, Claude provides citations for the information it retrieves from the web. The model can refine its search strategy, conducting multiple searches based on previous results to get a more comprehensive understanding. Developers also have granular control over the feature. They can customize search behavior, specify domains that Claude is allowed or not allowed to search, and even enable or prohibit web search use at an organizational level. Integrating Web Search into AI Models The ability to integrate web search into AI models like Claude is a significant step towards creating more dynamic and reliable AI assistants. For instance, Anthropic is already bringing this capability to Claude Code, its tool designed to assist developers with coding tasks. With web search enabled, Claude Code can access the latest API documentation, technical articles, and information on development libraries and tools, ensuring it provides assistance based on current standards and practices. This enhancement allows AI models to tackle tasks that require knowledge of recent events, current market data (potentially relevant for crypto analysis), or rapidly changing technical specifications, making them more valuable in a wider array of applications. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Claude AI and its Ecosystem Anthropic’s launch of the web search API for Claude AI is a notable development that empowers developers to build more sophisticated and informed applications. By giving Claude the ability to access and process real-time information from the web, Anthropic is enhancing the model’s utility and expanding the possibilities for its use across various industries. This move underscores the ongoing innovation in the AI space, constantly pushing the boundaries of what these powerful models can achieve.

44310887,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158320,1746682244,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Breakthrough AI Drug Evaluation: OpenAI and FDA Discuss Speeding Approvals,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-fda-ai-evaluation/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology and health, a significant discussion is underway that could impact how quickly new treatments reach patients. OpenAI, a leader in artificial intelligence research, is reportedly in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the potential use of AI for AI drug evaluation . For those following the intersection of tech and industry, this development signals a growing interest in leveraging advanced AI capabilities in highly regulated sectors like healthcare. Why is AI Drug Evaluation a Hot Topic? Traditional drug development is a notoriously lengthy and expensive process. Bringing a new drug from initial research to market can often take over a decade. A significant portion of this timeline is dedicated to clinical trials and the subsequent regulatory review and evaluation by bodies like the FDA. Accelerating this latter phase, the evaluation process, could dramatically reduce the time patients wait for potentially life-saving therapies. This is where AI drug evaluation comes into play. AI models have the potential to process and analyze vast amounts of complex data – from clinical trial results to patient data and scientific literature – far faster than human reviewers alone. The goal isn’t to replace human expertise but to augment it, providing insights and flagging critical information more efficiently. What’s Happening Between OpenAI FDA ? Reports indicate that OpenAI officials have met with the FDA to explore how the agency could utilize AI to expedite the drug evaluation timeline. While drug development involves many stages where AI could theoretically be applied (like drug discovery or trial design), these discussions reportedly focus on accelerating the final stages of the process – the regulatory review itself. According to sources, the talks have included discussions around a project potentially named ‘cderGPT’. This name suggests an AI tool specifically designed for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the division within the FDA responsible for regulating prescription and over-the-counter drugs in the U.S. There were also unconfirmed reports mentioning associates from Elon Musk’s DOGE being part of the talks. Given ‘DOGE’ typically refers to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, this detail is likely a misunderstanding or typo and should be treated with caution. Discussions would more plausibly involve individuals associated with Musk’s AI or health-focused ventures like xAI or Neuralink, if true. The Potential Impact on Drug Development Speed The primary objective of this potential collaboration is to increase drug development speed , specifically at the regulatory bottleneck. Imagine the ability to shave months or even years off the evaluation period for critical medications. This could mean faster access for patients to treatments for diseases like cancer, Alzheimer’s, or rare genetic conditions. Potential benefits of integrating AI into FDA evaluation include: Faster processing of application documents. Improved identification of safety signals or efficacy trends in trial data. More efficient comparison of new drugs to existing treatments. Reducing the administrative burden on human reviewers. However, it’s crucial to understand that AI is not a magic bullet. While it can accelerate data processing, the final decision-making and nuanced evaluation require human judgment and expertise. Challenges and Considerations for AI in Healthcare Regulation While the promise of faster evaluations is exciting, significant challenges remain when integrating AI in healthcare regulation, particularly at an agency like the FDA: AI Reliability and ‘Black Box’ Problem: AI models, especially complex deep learning systems, can sometimes arrive at conclusions through processes that are not easily understood or explained (the ‘black box’ issue). For regulatory decisions impacting public health, transparency and explainability are paramount. Validation and Trust: How can the FDA validate that an AI tool is consistently accurate, unbiased, and reliable when evaluating sensitive drug data? Building trust in AI outputs is essential before widespread adoption. Data Privacy and Security: Handling vast amounts of confidential clinical trial data requires robust security measures. Regulatory Frameworks: Existing regulatory frameworks were not designed with advanced AI in mind. New guidelines and standards will be needed to govern the use of AI in this context. Addressing these challenges will require close collaboration between AI developers, regulatory experts, and the pharmaceutical industry. The Future of FDA AI Integration The discussions between OpenAI and the FDA represent an important step towards formalizing the role of AI in drug regulation. While a project like ‘cderGPT’ is likely in its very early stages, the fact that such conversations are happening at this level indicates a serious commitment to exploring these possibilities. The success of integrating FDA AI tools will depend on rigorous testing, validation, and the establishment of clear guidelines to ensure safety, efficacy, and fairness in the evaluation process. This collaboration could serve as a model for how other regulatory bodies worldwide might approach the integration of AI into their critical functions, ultimately benefiting public health by potentially accelerating access to new and improved medical treatments.

This uptick in profit-taking mirrors investor behavior typically seen during the late stages of a bull market. Bitcoin Profit-Taking Rises – A Cause For Worry? Bitcoin’s 7-day moving average (MA) net realized profit/loss has mostly remained positive since early 2024. The metric surged as high as $1 billion a day as the flagship cryptocurrency pushed towards new all-time highs (ATH) last year. Although BTC experienced a sharp downturn between March and April 2025, profit-taking remained robust as Bitcoin recovered most of its losses. The asset is currently trading in the mid-$90,000 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashing Pre-Rally Signals Seen Before Major 2024 Breakouts, Analyst Says CryptoQuant contributor Kripto Mevsimi noted that such strong realized profits – even as prices rise – typically signal a late-stage bull market. Drawing comparisons to the 2021 market cycle, Mevsimi pointed out that similar patterns preceded a local top. However, the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024 has altered the market structure to a great extent. That said, investor psychology has remained the same in that profit-taking patterns still align with historical patterns, though now with greater speed and volume. Mevsimi shared several possible scenarios that may play out in the market. First, If realized profits remain high, the likelihood of a sharp correction increases. This may push BTC back toward $90,000. On the contrary, if profit-taking declines, it could indicate the start of a market cycle transition. Either way, short-term volatility is expected to rise. The post adds: The signal is not calling a full macro top, but it’s flashing a local caution zone. As always: zoom out, and follow behavior — not just price. BTC Could See A Temporary Pullback Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez warned that BTC may retest the $97,700 resistance ahead of today’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which could trigger another short-term pullback. Additionally, Bitcoin’s supply scarcity narrative is being questioned. While exchange reserves continue to dwindle, recent on-chain data suggests a supply squeeze is unlikely in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surpasses Realized Price Of Recent Buyers — Rally Incoming Or Double Top? In similar news, Bitcoin’s demand momentum is yet to recover from negative territory. Recent data shows that market participants are still favoring short-term speculation over holding BTC for the long-term.

While he didn’t provide exact figures, he confirmed it’s a major personal investment. Eric’s remarks echo Donald Trump’s growing support for crypto . The president has stated multiple times that he wants crypto to succeed, especially as a competitive edge against China. He even praised Bitcoin’s resilience during April’s financial market dip, saying it held up better than traditional markets. Trump’s administration has already made moves to back crypto beyond just words. In March, Trump signed executive orders to consolidate seized Bitcoin into a U.S. crypto reserve, halting government selloffs. He also ordered the creation of a broader crypto stockpile, which includes altcoins, from forfeited assets. The aim is to maximize value without draining taxpayer funds. U.S. Crypto Reserve in the Making To further support the crypto sector, Trump appointed Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair . Atkins is tasked with delivering clear, crypto-friendly regulations, a sharp contrast to the previous administration’s more skeptical approach. Even before his presidency resumed, Trump made headlines with NFT launches and the meme coin TRUMP. Though the coin’s value soared briefly to a $75 billion market cap, it later crashed over 90%. Trump, however, denied any financial involvement, insisting he wasn’t profiting from the hype. Whether through executive orders, regulatory changes, or direct ownership, the Trumps are going all-in on Bitcoin, betting big on a crypto-powered future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Finally Approaches $100K After Almost 100 Days, New ATHS Soon? , Trump Family Under Fire Since returning to the office, President Trump’s conflicts of interest have reportedly escalated, with a spotlight on his ties to the crypto firm World Liberty Financial.

Trump said in a May 7 Truth Social post that a “major trade deal” with a “big, and highly respected, country” would be announced on May 8, which The New York Times reported would be the UK, citing three people familiar with the plans. Bitcoin inches toward $100,000 When Trump published his post, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at around $97,759 and has since crept up closer to the psychological $100,000 price level to trade at $99,140 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin is trading at $99,140 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap Several Bitcoiners and analysts are crediting the rally toward $100,000 to speculation surrounding the trade deal. Australian crypto exchange BTC Markets’ head of finance, Charlie Sherry, told Cointelegraph that “as everyone else was looking down and calling for lower,” Bitcoin’s price did the opposite. “As is often the case in markets, just when consensus leans heavily bearish, price bottoms form and new market structures start to emerge.” Sherry said it is possible that the trade deal is already getting priced into Bitcoin. “While we may see psychological resistance at the $100k mark, it seems inevitable Bitcoin puts another zero on the board,” Sherry added. FOMO21 co-founder Neil Jacobs said on X that the Bitcoin rally was primarily due to Trump’s announcement. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said the incoming trade deal “means odds are increasing we hit new all-time highs in 2025.” Bitcoin reached its current all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20, just hours before Trump’s inauguration. Pandora CEO Sahib Anandsongvit said that he “can’t stop to think” how Bitcoin was $80,000 only a few weeks ago, pointing out Bitcoin’s $98,000 price at the time of the post and reiterating Trump’s looming trade deal. Bitcoin last traded at the $80,000 price level on April 11 and only reclaimed $90,000 on April 22. Related: Bitcoin returns to $98K as Fed holds rates steady despite Trump’s demand Trump’s post came just hours after the US Federal Reserve announced that it would keep interest rates at 4.25% to 4.50% despite mounting pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Bitcoin has not hit $100,000 since Feb. 1 after Trump proposed import tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Meanwhile, crypto market participants appear to be more bullish on the overall market, with the Crypto & Fear Index reading a “Greed” score of 65. Bitcoin’s 3% increase over the past 24 hours has led to approximately $96 million in short positions liquidated, according to CoinGlass data.

The approval comes days after Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed another crypto bill – the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act ( S.B. 1025 ). This legislation would have allowed the state treasurer and retirement system to invest 10% of available funds in crypto. Arizona’s House Bill 2749 is ‘Budget-Neutral’ Governor Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law on Wednesday. This marks Arizona the second US state to create a formal framework for holding crypto, after New Hampshire, which enacted legislation to allow government investments in cryptocurrency reserves. “Arizona just showed the country how to turn forgotten assets into a fortress against inflation,” Dennis Porter, CEO of Satoshi Action Fund, said in an announcement. ARIZONA SIGNS STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE INTO LAW! pic.twitter.com/xQXsm2fEXQ — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) May 8, 2025 The move is a “win for fiscal responsibility,” he said. Additionally, the state establishes a “forward-thinking, budget-neutral way to future-proof its treasury.” In a separate thread, Porter said that the bill’s budget-neutral feature makes it different from the one previously vetoed. “There were 4 bills. The Gov liked this one the most,” he wrote. State Takes Ownership of Unclaimed Crypto for Three Years Per the official release , assets are left abandoned if the rightful owner fails to respond to communications for three years. Therefore, the state’s qualified custodians are authorized to stake these crypto to earn rewards or receive airdrops. Further, these rewards earned on unclaimed crypto held for three years will be deposited into the new fund. The bill passed both Legislative chambers the bipartisan support and is championed by House Commerce Committee Chair Rep. Jeff Weninger. “This law ensures Arizona doesn’t leave value sitting on the table and puts us in a position to lead the country in how we secure, manage, and ultimately benefit from abandoned digital currency,” said Rep. Weninger. He further said that the structure protects property rights, respects ownership, and gives Arizona tools to account for a new category of value in the economy. “It’s exactly the kind of policy we should be leading on—modern, precise, and built with an understanding of where technology and finance are heading.” The post Arizona Governor Officially Enacts Bill to Create State-Managed Fund to Hold Unclaimed Crypto appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|Arizona|Bitcoin Reserve|Crypto bill,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-05-08 05:37:18

The announcement was made early Tuesday on the company’s official X account, stating unequivocally that Manche’s employment and affiliations had been terminated “effective immediately.” The firm has not yet named a successor or shared details regarding how it plans to restructure governance in the wake of the leadership shake-up. Report Uncovers Secret MOVE Token Deals Tied to Movement Labs The move comes in response to a recent investigative report, which exposed a series of undisclosed deals between Movement-affiliated entities and third-party market makers during the MOVE token’s launch phase. The report detailed the existence of so-called “shadow advisors,” covert payment arrangements, and hidden allocations of MOVE tokens—all of which pointed back to Manche. Manche had been suspended on May 2 , shortly after Coinbase delisted the MOVE token. Movement Labs has terminated Rushi Manche. Movement will continue under different leadership. Details on leadership changes and a revamped governance structure will be coming soon. — Movement (@movementlabsxyz) May 7, 2025 That delisting was prompted by increasing community scrutiny over transparency and operational practices at Movement Labs. The market reaction has been swift. MOVE tokens fell 8.5% in the 24 hours following Manche’s removal and are down 35% over the past week, reflecting broader investor unease. Market makers often play a crucial role in the early success of digital assets by providing liquidity and facilitating access to major exchanges. However, when misused, these partnerships can spell disaster. A mid-April analysis warned that mishandled market-making arrangements could undermine confidence and derail projects entirely. Rising Concerns Over Market Manipulation Notably, concerns about manipulation in crypto markets have grown in recent months. Data from summer 2024 revealed that as many as 78% of new token launches since April had suffered from problematic or poorly disclosed market-making deals. 3) Furthermore to make things clear – we are not a charity (or foundation ).

Creditors of defunct crypto lender Celsius Network alleged that Wintermute, a leading market maker, engaged in wash trading of the CEL token. Likewise, Fracture Labs filed a lawsuit in late 2024 accusing Jump Crypto of manipulating the value of its in-game token, DIO. Meanwhile, DWF Labs faced accusations of inflating trading volumes through undisclosed arrangements—allegations both it and Binance have denied. In response to growing concerns, U.S. regulators have ramped up enforcement, even launching a sting operation with a fake token to catch bad actors.

The latest news from the digital asset space brings a significant development: Galaxy Digital , a leading provider of financial services and investment management in the digital asset, blockchain, and cryptocurrency sectors, has joined forces with Zodia Custody , a reputable institutional-grade crypto custodian. What Does This Galaxy Digital and Zodia Custody Partnership Mean? This collaboration marks a crucial step in expanding institutional access to crypto opportunities, particularly in Europe. At its core, the partnership allows Zodia Custody’s institutional clients to directly access Galaxy Digital’s comprehensive staking services. This is a game-changer because it addresses one of the primary concerns for large financial institutions: maintaining control and security over their digital assets while participating in yield-generating activities like staking. Think of it this way: Institutions want the benefits of crypto (like potential yield from staking) but need the robust security and regulatory clarity they are accustomed to in traditional finance. Zodia Custody provides that secure, compliant foundation, and now, through this integration, they can seamlessly offer their clients access to Galaxy Digital’s proven staking infrastructure. Unlocking Institutional Crypto Staking Opportunities Institutional crypto adoption is a major theme shaping the market today. As more large players – asset managers, hedge funds, corporate treasuries – eye digital assets, the demand for secure, compliant, and scalable services grows exponentially. Staking, which involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the operations of a proof-of-stake blockchain network and earn rewards, has become a popular way for holders to generate passive income on their assets. However, institutional participation in staking has historically been challenging due to concerns around: Security: Protecting large sums of digital assets from theft or loss. Custody: Who holds the private keys? Institutions prefer qualified custodians. Compliance: Navigating complex and evolving regulatory landscapes across different jurisdictions. Operational Complexity: Setting up and managing staking infrastructure requires technical expertise. This partnership directly tackles these hurdles. Zodia Custody, with its backing from financial giants like Standard Chartered and Northern Trust, brings the institutional-grade security and compliance framework that its clients require. By integrating with Galaxy Digital, a firm with significant expertise in digital asset markets and staking operations (managing approximately $4.2 billion in staked assets), Zodia’s clients get access to staking rewards without having to move their assets out of Zodia’s secure custody environment. This is a significant benefit – earning yield while retaining asset custody . Why Zodia Custody and Galaxy Digital? The choice of partners here is strategic. Zodia Custody is known for its focus on regulatory compliance and security, building trust with traditional financial institutions. Their backing by major banks lends significant credibility in the institutional space. Galaxy Digital, on the other hand, brings deep expertise in digital asset markets and infrastructure. They are a major player, highlighted by their position as the top validator on the Solana network, one of the prominent proof-of-stake blockchains. Their extensive experience in managing staked assets provides the operational backbone needed to deliver reliable staking services. What’s Next for This Partnership and European Expansion? The initial focus of this collaboration is on enhancing staking services for Zodia’s European clientele. This aligns with Galaxy Digital’s broader strategy of expanding its footprint in the European market, recognizing the growing interest and potential for digital asset adoption in the region. Looking ahead, the partnership could pave the way for further joint initiatives. The report from The Block suggests potential future collaborations involving more complex financial products, such as exchange-traded products (ETPs) and various yield-bearing instruments built on digital assets. This indicates a shared vision to offer a wider range of institutional-grade crypto products and services, moving beyond just spot trading and basic custody. For Galaxy Digital, this partnership is also timely as the firm reportedly plans to uplist to the Nasdaq stock exchange in May. Such a move would likely increase its visibility and potentially attract more traditional investors, further solidifying its position as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights This partnership is more than just a news headline; it offers valuable insights into the evolving institutional crypto landscape: Custody is King (and Staking is the Queen): For institutions, secure and compliant custody is non-negotiable. The ability to stake assets while keeping them with a trusted custodian like Zodia removes a major barrier to entry. Partnerships Drive Innovation: Collaborations between specialized firms (custodians like Zodia and asset managers/service providers like Galaxy Digital) are essential for building the necessary infrastructure for institutional adoption. Europe is a Growth Market: Both firms are clearly targeting the European market, indicating significant potential for institutional digital asset growth in the region. Yield is a Key Driver: The demand for yield in a low-interest-rate environment (though rates have risen, the search for alternative yield persists) makes staking an attractive proposition for institutions, provided it can be accessed securely and compliantly. Future Products on the Horizon: Keep an eye on potential future offerings like ETPs and other structured products that leverage digital assets, facilitated by such partnerships. A Compelling Step Forward for Institutional Crypto The partnership between Galaxy Digital and Zodia Custody represents a significant and positive development for the institutional crypto market, particularly in Europe. By combining Zodia’s robust, compliant custody solutions with Galaxy Digital’s extensive staking expertise, the two firms are making it easier and safer for large financial institutions to participate in the yield opportunities offered by proof-of-stake networks. This collaboration not only enhances current offerings but also lays the groundwork for future innovation in institutional digital asset products. As institutional crypto continues its trajectory towards mainstream adoption, partnerships like this are fundamental to building the trusted infrastructure required for growth.

Wallet activity sparks rumors ahead of planned May 14 ecosystem update,https://crypto.news/is-binance-listing-pi-network-soon-wallet-activity-sparks-rumors-ahead-of-planned-may-14-ecosystem-update/,"Speculation around a possible Pi Network listing on Binance has picked up again after users spotted activity involving a wallet connected to the exchange. On May 7 onchain analyst Moon Jeff reported on X that small amounts of Pi Coin ( PI ) were observed moving through Binance’s Stellar deposit wallet. The wallet address, already associated with Binance in earlier transactions, appeared to be conducting test transfers, prompting fresh speculation about integration. https://twitter.com/cryptoad00/status/1920065139836924224?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The timing has drawn attention, although neither Binance nor the Pi Network team has provided an official confirmation. Pi Network is set to make a major announcement on May 14, which many believe could include details on new listings. On May 8, the Pi Core Team posted on X, hinting at upcoming ecosystem updates without offering specifics. A Pi ecosystem announcement will be released on May 14.

What adds weight to the speculation is the specific wallet involved, which is used by Binance to handle Stellar-based assets. The address was used for testing transactions during Pi Network’s early testnet phase, when it still ran on a version of the Stellar Consensus Protocol. Even though Pi now has its own mainnet , it still shares many key design elements with Stellar. Because of this similarity, Binance’s Stellar-based deposit infrastructure may still be compatible with Pi Coin, making it a logical choice for internal testing involving deposit or settlement functionality. PI is currently listed on smaller exchanges like OKX and Bitget but remains absent from major platforms like Binance and Coinbase. A past community vote on Binance showed that 86% of users support a PI listing, adding to current hopes. Market data points to a resurgence of interest. PI is up 8% in the last 24 hours, trading at around $0.63 as of press time. According to the crypto.news price tracker , trading volume has risen by 119% to $117.5 million. Technical signs point to a slight bullish trend. Short-term moving averages suggest buy signals, and the relative strength index and MACD are both on an upward trend. The price may rise towards $0.75 if it breaks above $0.68. PI Coin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news However, PI continues to face certain risks. More than 1.4 billion PI tokens, valued at over $850 million, will be unlocked over the next year, including 231 million this month alone. Without new exchange listings or rising demand, this could put pressure on prices. If PI loses key support, a drop toward $0.59 or lower is possible.

This move, reported by Reuters, signals a potential recalibration of Ukraine’s economic alignment and could have wide-ranging implications. Why Consider a Hryvnia Euro Peg Now? For years, the Ukrainian Hryvnia has often been managed with a view towards the US dollar, reflecting historical trade ties and the dollar’s role as a global reserve currency. However, the ongoing geopolitical situation and Ukraine’s aspirations for closer integration with the European Union are powerful drivers behind the potential pivot to a Hryvnia euro peg . Several factors contribute to this consideration: Increased Trade with the EU: The European Union is Ukraine’s largest trading partner. Pegging the Hryvnia to the euro could reduce exchange rate volatility for Ukrainian exporters and importers dealing with the Eurozone, making trade smoother and more predictable. EU Candidacy Status: As Ukraine progresses on its path towards potential EU membership, aligning its monetary policy and currency framework with the Eurozone makes strategic sense. It could be seen as a step towards future economic integration. Macroeconomic Stability: Linking to a major currency like the euro, backed by the European Central Bank (ECB), might be perceived as enhancing the credibility and stability of the Ukraine currency in the long term, particularly in the current volatile environment. Reduced Dependence on the Dollar: Diversifying away from a primary focus on the US dollar could be part of a broader strategy to strengthen economic sovereignty and resilience. Impacts on the Ukraine Economy A shift towards a Hryvnia euro peg would not be merely a technical adjustment; it would have tangible effects on the Ukraine economy . While aiming for stability, the transition and the peg itself present both opportunities and challenges. Potential Benefits: Boost to EU Trade: As mentioned, reduced currency risk could stimulate trade and investment flows between Ukraine and the Eurozone. Inflation Control: Pegging to a stable currency like the euro could potentially help anchor inflation expectations, although this depends heavily on domestic economic management. Investor Confidence: A clear commitment to aligning with the euro might be viewed positively by foreign investors from the Eurozone, potentially attracting capital. Potential Challenges: Loss of Monetary Autonomy: Pegging limits the National Bank of Ukraine’s ability to use exchange rate policy independently to respond to domestic economic shocks. Interest rate policy would also need to be carefully managed to maintain the peg. Vulnerability to Eurozone Shocks: The Ukraine economy would become more susceptible to economic fluctuations and policy decisions originating within the Eurozone. Implementation Risks: The transition itself would require careful management to avoid market disruption and maintain confidence in the Ukraine currency . How This Affects the Forex Market Ukraine The forex market Ukraine operates within would see significant changes if a euro peg is implemented. The dynamics of Hryvnia trading would shift. Currently, the USD/UAH pair is a primary focus. Under a euro peg, the EUR/UAH pair would become central. The National Bank would likely intervene in the forex market Ukraine to maintain the exchange rate within a specified band relative to the euro. This would mean buying Hryvnia with euros when the Hryvnia weakens against the euro, and selling Hryvnia for euros when it strengthens. Traders and businesses operating in the forex market Ukraine would need to adjust their strategies, focusing more on EUR/UAH movements and less on USD/UAH, although cross rates would still be relevant. The success of maintaining such a peg in the forex market Ukraine would depend on several factors: The level at which the peg is set. The National Bank’s foreign currency reserves (especially euro reserves). The credibility of the commitment to the peg. Overall macroeconomic performance and capital flows. Pursuing Currency Stability : Benefits and Challenges The primary stated goal behind considering a Hryvnia euro peg is likely to enhance currency stability . In times of conflict and economic uncertainty, a stable exchange rate can provide a crucial anchor, helping businesses plan and protecting citizens’ purchasing power (at least in terms of imported goods from the peg currency area). However, achieving and maintaining currency stability through a peg is not without its difficulties. As seen in the challenges section regarding the Ukraine economy, it requires disciplined fiscal and monetary policy. If domestic inflation rates diverge significantly from the Eurozone, or if external shocks hit Ukraine disproportionately, maintaining the peg can become challenging and costly, potentially leading to a build-up of pressure for a devaluation or revaluation. Historically, currency pegs have had mixed success globally. They can provide stability when economic conditions are aligned, but can also lead to severe crises if the peg becomes unsustainable due to fundamental economic imbalances. Looking Ahead: The Future of Ukraine Currency The discussion around potentially linking the Ukraine currency to the euro is still in its exploratory phase, according to the reports. It represents a strategic contemplation of Ukraine’s future economic direction and its place in the global financial system. The decision will involve careful weighing of the economic benefits of closer Eurozone alignment against the challenges of surrendering monetary flexibility. For those following the broader financial markets, including cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is crucial. Changes in major fiat currencies and their relationships can influence global liquidity, capital flows, and risk sentiment, which in turn can impact digital asset markets. The future trajectory of the Ukraine currency , whether it remains managed against the dollar or shifts towards the euro, will be a key indicator of Ukraine’s economic strategy and its deepening ties with Europe.

High Price : $2,200 Low Price : $1,600 Average Price : $1,800 Why ETH Price Will Surge in Q2-2025? Pectra Upgrade Launching May 7: Ethereum will roll out the Pectra upgrade, a merge of the Prague and Electra upgrades. Vitalik Buterin Proposes RISC-V : Ethereum’s co-founder has suggested replacing the EVM bytecode with the RISC-V instruction set, making Ethereum more adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. Base Layer Activity Drops: Despite innovations, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees, with average gas fees at $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. This has raised sustainability concerns but is also making the network more accessible. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 If Ethereum manages to stay above this support, it could gradually rise towards $2,400 or more by the end of 2025, especially if the market becomes more positive. However, Ethereum will face resistance around $2,500, so it may take time to break through this level. The Ethereum price is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and form higher highs. Furthermore, with increased adoption, newer upgrades, and network growth, the ETH coin price can smash the $5k mark and hit a new all-time high of $5,925. Conversely, rising uncertainty or any unfavorable global economic events could pull the ETH price toward its annual low of $2,917. Considering the market sentiments, the average price could settle at around $3,392.

Perhaps the most notable reason behind this surge is a big teaser published by the Core Team on X. It’s safe to say that PI’s price trajectory was quite painful for a long time. Even though the asset bounced off its all-time low at $0.4 marked on April 5, it has still struggled to post a meaningful recovery. Its price failed to recapture the momentum of most of the crypto market, where even larger-cap alts soared impressively. PI spent the majority of the past seven days below $0.6. However, it finally recorded an impressive uptick on a daily scale. Its price is up by roughly 7% in one of the more notable green candles in about a month. Thus, the current price tag of $0.62 means that PI now sits at a two-week peak. PI Token Price. Source: CoinGecko While one of the more probable reasons behind today’s price surge could be attributed to the overall market resurgance , there’s another one that got the community talking. The official X channel of Pi Network, with over $4.3 million followers, teased a big “ecosystem announcement,” which will be revealed next week. A Pi ecosystem announcement will be released on May 14. Tune in to find out what’s coming next! pic.twitter.com/5jn7m5mlmD — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) May 7, 2025 The team didn’t provide any further details, but speculations went rampant. One of the popular X users, often commenting on Pi Network-related stuff – Moon Jeff – said Binance was seen to simulate PI deposits and withdrawals, which could lead to an eventual listing. Recall that the world’s largest crypto exchange held a community vote a few months back to determine whether its users want to see PI on its platform. The final results were overwhelmingly in favor of a PI listing, but there’s not much information on the topic since then.

Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza will dominate discussions, but North Korea’s increasing cyber threats and crypto hacks have become a major concern requiring a coordinated international response, Bloomberg reported on May 7, citing people familiar with the plans. The people said North Korea’s nefarious cyber operations are alarming, as the stolen crypto has become a key funding source for the regime and its programs. North Korean-affiliated hacking groups such as the Lazarus Group have already stolen billions of dollars worth of crypto this year, including pulling off the $1.4 billion hack on Bybit in February, the largest ever for the crypto industry. North Korean-linked hackers also stole more than $1.3 billion through 47 crypto heists during 2024, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The US, Japan and South Korea warned in January that North Korea also deployed tech workers to infiltrate crypto companies as insider threats. North Korea’s crypto-related hacking activity by year. Source: Chainalysis North Korean “information technology (IT) workers also present an insider threat to private sector partners,” the statement read. The illicit proceeds from these high-profile hacks have helped the hermit kingdom circumvent international sanctions and fund its weapons development programs, according to a US Treasury report in September. Related: North Korean crypto attacks rising in sophistication, actors — Paradigm In April, a group affiliated with Lazarus set up three shell companies , with two in the US, to deliver malware to unsuspecting users and scam crypto developers. Attempt to infiltrate crypto exchange Earlier this month, crypto exchange Kraken detailed how it foiled an attempt by a North Korean hacker to infiltrate its organization. Kraken’s chief security officer, Nick Percoco, conducted trap identity verification tests that the candidate failed, confirming the deception. Cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and blockchain security researcher, Heiner Garcia, also uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected North Korean operative, who accidentally shared details that linked him to the nation’s crypto scams.

However, the firm missed revenue expectations, as income dropped amid declining mining yields and a shift in business strategy. According to the company’s May 7 earnings release , total revenue for Q1 reached $79.5 million, falling short of Zacks analyst estimates by over 8%. This marked a significant decline from the $179.3 million Core Scientific posted during the same period last year. Core Scientific’s Q1 Revenue Dominated by Self-Mining at $67.2M The bulk of its earnings came from $67.2 million in self-mining revenue, while hosted mining and colocation contributed $3.8 million and $8.6 million, respectively. The revenue shortfall follows the April 2024 Bitcoin halving, which cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively reducing mining income. Core Scientific also cited its ongoing operational transition toward high-performance computing (HPC) hosting—especially for artificial intelligence applications—as a contributing factor to the revenue dip. Still, some losses were mitigated by favorable market conditions. Bitcoin’s average price rose 74% during the quarter, and the firm benefited from a 33% reduction in power costs due to lower energy rates and improved efficiency. A key part of Core Scientific’s future growth strategy is its pivot to AI-focused infrastructure. In February, the company secured a $1.2 billion agreement with AI firm CoreWeave to expand data center capacity. This move is expected to significantly bolster colocation revenue, with projections pointing to an annualized figure of $360 million by 2026. Core Scientific has announced its First Quarter 2025 Results! – On track to deliver 250MW of billable capacity to CoreWeave by the end of this year and anticipate entering 2026 with annualized colocation revenue of approximately $360 million. – First tranche of 8MW of billable… pic.twitter.com/cHt5xSA74Y — Core Scientific (@Core_Scientific) May 7, 2025 CEO Adam Sullivan called Q1 an “inflection point” for the company, emphasizing its strategic positioning within the rapidly growing demand for high-performance data services. “We’re at the center of one of the most important shifts in modern computing,” Sullivan said in a statement. Shares in Core Scientific (CORZ) closed down 1% at $8.90 on May 7 but rose to $9.24 in after-hours trading. The shift to HPC is gaining momentum across the crypto mining sector. Companies like Hive Digital, Hut 8, Iris Energy, and TeraWulf have all begun reallocating mining resources toward AI infrastructure, signaling a broader trend reshaping the future of digital asset operations. Bitcoin Mining’s Sustainable Energy Usage Rises to 52% A recent study from Cambridge University shows that sustainable energy now powers 52.4% of Bitcoin mining , a significant increase from 37.6% reported in 2022. According to the report, 42.6% of Bitcoin mining’s sustainable energy comes from renewables like wind and hydropower, while 9.8% is sourced from nuclear energy. Natural gas has now overtaken coal as the largest energy contributor to Bitcoin mining, with usage rising to 38.2%, compared to 25% in 2022. Coal’s share, meanwhile, has fallen sharply to 8.9% from 36.6%. The United States became a global leader in Bitcoin mining following China’s 2021 crackdown on the crypto industry. With cheap electricity and strong capital markets, American mining firms quickly gained dominance, and the election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump initially fueled optimism for continued growth.

With this new service , companies can hold, receive, and hold US-dollar stablecoin account balances, similar to how a traditional fiat bank account works.” The accounts will support USDC and USDB, a newer stablecoin issued by Bridge, a lending platform for stablecoins that Stripe acquired earlier this year. These multi-currency accounts allow users to hold GBP, EUR, and USD funds. By offering a more secure way to store value, the financial services firm enables businesses—especially those in regions with fragile banking infrastructure—to transact more easily globally. Stripe expands its role to become a global financial network Stripe built its reputation by helping online businesses accept credit card payments, but this new offering signals a significant evolution in its vision. With the introduction of stablecoin accounts, the firm emphasizes that it’s no longer just a payment processor—it’s laying the foundation for a seamless, borderless global financial system. This launch comes at a time when stablecoins are increasingly seen as a store of value and a medium of exchange, especially in regions without critical financial and communication infrastructure. This transition puts Stripe in a digital financial ecosystem where companies can not only take payments but also hold money, make vendor payments, manage treasury operations, and now, do it all with fiat and crypto assets. John Collison, co-founder and president of Stripe, pointed to persistent problems like invoice fraud, phishing attacks, and splintered payment rails. He argues that the firm’s advancement into stablecoins presents a safer, more productive, and programmable future for business finance. For example, stablecoins, which were once mainly the domain of crypto traders, are increasingly viewed as a tool for real-world commerce. They offer speedy settlement, lower costs, and protection against swings in the value of a currency — particularly helpful in markets susceptible to hyperinflation or banking instability. Bridge , Stripe’s in-house stablecoin platform, is the core premise behind the new service. Bridge facilitates currency exchange among regular businesses who want to operate across crypto and fiat payment rail without fearing what’s happening under the hood. Ramp and Visa team up with Stripe to streamline stablecoin use Corporate partners are already embracing Stripe’s entry into stablecoins. Ramp, a fast-growing startup that sells corporate cards, is one of the first to offer the product. Ramp is launching corporate cards backed by stablecoin to meet companies’ demand for faster settlement times, reduced FX fees, and protection against local currency depreciation. These cards will connect to Ramp’s digital wallets, with Stripe’s Bridge providing behind-the-scenes currency conversions. A partnership with global payments giant Visa also backs the effort. Visa will facilitate broadening the reach of these stablecoin cards, permitting companies to transact everywhere Visa is accepted, even if the backend payment uses stablecoins. This partnership is one piece of Stripe’s overall strategy to transform itself into a platform for programmable, interoperable money. In addition to its stablecoin work, Stripe is entering the artificial intelligence world. At Stripe Sessions, the company also introduced a new AI tool that developers can use to integrate AI-powered agents into apps. These agents can make user purchases — features such as automatically turning to-do list items into one-click, AI-initiated purchases could be made possible. Stripe will also become the key payment partner for Visa’s AI agent program. Gaybrick described artificial intelligence and stablecoins as the “twin revolutions,” noting that AI is transforming how people live and work, while stablecoins represent the first truly global and fully programmable form of money ever seen.

44311845,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158323,1746684013,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bernstein Warns: Charles Schwab & Morgan Stanley Face Fierce Crypto Market Battle as Latecomers,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/charles-schwab-crypto-challenge/,"Major financial players like Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley are finally stepping into the cryptocurrency arena, a move long anticipated by the market. However, a recent Bernstein report offers a sobering perspective: they might be arriving a bit late to the party, facing significant crypto market competition . Bernstein Report: Charles Schwab & Morgan Stanley Enter the Crypto Market According to analysts at Bernstein, the entry of financial giants like Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley into the crypto sector marks a significant moment for institutional adoption. Charles Schwab recently made waves by announcing plans to offer spot trading services for Bitcoin and Ethereum later this year. Not to be left behind, Morgan Stanley is also reportedly integrating cryptocurrency trading services onto its popular online securities platform, E-Trade. While their entry is noteworthy, Bernstein’s analysis points out a crucial challenge: their timing. Compared to established crypto-native platforms, these traditional powerhouses are considered latecomers. Navigating Fierce Crypto Market Competition The cryptocurrency landscape isn’t an empty field waiting for Wall Street giants to claim their territory. It’s a bustling marketplace with formidable competitors who have spent years building their infrastructure, user base, and brand loyalty. Platforms like: Coinbase: A leading US-based exchange with a large retail and institutional client base. Kraken: Another long-standing exchange known for its security and range of trading options. Robinhood: Popular for its user-friendly interface and early integration of crypto trading alongside stocks. Bernstein analysts emphasize that these early movers have gained a significant competitive advantage. They’ve refined their technology, navigated regulatory uncertainties, and cultivated communities of crypto enthusiasts. Competing directly with these established players on their home turf will be a challenge for Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley. They will need to quickly innovate and adapt to the unique demands and expectations of crypto users. The Advantage of Institutional Crypto Giants Despite their late start in the direct crypto trading space, the Bernstein report isn’t entirely bearish on the prospects for Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley. Traditional financial institutions possess inherent advantages that shouldn’t be underestimated, particularly when it comes to institutional crypto adoption and attracting a specific demographic. Their key strengths include: Massive Scale: Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley manage trillions in client assets and have millions of existing customers. This built-in user base is a significant asset. Deep Pockets: They have the financial resources to invest heavily in technology, security, and compliance infrastructure necessary for crypto operations. Established Trust and Brand Recognition: Decades of operation have built immense trust among investors, especially older generations who may be hesitant to use newer, unfamiliar crypto exchanges. Integrated Services: Offering crypto alongside traditional investments on platforms like E-Trade provides convenience for existing clients. Bernstein concedes that these factors give them the potential to take away market share, particularly from retail-focused platforms. Older investors, for instance, who are curious about Bitcoin or Ethereum but are uncomfortable opening new accounts on dedicated crypto exchanges, might find the option to trade within their existing Charles Schwab or Morgan Stanley accounts highly appealing. What This Means for the Future of Crypto Adoption The entry of Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley, even as latecomers, signals a broader trend of institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies. While they face stiff crypto market competition , their scale and existing client relationships position them to capture a significant segment of the market, especially from less crypto-savvy investors. The battle for market share in the US crypto space is heating up. While Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood have a head start, the entry of Wall Street heavyweights like Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley will undoubtedly reshape the competitive landscape and potentially accelerate mainstream adoption of digital assets. Conclusion: A Challenging but Promising Entry In summary, the Bernstein report provides a balanced view of Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley’s foray into crypto. They are indeed late compared to native crypto platforms and face a challenging environment of fierce competition. However, their inherent strengths – vast scale, deep resources, and established trust – give them a powerful edge, particularly in attracting traditional investors looking for a familiar gateway into the world of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Their entry is a significant validation for the crypto market, even as it intensifies the battle for users and trading volume.

The firm plans to join the growing list of companies pivoting to Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset thanks to rising institutional demand and macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin-backed lending is also gaining traction, with Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca pointing out the shift in investor mindset. Holders are increasingly borrowing against their BTC instead of selling, due to rising confidence and ETF-related tailwinds. Meanwhile, Hive Digital Technologies is expanding its mining operations in Paraguay, attracted by low-cost hydro power and a pro-investment environment. The firm wants to boost capacity to 300 MW and 25 EH/s by September 2025. Strive Asset Management Goes All In on Bitcoin Strive Asset Management, which was founded by entrepreneur and former US presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, announced plans to become a Bitcoin treasury company. On May 7, the firm revealed that it will go public via a reverse merger with Asset Entities, a Nasdaq-listed social media marketing company. The merged entity will continue under the Strive brand and leverage its public market access to finance large-scale Bitcoin purchases. Strive’s announcement Strive plans to raise roughly $1 billion through a combination of equity and debt and use the proceeds to build a large Bitcoin reserve. The company stated that it plans to take advantage of all available mechanisms to develop a Bitcoin “war chest” and pursue a long-term strategy that could outperform Bitcoin itself. Additionally, Strive said it will offer Bitcoin holders a path to exchange their holdings for public stock in a structure designed to be tax-free. Strive manages around $2 billion in net assets across its investment funds. The company also previously filed to list an ETF focused on convertible bonds from major corporate Bitcoin holders like Strategy. The move was made during a time of growing interest in corporate Bitcoin treasuries, which is a trend that accelerated since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Companies adopting this strategy, like Strategy, have seen their stock prices soar. Some even rose as much as 350% in 2024 alone. Analysts, including those at Fidelity Digital Assets, argue that Bitcoin can serve as a valuable hedge against macroeconomic instability, including currency debasement and fiscal deficits. Bitcoin treasuries data (Source: Bitcointreasuries.net ) Corporate Bitcoin treasuries now collectively hold approximately $74 billion in BTC, based on data from Bitcointreasuries.net . Ramaswamy launched Strive in 2022 with a mission to ”harness the power of capitalism,” and maintained a close political alignment with President-elect Donald Trump. Although he ran against Trump in the 2023 Republican primaries, he ultimately endorsed him. Bitcoin Hodlers Turn to Loans Instead of Selling Bitcoin treasuries are not the only new hot trend in the crypto space. Bitcoin holders are increasingly turning to crypto-backed loans as confidence in the market grows. This is according to Seamus Rocca, CEO of Gibraltar-based Xapo Bank. At the Token2049 event in Dubai, Rocca explained that with Bitcoin hovering around $98,000 and institutional interest rising, investors are adopting a more long-term view and are more comfortable using their BTC as collateral. This is a major shift from a few years ago when such confidence in borrowing against crypto assets was lacking. Seamus Rocca at Token2049 In March, Xapo Bank introduced a new lending product that allows qualified users to borrow up to $1 million in US dollars against their Bitcoin holdings. Rocca attributed the growing demand for this service to the mood of long-term adoption and stability in the crypto sector. He explained that the current environment, which is boosted by developments like Bitcoin ETFs, is encouraging a sense of security that reduces fears of sharp price crashes and liquidation events. The bank offers loan-to-value ratios of 20%, 30%, and 40%, which allows clients to access liquidity while still minimizing risk. Rocca pointed out that even with a conservative 20% LTV ratio, early adopters with large Bitcoin holdings can borrow large sums without having to sell their assets. In such cases, Bitcoin will need to fall below $40,000 to trigger liquidation. (Source: Unchained ) Rocca said that these loans provide a practical alternative for holders who may need funds for unexpected expenses. Instead of selling Bitcoin and potentially missing out on future gains, borrowers can retain their exposure to BTC and simply pay interest on their loans. This strategy helps investors manage real-life financial needs without compromising their long-term crypto positions. With institutional adoption accelerating and the crypto market continuing to mature, Rocca believes more Bitcoin holders will look to access liquidity through borrowing rather than selling. Hive Digital Taps Paraguay’s Hydro Power for BTC Growth In other Bitcoin-related news, Hive Digital Technologies is placing a strategic bet on Latin America to expand its Bitcoin mining operations. The company is doing this despite the fact that most other crypto firms are contemplating returning to the United States due to geopolitical uncertainties. In a recent interview , Hive’s president and CEO Aydin Kilic specifically pointed to Paraguay as a particularly promising location, due to its geopolitical stability, low-cost hydroelectric power, and a government receptive to foreign investment. The company recently acquired Bitfarms’ 200 megawatt Yguazú facility for $56 million and completed the first phase of a 100 MW data center, which already supports five exahashes per second of ASIC mining. Hive plans to scale operations in Paraguay to 300 MW and increase its hashrate to 25 EH/s by September of 2025. Kilic fully believes in the importance of local engagement, and explained that Hive prioritized hiring, training, and vendor relationships to create a stable support ecosystem that enhances efficiency. Despite a proposed mining ban in Paraguay due to concerns over electricity consumption and potential rate hikes, Hive is in active dialogue with local policymakers to shape more favorable regulatory outcomes. While doubling down on Latin America, Hive is also diversifying globally with operations in Canada, Sweden, and now a new headquarters in San Antonio, Texas. Kilic said this geographical spread helps mitigate risks tied to global trade tensions and regional instability. For example, the company is reducing reliance on Chinese suppliers by securing ASIC and electrical components from multiple regions. To support its ambitious scaling plans, Hive secured ASIC orders, locked in long-term power purchase agreements, and increased engineering capacity across three continents. Kilic described Bitcoin mining profitability as a “physics equation,” where controlling variables like operational expenses, power costs, and machine uptime is crucial when it comes to driving consistent performance. He added that regardless of scale, whether an operator runs a single rig or ten thousand, the key to success lies in maximizing efficiency and maintaining disciplined treasury management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-08 06:07:10

New $0.0000002 Cryptocurrency Set To Take Over Before Elon Musk-Backed GROK,https://nulltx.com/is-pepe-done-new-0-0000002-cryptocurrency-set-to-take-over-before-elon-musk-backed-grok/,"Pepe (PEPE) may have led the meme coin wave, but its momentum is starting to slow, leaving investors wondering if its best days are behind it or if Elon Musk’s new GROK meme coin could overtake it. As investors hunt for the next breakout star in the cryptocurrency market, a new contender priced at just $0.0000002 is gaining serious attention, set to surpass even Elon Musk’s GROK cryptocurrency. With advanced AI tools, meme-to-earn feature, and a fast-growing community, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is being touted as the meme coin poised to dethrone Pepe (PEPE) and GROK. Here’s why this newcomer could be the biggest meme cryptocurrency story of 2025. Can PEPE Still Deliver Gains? According to CoinGecko data , PEPE has remained largely stagnant around the $0.05 mark over the past year. Recently, PEPE has fallen 12.61% over the past week, including a 4.59% drop in the last 24 hours. But, on the price chart, PEPE has broken out of a long-standing falling wedge pattern, which is generally considered a positive indicator for future price movement. If this breakout holds, the short-term price target lies around $0.000011000. On the flip side, if PEPE fails to maintain support at the wedge (currently around $0.000007895), the coin could fall back into the pattern, with a potential drop to the $0.00000600–$0.000005 demand zone, which would invalidate the bullish outlook. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Meme Coin With Better Utilities Than PEPE And GROK PEPE previously soared to a $11 billion market cap in one year, largely due to viral momentum tied to the iconic meme frog. Now, investors demand more than just buzz—they want substance, utility, and unique functionalities. That’s where FloppyPepe (FPPE) comes in, quietly developing one of the most promising projects in the space. What sets this cryptocurrency apart from others like PEPE and Elon Musk-backed GROK is its unique combination of meme culture and advanced AI technology. Its AI-powered agents, like the FloppyX and FloppyAI , continuously scan the cryptocurrency landscape, monitoring social sentiment, on-chain activity, DEX trading patterns, and live market data, to uncover real trading opportunities. The SolidProof-audited project also offers gas-fee-free transactions and staking up to 7.9% of its 120 trillion token supply. TRY FLOPPYAI NOW!! GROK, Sparks Frenzy After Explosive Surge Grok (GROK) , a new meme coin launched on the Solana network on May 1, has made headlines after nearly doubling in value to trade around $0.06274. Sharing its name with Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, GROK has fueled speculation that it may have been created by Elon Musk’s xAI team as a parody of the original AI model. This rumor has driven a massive spike in search interest, pushing GROK to the top of CoinGecko’s trending meme coins list, highlighting the intense FOMO surrounding the Elon Musk-backed token. Although its market cap has pulled back from a peak of $72 million to about $16 million at press time, experts believe there’s more upside potential for GROK. Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Is The Next Big Meme Coin FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) forward-thinking approach to cryptocurrency has already created serious FOMO. Notably, top analyst GIGA has endorsed the cryptocurrency, predicting a 100x surge. Even ahead of its official launch, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has raised more than $2 million in presale funding, a strong signal that experienced investors are taking notice early. The project is also gearing up to launch on major blockchains like Binance Smart Chain and Solana. When combined with rising investor interest and viral momentum, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has a real shot at surpassing not only Elon Musk-backed GROK but even dethroning PEPE itself. Missed Out On PEPE? Don’t Miss Out On FloppyPepe (FPPE) PEPE and the Elon Musk-backed GROK both began as low-priced presale tokens. Despite having little real utility, they attracted massive investor interest, turning small stakes into millions. Now, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to do the same, with the added advantage of real utility and AI integration. The presale is still in its early phase at just $0.0000002 , with up to 80% in bonuses using the code FLOPPY80 . This could be the next major breakout—now’s the time to get in early.

History is quietly preparing to repeat itself as FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quietly rising through the crypto ranks, with all the right elements to ignite another generational wealth wave and become the Bitcoin (BTC) of the AI age. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Coin Redefining Value Where meme coins once lived and died by hype alone, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has taken a bold leap beyond the predictable. Offering a complete ecosystem that merges decentralized finance with artificial intelligence. In a market craving both cultural virality and technical utility, this unique token is the first of its kind: a next-gen meme coin engineered for long-term value. And the infrastructure is already in place. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is expanding across major blockchains, including Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, allowing hassle-free, multichain access and scalability. With a comprehensive smart contract audited by SolidProof, bug bounty programs, and multi-signature wallets, it also provides ironclad security that guarantees long-term sustainability, not flash-in-the-pan hype. Advanced AI Utility For Community Engagement As artificial intelligence dominates the crypto space . From trading bots to AI-driven analytics, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is built from the ground up to thrive in it. Its ecosystem uses AI agents like Floppy Agent to deliver high-impact, real-time market intelligence, giving traders an unprecedented edge in fast-moving markets. Users can engage with this technology right away. But FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) real magic lies in its other AI-powered utility. The FloppyX agent crafts cinematic-quality videos using intelligent pipelines, while the Meme-o-Matic allows users to create viral memes like the one below using simple prompts. These tools don’t just engage the community, they create endless viral potential. An Incomparable Floppynomics What’s more? FloppyPepe (FPPE) introduces game-changing mechanics into its tokenomics. Its burn system, which permanently eliminates 1% of every transaction, mirrors the deflationary logic of Bitcoin (BTC) halving events, driving scarcity while increasing long-term value. Simultaneously, 3% of every transaction is automatically redistributed to holders, turning passive holding into an income stream. With staking options, a growing liquidity pool, and an 80% bonus with code “FLOPPY80,” currently in play, the math is explosive. Let’s look at the numbers. Dogecoin (DOGE) rose 200,000%. Shiba Inu (SHIB) skyrocketed over 1,000,000%. Analysts now project that FloppyPepe (FPPE) could rally 130,000%–150,000% or more from its presale price of $0.0000002 . With the current presale offering an 80% bonus, a $1,000 investment doesn’t just buy tokens; it buys early access to a future market leader. With the 80% bonus, your $1,000 essentially behaves like $1,800. If FPPE hits its projected high, you’re not just mimicking Bitcoin’s (BTC) trajectory, you’re accelerating it. Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise And Why FloppyPepe (FPPE) Might Be Next Bitcoin’s (BTC) origin story is legendary: from cents to tens of thousands of dollars. Yet its astronomical climb was not due to hype; it was due to early belief. Bitcoin (BTC) didn’t advertise itself. It didn’t promise Lambos or instant millions. Bitcoin (BTC) offered technology, scarcity, and community. And its intrinsic value continues to keep faithfuls like SantinoCryptoE optimistic of an incoming $150,000 price. Back then, few understood what Bitcoin (BTC) could become. That same uncertainty today surrounds FloppyPepe (FPPE), and for early believers, that’s the signal, not the noise. Don’t Miss the Next Bitcoin Moment, It’s Coming With An 80% Early Adopter Bonus FloppyPepe (FPPE) is opening up a world far more receptive to crypto, to memes, and to AI. Designed to be the first intelligent meme coin engineered to build wealth while creating content, community, and culture. Investors will be buying into AI infrastructure and smart tokenomics. In a world where utility and virality collide, this meme coin is uniquely positioned to lead the charge. Those who missed Bitcoin (BTC) now have the chance to correct their mistakes. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) presale is live, the 80% bonus won’t last forever, and the future doesn’t wait. Use the code Floppy80 for extra tokens.

The bill, titled “Stop Presidential Profiteering from Digital Assets Act”, includes tough measures against possible abuses, especially in the memecoin and stablecoin space. According to the bill, the president, vice president, members of Congress, federal officials appointed by the president or confirmed by the Senate, and their immediate family members will not be able to directly or indirectly profit from digital assets. In particular, the creation, promotion, advertising, and sale of digital assets that use the names, faces, or similar distinguishing features of said individuals will be prohibited.

The largest cryptocurrency is getting closer to the $100,000 mark, while several altcoins are testing important resistance levels. One of the performers is Pi Coin, which has jumped 8% in the last 24 hours. The token is now eyeing the $0.70 mark — and if it breaks through, the path to $0.90 and $1 could open up. Adding to this are fresh rumors about Pi possibly getting listed on Binance. These speculations started when Binance’s Stellar deposit wallet, which also serves as its Pi wallet, began testing transactions on the Pi blockchain. On top of that, the Pi Network team has a major announcement planned for May 14. The big reveal might take place at the Consensus Summit in Toronto, marking the project’s first official global event. Pi founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis is also expected to speak, sharing updates on the project’s Open Mainnet, which officially launched in February 2025. What’s Next For Pi Coin? Analyst Dr. Altcoin believes Pi Coin could pick up momentum after the Summit takes place. With over 70 million users worldwide, Pi Network is too big to be ignored by major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. He also said that Binance advertising on the Pi app could mean something. However, the Pi coin is down by more than 3% in the last 2 weeks. There is a constant sell-off pressure due to the ongoing token unlocks. As per data from Pi Scan , 10.3 million tokens will be unlocked today. Recently, its trading volume dropped below $40 million, but it has since bounced to $123 million. The next few weeks will be important and could determine where Pi Coin’s price is headed. Pi Coin’s RSI is neutral, with no strong momentum in either direction. The MACD is giving a buy signal, which is a good sign.

Acting comptroller Rodney Hood said in a May 7 letter that banks and federal savings associations can buy and sell crypto they hold in custody at customers’ direction. The OCC added in a press release that financial institutions can also outsource bank-permissible crypto activities , including custody and execution services, to third parties in compliance with applicable law. “Additionally, these banks may provide other custody services, including record keeping, tax or reporting services for their customers,” Hood said in a May 7 video posted to X. OCC-regulated banks may buy and sell assets held in custody and are permitted to outsource bank-permissible crypto-asset activities, including custody and execution services. https://t.co/0ScQdgNaS6 pic.twitter.com/J5dEkx4WUL — OCC (@USOCC) May 7, 2025 “OCC banks may use a sub-custodian to provide the same services subject to appropriate third-party risk management practices, while a range of cryptocurrency and digital asset activities may be performed by banks and their third parties,” he added. Previously, the OCC eased its stance on how banks can engage with crypto on March 7 by giving the green light for crypto-asset custody, some stablecoin activities, and participation in independent node verification networks such as distributed ledgers. “More than 50 million Americans hold some form of cryptocurrency. This digitalization of financial services is not a trend; it is a transformation,” Hood said. The OCC is an independent bureau within the US Department of the Treasury that regulates and supervises all national banks and also the federal branches of foreign banks. Industry supports the OCC letters Katherine Kirkpatrick Bos, general counsel at ZK-rollup developer StarkWare, said the letters signal a “shift in the OCC’s approach,” which now appears to favor a focus on integrating crypto within banking frameworks. “More guidance will give further clarity [and] will allow banks to re-enter crypto [without] the fear of existential regulatory risk,” she said. She added the OCC’s “explicit permission today allowing banks to outsource bank-permissible crypto-assets is a boon to regulated crypto native service providers.” Source: Katherine Kirkpatrick Bos Chief policy officer at crypto exchange Coinbase, Faryar Shirzad, also applauded the move, saying in a May 7 post to X, Hood’s commitment to “regulatory clarity, as well as his adherence to supervisory best practices and the letter of the law,” is appreciated. The Trump administration has taken a friendlier attitude toward crypto since coming into power in January. Related: The lessons learned at Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Congressional hearings In April, the US Federal Reserve announced it was withdrawing guidance that was created to deter banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities. US President Donald Trump also signed a joint congressional resolution on April 11 , overturning a Biden administration-era rule that would have required decentralized finance protocols to report transactions to the Internal Revenue Service.

In a thread on X, Pumpius stated that “$2 XRP is a lie,” and described the current market as a “controlled simulation” orchestrated by banks, exchanges, and regulators instead of the product of supply and demand. Pumpius believes XRP is a critical piece of future global finance infrastructure, and therefore faces different treatment from the rest of the crypto market. “XRP is the only asset they need suppressed,” he stated , asserting that financial entities deliberately keep the price low in preparation for a future system shift. The XRP Price is Artificial: Controlled by a Global Banking Cartel $2 XRP is a lie. This isn’t a market. It’s a controlled simulation. Designed by a cartel of banks, exchanges, and regulators. pic.twitter.com/4xr6a7biBq — Pumpius (@pumpius) May 6, 2025 Accumulation Behind the Scenes Pumpius alleges that institutions quietly accumulate XRP while the retail price is kept low through manipulation. This assertion adds credence to statements from another expert suggesting that BlackRock and similar institutions want to buy tokens at discounted retail prices . Pumpius suggests that live corridors and ongoing bank partnerships are concealed under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), hiding the scale of adoption. This claim is supported by recent reports that Ripple has over 1,700 NDAs , and Pumpius believes the plan is to continue the suppression until global systems adopt ISO 20022 standards, as this shift would activate XRP’s role. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He points to consistent price stagnation despite real-world usage as evidence. Ripple has reported dozens of active partnerships with financial institutions, but the market price of XRP has not reflected these developments. For Pumpius, the lack of correlation is a consequence of deliberate containment. Exchange Manipulation and False Volatility Part of the alleged strategy involves manipulation by crypto exchanges. Pumpius accuses them of wash trading, spoofing order books, and using automated bots to trigger panic and fake momentum. He insists that what appears to be normal volatility is a controlled strategy to keep XRP unattractive to average investors. He says this creates the illusion that XRP is underperforming compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are allowed to grow unchecked. He claims that XRP, being too integrated and regulatory-compliant, cannot rise without threatening the legacy financial order. Control Before Activation Pumpius’s core argument is that the suppression is temporary and ends once the underlying infrastructure goes live. He believes the banking establishment aims to control the system fully before public recognition of XRP’s true value occurs. Crypto experts have advised investors to hold their XRP in cold wallets and not on public exchanges so they can fully control the tokens when the market shifts.

After months, if not years, of debate and legislative maneuvering, U.S. politicians have reportedly reached a bipartisan agreement on crucial stablecoin regulation . This is big news, and it signals a potentially clearer path forward for a vital part of the digital asset ecosystem. A Rare Moment: What Does This Bipartisan Crypto Bill Agreement Signify? In the often-polarized landscape of U.S. politics, achieving bipartisan consensus on complex issues is a rare feat. The fact that Republicans and Democrats have found common ground on a bipartisan crypto bill is noteworthy in itself. According to a report by U.Today, this agreement centers around a bill known as the GENIUS Act. Previously, efforts to regulate stablecoins faced opposition from various corners, including some pro-cryptocurrency lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who had differing views on how best to approach the technology. The reported breakthrough suggests that key sticking points may have been resolved, paving the way for potential legislative action. The next immediate step, as reported, is that Republicans plan to push for a vote on this agreed-upon text in the Senate sometime this week. Understanding the Focus: Why is a US Stablecoin Bill a Priority? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a traditional currency like the U.S. dollar, or sometimes to commodities or algorithms. Their potential uses are vast, from facilitating faster and cheaper payments to enabling seamless trading within the crypto market. However, their growing importance and connection to traditional finance have raised concerns among regulators worldwide, including in the United States. A dedicated US stablecoin bill is seen as necessary to address several key areas: Financial Stability: Ensuring that stablecoin issuers hold adequate reserves and operate transparently to prevent ‘runs’ similar to bank runs, which could potentially impact the broader financial system. Consumer Protection: Establishing rules to safeguard users’ funds and provide clarity on the rights and responsibilities of stablecoin holders and issuers. Preventing Illicit Finance: Implementing measures to prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities. Fostering Innovation: Providing regulatory certainty allows legitimate businesses to build and innovate using stablecoins with clear guidelines. Without clear federal rules, the regulatory landscape for stablecoins in the U.S. has been fragmented, relying on a mix of state-level licensing and existing financial regulations that weren’t specifically designed for digital assets. What Might the GENIUS Act Entail? (Based on Previous Discussions) While the specific text of the agreed-upon GENIUS Act has not yet been publicly released, previous legislative proposals and discussions around stablecoin regulation offer clues about what it might include. Common themes in past bills have involved: Issuance Requirements: Mandating that stablecoin issuers obtain specific charters or licenses, potentially from federal or state regulators, or both. Reserve Standards: Requiring stablecoins pegged to the dollar to be fully backed by high-quality, liquid assets (like cash, cash equivalents, or short-term government bonds) held in segregated accounts, subject to regular audits and public attestation. Oversight Authority: Designating which federal agencies (like the Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, SEC, or CFTC) will have primary oversight responsibilities, potentially in coordination with state regulators. Prohibitions or Restrictions: Some proposals have considered restrictions or outright prohibitions on certain types of stablecoins, such as purely algorithmic stablecoins that lack traditional asset backing. Interoperability: Rules potentially aimed at ensuring different stablecoins can interact and be transferred easily across different platforms and blockchains. The agreement suggests that compromises have been reached on these potentially contentious points, finding a balance that satisfies a majority of lawmakers involved in the negotiations. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation in the US? This development around the GENIUS Act is a significant step, but it’s important to remember that it’s not the final word on crypto regulation US . The process involves several more hurdles: Senate Vote: The bill must pass the Senate. While the bipartisan agreement is positive, passage is not guaranteed and could still face procedural challenges or amendments. House Action: A similar or identical bill would need to pass the House of Representatives. If the House passes a different version, the two chambers would need to reconcile their differences in a conference committee. Presidential Assent: The final, identical bill passed by both the Senate and the House must be signed into law by the President. Even if the GENIUS Act becomes law, it primarily focuses on stablecoins. However, its passage could set a precedent and potentially build momentum for addressing other areas of crypto regulation, such as exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi), or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Challenges and Opportunities on the Horizon While the prospect of clear stablecoin regulation is widely seen as beneficial for fostering legitimacy and adoption, challenges remain. Critics might argue about the specifics of the bill’s requirements, potential burdens on smaller innovators, or the balance of power between federal and state regulators. The exact details, once released, will be crucial for assessing the bill’s full impact. However, the opportunity for the U.S. to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins is immense. It could enhance financial stability, protect consumers, and solidify the country’s position in the evolving global digital economy. A Step Forward for the US Stablecoin Bill The reported bipartisan agreement on the US stablecoin bill , the GENIUS Act, represents a potential breakthrough moment for crypto regulation in the U.S. It demonstrates that consensus is possible on digital asset policy and sets the stage for potential legislative action soon. While the details of the bill and its path through Congress are still unfolding, this development is a clear signal that policymakers are serious about establishing rules for this critical component of the crypto market. The coming days, particularly with the planned Senate vote, will be crucial in determining the immediate future of this significant legislative effort.

Trump’s Media Group to Launch “Utility Token,” Potentially Ushering in a New Era of U.S. Equity Tokenization On April 30, 2025, the Trump Media & Technology Group announced in a shareholder letter that it would collaborate with the Truth digital wallet to launch a new utility token called DJT . Initially, DJT will be used for payments on the Truth+ subscription service, with plans to expand into broader use cases across the Truth ecosystem, including tipping and transactional functions. The DJT trademark already spans digital wallets, crypto payments, and digital asset platforms, and Truth Social’s official account has rebranded with the “DJT” suffix—signaling deep integration between the token and the social platform. This marks the first time a publicly listed U.S. media company is launching a utility token tied to a real-world product ecosystem, signifying a historic convergence between traditional equities and on-chain asset formats. Although the team has yet to announce a release date, blockchain platform, or tokenomics, the rollout appears to follow Trump’s classic strategy: hype first, details later . Market participants expect a multi-phase, media-driven launch to maximize attention and adoption. At a time when memecoin mania is cooling and narratives are shifting toward utility and payment integration, DJT is hitting the market at just the right moment. Similar to HTX’s recent listing of WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin, demand for “practical crypto assets” is surging. DJT combines powerful political branding with real ecosystem support, offering long-term value potential far beyond that of short-lived meme-driven tokens. U.S.-China Rapprochement Fuels Risk Appetite, But Core Frictions Persist This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Besant and Trade Representative Jamison Greer will meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Geneva, marking the first high-level U.S.-China trade talks since tensions escalated in spring 2025. Key discussion points include the rollback of 145% tariffs, updates to export control policies, and restoring duty-free treatment for small cross-border parcels. Although both sides still dispute who initiated the talks, the meeting alone sends a strong signal of reengagement and diplomatic thawing . With tariffs at historic highs, markets are interpreting the summit as a short-term de-escalation of geopolitical risks—sparking a relief rally in risk assets. Following the news, Bitcoin rose by approximately 3.6%, briefly surpassing $97,000. This reflects how sensitive capital flows remain to macro-level easing signals. While structural differences between the two nations are far from resolved, the current window of policy détente may offer a short-term liquidity boost for digital assets, gold, and tech stocks . Powell Throws : “Now Is Not the Time to Cut Rates” On May 8, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% for the third consecutive meeting. While this outcome was widely expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a noticeably more cautious tone during the press conference: “Now is not the time for us to lead with a rate cut.” “The cost of waiting is relatively low.” “Whether we cut this year depends on how things develop.” Powell emphasized that the U.S. is still grappling with stubborn inflation and that trade-related factors—especially tariffs—could add fresh upward pressure on prices. The Fed is currently caught in a “dual bind” : on one hand, disinflation has stalled, with PCE and CPI both above the 2% target. On the other, the central bank’s fiscal position is deteriorating. In FY2024, the Fed paid $226.8 billion in interest on reserves and reverse repos, but only earned $158.8 billion in interest income from its Treasury and MBS holdings—resulting in a $77.5 billion annual loss. A 25–30 bps rate cut could shave another $20 billion off annual income, further reducing remittances to the Treasury and raising concerns over the Fed’s policy independence. As a result, despite markets currently pricing in three rate cuts in 2025, the Fed is more likely to take a “data-driven, delayed transition” approach. Investors should be cautious of emotional trades that outpace macro fundamentals, particularly as key economic indicators have yet to show clear deterioration. Labor Market Resilience Delays Policy Shift: Powell Says Unemployment Will Be Key Trigger In April, U.S. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 177,000—beating expectations—with the unemployment rate steady at 4.2%. Job gains were concentrated in healthcare, finance, and transportation. Although federal employment declined by 9,000 due to budget tightening, the labor market overall remains strong, showing no signs of systemic weakness. Against this backdrop, Powell reiterated that unemployment, not just inflation, will be the primary trigger for any policy pivot : “I can’t say what level of unemployment would be tolerable.” “We’ll assess overall labor market softness using comprehensive data.” This clearly sets the policy floor: only a material drop in payrolls or a sharp rise in unemployment (above 4.5%) could justify cutting rates even if inflation remains above target . BTC Stalls Near $99K: Options Market Shows No Clear Trend, Macro Data Will Dictate Direction Despite BTC rebounding to around $99,000 on geopolitical and monetary optimism, the options market is not confirming a strong directional bias. Deribit data shows implied volatility on June and July calls rising only modestly, while 25d risk reversals remain neutral to slightly bearish , and skew curves are relatively flat. Notably, large Gamma exposures are clustered around the $95,000–$100,000 range, indicating that BTC is currently trapped in a “high-volatility, low-conviction” zone awaiting macro catalysts. If CPI and jobs data for May–June remain hot, the Fed may push back on rate cut expectations— risking a BTC pullback . Conversely, if inflation cools and unemployment ticks up, Powell may pivot dovishly, providing a green light for BTC to break out of its volatility compression range and resume its bullish trend. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

44313755,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158307,1746687604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Powell’s Crucial Warning: US Tariffs Threaten Rate Cuts & Economic Outlook,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/powell-tariffs-rate-cuts/,"In the dynamic world of finance and cryptocurrency, understanding the signals from global economic leaders is paramount. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently delivered a significant update that casts a shadow of uncertainty over future economic policy, directly impacting the broader market sentiment that influences crypto valuations. His remarks focused heavily on the potential impact of ongoing trade negotiations and US tariffs , suggesting these policies could create headwinds for the economy and complicate the path forward for monetary policy. What Did Jerome Powell Say About Tariffs and Rate Cuts? Speaking on the current economic climate, Chairman Powell highlighted the unpredictable nature of tariff policies. He noted that while ongoing negotiations provide some data points, the persistence of high tariffs introduces a significant variable. Here are the core takeaways from his statement: Tariffs and 2025 Goals: Powell warned that persistent tariff policies have the potential to delay the Federal Reserve’s ability to meet its economic targets set for 2025. These targets typically involve goals related to inflation, employment, and stable economic growth. Trade barriers can disrupt supply chains, increase costs, and dampen economic activity, making these goals harder to achieve on schedule. Interest Rate Cuts Unlikely Now: Given the high level of uncertainty introduced by trade policy, Powell stated that preemptive interest rate cuts would be difficult under current conditions. The Fed prefers to have a clearer economic picture before making significant policy shifts like lowering borrowing costs. Uncertainty makes it harder to forecast the economic impact of rate changes. Prepared to Respond: Despite the uncertainty, Powell assured that the Federal Reserve remains vigilant and is prepared to respond quickly should economic issues arise or conditions change significantly. This indicates the central bank is monitoring the situation closely and has tools ready if needed. Why Do US Tariffs Create Economic Uncertainty? Tariffs, essentially taxes on imported goods, introduce uncertainty into the economic outlook for several reasons: Firstly, they can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, escalating trade disputes. This creates instability for businesses involved in international trade, affecting export markets and global supply chains. Companies may delay investment decisions due to unpredictable costs and market access. Secondly, tariffs can increase the cost of imported raw materials and components for domestic producers, potentially leading to higher consumer prices (inflation) or reduced profit margins. This complicates the Fed’s inflation management goals. Thirdly, the outcome and duration of tariff negotiations are often unclear, making it difficult for economists and businesses to forecast future trade flows and economic growth accurately. This lack of clarity is precisely what Jerome Powell emphasized as a barrier to policy adjustments like cutting interest rates. How Does Federal Reserve Policy Impact Crypto? While Powell’s comments are about traditional economics, the actions and signals from the Federal Reserve have a profound impact on financial markets globally, including cryptocurrencies. Here’s the connection: Interest rate policy influences the cost of capital and the attractiveness of different asset classes. When interest rates are low (or expected to be cut), traditional low-yield investments like bonds become less appealing. This can push investors towards riskier assets like stocks and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies, in search of higher returns. Conversely, higher rates can make safer assets more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from crypto. Economic uncertainty, as highlighted by Powell regarding tariffs, can also influence investor behavior. High uncertainty might lead to risk-off sentiment, where investors sell riskier assets (like crypto) and move into safer havens. However, prolonged uncertainty or economic slowdowns could also potentially strengthen the narrative for decentralized assets like Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Challenges Posed by Tariffs to 2025 Goals The challenges tariffs pose to the Fed’s 2025 objectives are multifaceted: Inflation Volatility: Tariffs can cause sudden price spikes for specific goods, making it harder for the Fed to manage overall inflation towards its target. Slower Growth: Reduced trade and investment due to tariffs can dampen overall economic growth, making full employment targets harder to reach. Supply Chain Disruptions: Businesses may struggle to adapt quickly to changing trade rules, leading to inefficiencies and impacting productivity. Reduced Business Confidence: Uncertainty about future trade policy can erode confidence, leading to reduced capital expenditure and hiring. These factors collectively make the economic environment less predictable, complicating the precise calibration of monetary policy needed to achieve stable growth and price stability by 2025. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Reader What does this mean for those navigating the cryptocurrency market? Firstly, stay informed about macroeconomics. Signals from the Federal Reserve and discussions around policies like US tariffs are not isolated events; they are crucial indicators of the broader economic health and liquidity environment that impacts crypto markets. Secondly, understand that periods of increased economic uncertainty often lead to higher market volatility across all asset classes, including crypto. Be prepared for potential price swings driven by shifts in global sentiment. Finally, consider how different economic scenarios (e.g., prolonged uncertainty, potential future rate cuts if conditions change) might affect your investment strategy. This isn’t financial advice, but a prompt to think critically about the macro backdrop. Summary: Navigating Uncertainty Jerome Powell ‘s recent comments underscore a critical point: trade policy, specifically the use of tariffs, is a significant source of economic uncertainty right now. This uncertainty makes it difficult for the Federal Reserve to commit to near-term policy easing like interest rate cuts and could potentially delay the achievement of key economic goals by 2025. For the cryptocurrency community, these developments are a reminder that the performance of digital assets is often intertwined with the health and stability of the traditional financial system and the macroeconomic policies that govern it. Staying aware of these signals from policymakers is essential for understanding the broader market context.

At the time of writing, the asset trades at $97,005, reflecting a modest 2.6% gain over the past seven days and a 3.3% increase in the last 24 hours. While volatility remains subdued, recent on-chain data highlights a steady rise in investor activity that could hint at future price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin In The Middle Of A Decision Point, Analyst Says—Here’s Why Bitcoin Investor Confidence Reflected in On-Chain Metrics CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alemán has outlined an ongoing trend that points to sustained investor interest. In a recent QuickTake post, Alemán noted that Bitcoin’s Realized Cap, representing the aggregate value of coins based on their last movement, has reached an all-time high for the third consecutive week. The metric, calculated by multiplying each unspent transaction output (UTXO) by its purchase price, rose to $890.7 billion, indicating growing capital inflow into the asset. According to Alemán, the consistent climb in Bitcoin’s Realized Cap demonstrates a continuation of accumulation by both long-term and short-term holders. The increased capital invested in BTC over the past few weeks suggests that market participants are positioning themselves for a potential price breakout. This pattern of capital inflow may be laying the groundwork for a stronger bullish phase if sustained investment continues. Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs) appear to be increasing their stakes during this consolidation period. Alemán emphasized that the rising Realized Cap does more than reflect price, as it also captures market conviction. The metric signals a growing belief in Bitcoin’s longer-term value proposition when paired with steady accumulation trends. If historical patterns repeat, the market may be in the early stages of forming a new uptrend. Coinbase Premium Gap Signals Localized Pressure Despite the on-chain optimism, other indicators suggest reasons for caution. Another CryptoQuant analyst, Abramchart, recently highlighted the Coinbase Premium Gap as a sign of regional bearish sentiment. The gap, which was at -5.07 at the time of reporting, means Bitcoin is trading lower on Coinbase, an exchange largely dominated by US investors, compared to global platforms. This negative gap is often interpreted as an indicator of selling pressure from American participants. Abramchart noted that although the premium had previously recovered, the recent decline aligns with Bitcoin’s failure to push beyond the $97,000 level. Persistent negative values in the premium gap typically signal weak demand in the US market, which could act as a headwind to upward momentum. If the gap continues to trend downward, it may reinforce current price stagnation despite broader accumulation trends.

CZ, once the crypto world’s golden boy, said on the Farokh Radio podcast aired on Tuesday that he “wouldn’t mind” a pardon and that his lawyers had filed the paperwork on his behalf two weeks ago. “We only submitted after the Bloomberg article and the Wall Street Journal article came out,” Zhao posited. He was referring to two stories published in March that reported he was seeking a pardon from President Trump amid discussions of a potential business deal between the Trump family and Binance.US. The Binance founder refuted the reports at the time but did not rule out the possibility of seeking a pardon. He claimed that seeing the news reports prompted the application for clemency. “If they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply,” he said on the recent podcast. He further noted that the President’s pardon of three co-founders of the BitMEX crypto exchange , including Arthur Hayes, encouraged him to also seek a pardon. CZ pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in 2023, agreeing to step down as CEO and receiving a lifetime ban from “managing or operating” Binance. He was released from a 4-month stint in prison in September after also agreeing to pay a $50 million fine, while Binance agreed to pay a record-setting $4.3 billion . After stepping down, CZ was replaced by former Abu Dhabi regulator Richard Teng, who has led Binance to invest heavily in regulatory compliance, which he described as “Binance 2.0.” No Plans To Return As Binance CEO In the U.S., the President can forgive individuals convicted of crimes in what is called a ‘pardon.’ If pardoned, it will not effectively wipe Zhao’s money laundering conviction from his record; however, it could potentially allow him to return as CEO of Binance. However, CZ clarified during the podcast that he has no interest in returning to the CEO position despite seeking a presidential pardon. “I’m not really looking to become CEO of Binance again,” quipped Zhao. Regardless, he remains Binance’s biggest shareholder, owning an estimated 90% stake in the world’s largest digital asset exchange.",Cryptocurrency|News|Binance|Changpeng Zhao|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-08 07:01:47

Eurizon SLJ Capital’s analysts Stephen Jen and Joana Freireat say in a new investment note that Asian investors have accumulated a massive pile of USD that could be ditched en masse if trade wars intensify and the dollar weakens, reports Bloomberg. According to the analysts, if the US-driven trade conflict grows, a significant number of Asian investors could bring substantial capital back home or seek to bolster their defenses against a declining USD. That, they warn, could leave the dollar facing a $2.5 trillion “avalanche” of selling. “We suspect these dollar hoardings by Asian exporters and institutional investors may be extremely large – possibly on the order of $2.5 trillion or so – and pose sharp downside risks to the dollar vis-à-vis these Asian currencies.” Bloomberg says its dollar gauge has dropped about 8% from a February high. Meanwhile, Asian currencies have strengthened versus the greenback in the past month. President Trump signed an executive order in April that imposed a 10% tariff on all imported goods entering the US, with the stated aim of increasing domestic manufacturing. The President also issued a proclamation that slapped reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries. The Trump administration says it is currently engaging with more than a dozen countries around the world to craft new trade deals. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are set to meet with their Chinese counterparts to discuss trade and economic issues in Switzerland this week.

The surge follows a May 8 announcement on Truth Social by U.S. President Donald Trump, who said he would host a press conference in the Oval Office the following day to announce a “major trade deal” with a “big” and “highly respected” country. Trump described the deal as “the first of many,” suggesting more international agreements could follow. Although Trump didn’t mention a specific country, The New York Times reported it is expected to be the United Kingdom, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. Traders welcomed the update as a potential step toward easing global trade pressures. Tariffs have been a key concern for markets in recent months, with earlier moves by the Trump administration leading to volatility across equities and crypto.

The asset fell sharply after the U.S. raised tariffs on China in April, dropping from over $88,000 to a low of $74,500. It has since rebounded steadily, buoyed by renewed exchange-traded funds inflows, a weaker dollar, and improving investor sentiment. In a separate but related development, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is also slated to meet with Chinese top officials in Switzerland this week. This is a significant development as U.S.-China relations have remained tense following mutual tariff hikes in April. The meeting marks the first formal attempt to ease the tariffs stalemate, which had dragged Bitcoin down below $75,000 before its current rebound. Bitcoin’s recent recovery has also been supported by other macro tailwinds. The Federal Reserve’s May 7 decision to hold interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50% gave markets some relief, even as Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited “heightened uncertainty” due to Trump’s trade policy. Powell stressed the economy’s resilience and low unemployment as reasons to hold off on tightening further. He also acknowledged that inflation is still above target. With momentum growing and macro conditions stabilizing, a break above $100,000 for Bitcoin now appears to be achievable in the coming days. Bulls are watching closely as the asset tests a key psychological level.

44314100,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158304,1746688215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Amazon Warehouse Robot Boosts Efficiency with ‘Touch’,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/amazon-robot-warehouse-ai/,"In the fast-evolving world of technology, where automation is rapidly reshaping industries from finance to fulfillment, Amazon continues to push boundaries. For those following the disruptive potential of AI and automation, the latest development from the e-commerce giant offers a fascinating glimpse into the future of supply chains and logistics. Amazon has unveiled a new addition to its growing fleet of Amazon warehouse robots that brings a unique capability: a sense of touch. Introducing the Amazon Vulcan Robot Amazon’s newest creation, named Vulcan, is designed to tackle some of the more complex tasks within its vast storage facilities. Unlike previous generations of robots primarily focused on moving entire shelves or simple pick-and-place operations, the Amazon Vulcan robot is engineered for finer manipulation. Its standout feature is its ability to ‘feel’ the items it interacts with, thanks to integrated force sensors. Here’s a closer look at what makes Vulcan unique: Dual-Arm Design: Vulcan features two distinct arms. One is used for rearranging items within storage compartments, clearing space or organizing. Advanced Grasping: The second arm is equipped with both a camera for visual identification and a suction cup gripper. This combination allows it to locate and pick specific items. Tactile Feedback: The crucial innovation lies in the force sensors. These provide the robot with tactile feedback, allowing it to sense contact and potentially adjust its grip or movement based on the pressure it feels. This is a significant step towards more dexterous robotic manipulation. AI Training: Amazon states that Vulcan was trained using physical data, including force and touch feedback. This training enables it to pick approximately 75% of Amazon’s diverse stock. Self-Improvement: The robot is also designed with the capacity for self-improvement over time, suggesting a machine learning component that allows it to refine its picking strategies based on experience. AI Robotics in Action: Deployment and Performance The Amazon Vulcan robot isn’t just a lab prototype; it’s already being deployed in real-world warehouse environments. Amazon has placed Vulcan robots in operation in Spokane, Washington, and Hamburg, Germany. These early deployments are already showing promising results. According to Amazon, the Vulcan robots have processed half a million orders to date across these locations. This demonstrates their capability to handle actual customer fulfillment tasks and integrate into existing logistics workflows. The deployment highlights the practical application of AI robotics in enhancing operational efficiency. The Bigger Picture: Warehouse Automation at Amazon Vulcan is merely the latest iteration in Amazon’s extensive investment in warehouse automation. The company utilizes hundreds of thousands of robots globally to assist in fulfilling customer orders. These range from Kiva robots that move entire shelves to robotic arms that sort packages. The goal of this widespread warehouse automation is multi-faceted. It aims to increase the speed and accuracy of order fulfillment, reduce operational costs, and potentially improve safety by handling repetitive or heavy lifting tasks. The introduction of more sophisticated AI robotics like Vulcan signifies a move towards automating tasks that previously required human dexterity and judgment. Logistics AI and the Future Workforce The increasing integration of AI and robotics, particularly in areas like logistics AI, often sparks debate about the impact on human employment. Critics frequently express concern that Amazon’s substantial investments in automation are primarily aimed at replacing human workers. Amazon, however, counters this perspective. The company argues that robots like Vulcan serve to make warehouses safer places for human employees. By automating tasks that might involve repetitive strain, awkward movements, or working in confined spaces, they can potentially reduce workplace injuries. Amazon maintains that these robots work alongside human employees, handling specific tasks while people focus on others that require more complex problem-solving, judgment, or direct interaction. While the long-term impact on the workforce remains a subject of ongoing discussion, the immediate focus for Amazon appears to be on augmenting capabilities and enhancing efficiency through advanced AI robotics and warehouse automation. Conclusion The debut of the Amazon Vulcan robot marks a significant step forward in AI robotics, bringing a sense of ‘touch’ to warehouse automation. This capability allows the robot to handle a wider variety of items with greater precision, integrating tactile feedback into its operations. As the Amazon Vulcan robot is deployed and learns in real-world environments, it demonstrates the practical application of advanced logistics AI in optimizing fulfillment processes. While the debate surrounding automation and jobs continues, Amazon positions these developments as enhancing safety and efficiency within its vast network of Amazon warehouse robots, pointing towards a future where humans and advanced machines collaborate to meet the demands of global e-commerce.

Geoff Kendrick, the head of research at Standard Chartered Bank, disclosed his bullish outlook for the altcoin in a report shared on Tuesday. Kendrick notably asserts that BNB, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could hit a $2,775 price point by 2028. The price forecast, slightly bold, suggests that BNB bulls could accumulate gains going up to 364.047% over three years. As the analyst wrote in the research report; “BNB has traded almost exactly in line with an unweighted basket of bitcoin and ether since May 2021 in terms of both returns and volatility,” Kendrick’s optimistic outlook centers on the success of the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance, which he believes has armed the BNB token with long-term potential. With Binance maintaining its position as one of the top exchanges, “BNB’s value drivers are unlikely to change anytime soon,” the analyst added. The recent BNB spot-based ETF filing from VanEck has bolstered trust among key players, who are confident that an approval from the U.S. SEC could catalyze a major price rally. Despite upholding a bullish sentiment, Standard Chartered maintains that the asset faces many risks and market barriers. The bank observed that regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and macro instability could extensively affect growth. Meanwhile, BNB has entered the new week with bulls reclaiming buying power. As a result, the asset has cleared off losses from the previous weekend and is now emerging as the best performer within the top 5 category. BNB was valued at $613 per coin at the time of their report.",Cryptocurrency|News|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-08 07:17:41

Both tokens are missing important safety details, have no verified on-chain data, lack proper audits, and offer no information about their creators. This has raised concerns that these projects could be rug pulls or misleading schemes, aiming to trap unsuspecting investors. What’s more worrying is that these token names are linked to sensitive recent events in India. ‘Operation Sindoor’ refers to an Indian military strike on terror camps in Pakistan, carried out after a deadly terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir. Using these high-profile, emotional events to name crypto tokens seems like an attempt to exploit public sentiment and current news trends — a tactic sadly seen before in the crypto world. Concerns Over Pump and Dump Schemes Most of these tokens have small market caps and low trading volumes. Some of these appeared just hours after India launched the precision strikes on Tuesday. This has led to concerns over possible rug pulls or misleading schemes that may involve risks of pump-and-dump schemes. Memecoins, especially the ones launched on platforms like Solana’s Pump.fun, often see volatile price swings. These memecoins lack any intrinsic value and heavily depend on the hype and social media trends. Investors should be careful and avoid interacting with such unverified tokens, with no proper safety measures, that use trending or sensitive names to draw attention. CZ Shares A Peace Message Binance’s Changpeng Zhao shared a message of unity, as he called for peace and requested focus on economic growth and tech innovations to bring communities together. After the attack, Bitcoin’s price quickly fell below $96,300 on Tuesday. It is currently trading at $99,032, up 2.5% in the past day. The broader crypto market saw mixed reactions, with altcoins like Ethereum dipping slightly but holding steady. Despite initial volatility, cryptocurrencies have remained stable, with some witnessing gains today.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-08 07:18:18

The venture, named Nakamoto after the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin , Satoshi Nakamoto, aims to become a publicly traded company focused on acquiring and holding the cryptocurrency, CNBC reported , citing people familiar with the matter. The Information was first to cover the story. The funding round, which has been quietly in motion since January, includes $200 million in equity and $100 million in convertible debt, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC. While the firm has not officially announced the raise, an official reveal and merger with a Nasdaq-listed company is expected as early as next week. The combined entity is set to go public this summer, per the report. “No comment,” Bailey wrote in a May 7 post on X, apparently in response to the news about the Bitcoin ( BTC ) investment firm. Source: David Bailey Related: Texas House committee passes Bitcoin reserve bill for full floor vote New Bitcoin firms are launching Nakamoto’s strategy is modeled on that of companies like Strategy, which transformed itself into a Bitcoin-holding powerhouse under Michael Saylor. The firm will invest in and acquire businesses globally, in countries such as Brazil, Thailand and South Africa, while deploying Bitcoin as part of its capital structure. The venture is reportedly backed by high-profile investors and includes an advisory board featuring several prominent figures from the financial and crypto sectors. Bailey’s move comes amid renewed enthusiasm for institutional Bitcoin investment, following a series of major fundraising announcements from firms like Twenty One and Strive Asset Management. Related: Trump-linked Strive files for ‘Bitcoin Bond’ ETF On April 24, Twenty One Capital, led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald, said it was looking to supplant Saylor’s Strategy to become the “superior vehicle for investors seeking capital-efficient Bitcoin exposure.” On May 7, Strive Asset Management, founded by entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, also revealed plans to transition into a Bitcoin treasury company. Source: David Bailey The firm is going public through a reverse merger and plans to use the combined company’s stock to accumulate Bitcoin. Once the deal closes, Strive plans to issue about $1 billion in equity and debt and use the proceeds to accumulate BTC. “The pace of these new BTC companies launching is accelerating,” crypto influencer TylerD said in a post on X.

44314477,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158329,1746688835,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shockwave: SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony Enters Not Guilty Plea in Federal Court,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/safemoon-ceo-not-guilty/,"The legal troubles surrounding the popular yet controversial cryptocurrency project SafeMoon continue to unfold. In a significant development, the former SafeMoon CEO , Braden John Karony, has formally entered a not guilty plea in a federal court, pushing forward a trial that will scrutinize the operations and financial handling of the company’s assets. What Charges Does the Former SafeMoon CEO Face? Braden John Karony is facing serious allegations brought forth by U.S. federal prosecutors. The charges against him are grave and center on financial misconduct within the cryptocurrency space: Securities Fraud Conspiracy: Alleging that he conspired to defraud investors in connection with the offer and sale of SafeMoon securities. Wire Fraud Conspiracy: Accusing him of conspiring to commit wire fraud, typically involving the use of electronic communications to facilitate a fraudulent scheme. Money Laundering Conspiracy: Charging him with conspiring to launder money derived from illegal activities, specifically the alleged fraud and embezzlement of SFM token funds. These charges paint a picture of alleged deliberate actions to deceive investors and misuse funds intended for the project’s development or held by the company. The Road to the Not Guilty Plea: The Background SafeMoon gained significant traction in the cryptocurrency market in 2021, attracting a large community of investors drawn to its unique tokenomics, which included static rewards, LP acquisition, and manual burns. However, the project was plagued by accusations of being a pump-and-dump scheme and concerns over the safety of its liquidity pool, which was allegedly not fully locked as initially claimed. Investigations into SafeMoon’s practices intensified, leading to the arrest of key figures, including Braden Karony. The core of the government’s case revolves around allegations that millions of dollars worth of SFM tokens , which investors believed were secure or being used for legitimate project purposes, were instead embezzled and used for personal gain or other unauthorized activities between March 2021 and November 2022. Inside the Courtroom: Braden Karony’s Defense By entering a not guilty plea , Braden Karony asserts his innocence against all charges. This means his defense team will challenge the government’s evidence and narrative during the trial. The trial is currently underway in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, located in Brooklyn. The proceedings are expected to delve deep into SafeMoon’s internal workings, financial records, and communications among its leadership. The defense will likely argue that Karony did not engage in fraudulent conspiracies or money laundering, that the funds were handled appropriately according to company practices, or that the government’s interpretation of events is incorrect. Court trials involving complex financial instruments like cryptocurrencies and alleged large-scale fraud can be lengthy and intricate, requiring expert testimony and detailed examination of digital trails. What Does This Mean for SFM Token Holders and the Crypto Community? For holders of the SFM token , the trial’s outcome is of paramount importance. A conviction could further damage the token’s already precarious standing and potentially impact any future recovery or legal actions taken by investors. Conversely, an acquittal could provide a degree of vindication, although the project’s reputation has already suffered significant damage due to the allegations and associated crypto fraud concerns. More broadly, this case, like others involving high-profile crypto projects and their leaders, highlights the increasing scrutiny from regulatory bodies on the cryptocurrency space. It serves as a stark reminder of the risks involved in investing in unregulated or less-regulated projects and the potential for malfeasance by those in positions of power within these organizations. The outcome could set precedents for how similar cases of alleged crypto fraud are handled in the future. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Investors The SafeMoon saga presents several challenges and offers crucial insights for anyone involved in cryptocurrency: Lack of Transparency: Many crypto projects, including SafeMoon, have been criticized for a lack of clear, verifiable transparency regarding fund management and project development. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape means that legal interpretations of crypto activities, especially regarding securities laws, are still being shaped. Due Diligence is Crucial: Investors must conduct thorough research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research) before investing. Look for audits, clear documentation, transparent teams, and verifiable use of funds. Be Wary of Hype: Projects promising unrealistic returns or relying heavily on marketing buzz without substance should be approached with extreme caution. This case underscores the need for vigilance in the crypto market. While innovation abounds, so do potential pitfalls. The Trial Continues The trial of the former SafeMoon CEO , Braden John Karony, is scheduled to run until May 26th. As proceedings continue, more details are expected to emerge regarding the government’s evidence and the defense’s strategy. The verdict will undoubtedly be a significant event for the SafeMoon community and will resonate within the broader discussion about accountability and investor protection in the digital asset space. Summary: A High-Stakes Legal Battle In summary, the legal battle involving former SafeMoon CEO Braden Karony is a critical development for the project and the crypto world. His not guilty plea sets the stage for a federal trial addressing serious allegations of securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracies tied to the alleged embezzlement of SFM token funds. This case highlights ongoing concerns about crypto fraud and the importance of regulatory oversight and investor caution in the fast-paced digital asset market. The outcome will be closely watched as it could influence future legal approaches to similar cases.

As a result, the stock market has recorded massive losses over the past weeks. On the flip side, the crypto market has managed to stay afloat, with the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin outpacing stocks on multiple occasions. As David Duong, the Head of Research at Coinbase Institution, observed in a recent interview with Ash Bennington, the trend kicked off on Liberation Day, after April 2nd. As Juong is quoted as saying; “Stocks were trading down like 4 to 5 Standard Deviations lower. Whereas Bitcoin was moving maybe one and a half Standard Deviations Lower. And it happens not just for one day, but for several.” The development further suggests that Bitcoin, a somewhat volatile asset, has managed to maintain stability through the ongoing market chaos. “So you’re seeing that really from a risk-adjusted perspective, crypto in general and Bitcoin specifically is actually doing a lot better than we’ve been seeing inside traditional assets,” Juong observed. Bitcoin forges ahead as bulls prepare to test the $100,000 price mark The big bull has remained on course, with bullish momentum sustained over the past week, propelling bulls to attempt to reclaim the $100,000 price level.

Top Analyst Predicts a 100x Rally to $2.50,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-mutuum-finance-take-on-shiba-inu-in-the-upcoming-bull-run-top-analyst-predicts-a-100x-rally-to-2-50/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) may be the reigning meme coin marvel, but its dominance could be challenged in the next bull run by a fast-rising DeFi coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently priced at just $0.025, top analysts are predicting a staggering 10,000% rally that could see MUTM hit $2.50 in 2025 from its current price. At $0.025 in its Phase 4 presale, Mutuum Finance has already enrolled over 9,600 investors and has raked in $7.8 million. With more than half of this round already gone, a 20% price hike to $0.03 is just around the corner as Phase 5 looms. Phase 4 investors can now stand to gain as much as 140% once the token goes live at its projected $0.06 opening price. As investor interest rapidly builds and presale phases fill up fast, the question isn’t whether MUTM can match SHIB’s momentum, but whether it might just outpace it entirely. Presale Momentum and Launch Day Valuation Confirmation Mutuum Finance is in presale at $0.025 and thus a very sought-after token among investors. Phase 4 token holders will be rewarded with a 20% increase in value when the token hits Phase 5. Although the starting price when the token will go live will be $0.06, there are certain crypto experts who are predicting a stunning spike, by as much as $2.5, in the near future when the token goes on sale. This vicious price prediction compared to current presale value is the reason why MUTM continues to stir passionate debate among low-price DeFi project supporters. Driving DeFi Innovation with a Next-Gen Lending System Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in the DeFi arena through its two-model lending approach. Through its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) architecture, users can lend stablecoins to smart contract pools for returns. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) option permits borrowers and lenders to communicate with one another without intermediaries, generating a more agile lending platform. This twin mechanism offers an effortless and decentralized experience for users who want stability and returns. A full Certik audit is ongoing to further verify Mutuum Finance’s smart contract design. Along with its open-source status, the audit should increase transparency and improve confidence as the platform grows. Encouraging Community Development through Strategic Incentives To promote long-term engagement, Mutuum Finance has launched several reward schemes. An ongoing $100,000 giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. There is also a referral scheme that promotes community expansion by rewarding users who invite others to the platform. Early adopters also get access to feature updates and platform enhancements, promoting long-term user engagement and loyalty. Mutuum Finance also seeks to mitigate the volatility associated with algorithmic stablecoins by launching a fully USD-backed, over-collateralized stablecoin. The stablecoin will provide more predictability and a stable base for lending and borrowing operations on the platform. Smart Tokenomics With Long-Term Focus One of the revolutionary aspects of the Mutuum Finance model is its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. The Buy-and-Distribute mechanism is to purchase tokens in the open market and redistribute them to stakers, which ensures frequent user engagement and sustains the tokenomics of the project. By matching supply and rewarding users on a regular basis, the strategy entices committed, long-term investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been the face of meme coins, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a serious coin. At just $0.025 during its Phase 4 presale, analysts are predicting a 10,000% rally, potentially sending MUTM to $2.50 by 2025. With $7.8 million already raised and 9,600+ investors, MUTM is gaining momentum fast. As Phase 4 nears its end, the price will rise 20%, and Phase 5 will see even higher gains for early adopters. Now is the time to act before it hits the next big wave.

The US OCC , the primary regulator for national banks in the United States, has issued guidance that could fundamentally change how financial institutions crypto services are offered. If you’ve been wondering when your bank might finally offer easy ways to access digital currencies, this development is a significant step forward. What Did the US OCC Announce Regarding Banks and Crypto? In a notable shift from previous, more cautious stances, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has clarified its position on national banks engaging with cryptocurrency. According to recent statements, the OCC confirms that banks operating under its charter have the authority to act upon customer requests to buy and sell cryptocurrency assets. Key takeaways from the OCC’s guidance include: Execution of Trades: Banks can facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies when directed by their customers. This isn’t about banks trading on their own books speculatively, but rather acting as agents for their clients. Custody Services: The guidance reinforces banks’ ability to hold cryptocurrency assets in custody for customers, a position the OCC had previously indicated. Outsourcing Capabilities: Banks are explicitly allowed to partner with third parties to handle the technical aspects of custody and trade execution. This acknowledges the specialized infrastructure often required for digital assets. The OCC stressed that these activities must be conducted within the bounds of safety and soundness requirements. Essentially, while granting more freedom, the regulator still expects banks to manage risks appropriately. Why is This US OCC Stance Important for Trading Crypto? This regulatory clarity from the US OCC is crucial for the broader adoption and legitimization of trading crypto within traditional financial frameworks. For years, banks have been hesitant to dive deep into crypto services due to perceived regulatory ambiguity and risk aversion. This guidance provides a clearer path forward. Here’s why it matters: Increased Access: For everyday consumers and institutional investors, accessing crypto through their existing banking relationships could become significantly easier and potentially safer compared to navigating potentially less regulated crypto-native platforms. Institutional Confidence: More explicit permission from a major regulator like the OCC can boost confidence among financial institutions crypto departments, encouraging them to invest in the necessary infrastructure and compliance frameworks. Market Liquidity: As more traditional players enter the space, it could potentially increase liquidity in the crypto markets. Enhanced Security: Banks are accustomed to robust security and compliance protocols. Integrating crypto services into this environment could offer customers a higher level of security and consumer protection. This builds upon previous actions by the OCC, such as lifting a ban on banks providing cryptocurrency services and easing regulations that were seen as discriminatory against certain crypto-related businesses. The trend indicates a move towards integrating digital assets into the traditional banking system, albeit cautiously. What Challenges Do Banks Still Face with Crypto Regulation? While the OCC’s stance is positive for banks crypto integration, significant challenges remain. Navigating the complex landscape of crypto regulation involves more than just the OCC. Key challenges include: Regulatory Patchwork: Banks must contend with rules from multiple agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, FinCEN, and potentially the SEC and CFTC depending on the nature of the digital asset. Harmonizing these different regulatory perspectives is complex. Compliance Costs: Implementing robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures for crypto assets is technically demanding and expensive. Banks need systems to monitor transactions on public blockchains and identify associated risks. Technology Integration: Safely integrating blockchain technology and crypto asset management systems into existing banking infrastructure requires significant investment and technical expertise. Risk Management: Banks must develop sophisticated risk management frameworks to address the volatility of crypto assets, cybersecurity threats specific to digital wallets, and operational risks associated with new technologies. Talent Acquisition: Finding and retaining talent with expertise in both traditional finance and blockchain technology is crucial. Despite the OCC’s green light, the path for financial institutions crypto services is not without hurdles. Each bank will need to carefully assess its capabilities and risk appetite before offering extensive crypto services. Examples and Actionable Insights for Financial Institutions Following the OCC’s guidance, we are likely to see more banks exploring or expanding their crypto offerings. While specific examples of major banks launching extensive trading crypto services directly to retail customers are still emerging, many have already begun with: Custody Services: Offering institutional clients secure storage for digital assets. Blockchain Technology Exploration: Using blockchain for internal processes like payments or trade finance. Investment Products: Providing access to crypto investment products like futures or trusts (often through brokerage arms). For banks considering entering this space or expanding their footprint, actionable insights include: Understand the Regulatory Landscape: Go beyond the OCC and understand the expectations of all relevant regulators. Develop Robust Compliance Programs: Build out AML/KYC and transaction monitoring systems specifically tailored for crypto assets. Invest in Secure Technology: Prioritize secure custody solutions and reliable trading infrastructure, whether built in-house or outsourced to trusted partners. Educate Staff: Ensure employees understand the basics of crypto assets and associated risks. Start Small and Scale: Consider starting with limited offerings, such as custody for institutional clients, before moving into more complex areas like retail trading. The move by the US OCC is a signal that the regulatory environment is evolving, making it increasingly viable for financial institutions crypto strategies to move from theoretical discussions to practical implementation. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation and Banks? The OCC’s guidance is a significant piece of the puzzle but not the final word on crypto regulation for banks. Future developments will likely include: Further Clarity from Other Regulators: The Federal Reserve and FDIC are expected to provide more detailed guidance on specific crypto activities. Potential Legislation: Congress may introduce legislation to create a more unified framework for digital assets. International Coordination: Regulators globally are working on frameworks, and U.S. rules will need to consider international standards. Focus on Specific Asset Types: Regulations may differentiate more clearly between stablecoins, utility tokens, and other digital asset categories. The trajectory suggests a future where banks crypto services are more common, but the pace and nature of adoption will be heavily influenced by ongoing regulatory developments and how effectively banks manage the inherent risks of trading crypto . Conclusion: A New Era for Banks and Digital Assets The U.S. OCC’s confirmation that national banks can act on customer requests to buy and sell crypto assets marks a pivotal moment. It signals a growing acceptance of digital assets within the traditional financial system and provides a clearer regulatory runway for financial institutions crypto strategies. While challenges related to compliance, technology, and the broader regulatory landscape remain, this guidance is a strong indicator that accessing and trading crypto through established banking channels is becoming a tangible reality. This move by the US OCC doesn’t just affect banks; it has implications for investors, consumers, and the future direction of crypto regulation in the United States.

According to Bill Morgan, the long-standing battle between the U.S. regulatory body and the cryptocurrency firm Ripple has not officially come to an end. The lawyer’s notation has left market players more uncertain, as Ripple participants had already begun to celebrate Ripple’s perceived victory over the previous weeks. Notably, the four-year legal battle reportedly came to a close after Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, made a big revelation in April, stating that the case against the company had been dissolved. “Today is a victory—and a long overdue surrender by the SEC,” he remarked. Ripple proponents were understandably convinced that the firm had emerged victorious, mainly because the SEC had dropped multiple investigations and lawsuits filed against other notable cryptocurrency companies. Remarkably, the regulator is yet to acknowledge and affirm Garlinghouse’s statement officially, although market participants have continued to maintain optimism. However, as the lawyer observed, certainty can only be guaranteed after court proceedings have been carried out. “It [the Ripple vs SEC lawsuit] is not over yet. Things need to happen first in court”. He wrote . In a follow-up post, the lawyer further highlighted Ripple’s Q1 2025 quarterly market report, noting that the crypto firm has officially referenced the lawsuit. “I think this is the first explicit public reference by Ripple that the SEC agreed to request that the Court vacate the permanent injunction.” Bill Morgan raised concerns over notations on the report, stating that the SEC has officially withdrawn its appeal, despite the SEC commissioner not making any formal statement on the situation. https://twitter.com/belisarius2020/status/1919703964276105438?s=46&t=qzsvHvtDB3yjTaoaylh-2g The lawyer’s assertion comes as Ripple’s CLO Stuart Aldertoty reiterated that the SEC’s lawsuit was filed without proper legal justification.

The leak included a MySQL database dump shared publicly online. It contained crypto-related information that could help blockchain analysts trace the group’s illicit financial flows. Ransomware is a type of malware used by malicious actors. It locks its target’s files or computer systems, making them inaccessible. The attackers typically demand a ransom payment, often in digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), in exchange for a decryption key to unlock the files. LockBit is one of the most notorious crypto ransomware groups. In February 2024, 10 countries launched a joint operation to disrupt the group, saying that the organization had caused billions in damages to key infrastructure. Source: ReyXBF No Bitcoin private keys leaked While almost 60,000 Bitcoin wallets were leaked, no private keys were included. One X user shared a conversation with a LockBit operator, confirming the breach. However, the LockBit person said no private keys or data were lost. Despite this, analysts at Bleeping Computer said the database contained 20 tables, including a “builds” table. This included individual ransomware builds created by the organization’s affiliates. The data also identified some of the target companies for the builds. In addition, the leaked database also included a “chats” table. This table contained over 4,400 negotiation messages between victims and the ransomware organization. Related: Crypto crime in 2024 likely exceeded $51B, far higher than reported: Chainalysis LockBit hack tied to Everest ransomware breach It’s unclear who was behind the breach and how they got into LockBit’s operations, but Bleeping Computer analysts said the message used in the Everest ransomware site breach matched the one used in LockBit. The analysts suggested that there may be a link between the two incidents. The breach highlighted the role that crypto plays in the ransomware economy. Each victim is usually assigned an address to pay their ransom, allowing the affiliates to monitor payments while attempting to obscure ties to their main wallets. The exposure of the addresses allows law enforcement and blockchain investigators to track patterns and potentially link past ransom payments to known wallets.

In a recent post on X, Peterson said the Fed has made a big mistake by tightening monetary policy too much. According to him, this move is hurting the U.S. economy—and stopping Bitcoin from reaching its true potential. Is the Fed Making the Economy Worse? Peterson explained that the Fed has reduced the money supply too aggressively, which is now causing deflation. He pointed out that falling prices, lower spending, and slowing growth are signs that the economy is weakening—not strengthening. “The Fed still doesn’t realize the real issue is its own policy,” Peterson wrote. He believes the U.S. economy is shrinking because there isn’t enough money circulating. This situation makes it harder for both businesses and consumers to thrive. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Advances to $100K-Has The BTC Bull Run Begun?

Peterson says this is proof that many people are struggling, even if the job numbers look good. Bitcoin’s Growth Being Held Back? Peterson claims that Bitcoin could be 30% to 50% higher today if the Fed had managed a proper “soft landing” for the economy. Instead, the current policies are limiting its price growth. He warned that both the economy and crypto market could feel the effects of these policy mistakes for years.

XRP price action has shown notable volatility, with price moving from support levels around $2.10 to test the upper resistance zone near $2.20.

Senate Bill 21 (SB 21)—which proposes creating a Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve—has passed the House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency with a 9-4 vote, split along party lines. The bill was previously approved by the Texas Senate in March and now moves to a full floor vote. If passed, it heads to Governor Greg Abbott, a long-time crypto supporter who accepted Bitcoin donations back in 2014 and has repeatedly expressed his vision to make Texas the “crypto capital” of the U.S. Texas Bill Details and Scope Filed by Republican Senator Charles Schwertner in January, SB 21 initially focused solely on Bitcoin. However, it was later revised to include other digital assets with a market cap of $500 billion or more—a threshold that currently includes only Bitcoin. The reserve would be overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar. The Texas House committee has approved SB 21, next steps a Texas House vote by all members and the governor’s signature. It looks likely that Texas will have a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the big open question is how much BTC will be acquired. https://t.co/vXq5bqNw0d pic.twitter.com/FGONjPLzWT — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) May 8, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Finally Approaches $100K After Almost 100 Days, New ATHS Soon? , Arizona and New Hampshire Lead the Way While Texas inches forward, Arizona has already made its move . Governor Katie Hobbs signed legislation establishing a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund, independent of taxpayer money. Arizona can now stake unclaimed crypto, earn staking rewards, and receive airdrops to grow the fund. Just one day earlier, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte signed House Bill 302, allowing the state treasury to invest in top cryptocurrencies with a $500 billion+ market cap —currently meaning Bitcoin-only. Mixed Reactions From Other States Momentum is growing, but not all states are on board. Florida suddenly pulled two Bitcoin reserve bills from its legislative schedule on May 3—the same day it passed over 230 unrelated measures, including bans on school smartphone use and fluoride in water. Meanwhile, Sweden is also exploring the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve, with a Swedish MP proposing the initiative to the country’s finance minister. With the Texas legislative session ending on June 2, the countdown is on. All eyes are now on whether SB 21 will make it through the final vote and officially place Bitcoin in Texas’ treasury strategy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Among the most insightful indicators for investors looking to gauge future price movements is the flow of stablecoins onto exchanges. Recent activity on Binance , one of the world’s largest crypto exchanges, has caught the attention of analysts, suggesting a potential shift in Crypto Market Sentiment . What Do These Stablecoin Inflows Mean for Crypto Market Sentiment? When large amounts of stablecoins, such as USDT, USDC, or FDUSD, move onto cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance , it’s often interpreted as a sign that investors are preparing to buy crypto assets. Unlike fiat currency deposits, stablecoins are already within the crypto ecosystem, making them readily available to trade for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins. Therefore, a significant increase in Stablecoin Inflows can indicate growing buying pressure and, consequently, a more optimistic market outlook. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost recently highlighted a substantial uptick in stablecoin flows specifically directed towards Binance over a three-day period. This observation is particularly noteworthy because Binance holds significant market share, making its activity a strong proxy for overall market sentiment. The analyst’s findings suggest that after a period of consolidation or perhaps even decline, confidence among market participants might be improving. This influx of capital, specifically earmarked for potential crypto purchases, provides tangible evidence that market participants are not just holding their positions but are actively positioning themselves to enter or increase their exposure to the Cryptocurrency market. This shift from a holding or withdrawing pattern to one of depositing stablecoins is a key indicator that analysts watch closely. Deep Dive into Binance’s Recent Activity The data from CryptoQuant paints a clear picture: significant capital is flowing into Binance. The analyst Darkfost specifically pointed out that May 6th recorded the largest daily stablecoin inflow since April, hitting a staggering $1 billion entering the platform in just 24 hours. This single-day figure is a powerful illustration of the scale of capital ready to be deployed. Over the preceding three days, the cumulative inflow was even more substantial. Such concentrated inflows suggest deliberate positioning by a large number of investors or significant entities. This isn’t just small retail traders making minor deposits; the volume points towards substantial capital movements, potentially by larger players or institutions using stablecoins as their preferred on-ramp onto major exchanges like Binance. Comparing this inflow volume to previous periods provides context. The fact that May 6th’s inflow was the largest since April indicates a notable change in pace. April saw periods of market volatility and price corrections, which might have led to stablecoin outflows or holding off-exchange. The reversal of this trend in early May, particularly with such a significant spike, strongly supports the narrative of improving Crypto Market Sentiment and renewed interest in acquiring crypto assets. Understanding the specific exchange where these inflows occur is also vital. Binance’s global reach and liquidity make it a primary venue for large trades. Therefore, activity on Binance is often seen as a bellwether for the broader Cryptocurrency market. Why Stablecoins are Key Crypto Trends Indicators Stablecoins play a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Their value is pegged to a stable asset, usually the US dollar, minimizing price fluctuations. This stability makes them ideal for several purposes: Trading Pairs: Most crypto assets are traded against stablecoins (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDC). This liquidity is essential for market function. On-Ramps and Off-Ramps: Stablecoins facilitate easy entry into and exit from the crypto market without needing to constantly convert back to fiat currency. Storing Value During Volatility: Traders often convert volatile assets into stablecoins during periods of uncertainty, essentially moving to the sidelines without leaving the crypto ecosystem entirely. Yield Generation: Stablecoins can be used in DeFi protocols to earn interest, providing an alternative to traditional savings accounts. Because stablecoins are the primary medium for buying volatile crypto assets on exchanges, tracking their movement is a critical part of analyzing Crypto Trends . Inflows suggest intent to buy, while outflows might suggest intent to sell or move funds off-exchange for holding or other purposes. The recent surge in stablecoin deposits onto Binance is a clear signal that a significant amount of ‘dry powder’ is being positioned on the exchange, ready to potentially fuel upward price movements. This makes monitoring stablecoin flows a vital tool for anyone navigating the Cryptocurrency market. Navigating the Current Cryptocurrency Landscape The recent Stablecoin Inflows into Binance are a compelling piece of the puzzle, but they are just one factor in the complex Cryptocurrency landscape. While the analyst points to growing optimism, it’s important to consider the broader context: Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rates, and inflation all influence investor risk appetite, which in turn affects the crypto market. Regulatory Developments: News regarding crypto regulation in major economies can significantly impact sentiment and market flows. Specific Asset News: Developments related to Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum upgrades, or news about specific altcoins can drive targeted buying or selling pressure. Technical Analysis: Price charts and technical indicators provide insights into market structure and potential future movements, complementing fundamental analysis based on flows. The surge in stablecoin inflows suggests underlying demand is strengthening, which is generally a positive sign for Crypto Market Sentiment . However, investors should always conduct their own research and consider multiple data points before making investment decisions. While the ‘dry powder’ is on the exchange, it still needs to be deployed to impact prices. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights For those interested in Crypto Trends , the recent activity on Binance offers several takeaways: Acknowledge the Signal: Recognize that significant stablecoin inflows are historically associated with potential buying pressure. Stay Informed: Continue monitoring exchange flows, particularly on major platforms like Binance, as they provide real-time insights into market positioning. Combine Indicators: Don’t rely solely on stablecoin flows. Look at trading volume, price action, on-chain data, and broader news to form a comprehensive view of Crypto Market Sentiment . Consider Your Strategy: If you were waiting on the sidelines during a downturn, increased stablecoin inflows might align with your criteria for re-entering or increasing your position in the Cryptocurrency market, but ensure it fits your risk tolerance and investment plan. Be Patient: Inflows indicate *potential* buying. The actual execution of trades takes time and can be influenced by market events. The presence of substantial stablecoin reserves on exchanges like Binance creates the potential for upward price movement, but it’s not a guarantee. It signifies readiness to buy, driven by what appears to be improving sentiment among participants in the Cryptocurrency space. Summary: A Glimmer of Optimism on Binance In conclusion, the recent analysis highlighting a significant surge in Stablecoin Inflows onto Binance , including a $1 billion inflow on May 6th, is a compelling indicator of potentially improving Crypto Market Sentiment . This influx of capital suggests that market participants are positioning themselves to acquire Cryptocurrency assets, viewing the current landscape with renewed optimism after a period of uncertainty. While stablecoin flows are just one metric among many, they offer valuable insight into the readiness of capital to enter the market. This notable trend on one of the world’s largest exchanges reinforces the idea that positive Crypto Trends may be emerging. Investors and enthusiasts alike should view this development as a strong signal worth monitoring closely as the market continues to evolve.

On May 7, the Texas House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency approved Senate Bill 21 in a 9-4 vote , clearing one of the final hurdles before it can land on Governor Greg Abbott’s desk. Initially introduced by Republican Senator Charles Schwertner in January as a Bitcoin ( BTC ) only proposal, SB 21 was later refiled in February to allow for other digital assets with a minimum $500 billion market cap over the past 12 months. Bitcoin is currently the only digital currency to meet this criterion. If passed into law, the bill would allow the state comptroller to manage the reserve and invest state funds in eligible crypto assets. The bill had previously passed the Texas Senate on March 6 with a 25-5 vote. According to data from Bitcoin legislation tracker Bitcoin Laws, SB 21 is not the only crypto-related legislation Texas lawmakers have introduced this year. In March, HB 4258 was proposed to permit the state comptroller to invest up to $250 million of the Economic Stabilization Fund into Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, SB 778 , introduced in February this year, focuses on accepting taxes and donations in crypto and imposes a minimum five-year holding period for any Bitcoin acquired by the state.

A day before SB 21 passed the committee in Texas, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs signed HB 2749 into law, creating a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund funded by unclaimed digital assets. On the same day, New Hampshire Governor Kelly Ayotte signed HB 302 , making it the first state to legally authorize public fund investment in Bitcoin and other qualifying assets. Up to 10% of the state’s general fund can now be invested in digital assets exceeding a $500 billion market cap, again effectively limiting it to Bitcoin. Currently, 37 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills are under review across 18 U.S. states. The number was initially higher, but many proposals have failed to gain legislative support. Florida became the latest to shelve its Bitcoin reserve plans on May 6, joining Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Montana, and Oklahoma, all of which saw similar bills rejected in recent House or Senate votes.

The move has been widely celebrated within the cryptoverse. “Second state in two weeks. Not a fickle decision. A law. Bitcoin is entering the mainstream,” Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley observed in a post on the X social media site. Arizona Approves Unclaimed Crypto Law The bill, sponsored by House Commerce Committee Chairman Jeff Weninger, establishes a reserve fund for unclaimed digital assets if the owner fails to respond to communications over a three-year period. Qualified custodians can stake the reserve assets to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which can then be deposited into what Arizona has dubbed a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund. “This law ensures Arizona doesn’t leave value sitting on the table and puts us in a position to lead the country in how we secure, manage, and ultimately benefit from abandoned digital currency,” Weninger postulated in a May 7 statement . The signing comes shortly after Hobbs vetoed a separate bill, SB 1025, which would have allowed Arizona’s treasury and retirement systems to invest up to 10% of their assets in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In her veto message, the governor stressed that “Arizonans’ retirement system is strong because it sticks to proven investment strategies,” and that it’s inappropriate to expose the state’s retirement funds to untested investments like cryptocurrencies. Multiple states in the US are weighing strategic reserve legislation, though many have stumbled into roadblocks. New Hampshire, however, beat several others to the punch this year after its Governor Kelly Ayotte approved a strategic Bitcoin reserve bill on May 6. The New Hampshire bill authorizes the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of public funds in a digital asset that has at least $500 billion in market capitalization. Bitcoin is currently the only crypto that meets that threshold. The state-level efforts to establish Bitcoin reserves come amid a push from President Donald and Republican lawmakers to do the same in the federal government. Trump signed an executive order in March authorizing the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a separate Digital Asset stockpile.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|arizona|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-08 07:57:21

While global conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza are anticipated to dominate the discussions, Bloomberg reported on May 7 that North Korea’s increasingly sophisticated cyber operations have become a pressing concern for G7 nations. The stolen digital assets are believed to be a crucial funding source for the country’s weapons programs, prompting calls for coordinated international action. Lazarus Group Leads North Korea’s Surge in High-Profile Crypto Hacks North Korean hacking groups, particularly the notorious Lazarus Group, have been linked to numerous high-profile attacks. The group was reportedly behind a $1.4 billion heist targeting crypto exchange Bybit in February—the largest known crypto theft to date. In total, North Korean-affiliated actors are believed to have stolen over $1.3 billion across 47 incidents in 2024 alone, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. In addition to external breaches, North Korea has employed subtler strategies such as infiltrating crypto companies through rogue IT workers posing as freelance developers. In January, the United States, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint warning about this insider threat. These tactics, experts say, are part of a broader effort to bypass international sanctions and funnel illicit proceeds into the country’s missile development programs.

In April, operatives linked to Lazarus reportedly established three shell companies—including two in the U.S.—to distribute malware targeting crypto developers. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Kraken recently revealed it had uncovered and blocked an infiltration attempt by a suspected North Korean agent posing as a job candidate. The candidate failed a series of identity verification traps set by the company’s security team. Adding to the growing body of evidence, cybersecurity researcher Heiner Garcia staged a dummy job interview with another suspected North Korean operative. The individual inadvertently disclosed clues that linked him to past crypto scams tied to the regime. Crypto Hacks Surge in 2025 as Losses Top $1.74 Billion in Four Months Hackers stole over $92.4 million from crypto projects in April 2025 alone, according to blockchain security firm Immunefi . The figure represents a 27.3% year-over-year increase and more than double the losses reported in March. April’s attacks occurred across 15 incidents, with two major exploits accounting for the bulk of the damage. UPCX, an open-source platform, lost $70 million in a single attack, while decentralized exchange KiloEx was hit for $7.5 million. Other affected projects included Loopscale, ZKsync, Term Labs, and Bitcoin Mission, each experiencing losses exceeding $1 million. Cumulatively, the first four months of 2025 have already seen $1.74 billion in crypto losses—more than all of 2024, which totaled $1.49 billion. Immunefi previously noted that Q1 2025 was the worst quarter for hacks in crypto history, driven largely by massive breaches of centralized exchanges Phemex and Bybit.

Citing sources close to the project, Bloomberg reported on May 7 that Robinhood’s upcoming initiative would enable users in Europe to trade tokenized versions of U.S. securities—potentially a game-changer in the world of cross-border investing. Tokenized Stocks The move comes as Robinhood continues to deepen its European footprint. Just last month, the company secured a brokerage license in Lithuania, a strategic gateway that enables operations across the EU. With an earlier deal in 2024 to acquire crypto exchange Bitstamp, the groundwork for this expansion has been steadily taking shape. Now, with blockchain at the center of its next phase, Robinhood appears ready to challenge conventional finance yet again. Two crypto-native firms—Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation—are reportedly in the running to partner with Robinhood on the infrastructure side. While none of the involved parties have confirmed the collaboration, the implications are significant. Tokenization: A Financial Revolution in the Making Tokenization, the process of converting real-world assets like stocks into blockchain-based tokens, is increasingly being explored by financial institutions. For Robinhood, this technology could allow them to bypass some of the bottlenecks associated with traditional market structures—such as slow settlement times, restricted trading hours, and high operational costs. CEO Vladimir Tenev echoed the sentiment in a recent interview, contrasting the rigid IPO process with the fluidity of digital assets: “You can sit down in front of some software, create a coin and have it be trading in 5 minutes That’s a scary thing. It’s also an incredibly powerful thing.” While the project’s details are still under wraps, the timing is strategic. European investors have long faced hurdles in accessing U.S. securities. If Robinhood successfully implements blockchain-based tokenized trading, it could offer a streamlined and cost-effective solution—potentially reshaping how retail investors interact with global markets. On May 7, Robinhood’s shares gained 2.7% on the Nasdaq, possibly buoyed by news of its crypto and blockchain ambitions.

44315739,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158380,1746691254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Crypto Regulation: Treasury Holds Crucial Roundtables on Future Policy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-regulation-treasury/,"Big news is brewing in the world of US Crypto Regulation ! The U.S. Department of the Treasury is set to host a series of private roundtables next week, bringing together key players from the cryptocurrency industry. This isn’t just a casual chat; these discussions are poised to delve into critical areas that will likely shape the future landscape for digital assets in America. Reported initially by Token Relations co-founder Jacquelyn Melinek and reposted by Crypto in America host Eleanor Terrett, these meetings signal a significant step towards more direct engagement between regulators and the innovators building the decentralized future. Why is the Treasury Crypto Roundtable So Important? When the Treasury Crypto division decides to sit down with industry experts, everyone in the crypto space pays attention. These aren’t public hearings, but private, focused discussions aimed at fostering a deeper understanding and potentially paving the way for clearer guidelines or regulations. The fact that the Treasury is initiating these talks underscores the growing importance and complexity of the crypto ecosystem in the national and global financial system. These roundtables provide a crucial platform for: Direct Communication: Industry leaders can share their perspectives, challenges, and innovations directly with policymakers. Information Gathering: The Treasury can gain firsthand insights into how decentralized technologies actually work and are being used. Identifying Key Issues: Discussions will pinpoint the most pressing concerns from both the regulatory and industry standpoints. The outcomes of such meetings, while not immediately resulting in policy, often inform future regulatory approaches, legislative proposals, and enforcement priorities. For anyone involved in or watching the crypto space, understanding the topics on the agenda is key. Exploring the Core Topics: Decentralized Finance, Banking, and Cybersecurity The reports indicate the discussions will center around three major pillars: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) , Banking, and Cybersecurity. These areas represent some of the most dynamic, yet challenging, aspects of the crypto world from a regulatory perspective. What’s on the Table for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)? Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has exploded in popularity, offering services like lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries. However, its decentralized nature also presents unique regulatory puzzles. Discussions around DeFi will likely cover: Identifying Responsible Parties: How do you regulate protocols that are governed by code or decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)? Consumer Protection: How can users be protected from risks like smart contract bugs, rug pulls, and impermanent loss in a permissionless environment? Illicit Finance Risks: How can DeFi platforms mitigate risks associated with money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion? Market Integrity: How do you ensure fair and transparent markets when activities occur across numerous protocols globally? Industry participants will likely advocate for approaches that foster innovation while addressing these risks, perhaps proposing industry best practices or limited regulatory touchpoints that don’t stifle growth. Navigating the Intersection of Crypto Banking The relationship between traditional banking and crypto is evolving rapidly. More banks are exploring offering crypto services, while crypto native firms are seeking access to banking infrastructure. The term Crypto Banking encompasses various interactions, from banks holding crypto assets to stablecoin reserves and payments. Key points in these discussions might include: Stablecoin Regulation: How should stablecoins, particularly large-scale ones, be regulated to ensure stability and protect users? Are they deposits, securities, or something else? Bank Exposure to Crypto: What are the prudential risks for banks engaging with crypto assets? How should capital and liquidity requirements be adjusted? On- and Off-Ramps: Ensuring clear, compliant pathways for converting between fiat and crypto is crucial for market functioning and preventing illicit activity. Custody of Digital Assets: What are the standards and requirements for financial institutions holding crypto on behalf of clients? Achieving clarity in Crypto Banking is essential for both traditional finance seeking to enter the space and crypto companies needing reliable financial services. Strengthening Cybersecurity in the Digital Asset Space Cybersecurity is not unique to crypto, but the immutable nature of blockchain transactions and the value stored in digital wallets make robust security paramount. High-profile hacks and exploits underscore the need for constant vigilance. Treasury’s focus on cybersecurity likely involves: Infrastructure Security: Protecting exchanges, custodians, and other critical market infrastructure from attacks. Wallet Security: Discussing best practices for securing private keys and protecting user funds. Threat Intelligence Sharing: How can government and industry collaborate to identify and mitigate emerging cyber threats? Incident Response: Planning for how to respond effectively when security breaches occur. Enhancing cybersecurity is a shared goal that benefits users, businesses, and the stability of the financial system as a whole. These discussions are vital for building trust and resilience in the crypto ecosystem. The Broader Context of US Crypto Policy These roundtables fit into a larger picture of evolving Crypto Policy in the United States. Various government agencies, including the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the SEC, and the CFTC, are grappling with how to appropriately oversee this rapidly developing sector. Executive Orders have called for a coordinated approach, and reports from different agencies have outlined potential risks and recommendations. The Treasury’s role is particularly significant given its mandate covering financial stability, sanctions, and combating financial crime. Their engagement with the industry suggests a move towards more informed and potentially more tailored regulatory actions rather than broad, sweeping mandates. For industry participants, these meetings are an opportunity to educate policymakers and advocate for frameworks that support responsible innovation. For regulators, they are a chance to understand the practical implications of potential rules and identify areas where clarity is most needed. What Could Be the Potential Outcomes? While these are private, non-policy-making discussions, they are foundational. Insights gained here could influence: Future Guidance: The Treasury or other agencies might issue clarifying guidance on existing regulations as they apply to crypto. Legislative Proposals: The information could inform recommendations to Congress for new laws specifically addressing crypto, DeFi, or stablecoins. Enforcement Priorities: A better understanding of the landscape helps regulators identify areas of highest risk requiring enforcement attention. International Collaboration: The U.S. approach often influences global standards, making these domestic discussions relevant internationally. The path forward for US Crypto Regulation is still being charted, and these Treasury roundtables are undoubtedly a crucial step in that process. In Conclusion: A Step Towards Clarity? The U.S. Treasury’s decision to host private roundtables with the crypto industry on topics like Decentralized Finance , Crypto Banking , and cybersecurity is a positive sign of increased engagement. It indicates a recognition of the complexity and importance of the digital asset space and a willingness to seek direct input from those building within it. While the immediate impact remains to be seen, these discussions are vital for fostering a more informed approach to Crypto Policy . Industry participants have a chance to educate, and regulators have an opportunity to gain clarity, potentially paving the way for more effective and balanced regulation in the future.

44315931,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/can-you-mine-bitcoin-with-a-gaming-pc,1746691260,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC? Here’s what you need to know,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/can-you-mine-bitcoin-with-a-gaming-pc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Is your gaming PC capable of mining crypto? As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing. From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight. And if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily. It’s a fair question: Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC? The short answer: Yes, but it won’t be worth it. The long answer: Understanding Bitcoin mining Mining is the process that adds new BTC to circulation. More importantly, it’s how the Bitcoin network stays secure and functions without a central authority. Every time someone sends or receives Bitcoin, miners verify and record that transaction. This is all powered by proof-of-work (PoW) , a consensus mechanism where miners race to encode transactions in a format that is acceptable to the network. It’s essentially just a massive guessing game, where miners try different inputs until one generates a hash with enough leading zeroes to meet the network’s current difficulty target. For example, a valid Bitcoin block might start with something like 00000000000000000000956e9ff76455.... The first miner to hit that valid hash wins the reward: currently 3.125 BTC, plus transaction fees. The issue is, to generate that many leading zeroes in 2025, you’re looking at around 10³¹ hash attempts on average to produce a valid hash. As you can imagine, that takes a lot of power. Did you know? The energy used to mine a single Bitcoin block today could power an average US household for over 10 years. That’s the cost of making sure the network stays decentralized and tamper-proof. From CPUs to ASICs: How mining hardware evolved It didn’t use to be this hard to mine Bitcoin. As more miners joined the network and the total computing power surged, the protocol automatically ramped up the difficulty. That’s by design. Bitcoin adjusts to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, no matter how much horsepower is thrown at it. Back in 2009, Bitcoin mining for beginners meant using a regular laptop CPU. Then came the rise of GPUs — graphics cards originally built for gaming — which dramatically improved mining performance. But then came ASICs, application-specific integrated circuits , designed solely to mine Bitcoin. These machines are vastly more powerful and energy-efficient than any GPU. By 2015, they had effectively taken over the mining scene. Fast forward to 2025: ASICs still reign supreme. If you’re wondering about the best setup for mining Bitcoin on PC, know that ASIC vs. GPU mining isn’t a fair fight anymore. That doesn’t mean your gaming rig is useless, but it does mean you’ll want to consider alternative strategies. Did you know? After Sept. 30, 2025, 4GB GPUs will no longer work due to DAG size limits . Gaming PCs vs. ASIC miners Bitcoin mining with a gaming PC, even with a high-end GPU like the RTX 4090, is inefficient and unlikely to be profitable due to low performance, high energy costs and hardware wear-and-tear compared to ASIC miners. Performance: Can your GPU keep up? Let’s say you’re using an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 — top of the line. Sounds heavy-duty, right? Not for Bitcoin GPU mining. That card might do well on other algorithms like Ethash (used in Ethereum Classic ), but when it comes to Bitcoin’s SHA-256, it barely scratches the surface. Even the mighty RTX 4090 gets crushed by ASICs. A high-end ASIC like the Antminer S21 Pro pumps out 200 terahashes per second (TH/s) — that’s trillions of hashes per second, compared to maybe a few hundred megahashes per second from a GPU. That’s a millionfold difference. Efficiency: The electricity bill tells the real story Let’s talk about power. A GPU like the 4090 pulls around 450 watts. But the hashing performance it delivers is minuscule compared to the watts consumed. ASICs, by contrast, draw more power (e.g., 3,500 watts) but deliver far better output — roughly 17.5 joules per terahash. In short, even if you’re mining Bitcoin on a gaming PC 24/7, the energy cost per dollar earned is painful. Is Bitcoin mining profitable with a gaming PC? Not really. Especially when you factor in cooling, hardware strain and your local energy prices. Economics: Does it make any sense? Even with low electricity rates, the ROI on mining Bitcoin from home with a gaming computer is near zero — if not outright negative. Solo mining ? Forget it. The chances of hitting a block are microscopic. Pool mining ? Your contribution is so small compared to ASIC farms that the payouts will be negligible. And then there’s the wear and tear. GPUs weren’t designed to run at full capacity around the clock. Long-term mining can shorten their lifespan and may void warranties. Did you know? WhatToMine is a useful site that shows what coins are most profitable to mine with your exact setup. Just plug in your GPU, and it does the rest. Alternative cryptocurrencies for gaming PCs If Bitcoin mining on PC feels like bringing a Nerf gun to a tank fight, don’t lose hope. There are still coins designed to be mined with GPUs in 2025 — and some even reward users fairly for it. Let’s take a look at such cryptocurrencies: Ethereum Classic (ETC): GPU-friendly legacy chain Still using the Ethash algorithm, Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) is a solid option for GPU miners. Blocks are mined every 13 seconds with a 3.2 ETC reward. Ravencoin (RVN): Built for the people Ravencoin uses KAWPOW , an algorithm specifically designed to resist ASIC domination. It’s friendly to GPU miners and offers quick one-minute blocks with 2,500 Ravencoin ( RVN ) rewards. Mining altcoins with GPU setups is still very viable here. Monero (XMR): Privacy-first and CPU/GPU accessible Monero relies on the RandomX algorithm, making it accessible to both CPU and GPU miners. You won’t get rich, but it’s a way to earn passively, especially if you’ve got cheap electricity and want passive income from mining.",Mine Bitcoin|Gaming PC|GPU|ASIC,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETC|MINING|XMR,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-08 08:01:00

One day you’re soaring, the next you’re bracing for impact. Understanding the collective mood of the market is crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes in. This widely-watched indicator offers a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , helping investors gauge whether the market is currently driven by irrational exuberance (Greed) or excessive caution (Fear). As of May 8th, the index, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 65. While this is a two-point drop from the previous day, it firmly keeps the market in the ‘Greed’ territory. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Tell Us? The index is essentially a meter that attempts to quantify the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Indicates investors are highly worried, potentially leading to panic selling. This can sometimes signal a buying opportunity for contrarians. 25-49: Fear – Sentiment is negative, caution prevails. 50: Neutral – The market is relatively balanced in sentiment. 51-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic and eager, potentially leading to increased buying pressure. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Suggests the market is potentially overheated, with investors exhibiting FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This could signal a potential correction. The idea is rooted in basic market psychology: when the market is experiencing ‘Extreme Fear’, it might be undervalued due to panic, while ‘Extreme Greed’ could indicate an overvalued market ripe for a pullback. Warren Buffett famously advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” The index aims to provide a tool to help identify these moments. How is the Index Calculated? Exploring the Factors The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from analyzing several different data points. Understanding these factors gives you insight into what’s truly influencing the market’s mood. The index considers six key factors, each with a specific weighting: Let’s break down the components: Factor Weighting What it Measures How it Influences the Score Volatility 25% Measures the current price fluctuations of Bitcoin (BTC) and compares it to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market, pushing the score lower. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current trading volume and market momentum (how strong price movements are) compared to average values. High buying volume in a rising market suggests greedy or optimistic behavior, increasing the score. Low volume or selling pressure suggests fear, decreasing the score. Social Media 15% Scans posts on platforms like Twitter, looking for specific keywords related to cryptocurrency and analyzing the sentiment of these posts. Increased positive sentiment and high engagement often correlate with greed, boosting the score. Negative sentiment lowers it. Surveys 15% (Currently paused) This factor previously incorporated weekly crypto polls, asking people about their market outlook. The results of these polls directly reflected public sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors move from riskier altcoins into the perceived relative safety of BTC. Decreasing dominance might suggest greed, as investors take on more risk in altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. A surge in search volume for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin crash” indicates fear, lowering the score. Terms like “buy Bitcoin” or high interest in general crypto topics during a rally can indicate greed, raising the score. Each of these factors provides a piece of the puzzle, and their combined weightings produce the final index score. It’s a sophisticated way to aggregate diverse data points into a single, understandable metric for crypto market sentiment . Why Did the Index Drop Two Points to 65? A two-point drop, while keeping the index firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests a slight cooling off in market exuberance compared to the previous day. This small shift could be attributed to minor changes in one or more of the contributing factors. Perhaps there was a slight increase in short-term cryptocurrency volatility , a minor dip in market momentum , a shift in social media sentiment, or a subtle change in Bitcoin dominance or Google Trends. Without a detailed breakdown of the daily changes in each component from the provider, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of the two-point move, but it indicates a marginal decrease in the overall positive pressure on the market. Interpreting the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 65 Mean for Investors? A score of 65 sits comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone (51-74). This typically suggests that investors are feeling optimistic. Prices have likely been performing well recently, attracting new buyers and encouraging existing holders to hold or even buy more, driven by positive price action and news. However, being in the ‘Greed’ zone also comes with a note of caution. Key aspects of the ‘Greed’ zone: Increased Optimism: Investors are generally bullish and expecting prices to rise further. Potential for FOMO: The fear of missing out on potential gains can drive irrational buying. Higher Risk: Markets driven by greed can be more susceptible to sharp pullbacks or corrections as sentiment can shift quickly. Focus on Gains: The focus tends to be on potential profits rather than the underlying fundamentals or risks. While 65 is not ‘Extreme Greed’ (75+), it indicates a market where caution is warranted. It’s a time when investors should be particularly mindful of their risk management strategies and avoid making decisions based solely on emotion. Benefits and Challenges of Using the Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a popular tool, but like any indicator, it has its pros and cons. Benefits: Simplicity: Provides a single, easy-to-understand number representing overall market sentiment. Historical Context: Allows investors to compare current sentiment to past market cycles. Contrarian Signal: Can help identify potential opportunities for contrarian investors (buying during extreme fear, considering selling during extreme greed). Aggregation: Combines multiple data points into one metric, saving time on individual analysis. Challenges: Not a Perfect Predictor: Sentiment alone doesn’t dictate price movements; macroeconomic factors, regulations, and technological developments also play significant roles. Lagging Indicator: The index reflects *current* sentiment, which might change rapidly. Bitcoin-Centric: While it includes factors like Bitcoin dominance, the index is heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and sentiment, which might not always perfectly reflect the broader altcoin market. Weighting Subjectivity: The specific weightings of the factors are determined by the index provider and could be debated. Data Limitations: Some data sources, like social media sentiment analysis, can be complex and potentially prone to manipulation or misinterpretation. Therefore, the index should be used as one tool among many in an investor’s analysis toolkit, not as the sole basis for investment decisions. Actionable Insights: How Can Investors Use the Index? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can provide valuable insights, but how do you translate that into action? Here are a few ways investors might use the current reading of 65: Given the index is in the ‘Greed’ zone: Exercise Caution: Avoid making impulsive buys driven by FOMO. Prices may be elevated. Review Your Portfolio: Consider taking some profits, rebalancing, or setting stop-loss orders to protect against potential pullbacks. Stick to Your Strategy: Don’t let the prevailing ‘Greed’ sentiment derail your long-term investment plan. Research Diligently: During periods of high optimism, it’s even more important to research projects thoroughly rather than buying based on hype. Look for Relative Value: While the overall market sentiment is greedy, individual assets might still present opportunities based on fundamentals. Conversely, if the index were to plummet into ‘Fear’ or ‘Extreme Fear’, contrarian investors might see this as a potential opportunity to accumulate assets at discounted prices, provided their fundamental analysis supports the investment. Looking Ahead: What Could Shift the Sentiment? The current state of 65 in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is dynamic. Several factors could cause it to shift significantly: Major Price Movements: A significant rally would likely push the index higher into ‘Extreme Greed’, while a sharp downturn would quickly send it towards ‘Fear’. Regulatory News: Positive or negative news from regulators globally can have a profound impact on investor confidence. Macroeconomic Environment: Changes in inflation rates, interest rates, or global economic stability influence investor risk appetite across all markets, including crypto. Technological Developments: Breakthroughs or issues within major blockchain networks (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) can affect sentiment. Geopolitical Events: Global conflicts or political instability can lead investors to seek safety or shed risky assets. Monitoring these external factors alongside the index’s movement provides a more holistic view of the market landscape. For instance, an increase in cryptocurrency volatility coupled with negative regulatory news would almost certainly drive the index lower. Conclusion: Navigating the Emotions of the Crypto Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable barometer for understanding the collective emotional state of the market. While it currently sits in the ‘Greed’ zone at 65, a slight dip from the previous day reminds us that sentiment is fluid. It’s a tool that aggregates complex data points like volatility , market momentum , social buzz, and even Bitcoin dominance into a single, digestible number. For investors, the current reading is a signal to proceed with awareness rather than abandon ship. It suggests optimism is high, but it also flags the increased potential for volatility and the need for disciplined risk management. By understanding what the index measures and how to interpret its signals in conjunction with other analysis methods, you can better navigate the often-turbulent waters of the cryptocurrency market and make more informed decisions.

If passed, it would mean Sei becomes an EVM-only chain, moving away from its current dual support for both EVM and Cosmos accounts. “As EVM usage continues to dominate activity on Sei, this proposal reflects a clear path forward: a streamlined, EVM-first architecture designed to scale the next generation of DeFi, gaming, and real-world applications.” Jay Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs According to the proposal, only EVM addresses will be able to send transactions on Sei. CosmWasm contracts and Cosmos message handling would be removed, while staking and governance features will remain available through EVM precompiles.

Sei Labs said the current dual setup has created friction for users and developers, with users having to manage and link “both EVM and native addresses.” If the proposal goes through, infrastructure providers will need to switch to EVM-only APIs. Users will also need to move assets to EVM-native wallets or bridge out Cosmos assets, and CosmWasm developers will have to port their apps to EVM, the team noted. According to Sei Labs, shifting to an EVM-only setup will “significantly simplify the Sei developer and user experience, reduce infrastructure overhead, and position Sei more strongly within the broader EVM ecosystem.” Still, there’s no clear timeline for when the proposal might take effect. Amid the announcement, SEI ( SEI ) price jumped 6% to $0.2, while trading volume surged 17.27%, according to data from crypto price aggregator platforms.

Perishing Square has poured $900 million into buying 9 million shares of Howard Hughes Holdings (HHH). Ackman’s fund paid a premium of 48% compared to HHH’s closing stock price last Friday and now controls 46.9% of the real estate firm’s shares, per a new press release . Ackman, who has been named the executive chairman of the HHH board of directors, says the investment will help expand HHH into a diversified holding company. “HHH has built substantial value for shareholders in recent years that has largely gone unrecognized due to the high cost of capital that the market assigns to the Company in light of its pure-play exposure to real estate development and community creation. We believe that HHH is a superb platform to build a faster-growing, high-returning holding company that will acquire control of companies that meet Pershing Square’s criteria for business quality and durable growth.” In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Ackman noted he made the investment with eyes toward following in the footsteps of legendary investor Warren Buffett. “The story begins arguably when I began my career. Very early on, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway letters, beginnings of my investment education. And the story of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett buying basically control of a textile business and then transforming it over time into a diversified holding company.” Ackman says “the ultimate investment dream” is to have a public company built with permanent capital. “You can follow investment principles and build a business of significance. And that’s what Warren has achieved, that’s what we hope to achieve with Howard Hughes.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

All this had little effect on the Bitcoin price. Thursday has dawned bright for Bitcoin, and the king of the cryptocurrencies has surged out the top of a 6-month bull flag, ready to embark on the next upwards leg of the bull market. Powell takes “wait and see” approach to cuts The Federal Reserve is continuing with its “wait and see” approach to rate changes. The Fed chairman Jerome Powell said at Wednesday’s FOMC meeting that there were increased risks to inflation and unemployment given the tariffs war that was taking place. Powell said that the economic outlook was mixed, given that recent strong labour market figures were at odds with a predicted inflation figure of 3% for 2025, and slower Q1 growth. While Powell projected a generally neutral stance during the meeting - neither hawkish nor dovish, he laid down a marker politically by dismissing President Trump’s call for immediate rate cuts. He even drew applause when he pledged to set policy based on economics rather than politics. It may have been largely missed by those in the room that the Fed Chairman represents the interests of the banks, who are among the major shareholders of the Federal Reserve, which is a private, and not state-owned central bank. $BTC surges powerfully out of bull flag Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC shows the power of the surge out of this long-time giant bull flag. The uncertainty over the FOMC meeting brought the price back to test the 0.618 Fibonacci, before the bulls sent the price skyward. The Fibonacci levels, taken only from the move from last Friday’s local high, down to Tuesday’s low, indicate that the price is heading for the 1.618 Fibonacci at over $100,000. Reaching this nice round figure could then bring a lot of retail interest back into the crypto market. There may be some kind of pull back when $100,000 is reached, given that the short-term Stochastic RSIs are starting to top out. This could take the price back to support at $99,000, $98,000, or even to confirm the breakout at $97,000. Bitcoin on the brink of potentially one last price explosion Source: TradingView Zooming right out into the monthly time frame there is very little, if any, uncertainty. The second bull flag, just into its six month of formation, has now broken out. The price is possibly heading up to the 1.618 Fibonacci at $102,000. Once confirmed above this level, the price could rocket upwards, just like it did after breaking out of the previous big bull flag. The Stochastic RSI, second from bottom in the chart, shows that a cross up is taking place. Also, in the RSI, the indicator at the bottom of the chart, a cross up is being postured. Both indicators will confirm (or not) at the end of May. If this surge does occur, it may be the last for Bitcoin of this particular bull market, given that the traditional 4-year cycle ends this year. Nonetheless, Bitcoin is on the brink of a potential huge price surge that could take it to $155,000, or even $208,000, according to Fibonacci extension levels.

44318386,https://crypto.news/?p=14377246,1746695984,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/44318386.jpeg,EOS rallies over 20% ahead of official Vaulta rebranding,https://crypto.news/eos-rallies-over-20-ahead-of-official-vaulta-rebranding/,"EOS rallied as much as 22% today, ahead of its official rebranding to Vaulta, with several bullish signals showing up on its charts. EOS ( EOS ) rose for the second straight day, reaching an intraday high of $0.84 on May 8, while its market cap crossed $1.2 billion at the time of writing. The surge came alongside a massive 285% spike in trading volume, with nearly $500 million worth of EOS traded in 24 hours. There are three main catalysts driving EOS crypto’s gains today. First, a lot of hype is building around EOS’s upcoming rebrand to Vaulta , which is officially set to happen on May 14, less than a week away. The project is pivoting toward blockchain-powered banking solutions, hoping to bridge traditional finance with decentralized tools. As part of this shift, the EOS token will be swapped 1:1 for the new Vaulta token, ticker “A”, according to details shared yesterday. The new token will inherit all the existing EOS tech, including its integration with exSat, Vaulta’s Bitcoin banking gateway, and can be swapped using the Vaulta Swap Portal or supported crypto exchanges. “Vaulta is not a fork or a reset. It’s the EOS network—reimagined and rebranded, fully compatible with all existing infrastructure and state history,” the team explained in a recent update. You might also like: a16z-backed project Balance rallies over 70% ahead of Bithumb listing Another big driver is the attractive staking rewards being introduced. The Vaulta token will reportedly offer a staking yield of around 17% , funded by a 250 million token reward pool. That’s notably higher than the yields offered by larger blockchains such as Ethereum ( ETH ), which provides around 2.7%, or Solana ( SOL ), which offers about 5.4%, making it a more attractive option for those seeking passive income. Lastly, traders in the derivatives market are piling in. Data from CoinGlass shows open interest in EOS futures increased 45% in the past day, now topping $188 million. Meanwhile, the long/short ratio on Binance is above 1, signaling that more traders are betting that EOS will continue climbing in the short term. EOS price analysis Looking at the 4-hour EOS/USDT chart, EOS just broke out from the upper side of a multi-week ascending broadening wedge pattern, a bullish signal in technical analysis. EOS price, Aroon and CMF chart — May 8 | Source: crypto.news The Chaikin Money Flow has climbed to 0.16, showing stronger buying pressure. Meanwhile, the Aroon Up indicator is sitting at 85.7% and the Aroon Down is down at 35.71%, suggesting buyers are still in control. With this setup, EOS could be gearing up to retake the $1 psychological resistance level, a price it failed to break through during its run back in mid-January. That’s about 20% higher from where it’s trading right now. But market commentators are staying optimistic that the rally might go even further. Analyst CW thinks EOS could push up to $1.45 if it breaks through the next big sell wall sitting at $1. Another trader set their sights even higher, predicting a move toward $2.10 after EOS broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart. According to them, this breakout confirms a larger trend shift in technical analysis, opening the door for more upside. At the time of writing, EOS was trading at around $0.833 per coin.

However, savvy investors know that the broader economic and political landscape plays a significant role in shaping the crypto market. That’s why a recent announcement from former U.S. President Donald Trump caught the attention of many, signaling the potential for notable shifts in global economic dynamics. Understanding the implications of a Trump Trade Deal could be crucial for anticipating the future direction of the market. What Was the Big Announcement About the Trump Trade Deal? Former President Donald Trump took to his Truth Social platform to announce an upcoming news conference. Scheduled for 14:00 UTC on May 8, the event is set to take place in the historic Oval Office. The purpose? To unveil what he described as a “major trade deal” with representatives from a “big, and highly respected, country.” Trump also hinted that this agreement is just the first of many similar deals to come. While details about the specific country or the terms of the deal remain under wraps, the announcement itself is significant. Major trade agreements can have far-reaching effects on global economies, supply chains, and international relations. For those tracking the intersection of traditional finance, macroeconomics, and digital assets, this kind of Economic News Crypto connection is becoming increasingly important. Why Do Political Events Crypto Connections Matter? You might be thinking, “Okay, a trade deal, but what does that have to do with Bitcoin or Ethereum?” It’s a fair question. On the surface, a trade agreement between two countries might seem disconnected from decentralized digital currencies. However, the crypto market doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It’s influenced by the same global forces that affect traditional markets, albeit sometimes reacting in different or amplified ways. Political Events Crypto relationships are becoming more apparent as the digital asset space matures and gains mainstream adoption. Here’s why: Investor Sentiment: Major political or economic news can significantly impact investor confidence across all asset classes, including crypto. Positive news might increase appetite for risk assets, while negative news could lead to a flight to safety. Economic Stability: Trade deals can influence economic growth, inflation, and currency stability in participating countries and beyond. These factors can indirectly affect the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies as an investment or a hedge. Regulatory Environment: While not directly about regulation, a major trade deal could involve countries with differing stances on cryptocurrency, potentially hinting at future policy directions or international cooperation (or lack thereof) on digital asset regulation. Global Capital Flows: Changes in trade relationships can alter capital flows between countries, which might have ripple effects on liquidity and investment patterns in global markets, including crypto. Therefore, understanding significant political and economic developments, like a major Trump Trade Deal , is part of a holistic approach to navigating the digital asset space. Anticipating the Crypto Market Reaction Predicting the exact Crypto Market Reaction to any specific event is notoriously difficult. Crypto markets are influenced by a complex mix of factors, including technical indicators, market sentiment, regulatory news, and broader economic trends. However, we can consider potential scenarios based on how similar macro events have played out in the past. A positively perceived trade deal (e.g., one expected to boost economic growth, reduce trade tensions, or open new markets) could contribute to a general risk-on sentiment, potentially providing tailwinds for assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a deal perceived negatively (e.g., one seen as protectionist, disruptive, or creating new tensions) could contribute to risk aversion, potentially leading to sell-offs in volatile assets. Key aspects to consider when the details of the deal are released include: The Partner Country: Is it a major global economy? What is their current relationship with the U.S.? What is their stance on digital assets? The Terms of the Deal: Does it involve tariffs, specific industries, intellectual property, or currency agreements? How might these terms impact the global economic outlook? Market Perception: How do economists, analysts, and the media react to the deal? Market reaction is often driven by perception as much as by the underlying details. Monitoring these factors will be key to understanding the potential downstream effects on the Crypto Market Reaction . How Does Global Trade and Crypto Intersect? The relationship between Global Trade and Crypto is evolving. While cryptocurrencies were initially envisioned as alternatives outside the traditional financial system, they are increasingly integrated into it. International trade often relies on stable financial systems, predictable regulations, and efficient cross-border payments. Major trade deals can impact the stability and efficiency of these traditional systems. In some cases, this could indirectly highlight the potential benefits of decentralized alternatives offered by crypto (e.g., faster, cheaper cross-border transactions). In other cases, increased economic stability fostered by successful trade agreements might reduce the perceived need for alternative assets or hedges. Furthermore, as cryptocurrency adoption grows globally, its potential role in facilitating international trade, remittances, and supply chain finance becomes more relevant. While this specific Trump Trade Deal may not directly address cryptocurrency, it’s part of the larger geopolitical and economic chessboard upon which the future of digital assets is being played out. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Pay attention not just to crypto-specific news but also to major global economic and political announcements like this one. Understand the potential macro drivers. Analyze the Details (When Available): Once the details of the trade deal are announced, try to understand its potential economic implications. Consult reputable financial news sources for analysis. Consider the Broader Market Context: Evaluate the news within the context of current market sentiment, interest rates, inflation data, and other significant economic indicators. Manage Risk: Recognize that macro events can increase market volatility. Ensure your portfolio is diversified and aligned with your risk tolerance. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on immediate news headlines. Look for Long-Term Trends: While short-term reactions can occur, focus on the potential long-term implications of such deals on global economic stability and the continued integration of crypto into the global financial system. Concluding Thoughts: The Interconnected World Donald Trump’s announcement of a “major trade deal” is a reminder that the cryptocurrency market is increasingly intertwined with global political and economic forces. While the direct impact of this specific deal on crypto remains to be seen and will depend heavily on its details and market perception, it highlights the growing importance of monitoring major Political Events Crypto connections and understanding how Global Trade and Crypto dynamics are evolving. As the digital asset space matures, its sensitivity to macroeconomics and international relations is likely to increase. By staying informed about significant developments like the upcoming Trump Trade Deal and considering their potential influence on the overall economic climate and Crypto Market Reaction , investors can be better prepared to navigate the opportunities and challenges ahead.

The assets put up as collateral comprised three distinct tokens: 103,000 AVAX tokens, worth $2.06 million; 7.581 million MOVE tokens, valued at $1.28 million; and 5.983 million SEI tokens, which carried a price tag of $1.17 million. These digital assets came from the wallet address 0xa713fc94db054aa435af4d9c66c3433dca98559f, which has been associated with the DeFi operations of World Liberty Finance. 特朗普家族支持的 DeFi 项目 @worldlibertyfi 在 8 小时前将价值 $451 万的 3 种代币存进 @FalconStable (资金由 Ceffu 托管) 作为抵押品，然后铸造了 202.3 万枚 USDF。 存入代币： 10.3 万 AVAX ($2.06M) 758.1 万 $MOVE ($1.28M) 598.3 万 $SEI ($1.17M) 地址链接 ： https://t.co/kLnqMV3dmf … pic.twitter.com/FiwAxdNGti — 余烬 (@EmberCN) May 7, 2025 Strategic Alignment with Falcon Finance and DWF Labs The funds that were deposited went into Falcon Stable, a decentralized stablecoin protocol that was developed by Falcon Finance. The stablecoin that was minted—USDF—is a dollar-pegged asset so they say; not that anyone would stake anything on it ever. It has received backing—lol—by DWF Labs, a prominent Web3 investment and market-making firm. The overcollateralized model is how Falcon Stable works, and it is simple. Users who want to mint USDF must deposit cryptocurrencies of equivalent or higher value than the USDF they want to mint. For every 1 USDF minted, at least 1.5 USD worth of collateral is deposited. This mechanism maintains the peg of the stablecoin and secures the platform’s lending and borrowing functionalities. The risk management of these collateral assets is overseen by Ceffu, a platform that is all about digital asset custody. World Liberty Finance’s recent development is intriguing for several reasons. First, WWFLI is a stablecoin issuer; that is, it issues a ‘uSD1,’ a stablecoin which has a monetary policy and reserves behind it that make it different from the ‘native assets’ that many DeFi protocols and DAOs issue. Second, DWF Labs is effectively the venture capital arm of this ecosystem, holding significant stakes in its constituent parts—much like how venture capitalists of old held a diverse portfolio across different parts of the tech stack. People watching the crypto scene see this development as a double play by WLFI: first, it’s trying to make its own native ecosystem more stable and supportive by accessing USDF liquidity; second, it’s seeking to beef up its partnership with Falcon Finance and DWF Labs in hopes of ramping up cross-protocol synergy (whatever that is). Given the amount of collateral and the value of the minted USDF, the move seems to indicate that WLFI is preparing for more ambitious DeFi operations or liquidity provisioning. Furthermore, the engagement with the Trump family brings extra prominence and possible political meanings. Even if it is not yet known just how much the Trump family is directly engaged with the goings-on of WFLI, their name has instantaneously made WFLI notable on social media and in crypto chats. In a Web3 world that is growing ever more intricate, alliances such as this—mixing the power of celebrity, the kind of institutional finance that can easily beget millions, and the innovative world of DeFi—are a reminder of how far we’ve come from the days of very simple, very grassroots, and very unnetworked projects that made up the Web3 space. Today, WLFI yields power and presence in a way that makes it able to access millions in stablecoins almost immediately when it needs to. And it makes all of that behave like money, using its tokens as collateral. The way minted USDF moves into decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, and possibly some new DeFi products, set us up nicely to watch what WLFI does next. Right now, it’s serving out $4.5 million in crypto assets. That would appear to put some significant meat on the DeFi bones of this project. Is WLFI’s dual-token strategy—with both USDF and USD1 in its arsenal—a strategy for long-term stability? Or is it a recipe for competitive friction in the stablecoin sector? Time will tell, of course, but the most recent message from World Liberty Finance is unmistakable: The firm is heaving itself into the DeFi space and is positioning itself as a serious contender with (at least) two products that would seem to want a piece of the stablecoin market.

Market Sentiment Turns Cautious as Key Cryptos Dip Below Cost Basis,https://nulltx.com/are-top-buyers-in-profit-or-pain-market-sentiment-turns-cautious-as-key-cryptos-dip-below-cost-basis/,"With a phase of heightened uncertainty now upon the crypto market, the mid-term cost basis of euphoric buyers from late 2024 to early 2025 presents a mixed picture. Some assets are still performing positively, but others are definitely not and show all the signs of being in a bear market. Price action over the last week or so has seen a stabilization of sorts that, in some cases, has formed new support zones. These support zones, however, are not where mid-term holders would want them to be. In fact, they’re below price levels that mid-term holders from late 2024 to early 2025 would want to be above. This data is a precious indicator of how the market is feeling. It can be used almost as a form of social media for gauging the sentiment among big investors. When the market price falls beneath the cost basis of the big investor cohorts, we know they’re losing for sure and that they’re not going to be buying anytime soon. They’re going to be afraid and trying to not look at the numbers as much as possible. When we’re in this kind of market and have fallen below the cost basis, caution is warranted for pretty much every kind of investment. $XRP could be due for a retracement, with the TD Sequential flashing a sell signal on the 3-day chart! pic.twitter.com/onZCDJTusd — Ali (@ali_charts) May 7, 2025 Cost Basis Comparison Reveals Sentiment Shifts Let’s analyze how the leading cryptocurrencies are faring against the cost basis of their buyers during the euphoric part of the market between December 2024 and January 2025. Solana (SOL) was bought at an average price of $146 during this period. With present prices down by about 28%, those investors find themselves with substantial paper losses. The deep crimson seen in performance indicates that the asset has lost the momentum needed to move up in price and may find it hard to move back into a bullish position in the absence of a strong catalyst. Ethereum (ETH) tells a nearly identical tale. Anyone who entered the market around $1,800 and is now holding ETH is looking at a 36% loss. For the moment, that’s the worst performance of any asset we track in this group. If ETH can’t hold above the $1,800 threshold, we could see even more asset dumping from frustrated mid-term holders. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest and most dominant crypto asset, also finds itself in a tight spot. With euphoric buyers having entered at around $95,000, BTC is now slightly below that figure, posting a 1% loss. While this may appear marginal, the psychological implications of BTC trading below a key recent cost basis are important. Historically, when Bitcoin fails to hold the average entry price of medium-term holders, it can trigger broader market corrections or stagnation. Are Top Buyers in Profit or Pain? Comparing current prices to the cost basis of euphoric buyers (Dec ‘24–Jan ‘25) reveals mid-term sentiment: SOL: $146 → 28% loss XRP: $2.14 → +11% profit ETH: $1.8K → -36% loss BTC: $95K → -1% loss Price… pic.twitter.com/i5snu7Re7O — glassnode (@glassnode) May 6, 2025 The one clear exception is Ripple’s XRP, which is still showing positive price movement. Investors who bought XRP during the euphoric rally at $2.14 are currently enjoying an approximately 11% return on their investment. However, that bullish trend could very well end in the near future. XRP’s Strength Could Be Fading Market analyst Ali Martinez says XRP might be due for a pullback in the short term. Martinez notes that a TD Sequential sell signal has shown up on XRP’s 3-day chart. This could indicate that XRP is about to take a breather and, in all likelihood, give back some of its recent gains. Since the chart Martinez is using shows XRP’s performance up until now, a downturn would put XRP in the same “major assets” bucket with the other cryptocurrencies that are currently in the red. XRP’s level of importance is within the range of $2 to $2.26. If it closes outside of this decisive level, it could determine the next major trend for XRP. A close above $2.26 would actually negate the current bearish market setup and initiate new buying interest. A close below $2, however, would confirm the current sell signal and likely initiate further downside momentum. XRP has become a point of focus for traders, given its strong performance relative to peers. If it doesn’t hold onto those gains, it could take a further large chunk out of market sentiment. Mid-Term Holders Show Signs of Fatigue The larger issue points to a crypto market that is in a presently precarious condition. When pricing holds below a 3-to-6-month cost basis—a halfway mark nearly always representing conviction and a medium-term outlook—it signals a weak market structure. What we have at this moment is a market around that cost basis, with no clear uptrend, and sellers potentially emboldened by the profit incentive to keep pushing prices down. There is a good chance the market will stay in this beat-up, cautious sentiment until we see either renewed momentum from the market itself or have macro-level catalysts come in and drive prices above these key levels. In the evolving crypto cycle, assets like XRP and BTC could serve as leading indicators for where things go next. At present, the mood is very cautious, and for many top buyers in this space, the pain is being felt in a real way. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

44318649,https://nulltx.com/?p=149167,1746696469,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"AI Token Unlock Tsunami: $2.8B Set to Flood Market, Threatening Valuations",https://nulltx.com/ai-token-unlock-tsunami-2-8b-set-to-flood-market-threatening-valuations/,"For the last year, one of the crypto market’s most hotly discussed themes has been artificial intelligence (AI) . Yet, while this has been a theme, it’s long been a theme for a good reason: riding a wave of investor enthusiasm, AI-related tokens in the crypto market have enjoyed much excitement and seen much growth in recent months and not just as a result of recent earnings calls. The AI theme has undoubtedly brought interest and innovation to web3, yet the stunning hype around AI-related tokens might soon be tested by a wave of supply that could push down prices and restructure faith in price targets. As per an in-depth study by Tokenomist, several leading AI and AI-agent crypto projects are gearing up for major token emissions in the next few months. These emissions—where tokens that have been locked up are set free into the market—could significantly dilute any current token holders and possibly push prices down if the market demand does not equal the new supply. Short-Term Unlocks Signal Market Volatility Ahead In the next six months, the market is anticipated to receive a new token supply worth over $1.5 billion from the AI token sector. Worldcoin (WLD) tops the list of impacted tokens, unlocking a stunning $929.98 worth of new tokens—73.94% more than its current circulating supply. As this and other token unlocks (see below) proceed, the price effect on the unlocked tokens and their related ecosystems will depend on how well the market can absorb the new supply. Following closely is GRASS, set to free $265.95 million worth of tokens in the same timeframe, representing 67.04% of its circulating supply. This wave is expected to peak around October 2025, making it one of the more time-sensitive events for investors to monitor. Tokens like SPEC, AI, and DEAI are receiving special notice for their extremely high dilution ratios. SPEC, in particular, is set for an incredible 153.95% increase in the supply over the next six months. That number suggests the circulating supply could nearly double. Contextually, that would mean for every token currently in circulation, 1.5 new tokens would be introduced. This would apply strong sell-side pressure unless demand pulls in the other direction. In the same way, AI—even though it has a lower unlock value of $16.34 million—is viewed as a high-risk associated with its limited circulating float and quick unlock speed. Even a minimal amount of selling, with an expected 84.04% increase in just six months, could lead to some pretty significant drops in price. Other tokens—like IO, ATH, and COOKIE—are also set for considerable supply inflations, with unlock percentages nearing 44% to 50% in the short term. While not quite as aggressive as SPEC or DEAI, these unlocks still mean significant dilution for investors holding these tokens in the mid term. Long-Term Dilution May Reshape Sector Valuations When we look at the next 12 months, the situation in the AI sector becomes even more pronounced, with nearly $2.8 billion worth of unlocked tokens on the cusp of being added to the current supply. Once again, WLD is the standout here by absolute value, with a jaw-dropping $1.84 billion in projected token unlocks over the same period—this represents a 146.68% increase over its current circulating supply. SPEC, however, continues to surprise people the most because of its seemingly insane dilution ratio. With a full-year unlock of $105.34 million, its supply could grow by as much as 259.39% to effectively triple in size. This aggressive unlock schedule will likely require any combination of product traction and partnerships to justify the valuation of its token in the face of—as noted above—strong dilution. AI shares the same trend (161.67% increase), while DEAI (244.31%) and IO (111.61%) are clearly moving in the right direction (at least in terms of share price) and may be benefiting from the AI buzz. But are any of these likely to yield real, investable growth any time soon? For now, there doesn’t seem to be a compelling case for that. AI & AI Agent Token Unlocks – $2.8B in Supply Hits the Market Soon While AI remains one of the strongest narratives, upcoming supply emissions could reshape valuations across the sector We analyzed which AI tokens face the largest emissions relative to circulating supply and… pic.twitter.com/VN1tWpU6AC — Tokenomist (prev. TokenUnlocks) (@Tokenomist_ai) May 6, 2025 In the meantime, ATH and COOKIE are projected to maintain consistent unlocks throughout the year. They will see increases in circulating supply of 85.58% and 69.76%, respectively. These supply increases are less aggressive than what we see with STG, but they still challenge valuations. And they do so in the context of pretty anemic user growth and a lack of utility. AI Narrative Faces Its First Major Test Although AI is one of crypto’s most thrilling and potentially rewarding frontiers, the huge number of tokens that are about to be unlocked is undoubtedly a challenge. In a market where both liquidity and investor sentiment can shift in an instant, how will the balance between narrative-driven excitement and the tokenomics of unlocked supply hold up? Initiatives with sound underpinnings, increasing acceptance, and well-built ecosystems may survive the storm of dilution. But for others—especially those with low float and high unlock velocity—a grueling reset of their already thin valuations may be just around the bend. It would be prudent for investors in the AI crypto space to keep a close watch on when tokens become available and to adjust their risk levels if necessary. In crypto, as in all things financial, when you get in and how many there are to buy are the key. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Still, the Virtuals ecosystem calls in the market. Even after a reckless ride of volatility, $VIRTUAL has a 25.08% slice of the total AI agents market and $1.4292 price. Although the price drop may appear sudden, analysts believe it is part of a larger shift that comes after a long period of rising prices. Virtuals has been the leader in both performance and visibility within the AI agent sector in recent weeks, and this price pullback may just be a short-term pause in a continuing longer-term uptrend. $VIRTUAL Faces Profit-Taking Ahead of FOMC Decision The recent market dip in $VIRTUAL corresponds with the growing wariness of investors ahead of major forthcoming macroeconomic events, such as the Federal Reserve’s projected FOMC meeting. Traders are on the lookout for signals regarding imminent interest rate changes that could potentially send ripple effects throughout both the traditional and crypto markets. In anticipation, many have taken profits from yesterday’s top performers, including the Virtuals. Even though prices have plummeted, the virtual ecosystem is now more dominant than ever and in fact is soaking up quite a bit of the remaining A-List action. Its 25% share of AI agent mindshare means the virtual platform is now roughly 2.5 times more likely to be the place where brainy AI agents are being cooked up. The platform continues to gain traction, and for now the longs are holding onto their long positions. Analysts believe the wild swings in $VIRTUAL will be short-lived. They are looking past the recent price action and seeing only growth in the project. They are also seeing something else: They are seeing integration in the ecosystem. The meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has a direct impact on the kind of price action you see in the stock market. Favorable outcomes from the FOMC—for example, indications of rate stability or continued economic support—tend to lead to swift recoveries across the stock market. Smaller AI Projects See Green Amid Market Pullback Despite the larger AI-agent market seeing downturns, some projects in this space have managed to stage a countertrend and post gains recently. One of the most impressive performers was NYKO (@niyoko_agent), a platform for personalized AI assistants that seems to have a pretty killer business model. Their market cap increased 5.89%. Why? Well, for one, as we reported in our profile of the project, they offer an AI-heavy environment that seems potentially compatible with over-the-top kinds of applications. Also in the green was DEGENC (@DegenCapitalCIO), which ticked up 2.06%. DEGENC uses AI to deliver crypto trading insight. That’s a small niche in the rapidly growing crypto universe, but DEGENC has apparently found a way to make itself profitable. BIOS (@BasisOS), a project that aims to create modular AI operating systems, nudged its way into the green, almost tickling a 1.34% market cap gain. Virtuals Daily Update | May 7th 2025 Stay up to date on all news from the @virtuals_io ecosystem over the last 24 hours… pic.twitter.com/HBOXonmZyQ — Graeme (@gkisokay) May 7, 2025 The performances of these projects indicate that investor enthusiasm is not dead—it is just more focused than it was before. As the market settles into a new normal, the spotlight may momentarily wane on large-cap flag bearers such as Virtuals and turn to rising projects that possess unrealized, high-impact potential. Of course, if these weight class-challenging new businesses are going to continue being momentum plays, they need to be about something more meaningful than the trading gains that serve to prop them up for a few days or weeks. Outlook: Virtuals Still Leads, But Volatility is Here to Stay Although the price of the $VIRTUAL token has succumbed to declining market conditions, the Virtuals ecosystem remains the most influential part of the AI-agent marketplace. With its huge lead in terms of mindshare, user engagement, and continued development activity, the project—not just its token—appears likely to survive the present turbulence and probably even thrive in the long term. Thus, it seems safe to project the continued relevance of Virtuals for the foreseeable future. The forthcoming 48 hours will be crucial, particularly as the markets process the information from the FOMC. If the macro landscape holds steady or improves, “virtuals” could have a nice little run commensurate with whatever uptick in crypto that the space seems poised for right now. Until then, expect volatility—because these guys are clearly in a Pennsyltucky kind of mood—and expect to see both virtuals and the broader crypto space caught in it.

The world stands at a crossroads—as it always does. Economic systems once promising stability and growth have revealed deep flaws: centralized control, rampant inequality, and short-term thinking have left humanity grappling with extremes of poverty and wealth. As we look to the future, the idea of a “divine economy” emerges not as a utopian fantasy but as a practical, long-term project. You might also like: DeFi needs a (healthy) dose of paranoia about risk management | Opinion This endeavor, likely spanning centuries, seeks to build a civilization rooted in sound money, true prosperity, and renewed relationships between individuals, communities, and institutions—relationships currently fragile, if not broken. While innovations like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the Bitcoin Standard offer compelling foundations, this vision does not depend on their inevitable success. Rather, it draws from their principles to propose a global economy balancing competition and compassion, individual success and collective advancement. A global currency grounded in sound money A divine economy requires establishing a global currency grounded in sound money. For too long, fiat currencies have been manipulated, inflated, and politicized, eroding trust and distorting value. A global currency—potentially Bitcoin—would transcend borders, fostering free trade and fiscal prudence. Sound money resists devaluation and encourages long-term thinking, demanding transparency from institutions and accountability from individuals. Imagine a world where savings retain value across generations, money issuance is decentralized and verifiable (such as Bitcoin mining), and economic incentives align with sustainable growth rather than reckless speculation. This does not reject national sovereignty but proposes a framework where nations prosper through healthy competition, free from currency wars or exploitative debt cycles. Redefining true prosperity Yet, a global currency alone is insufficient. True prosperity extends beyond material wealth, encompassing human nobility—creativity, resilience, and ethical conduct. Prosperity is not solely measured by GDP or personal fortunes but by community strength, individual dignity, and shared spiritual aspirations driving humanity forward. Technological and financial innovations must pair with new social relations. Individuals must see their progress intertwined with others’ advancement. Communities must foster trust and mutual support. Institutions—governments, corporations, global bodies—must operate with integrity for the common good. This shift requires recognizing our shared humanity, a principle underpinning every transaction and policy. New relations for a new economy Extremes of poverty and wealth cannot be solved by markets alone. Free markets, essential for innovation and freedom, must be tempered by generosity and genuine philanthropy. In a divine economy, success is not zero-sum. The wealthy are not vilified, nor the poor abandoned; both are integral to a thriving whole. Philanthropy becomes a natural extension of prosperity, not performative virtue-signaling. Generosity flows from understanding that humanity’s strength depends on uplifting everyone. This is not socialism—it preserves competition and reward—but infuses them with a higher purpose. A business leader might invest in education for underserved regions, knowing that an educated society benefits all. A worker saves diligently, understanding their effort contributes to stability and transparency. Compassion as an economic force Compassion lies at the heart of this vision, not as a vague sentiment but as a practical economic force. Consider Bitcoin’s potential mass adoption: its decentralized nature empowers individuals under oppressive regimes, giving them access to a global economy free from censorship or confiscation. Yet, compassion demands more—it requires mechanisms ensuring those without technical knowledge or resources are not left behind. A divine economy might pair Bitcoin’s infrastructure with community-driven initiatives, where local leaders teach sound money, or mining profits reinvested in social goods like healthcare or clean energy. Compassion also means designing systems rewarding long-term horizons over short-term greed. Fiscal prudence becomes a virtue, encouraging individuals and nations to plan rather than borrow against the future. Navigating challenges and competition Transitioning to a divine economy faces challenges. Bitcoin, despite its promise, encounters hurdles—scalability, energy concerns, and resistance from entrenched powers. Its success isn’t guaranteed, but its ideas inspire. A global currency must navigate geopolitical tensions; nations won’t easily relinquish control over monetary policies. Yet, the argument for such a system is compelling. A unified standard reduces trade friction, eliminates currency manipulation, and fosters trust. Nations still compete through innovation, culture, and governance on a level playing field. Healthy competition thrives when rules are fair and rewards are genuine. Embracing a thousand-year view This vision assumes humanity is capable of more than self-interest. It rests on the belief that we are noble beings driven by spiritual aspirations as well as material needs. Ethics and virtues—honesty, justice, generosity—become economic bedrocks, not optional extras. A merchant does not cheat because integrity matters more than profit; a policymaker serves because service outweighs ambition. These aren’t naive assumptions; they’re prerequisites for a civilization that endures. History shows systems built on exploitation or mistrust eventually collapse. A divine economy seeks to break that cycle. The journey to this civilization will take centuries, not decades, demanding patience, experimentation, and learning from failures. Bitcoin’s principles—decentralization, transparency, sound money—offer a starting point but aren’t the whole answer. These ideas must integrate into broader actions, encompassing compassion, philanthropy, and profound recognition of humanity’s oneness. Individual progress must fuel collective advancement, and vice versa. Institutions must evolve, shedding corruption and embracing accountability. Communities must bridge divides, turning strangers into neighbors. As I see it, the divine economy is not a destination but a direction—a project demanding our ingenuity, empathy, and resolve. It asks us to imagine a world where money serves humanity, prosperity is shared, and competition lifts us all higher. This is the civilization I believe we can build, step by deliberate step, over the long arc of time. The tools—Bitcoin’s lessons, free markets, human connection—are in our hands. The question is whether we have the will to use them wisely. I believe we do.

The hybrid system offers stability as well as control to users. P2C Lending enables investors to receive yield by providing stablecoins such as USDT to lending pools that are governed by smart contracts, providing a safe and automated means of earning passive income. In contrast, P2P Lending allows direct borrowing and lending relations between users with no middlemen. This aspect enhances privacy and allows for more personalized lending, giving users more control over the transaction. Through this novel setup, Mutuum Finance is now a viable and scalable product within the DeFi ecosystem. It is also currently undergoing a third-party audit by Certik to further enhance transparency and investor trust. Presale Growth and Launch Price Expectations Currently, at $0.025, the MUTM token is highly sought after. Those who invest now at this stage in Phase 4 are set to appreciate by 20% once Phase 5 begins. The final launch price is at $0.06, but some crypto analysts are already predicting it is going to be up within no time after its release, an exponential rise compared to today’s prices in the presale. These are the explanations why MUTM is one of the most debated low-price DeFi coins. Fueling Growth Through Community and Rewards The platform is also creating a successful community with incentive-based mechanics. There is a real-time leaderboard showing the top 50 token holders and rewarding them with additional MUTM tokens. On top of this, a token giveaway worth $100,000 is underway, where ten winners will be awarded $10,000 each in MUTM. A referral program also motivates user growth by rewarding participants who bring in new users to the platform. Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the most sensational early-stage decentralized finance opportunities. As the token draws near its next price milestone and launch, early investors would be much better off enjoying token appreciation along with platform rewards. Dogecoin’s $1 Dream May Be Far Off, But Mutuum Finance Will Surge to $2.50 While Dogecoin’s journey to $1 faces obstacles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly attracting massive interest from investors. Already over $7.8 million raised in its presale, and Phase 4 is almost sold out, with prices set to rise 20% when Phase 5 starts! With a launch price of $0.06, analysts predict that Mutuum Finance could soar to $2.50 in the near future. Don’t miss out on the chance to enter early.

44318744,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158439,1746696614,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: A Positive Reversal,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-spot-bitcoin-etf-inflows-4/,"Good news for the crypto market! After a period of net outflows, the US Spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced a notable turnaround on May 7th, recording a combined net inflow of $142.29 million. This shift signals renewed investor interest and provides a positive data point for the digital asset space. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows Data According to data shared by Trader T on X, May 7th saw a welcome reversal in the trend for US-based spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The total net inflow figure of $142.29 million indicates that more capital flowed into these investment products than exited them on that day. This contrasts with the net outflows observed the previous day, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment or investment strategies. Breaking down the inflows reveals which specific ETFs attracted the most capital: ARK Invest’s ARKB: Led the pack with a significant $54.73 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC: Followed closely, attracting $39.92 million. BlackRock’s IBIT: Saw solid inflows of $37.16 million. Bitwise’s BITB: Added $10.48 million to its holdings. Other spot Bitcoin ETFs tracked showed no change in their holdings for the day, meaning they neither saw significant inflows nor outflows. Why Do Bitcoin ETF Inflows Matter for the Crypto ETF Market? Understanding Bitcoin ETF Inflows is crucial because these products serve as a significant bridge between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world. Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. This accessibility appeals to a broad range of investors, including institutions and retail participants who may be more comfortable investing through regulated, familiar investment vehicles. Consistent net inflows into these ETFs are often interpreted as a sign of increasing demand for Bitcoin from these larger investment pools. This demand can potentially influence Bitcoin’s price and overall market liquidity. Conversely, persistent outflows can indicate waning interest or profit-taking, potentially putting downward pressure on the price. The recent return to inflows, especially after a period of outflows, is a positive signal for the health and growing maturity of the Crypto ETF Market . It suggests that dips are being bought or that confidence is returning after recent market volatility. A Closer Look at the Leaders: ARKB and IBIT Among the ETFs reporting inflows, ARKB and IBIT are particularly noteworthy. BlackRock’s IBIT has been a dominant force since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, consistently attracting substantial capital and quickly becoming one of the largest holders of Bitcoin among these funds. Its continued inflows, even when others might be stagnant, highlight its strong market position and investor trust. Similarly, ARK Invest’s ARKB has established itself as a major player. Leading the inflows on May 7th with over $54 million demonstrates its significant influence and appeal within the market. The performance of these key players provides valuable insight into where investor capital is currently being directed within the US Spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. What Could Be Driving These Inflows? Several factors could contribute to the return of positive Bitcoin ETF Inflows : Bitcoin Price Stability: Following recent volatility, a period of relative price stability or upward movement can restore investor confidence. Macroeconomic Factors: Shifts in the broader economic outlook or changes in interest rate expectations can influence asset allocation decisions. Institutional Interest: Continued adoption or allocation from larger financial institutions can significantly impact inflow numbers. Market Sentiment: A general improvement in sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies can encourage investment. Pinpointing the exact catalyst for a single day’s inflow is challenging, but the overall trend in the Crypto ETF Market is closely watched as an indicator of broader adoption and demand. Understanding the US Spot Bitcoin ETF Landscape: Risks and Rewards While the return of inflows is positive, it’s important for investors to consider the full picture. The primary benefit of US Spot Bitcoin ETF s is providing easy access to Bitcoin exposure through regulated brokerage accounts. This simplifies investment and removes the complexities of self-custody. However, risks remain. The price of Bitcoin is inherently volatile, and ETF values will fluctuate accordingly. Fees associated with managing the ETFs can also impact returns. Furthermore, the regulatory environment, while currently supportive in the US with these launches, could still evolve. For investors, monitoring Bitcoin ETF Inflows alongside other market data points provides a more comprehensive view of market dynamics and potential trends. Conclusion: A Positive Sign for the Market The $142.29 million in net inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETF s on May 7th represents a positive development, breaking a short streak of outflows. Led by strong performances from ARKB , FBTC, IBIT , and BITB, this data point underscores continued interest and investment activity in Bitcoin via traditional financial channels. While daily fluctuations are normal, the return of positive inflows is a hopeful sign for the broader Crypto ETF Market and the potential for sustained demand for digital assets.

The firm disclosed this in an official announcement, stating that accredited investors can deposit and trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether USDT. According to Futu, the service is available through its retail trading app NiuNiu, and users can switch between traditional financial products and cryptocurrencies with just a click. Thus, it offers users an opportunity to invest in and manage a variety of diversified assets. The announcement stated: “Investors can play with Crypto+TradFi assets through one App, quickly switch between virtual and traditional asset markets, and choose appropriate investment products to control market fluctuations.” Futu is one of the leading retail brokerage platforms in Hong Kong. According to the company, one in every two adults in the city uses its platform, and it has ranked first for downloads among all retail brokerage apps. The company is also licensed by the Hong Kong Securities Regulatory Commission, which means it is regulatory compliant. Interestingly, the firm is seeking to attract more crypto investors to use its platform and is now offering new users up to HK$1,600 in Bitcoin rewards. According to the firm, this is a limited offer with terms and conditions. Futu wants to bridge TradFi with crypto Meanwhile, the firm intends for its app to offer an easy way to connect TradFi with crypto. It stated that most traditional crypto exchanges only offer a single asset, and most TradFi institutions do not have the crypto infrastructure, reducing the opportunity to invest for most users. In order to achieve this, Futu’s platform offers a comprehensive account where users can manage diverse assets from one portfolio and access all investment options through a one-stop platform. Interestingly, it appears Futu does not take custody of crypto assets deposited on its platform. The announcement stated that customers’ crypto assets are deposited on licensed crypto exchanges for safekeeping. Speaking of the new product, the firm’s managing director, Xie Zhijian, noted that the company has the technical ability and capital strength to provide crypto trading services to qualified investors. He said: “As a technology broker, we hope to build a bridge between emerging assets such as virtual assets and traditional assets, and also hope to promote the activity and participation of these two markets at the same time.” The firm is planning to offer deposits and trading for more cryptocurrencies. It is noted that it already offers Crypto ETF trading, simulation trading, and other functions. Thus, improving interoperability between crypto and TradFi assets for investors is its core goal. Hong Kong ranks second among the most-friendly cities for crypto Meanwhile, Futu’s efforts highlight the growth of the digital assets market in Hong Kong. The city has become one of the leading crypto hubs globally due to regulatory clarity and local institutions embracing blockchain technology. Over the past few years, it has passed several laws enabling crypto firms to become regulatory compliant. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has also embraced blockchain technology with a pilot program for digital currency e-HKD, currently in Phase 2. Unsurprisingly, it is ranked as the second most friendly city for crypto globally, ahead of Singapore, Abu Dhabi, and Zurich. According to the migration platform Multipolitan, only the capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana, ranks ahead of Hong Kong. Multipolitan ranked the cities based on factors such as tax regime, regulations, wealth, and digital infrastructure, and Hong Kong scored high on most of the criteria. However, its push to become a global crypto hub could be under threat as pro-crypto moves in the US increase its appeal for crypto companies. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

That number is not just a statement of Solana’s growing superiority in the blockchain world but also an indication of the user activity that has been generated by several key protocols on the network. Those protocols have shown themselves capable of bringing in nearly all the traders this side of Centralized Exchanges (CEXes). Two platforms stand out at the center of this upturn: Raydium and Fluxbeam. These two DEXs have emerged as the platform leaders of the Solana ecosystem and have captured a significant majority of the network’s user activity over the last 30 days. With an influence that’s impossible to ignore, these two platforms boast a combined total of more than 239 million users across Solana’s DeFi stack. BREAKING: Total DEX volume on @Solana has surpassed $800B in 2025. pic.twitter.com/d8bKQLbFom — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 7, 2025 Raydium and Fluxbeam Lead the Way Recent user analytics show that Raydium commands a 35% share of active users on Solana’s decentralized exchanges. This figure is current for the past 30 days. Seemingly, all observables point to Raydium being number 1 in that wildly booming Solana DeFi (decentralized finance) sector. Raydium, at its core, is a robust AMM (Automated Market Maker). And from that vantage, it’s an interesting, fast, and efficient liquidity hub for Solana. With Raydium, traders can execute orders fast, with minimal slippage. Integrating with the broader Serum order book system and some other observables point to its lack of presence in a few sectors as some steps in the roadmap to overcome a challenge it seems to face in the area of user experience. Top Solana entities by user share (30D): – Raydium – 35% – Fluxbeam – 28% – Solana – 21% – https://t.co/KMhKpro0u7 – 13% – Jupiter – 2.7% 239M total users. Memes, DEXs, and infra — each playing their part. But Raydium and Fluxbeam are clearly driving the crowd. pic.twitter.com/AifXs11CX1 — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 6, 2025 Following closely behind is Fluxbeam, which has swiftly surged to a 28% share of Solana’s DEX user base in 2025. Its ascent can mainly be credited to an interface that is as good as any in the space; fee structures that are competitive to the point of being almost dynamic; and community growth strategies that are as aggressive as they are well thought out. Fluxbeam is becoming quite the alternative to more established players—it represents something fresh, accessible, and even a bit fun, which is not how most DEXes like to think of themselves. At the same time, the base infrastructure of Solana has a 21% share of users. While it is not a decentralized exchange itself, the core functionalities of the Solana blockchain provide a seamless platform for decentralized trading. Solana is known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, and these attributes have made the network a suitable environment for building and using DEXes. Pump.fun is a platform riding Solana’s meme coin and social token wave, but it certainly is not a silly platform or a ridiculous project. The way that Pump.fun onboards new users to the decentralized finance (DeFi) world is no joke, either. The platform’s active user base—comprising likely very new crypto users—interacts with the platform in a fashion that resembles how users of popular consumer apps interact with their app. Half of Pump.fun’s active users are under the age of 34, and 39% identify as women. Completing the roster is Jupiter, a potent DEX aggregator, which presently commands 2.7% of Solana’s DEX user base. Its sliver of market share seems somewhat paltry, but in fact, it’s hardly a small player. This is because Jupiter handles a critical part of the swapping infrastructure on Solana. Memecoins, DEXs, and Infrastructure: The Trio Powering Solana’s Boom Solana’s massive volume figures and user base in 2025 stem from something more than just state-of-the-art trading platforms. Instead, I see them as the brewing outcome of three converging forces: memes, decentralized exchanges, and infrastructure. Viral marketing and gamified user experiences attract vast numbers of audiences to memecoin platforms like Pump.fun. These fresh users next flow through to decentralized exchanges such as Raydium and Fluxbeam to perform the usual operations of a token economy—buying, selling, and swapping tokens. And underpinning all of this is the Solana blockchain itself, with its scalability and low fees, making such wildly successful growth possible without any sort of clogging in the network. This ecosystem collaboration enables Solana’s success even when the rest of the market is experiencing volatility. While other chains deal with slow transaction times and angry users due to congestion and high gas fees, Solana offers a smooth experience. That’s because it’s employing two technologies in synergy: parallel processing and innovative validator incentives. In 2025 so far, DEX volume has already hit $800 billion—and the year isn’t even done yet. Solana is staking out a position not just as a speedy blockchain but as a full-stack, user-friendly DeFi ecosystem. Raydium and Fluxbeam are the two applications attracting the most user attention, and the aspiring social layer of Solana is really just getting started. Memecoins and other social tokens are, in Solana’s case, not so much a silly sideshow as a path toward the burgeoning crypto global economy. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Each time BTC reaches new highs, it unlocks liquidity that often spills into altcoins and early-stage tokens with strong stories behind them. This cycle appears to be no different. If you’ve been on the sidelines, waiting for the right moment, now could be that window. Coins like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) —which blends AI trading tools, meme-driven community energy, and real staking utility—are already gaining traction. Alongside other projects focused on decentralized computing and blockchain innovation, these assets are primed to ride the next wave. Below, we’ll walk through some of the best cryptos to consider right now—and why getting in early could make all the difference. Top Cryptos to Watch Before the Next Altcoin Breakout With Bitcoin’s rally creating momentum, early-stage picks are capturing the attention of investors. Here are three of the most promising cryptos to consider right now : Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) Dawgz AI is grabbing headlines as a unique AI-powered meme coin that’s quickly gaining traction during its presale stage. Currently priced at $0.004, with the next price hike set to increase it to $0.00438, this project has already raised over $3.4 million out of its $3.61 million goal. What Makes Dawgz AI Stand Out? AI-Powered Trading Bots: These algorithms are designed to run 24/7, providing high-frequency trading and passive income opportunities for holders.

44318918,https://nulltx.com/?p=149147,1746696978,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Bitcoin Outpaces Gold and Stocks in April as Correlation With S\&P 500 Strengthens,https://nulltx.com/bitcoin-outpaces-gold-and-stocks-in-april-as-correlation-with-sp-500-strengthens/,"April was a crucial month for the major asset classes, and turbulent early-month trading saw Bitcoin emerge as the clear outperformer. Data from the past 30 days show that not only did Bitcoin bounce back strongly after a sharp drop in the first week of April, but by month’s end it had also dramatically outpaced both gold and the S dP 500. Bitcoin’s emergence as the top performer is another way of saying that it is developing into a high-beta asset—which means it swings a lot in price compared to other investments but offers potential for much greater upside. As an increasing number of investors begin to treat Bitcoin as a serious portfolio component rather than a speculative anomaly, its price behavior is starting to reflect something far more pedestrian: the generally positive or negative vibe coming from the broader economy. And the vibe from April’s data is anything but subtle. The correlation between Bitcoin and traditional equities—especially the S&P 500—is becoming much stronger. Indeed, in the realm of portfolio theory, Bitcoin is not so much the unusual equity it used to be thought of as, but more a potential risk factor common to a wide variety of assets. Major Asset Classes Performance In April As shown in the chart, Bitcoin outperformed both Gold and the S&P 500 in April, despite a significant decline at the beginning of the month. The correlation between #BTC and the S&P 500 remains strong. In fact, the S&P 500 only slightly… pic.twitter.com/f04pPY2AOQ — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) May 6, 2025 A Volatile Start, a Strong Finish At the start of April, Bitcoin was under pressure. Price levels were moving lower due to profit-taking and the general risk-off sentiment proliferating across the financial markets. But this dip was short-lived. In the following weeks, Bitcoin staged a dramatic comeback, moving almost in lock-step with the upward-moving S&P 500. By the end of April, Bitcoin had not only recouped its early losses but also had moved into positive territory, delivering a gain that exceeded gold and came within spitting distance of the benchmark U.S. stock index. Traditionally seen as a secure asset during times of economic instability, gold experienced only slight fluctuations during the month. While it edged upward, providing some modest gains, it failed to keep up with Bitcoin’s recovery. The S&P 500, meanwhile, enjoyed a nearly flawless month, finding support from both strong corporate earnings and investor optimism regarding the Federal Reserve’s future policy moves. The ability of Bitcoin to bounce back from short-term volatility and beat not just gold but also stocks speaks volumes about its nascent status in the global financial system. For investors, it ain’t yet a signal that the asset can ride market chop and come out whole but, rather, a sign that this is probably the next great monetary base. Correlation With the S\&P 500 Reaches New Highs April’s market data offers one of the most striking observations: the correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 is increasing. Analysts have observed that the path Bitcoin takes now often mirrors that of major stock indices. This is especially true when we consider the current state of the global macro economy. In April, for instance, the S&P 500 rose and subsequently fell in about the same time frame as Bitcoin. This solidifies the idea that, in terms of the apparent movement to either side of a mean average price, Bitcoin is behaving more like a high-beta stock than an uncorrelated asset. Although the S&P 500 finished the month marginally better than Bitcoin, the two were closely aligned. The close tracking implies that Bitcoin is now a market player, not isolated in a realm of its own. Like any public asset, it now responds to the same stimuli as the traditional market—interest rate expectations, inflation data, and general investor sentiment. This increasing correlation could undermine the story of Bitcoin as a “hedge” against traditional financial markets. Instead, it makes Bitcoin a risk-on asset—one that provides even more amplified exposure to the trends driving the stock market—because in both cases, we have investors trying to juice their returns. Bitcoin Offers Higher Alpha With Familiar Risks Despite being so volatile, Bitcoin is still an alluring prospect because it has the potential to produce a high alpha. An alpha, of course, is the fancy term for investment performance that exceeds a market benchmark. April’s price action for Bitcoin reinforced this. While the S&P 500 was showing steady gains of its own, Bitcoin was following that path upticks and downticks—in a much sharper and grander fashion, actually, compared to what was going on with the equities market. In contrast, gold still offers stability, but it is devoid of the explosive growth potential that Bitcoin can deliver. This difference is taking on more significance as investors hunt for ingenious new ways to balance risk and reward in their portfolios. The conclusive statement is that April showed Bitcoin maturing nicely as a financial asset. It is no longer a wild child that you might want to safeguard in a mausoleum; it acts just like any other respectable financial asset. Still, it has potential upside. Bitcoin specifically, and not the idea of cryptocurrency broadly, acts like a hedge against inflation. It is reliable and dependable, hashtag #notfinancialadvice, just as reliable and dependable as any other performance of a thing that you might be able to buy.

44319145,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158440,1746697216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Asia FX Remains Muted: Crucial US Dollar Outlook Shaped by Fed Interest Rates and US China Relations,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-us-dollar-outlook/,"For those navigating the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the broader macro landscape is key. Events in the Global Forex Market , particularly shifts in major currencies like the US Dollar and dynamics in regions like Asia, can significantly influence investor sentiment and capital flows across all asset classes, including digital assets. Currently, the focus is squarely on a quiet Asia FX market, critical US-China discussions, and the steady stance of the US Dollar following the latest Federal Reserve decision. Why is Asia FX Muted Right Now? The foreign exchange markets across Asia have shown limited movement recently. This period of relative calm isn’t accidental. Several factors contribute to this subdued activity: Waiting for Signals: Traders and investors are holding back, awaiting clearer signals from major global economic and political events. The outcomes of high-level US-China talks and future guidance from the Federal Reserve are paramount. Balancing Act: Asian central banks are often balancing domestic economic needs with external pressures. With uncertainty abroad, many prefer stability in their currencies. Seasonal Factors: Sometimes, regional holidays or the lead-up to significant global data releases can contribute to lower trading volumes and volatility. This ‘wait and see’ approach means that while there isn’t dramatic price action, underlying tensions and potential for sudden shifts are building. The stability in Asia FX is perhaps more a reflection of anticipation than inherent calm. The Weight of US China Relations on Global Markets High-level discussions between the United States and China always cast a long shadow over global markets, and the current round is no exception. These talks often cover a range of complex issues, including trade, technology, and geopolitical strategy. The results, or even the tone of these discussions, can directly impact currency valuations, especially for the Chinese Yuan and currencies of countries with strong trade ties to both economic giants. Here’s why US China Relations are so impactful: Trade Policy: Any progress or breakdown in trade negotiations can alter tariffs, supply chains, and export/import volumes, directly affecting economic growth prospects in both countries and their trading partners. This, in turn, influences currency strength. Investment Flows: Geopolitical stability or tension affects cross-border investment decisions. Uncertainty can lead to capital flight from perceived riskier assets or regions. Technological Competition: Disputes over technology access and dominance can create significant market volatility for tech-heavy economies in Asia. The market is watching these talks closely, hoping for signs of de-escalation or cooperation, which could provide a clearer path forward and potentially unlock more dynamic movement in Asia FX . Decoding the US Dollar Outlook After the Fed Decision The US Dollar has remained relatively steady following the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to hold Fed Interest Rates unchanged. This was widely expected by the market, so the immediate reaction was muted. However, the language used by the Fed and the subsequent commentary provide crucial clues about the future US Dollar Outlook . Key takeaways from the Fed’s stance: Rates on Hold: Maintaining the current rate level signals the Fed believes its monetary policy is appropriately restrictive for now, aiming to bring inflation down towards its target. Data Dependence: The Fed continues to emphasize that future decisions will depend heavily on incoming economic data, particularly regarding inflation and the labor market. Cautious Tone: While acknowledging progress on inflation, the Fed remains cautious, indicating they are not in a hurry to cut rates. This ‘higher for longer’ narrative, even if slightly softened, generally provides support for the US Dollar compared to currencies where central banks might be closer to cutting rates. The steady dollar contributes to the muted environment seen in many currency pairs, including those in Asia FX . What’s Next for Fed Interest Rates and the Dollar? The big question for the Global Forex Market is when and how quickly the Federal Reserve might start cutting Fed Interest Rates . Market expectations have fluctuated significantly throughout the year, reacting to inflation reports and labor data. Currently, the consensus leans towards potential rate cuts later in the year, but the exact timing and number remain uncertain. Factors influencing future Fed Interest Rates decisions: Inflation Data: Continued progress towards the 2% target is paramount. Any resurgence in price pressures could delay cuts. Labor Market: A significant weakening in the jobs market could prompt the Fed to cut rates sooner to support economic growth. Economic Growth: Unexpectedly strong or weak GDP numbers will also play a role in the Fed’s assessment of the economy’s health. The path of Fed Interest Rates will be a primary driver for the US Dollar Outlook in the coming months, directly impacting currency pairs globally and influencing capital flows into various asset classes, including potentially volatile ones like cryptocurrencies. Broader Implications for the Global Forex Market The interplay between cautious central banks, geopolitical negotiations like US China Relations , and the steady but uncertain path of the US Dollar creates a complex picture for the entire Global Forex Market . While Asia FX is currently subdued, this period of consolidation could precede increased volatility once clearer signals emerge. Key implications include: Increased Volatility Risk: When major uncertainties are resolved (positively or negatively), markets can react sharply. Diverging Central Bank Paths: If the Fed’s rate path diverges significantly from other major central banks, it could lead to substantial currency movements. Safe Haven Flows: Renewed geopolitical tensions or economic uncertainty could boost demand for traditional safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar, Swiss Franc, or Japanese Yen. Understanding these macro forces is vital for anyone participating in financial markets, as they set the stage for broader liquidity conditions and risk appetite. Summary: Navigating the Calm Before the Storm? The current state of the Global Forex Market , characterized by muted Asia FX and a steady US Dollar Outlook after the Fed’s decision on Fed Interest Rates , reflects a market waiting for direction. The outcomes of ongoing US China Relations add another layer of complexity and potential catalyst for movement. While volatility is low now, the underlying factors suggest that significant shifts could be on the horizon once key uncertainties are resolved. Staying informed about these macro developments is crucial for making informed decisions in any market, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

The documents, obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, show that the SEC’s internal discussions raised concerns about XRP’s dependency on Ripple, while also confirming that New York’s Attorney General actively pushed for the SEC to support its position that Ether should be treated as a security.

She asked that the agency submit a legal brief supporting the argument that ETH meets the definition of a security . This request was made in connection with New York’s lawsuit against crypto exchange KuCoin, which the state accused of violating securities and commodities laws. Maswoswe said investor protection could improve if Ether were deemed a security. Though ETH’s status wouldn’t affect the case’s outcome, she noted that a favorable ruling could set legal precedent and support the broader classification of crypto assets under securities laws. SEC’s Conversations on XRP and Ripple’s Role The Coinbase document release also exposes that the SEC staff has been evaluating XRP’s legal status since 2021. One internal email raised the issue of whether the XRP Ledger (XRPL) could be impacted if Ripple were no longer involved. This question is central to how the SEC determines whether a digital asset qualifies as a security. The more an asset’s success depends on the performance or promises of a centralized entity, the more likely it is to fall under the SEC’s regulatory scope. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SEC’s Approach to Ethereum Under Gary Gensler, the SEC avoided declaring ETH’s status, never publicly stating his opinion on the asset despite probing Ethereum 2.0. The enforcement division launched, then dropped, an investigation into its sales. At the same time, Consensys filed a legal challenge against the SEC, accusing it of overstepping its authority by trying to regulate ETH as a security. Regulatory Climate Shift Under New Leadership With new leadership steering the SEC, the agency’s stance on crypto appears less aggressive than it was under Gensler. Several high-profile enforcement actions have been rolled back, including the cases against Ripple and Coinbase. This signals a potential softening in the regulatory approach, and many believe the end of the SEC’s lawsuit has cemented XRP’s status.

Accordingly, the governor of Arizona signed a bill that provides for the creation of a reserve fund for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has signed a bill into law that allows a U.S. state to hold Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and establish a “Bitcoin Reserve Fund” that will not use taxpayer money or state funds. The announcement was made via a press release on the governor’s official website. The move follows actions by New Hampshire, where he recently signed a law allowing state funds to invest in Bitcoin and other digital assets. According to the bill that was approved, the state of Arizona will be able to establish a Bitcoin reserve fund without creating a tax burden by evaluating abandoned cryptocurrencies. No taxpayer money or public resources will be used in the creation of the Bitcoin fund. Under a new Arizona law, a cryptocurrency will be considered abandoned if its owner does not respond to messages within three years and will then be turned over to the Internal Revenue Service. These abandoned cryptocurrencies can be actively used to earn rewards through staking and airdrops in the future. The income generated will be transferred to Arizona's “Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund.” As is known, after the postponement of two bills in Florida earlier this week that would allow public funds to be invested in Bitcoin, New Hampshire signed a first in the US and approved a bill allowing crypto investments. *This is not investment advice.

The 94-year-old CEO, known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” named Vice Chairman Greg Abel as his successor to lead the $1 trillion conglomerate into its next era. Buffett, who has been at the top of Berkshire Hathaway since 1965, leaves behind a financial legacy that pushed shares up by a jaw-dropping 5,502,284%. But as he prepares to hand over the reins, the company and Abel now have to decide what to do with the $350 billion in cash reserves Buffett is leaving them with. A businessman is only as good as his liquidity, so a cash portfolio isn’t that bad to have, right? Well, not quite. $350 billion cash reserves, what to do? Berkshire Hathaway ended 2024 with $334 billion in cash, the largest sum it has ever held after selling $134 billion in stock from several firms including Apple and Bank of America, throughout 2024. Since then, that number has swelled to a whopping $350 billion as of May. Cash is the safest go-to for any institution in uncertain markets, but it also limits returns, especially when inflation and low interest rates eat away at real purchasing power. Buffett himself insists that he does not consider cash a superior long-term investment. In his 2024 annual letter to shareholders, he said Berkshire “will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned.” The most pertinent problem with stockpiling cash is one the exiting CEO himself has told tales about: inflation. Holding billions in cash may feel safe during lengthy periods of economic headwinds, but the erosion of purchasing power over time can quietly undermine even the largest portfolios. Certificates of deposit and high-yield savings accounts may offer returns in the 4% to 5% range. However, compared to the S&P 500’s average annual return of over 10% across decades, they count for nought. Will Berkshire’s new CEO change strategies? Incoming CEO Greg Abel is a seasoned executive with experience across Berkshire’s holdings. But the watchful eyes of investors are wondering how he’ll deploy the company’s cash and uphold Warren Buffett’s business principle of, disciplined investing. Observers note that Buffett’s cash management would make it rough for Abel to make decisions in the company. We don’t think Abel wants to be the next Warren Buffett, nobody can, nobody will. He is worth $160 billion because he spent years learning stocks, skimming through financial reports, and almost religiously following 90-year-old manuals. Cash makes you ‘ready for the right moment’ According to some economists, in the event of an economic downturn, Berkshire will be in a powerful position to act while others are retreating. Crypto analyst and private equity investor Miles Deutscher explained his own strategy of holding more than 50% of his net worth in cash. Through a short thread on social platform X, he asserted that “fund managers would cringe at that portfolio weighting.” For Deutscher, cash helps investors move their market positions quickly without the need to liquidate assets at inopportune moments. The question for Berkshire is does Abel see Buffett’s cash-heavy strategy as the best way to go? or will he follow what Wall Street firms do best, deploying capital aggressively? The 62-year-old Vice Chair has $350 billion in cash at his disposal, he can either make the best out of it, or tear down 60 years of Berkshire Hathaway’s success story.",OP-ED|Berkshire Hathaway|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-08 09:46:00

What’s holding back ETH price? Ethereum ( ETH ) successfully implemented the Pectra upgrade on May 7, yet the market’s reaction was underwhelming. On the day of the upgrade, ETH opened at $1,849 and closed at $1,811, recording a slight 2% decline. At press time, ETH is trading at $1,936, marking a mere 5% gain from its May 7 opening. The subdued response can be partly attributed to macro headwinds — most notably, uncertainly in global trade due to the ongoing tariff war. However, Ethereum’s underperformance predates current market risks. In recent months, ETH price has consistently lagged the broader crypto market as Ethereum continued to underperform other layer 1s in terms of user growth. From July 2023 through April 2025, Ethereum’s active addresses, the key indicator of network utility and user growth, have mostly ranged between 400,000 and 600,000. This stands in sharp contrast to competitors like Tron ( TRX ), which surged to over 2.5K active addresses, and Ton ( TON ), which peaked at 3.6K active addresses at one point and has since outperformed Ethereum in terms of user activity.

But the lower address activity signals reduced demand from retail investors, which is often a key driver behind bull runs. Source: DeFiLlama While the Pectra upgrade introduced meaningful upgrades—such as lower blob fees and enhanced wallet usability—it falls short of addressing the key barrier to user growth: the difficulty of bridging assets and data across Ethereum’s fragmented Layer 2 ecosystem. As far as ETH price is concerned, investors likely need clear evidence of growing network adoption in terms of user growth, rather than just the TVL that is already locked, and bridging is key for making this happen.

They are also allowed to provide crypto custody services. In a recent post , Acting Comptroller of the Currency and administrator of the federal banking system, Rodney Hood, declared that cryptocurrency is no longer simply a trend. Instead, it is considered a “transformation” by the federal agency. Therefore, the organization has decided to shift its previously skittish stance towards crypto by allowing banks to engage in financial activities related to cryptocurrencies. “We’ve confirmed that national banks and federal saving associations may engage in certain cryptocurrency activities responsibility, in order to serve their customers,” said Hood in a video statement. OCC-regulated banks may buy and sell assets held in custody and are permitted to outsource bank-permissible crypto-asset activities, including custody and execution services. https://t.co/0ScQdgNaS6 pic.twitter.com/J5dEkx4WUL — OCC (@USOCC) May 7, 2025 These activities include buying and selling crypto held in custody at their customer’s direction. Banks and federal saving associations are also granted the ability to outsource crypto custody and execution services to third parties. However, financial institutions must ensure these services comply with OCC’s safety standards and soundness criteria to ensure proper oversight and risk management. Additionally, OCC-regulated banks are allowed to provide other custody services to customers such as record keeping, tax, or reporting services related to cryptocurrency. “While a range of cryptocurrency and digital asset activities may be performed by banks and their third parties, I want to be clear that the OCC expect these activities to be conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable law,” said Hood. Read more: Trump-era policy shift sparks crypto firms’ push for banking licenses: report In a document issued by the OCC on May 7, the organization clarified their stance on cryptocurrency. The letter cited that banks may act in a fiduciary capacity and a sub-custodian to provide custody services, which are subject to appropriate third-party risk management practices. “The services national banks may provide in relation to the cryptocurrency they are custodying may include services such as facilitating the customer’s cryptocurrency and fiat currency exchange transactions, transaction settlement, trade execution, [record keeping], valuation, tax services, reporting, or other appropriate services,” wrote OCC. The Fed, OCC, and SEC: The pro-crypto shift in banking regulations The change in the OCC’s stance reflects a broader trend of federal organizations embracing crypto in the wake of the Trump administration friendlier stance towards the industry. Banks now have more freedom to get involved with the crypto industry following recent regulatory changes. In late April, the U.S. Federal Reserve announced that it has removed its requirement for state banks to give a notice before participating in crypto-related activities. Not only that, the Fed also withdrew its 2023 guidelines which limited how banks could deal with stablecoins . In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, followed suit by retracting from two joint statements made that same year. In March this year, a number crypto firms were reportedly interested in applying for banking licenses to expand their businesses and potentially reduce borrowing costs. Not to mention, a bank charter would increase their legitimacy as a business operation in the eyes of customers. Last January, the Securities and Exchange Commission removed a rule that had forced banks holding crypto to list it as a liability, easing pressure on financial institutions.

44319395,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158447,1746697819,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exciting Backpack Staking Initiative Launched for SOL Reserves,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/backpack-staking-sol-reserves/,"The world of decentralized finance and centralized crypto platforms continues to evolve rapidly. A significant development recently announced by Backpack, a prominent Solana-based crypto exchange, signals a major step in how exchanges manage their reserves and potentially benefit their users. This announcement centers around Backpack Staking , specifically leveraging their Solana (SOL) holdings. What is Backpack Staking and Why Stake SOL Reserves? Armani Ferrante, the founder and CEO of Backpack, shared the news via social media: Backpack has officially begun the process of staking its internal Solana (SOL) reserves. Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency assets to support the operations of a blockchain network, typically in proof-of-stake systems like Solana. In return for securing the network and validating transactions, stakers receive rewards, often in the form of newly minted tokens or transaction fees. For a Crypto Exchange holding significant reserves, staking presents an opportunity for Yield Generation on otherwise idle assets. Here’s a breakdown of the initial plan: Phase 1 (Current): Backpack is initiating the staking process with its own SOL reserves. Yield Distribution (Initial): All staking yields generated from these reserves will initially be directed towards lenders on the platform. This suggests an integration with Backpack’s lending services, potentially enhancing the returns available to users who lend assets. Future Expansion: The ultimate goal is to expand the distribution of staking yields to include all staking users, encompassing both lenders and depositors on the Backpack platform. This move is strategic. By staking reserves, Backpack not only contributes to the security and decentralization of the Solana Staking network but also creates a new revenue stream that can be passed on to users, potentially making the platform more attractive compared to competitors that do not offer yield on deposited assets. Implications for TVL Reporting and Platform Growth Armani Ferrante also highlighted a potential side effect of this initiative: inaccurate reporting of Total Value Locked (TVL) by external monitoring platforms. He explained, “For now, I expect most platforms monitoring our wallets to inaccurately report our TVL numbers, as they’re not tracking the staked quantity.” This is a common challenge in DeFi and CEX-DeFi integrations. When assets are moved from known exchange hot/cold wallets into staking contracts or protocols, standard blockchain explorers and TVL aggregators may not recognize them as belonging to the exchange’s accessible reserves unless they specifically track those staking addresses and attribute them correctly. This could lead to a temporary dip or misrepresentation of Backpack’s reported TVL, even though the underlying assets are still managed by the exchange, albeit in a yield-generating state via SOL Staking . Looking ahead, Backpack is also preparing for growth. Ferrante mentioned plans to create more wallets to accommodate future inflows. This indicates anticipation of increased user adoption and asset deposits, which could be fueled, in part, by the attractive prospect of earning yield through this new staking program. Benefits and Potential Challenges of Staking Exchange Reserves Staking exchange reserves offers several compelling benefits: Enhanced User Value: Passing on staking yields to users (initially lenders, then depositors) directly adds value and incentivizes holding assets on the platform. This is a key aspect of Yield Generation . Ecosystem Contribution: By staking SOL, Backpack strengthens the Solana network’s security and contributes to its decentralization, benefiting the broader ecosystem it operates within. New Revenue Stream: Staking rewards provide a passive income stream for the exchange itself, which can be reinvested or used to improve services. Competitive Advantage: Offering yield on deposited assets can differentiate Backpack from exchanges that do not provide such features. However, there are also potential challenges: Liquidity Management: Staked assets are typically locked for a period, which needs careful management to ensure the exchange can meet user withdrawal requests. Slashing Risk: While less common with major protocols like Solana, improper validator behavior can lead to a portion of staked assets being “slashed” or penalized. Operational Complexity: Managing staking operations at scale, including choosing validators, monitoring performance, and distributing rewards, adds complexity to exchange operations. TVL Reporting Accuracy: As noted by Ferrante, external reporting can be inaccurate, potentially affecting public perception or ranking based on TVL metrics. How Does This Impact Users? For users of the Backpack platform, this initiative could be very positive. If you are a lender on Backpack, you may soon see enhanced returns as staking yields are directed your way. If you are a depositor, the future plan suggests you could eventually earn yield on your deposited SOL simply by holding it on the exchange, without needing to manage the staking process yourself. This passive income opportunity aligns with the growing user demand for Yield Generation in the crypto space. It’s important for users to stay informed about the specific terms and conditions as Backpack rolls out the program, especially regarding how yields are calculated and distributed, and when the program expands beyond lenders to include all depositors. The Bigger Picture: Staking as a Standard for Crypto Exchanges? Backpack’s move raises questions about whether staking internal reserves and sharing the yield will become a standard practice for Crypto Exchange platforms, particularly those built on or supporting proof-of-stake networks. As the crypto market matures, exchanges are looking for innovative ways to attract and retain users, and offering passive income opportunities like staking rewards directly on deposited assets is a powerful incentive. This trend could lead to increased demand for Solana Staking services overall, as exchanges become major stakers. It also highlights the ongoing convergence of traditional exchange services with DeFi-like yield-generating mechanisms. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Backpack and Solana Backpack’s decision to begin staking its SOL reserves and distribute the yields marks a significant strategic move. It positions the exchange to offer enhanced value to its users through passive income opportunities, strengthens its ties to the Solana ecosystem by contributing to network security, and opens up a new internal revenue stream. While challenges like accurate TVL reporting exist, the potential benefits in terms of user acquisition and retention, as well as contribution to the underlying network, appear substantial. This initiative is a compelling example of how crypto platforms are evolving to integrate yield generation directly into their core services, potentially setting a precedent for other exchanges in the future.

Speaking on the Farokh Radio podcast aired May 6, Zhao said his legal team filed the request following widespread media speculation. “I got lawyers applying,” Zhao said during the interview, saying that he ultimately decided to move forward after stories from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal suggested he was pursuing a pardon from former U.S. President Donald Trump. “If they’re writing this article, I may as well just officially apply,” Zhao added. CZ Cites Trump’s BitMEX Pardons as Key Motivation Zhao, commonly known as CZ, also cited Trump’s past pardons of three BitMEX executives, including Arthur Hayes, as further motivation for submitting the application. According to him, the paperwork was filed roughly two weeks prior to the podcast episode. The former crypto mogul pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act in November 2023 as part of a settlement with U.S. authorities. The agreement led to Binance paying $4.3 billion in fines, with Zhao personally contributing $50 million. He was sentenced to four months in prison and barred from holding any management position at Binance as a condition of the deal. Although a pardon would not erase Zhao’s money laundering conviction, it could potentially clear the way for him to return to a leadership role at Binance.US, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Zhao acknowledged that “no felon would mind a pardon” and believes he may be the only individual to have served time for a Bank Secrecy Act violation. Since stepping down as CEO and serving his sentence, Zhao has remained a shareholder in Binance and has said he has no intention of returning to the helm. Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week in November, he remarked, “I feel the team is doing well and doesn’t need me back.” Zhao has since shifted focus to international advisory work, offering guidance to governments in Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan on crypto regulation and blockchain integration. Trump, who recently granted Ulbricht’s pardon , had promised the crypto community during his campaign that he would free the Silk Road founder. Though he pledged to act on his first day in office, Ulbricht’s release came a day after Trump’s January 20 inauguration. Bhutan Taps Binance to Launch National Crypto Tourism Payment Bhutan has partnered with Binance Pay and DK Bank to allow tourists to pay for nearly all travel-related expenses using cryptocurrency. Tourists can now use digital assets to pay for flights, hotels, tours, visa fees, and even roadside purchases. The system, powered by Binance’s app, supports over 100 cryptocurrencies and enables real-time transactions via QR codes. Payments are instantly settled in local currency by DK Bank, eliminating the need for traditional banking systems, currency exchanges, or international cards—making travel more seamless and affordable for foreign visitors. More than 100 Bhutanese merchants, including rural artisans and small vendors, have joined the system, allowing even remote businesses to accept crypto payments through a simple smartphone.

This debt is theoretically less risky than owning the companies outright, and could result in a strategy that is lower in volatility than MSTR, RIOT, MARA, etc. BMAX is supposed to participate in the upside that comes with those firms, but has underperformed Bitcoin itself since inception. It may take a few years for the potential outperformance to play out, as we are currently very early in the convertible debt cycle; the first maturity is in 2028. Currently, I struggle to find a place in a portfolio to recommend BMAX over a Bitcoin ETF like IBIT, but some investors may still be interested due to its unique offering. Introduction I've been interested in cryptocurrencies for the better part of ten years, but most of my attention has been on the coins themselves, like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), and not the corporations that operate in the space. Of course, over that time, "" Bitcoin Development Company "" Strategy ( MSTR ), formerly MicroStrategy, had caught my attention. The core premise of the company's Bitcoin operations is that it has historically been profitable to buy Bitcoin on credit. The firm pioneered a strategy where they issue convertible debt to buy Bitcoin for their corporate treasury. Enter the REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF ( BMAX ) , from the same advisors who run the famous FEPI ETF , which promises to invest in the convertible bonds Strategy and other firms issue to buy Bitcoin with. It launched in March 2025, carries a fee of 0.85% p.a., and invests directly in the convertible bonds of firms like MSTR as well as Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and MARA Holdings ( MARA ). In REX Shares' words, from their website : The game has changed. Corporate treasuries are evolving, and public companies are now using convertible bonds to stack Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Once reserved for Wall Street’s elite, these are now available to all via ETFs. BMAX strategically focuses on entities like Strategy, a prominent issuer of Bitcoin treasury convertible bonds. This focus allows the fund to leverage the burgeoning market dynamics where digital asset strategies intersect with traditional finance. The strategy seems fairly straightforward when illustrated by REX Shares: REX Shares Convertible Debt The basic premise behind convertible debt is that it doesn't have to be paid in cash, but can be converted into equity to pay creditors instead. This keeps costs low for the business issuing the debt, which allows them to buy more Bitcoin. These come with their own risks, and act as a weird in-between asset for equity and debt. These bonds move alongside the equities that issue them at times, mostly because the payoff for these instruments is more equity and not cash. The way it is being sold by REX Shares is that BMAX is less risky than MSTR because of this relationship between the equity and its convertible bonds. We can see this relationship very clearly when looking at the price return correlation of BMAX against MSTR over the last few months, where the rolling metric is very high, but not perfect. We see the break, where they started to decouple, occur during the most volatile period in this chart, early April. Data by YCharts Let's take a look at the performance outright to see if it's worth holding over MSTR or Bitcoin outright. After all, the only case to be made for BMAX so far is that it is a toned down version of MSTR, but that could be achieved with a lower allocation to MSTR. Performance & Alternatives Performance is very limited, as BMAX is so new, having launched in March this year. However, we did get to see a large drop and recovery through this time, as the fund was launched just before the market's steep fall on April 4th. BMAX fashions itself as less volatile and risky than holding MSTR stock, which itself is like a leveraged position on Bitcoin. Financing Bitcoin leverage for MSTR et al. doesn't right away sound like a risk-off strategy to me, especially compared to owning Bitcoin or a Bitcoin covered call fund like YBTC . According to REX Shares: Convertible bonds combine the security of fixed income with the potential for stock appreciation to stocks active in Bitcoin, seeking a less volatile, more balanced approach to risk and growth. So, let's look at how the fund has held up against its competitors over the course of its short lifespan. Thankfully, we get a wider picture in this performance check than most funds younger than a quarter, thanks to recent market volatility. Data by YCharts While its end performance is very close to that of Bitcoin, we do see a much further drawdown than the largest Bitcoin ETF, IBIT . Fun fact: IBIT owns nearly 3% of BTC's total supply. True to management's claims, MSTR fared worse in the drawdown by the time we found the bottom. In a run-up, like we're seeing in the chart above, we should expect MSTR to have the highest return of all of these funds as it is the most aggressive, followed by Bitcoin outright, then convertible debt used to fund Bitcoin, and finally a Bitcoin covered call fund that sells its upside for income. Consequently, when looking at just the drawdowns, we see the reserve order, with the most aggressive asset, MSTR, being off its highs for longer and more steeply than Data by YCharts BMAX Holdings So let's take a look at what's actually in the fund, other than the general ""convertible bonds"" label. BMAX currently has 11 holdings, ten of them being bonds, and a cash position. While the majority of the holdings are from MSTR, we do see a near-11% allocation to MARA bonds, and a 3.5% allocation to a RIOT bond. REX Shares Note that the fund doesn't exclude ownership of the equity they may gain from bonds being converted, but limits their holdings to 20% of NAV. That being said, the current allocation is 0% to equity outright. This is most likely because none of the holdings have been converted yet, and so BMAX hasn't had the chance to I imagine this provision is in the fund so that the managers can choose when to sell the equity, and are not forced by the fund's rules to sell as soon as they are in possession of the shares, which could be disadvantageous based on the given market conditions when the conversions occur. Also note that most of these bonds do not pay very high yields, or any yield at all. This is due to the convertible nature, where investors understand the upside is in the equity being acquired at a discount and not in regular payments of cash. This system is very advantageous for MSTR et al. because they are able to raise capital now to buy Bitcoin at today's prices instead of tomorrow's prices. We can see this in the following chart, where REX Shares breaks down BMAX's holdings and highlights the price these firms purchased Bitcoin at using that round's funding. They range from the highlighted prices, under $70k, to as high as $96k. REX Shares BMAX Dividends & Yield The fund has never paid a dividend, but it likely will at some point. This is due to the fact that there is some yield to be had in these bonds, with the highest coupons coming in at 2.25% and the lowest at 0%. Expect the yield on the fund to be very low, likely sub 1% when all is said and done. Most of what the yield will do is help offset the 0.85% p.a. management fee. Regarding this, REX Shares writes : ...BMAX seeks to pay quarterly dividends from interest income and bond gains. However, they are expected to be minimal as most of the convertible bonds issued by the bond issuers currently pay zero or near zero interest rates. Suitability Who is this fund for? The only answer I can come up with is: people who want to invest in MSTR, but are afraid of volatility. That may sound like an oxymoron to some, but there must be a market out there for these folks, given BMAX exists, and the bonds do sell on the market. I'm not going to give allocation guidance for BMAX in particular, because I don't see a world in which it's more suitable for investors than owning a Bitcoin ETF, like IBIT. This fund is definitely not suitable for moderate and conservative investors, but neither are MSTR and Bitcoin. The aggressive investors already interested in the asset are likely better off owning MSTR outright, and taking advantage of the higher risk, higher reward environment that being on the issuance side of the convertible debt offers. Investors that believe MSTR is too risky are better off owning Bitcoin through an ETF like IBIT than BMAX, as they won't get the downside that comes with MSTR bonds; that downside appears to be more than IBIT's own, based on BMAX's short history. The risk and reward may not be right for most folks. As a counter-weight, here is REX Shares' answer to the ""who should consider this fund"" question: BMAX may be a good fit for investors who want to tap into Bitcoin’s long-term potential—but with a more balanced, risk-aware approach. It’s designed for people who: Want exposure to companies investing in Bitcoin, without holding crypto directly Prefer less day-to-day volatility than owning Bitcoin or mining stocks Like the structure of a regulated ETF that trades in a regular brokerage account Are looking for a way to diversify their portfolio with digital asset themes, but still want built-in protection If you’re curious about Bitcoin but want a smarter, more strategic way to participate, BMAX could be a good starting point They may seem to contradict me, as ""less day-to-day volatility than owning Bitcoin"" hasn't proven true so far, but it may just be too early to tell for sure. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt on that one. Data by YCharts It should also be noted that ""Like the structure of a regulated ETF that trades in a regular brokerage account"" does also apply to IBIT. While I use it for a direct comparison to BMAX, since it is an ETF that owns Bitcoin, the fund managers are referencing BMAX as an alternative to self-custody or exchange-traded Bitcoin, like on Coinbase ( COIN ), Robinhood ( HOOD ), or eToro ( ETOR ), where investors can buy paper Bitcoin held by the exchange to trade spot prices, as opposed to an ETF. Conclusion Ultimately, I struggle to find an answer to ""why would I invest in the REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF ((BMAX))?"" It doesn't seem to offer the same kind of protection from a tanking Bitcoin market that it claims, and over its short lifetime, has shown worse resilience than Bitcoin ETFs. However, the fund is definitely a risk-off version of Strategy, and does provide investors access to assets not usually available to retail investors, which does earn BMAX some points. While I struggle to recommend it, the fund is serving its purpose as a way for retail investors to get access to the convertible debt strategy MSTR pioneered in the corporate Bitcoin space. This fund needs a lot more time to be properly reviewed, likely years, because how it reacts to when its bonds convert or mature will be telling of long-term performance. The fund is too new for these events to happen yet, and so it's unclear how the fund will react currently. Its first bond doesn't mature until 2028, and has a put date in 2027. We'll have to wait for that to play out before we can really evaluate the fund's performance against alternatives.

In a world where volatility is the norm, HTX DeepThink aims to help readers “ Find Order in Chaos .” This week, what does Trump’s emerging token plan mean for crypto markets? Why is the Fed holding rates steady? Behind Bitcoin’s rebound, are hidden risks lurking? In this edition of HTX DeepThink, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research breaks it all down. Trump Media Group’s Utility Token: A Potential Shift in U.S. Equity Tokenization On April 30, Trump Media & Technology Group announced it would collaborate with the Truth digital wallet to launch a new utility token called DJT. Initially, DJT will facilitate payments for the Truth+ subscription service, with plans to expand its utility across the Truth ecosystem. It’s the first time a publicly listed U.S. media company is launching a utility token tied to a real-world product ecosystem, signifying a historic convergence between traditional equities and on-chain asset formats. Although the team has yet to announce a release date, blockchain platform, or tokenomics, the rollout appears to follow Trump’s classic strategy: hype first, details later . DJT is hitting the market at just the right moment as memecoin mania is cooling and narratives are shifting toward utility and payment integration. Similar to HTX’s recent listing of WLFI’s USD1, demand for “practical crypto assets” is surging. DJT combines powerful political branding with real ecosystem support, offering long-term value potential far beyond that of short-lived meme-driven tokens. U.S.-China Trade Talks: A Temporary Easing Amidst Persistent Tensions This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Besant and Trade Representative Jamison Greer will meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Geneva. This meeting, the first high-level U.S.-China trade talks since heightened tensions in spring 2025, signals a potential diplomatic thaw. Although both sides still dispute who initiated the talks, the meeting alone sends a strong signal of reengagement and diplomatic thawing . With tariffs at historic highs, markets are interpreting the summit as a short-term de-escalation of geopolitical risks—sparking a relief rally in risk assets. Following the news, Bitcoin rose by approximately 3.6%, briefly surpassing $97,000. This reflects how sensitive capital flows remain to macro-level easing signals. While structural differences between the two nations are far from resolved, the current window of policy détente may offer a short-term liquidity boost for digital assets, gold, and tech stocks . Powell Throws : “Now Is Not the Time to Cut Rates” On May 8, the Fed held interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% for the third consecutive meeting. While it was widely expected, Fed Chair Jerome Powell struck a noticeably more cautious tone during the press conference: “Now is not the time for us to lead with a rate cut.” “The cost of waiting is relatively low.” “Whether we cut this year depends on how things develop.” The Fed is currently caught in a “dual bind” : on one hand, disinflation has stalled, with PCE and CPI both above the 2% target. On the other, the central bank’s fiscal position is deteriorating. A 25–30 bps rate cut could shave $20 billion off annual income, further reducing remittances to the Treasury and raising concerns over the Fed’s policy independence. As a result, despite markets currently pricing in three rate cuts in 2025, the Fed is more likely to take a “data-driven, delayed transition” approach. Bitcoin’s Market Dynamics: Macroeconomic Data to Dictate Direction Despite BTC rebounding to around $99,000 on geopolitical and monetary optimism, the options market is not confirming a strong directional bias. Deribit data shows implied volatility on June and July calls rising only modestly, while 25d risk reversals remain neutral to slightly bearish , and skew curves are relatively flat. Notably, large Gamma exposures are clustered around the $95,000–$100,000 range, indicating that BTC is currently trapped in a “high-volatility, low-conviction” zone awaiting macro catalysts. If CPI and jobs data for May–June remain hot, the Fed may push back on rate cut expectations— risking a BTC pullback . Conversely, if inflation cools and unemployment ticks up, Powell may pivot dovishly, providing a green light for BTC to break out of its volatility compression range and resume its bullish trend. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,820, reflecting a 3.3% increase over the last seven days and a 2.5% gain in the past 24 hours. While the asset remains well below its all-time highs, this gradual rise suggests a potential shift in sentiment among investors. The latest on-chain insights from CryptoQuant point to a notable trend developing within Ethereum’s staking ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Insanely Undervalued’ As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking – Is A Rally Imminent? Post-Pectra Staking Activity Marks Sentiment Shift According to analyst Kripto Mevsimi, the post-Pectra upgrade period has been marked by a reversal in staking flows. After a brief pullback ahead of the network update, ETH holders appear to be returning to staking, with fresh inflows suggesting renewed interest and confidence in Ethereum’s long-term direction. Mevsimi’s analysis shows that between November 16 and February 15, before the Pectra upgrade was publicly announced, Ethereum’s total staked supply dropped by over 1 million ETH. This retreat likely reflected investor uncertainty surrounding the update and broader market conditions. However, from mid-February to mid-May, staked ETH has increased by approximately 627,000 ETH, signaling a return of staking activity following Pectra’s implementation. The upgrade itself introduced important validator improvements and flexibility enhancements, including EIP-7002, which some analysts believe may pave the way for institutional adoption or potential ETF alignment. The renewed staking trend, while not yet dramatic in scale, appears to indicate an early phase of repositioning within the Ethereum ecosystem. Mevsimi suggests that this could mark the beginning of institutional preparation or a broader reassessment of Ethereum’s staking value proposition. With regulatory clarity still developing and macroeconomic uncertainty in play, the future of this trend remains fluid. However, the behavioral pivot post-upgrade may reflect strengthening structural support for Ethereum as a network. Ethereum Fee Revenue Declines Despite Price Recovery While staking metrics suggest a shift toward renewed engagement, Ethereum’s on-chain activity presents a more cautious picture. In a separate update, CryptoQuant analyst Carmelo Alemán highlighted a steep drop in the network’s fee revenue. Data from the Ethereum: fees (Total) metric reveals that daily fees have plummeted from 5,646 ETH on November 13, 2024, to just 292 ETH by May 6, 2025—a 94.82% decline. This dramatic reduction in fee generation impacts validators directly, as it lowers rewards tied to securing the network. Alemán notes that the decline may also be linked to reduced demand for block space, fewer transactions, or increasing user migration to Layer 2 platforms such as Arbitrum, Optimism, or zkSync, where fees are typically much lower.

Notably, 42% of these users interact with crypto-related content, highlighting Telegram’s pivotal role in the crypto community. Telegram bots like CoinMarketCap’s price tracker and Cointelegraph’s news feed now deliver market insights directly in chats, bypassing browser-based interfaces. While some bots focus on providing real-time data and insights – including price updates, news, and on-chain statistics, others go further by enabling trading, airdrop farming, and other interactive functions. Tools like Unibot and LootBot capitalize on Telegram’s intuitive design to reduce technical barriers and offer active engagement features. A 2024 MarketsandMarkets report projects the crypto bot market will reach $1.5 billion by 2027, with Telegram bots driving much of that growth due to their ease of use. This shift reflects a broader change in crypto tool design: prioritizing fewer buttons, automated processes, and mobile-friendly experiences. Hardbeed , a live stats feed for a fully on-chain binary options protocol on Ethereum, is one of the projects that chose to go “Telegram-first”. The bot monitors an on-chain system where users predict ETH/USDC price movements (up or down) in 1-minute rounds and delivers real-time data like round outcomes, transaction volumes, and address-specific activity, making complex blockchain events digestible. Today, we are going to see why developers are choosing to go pro-Telegram, the advantages and disadvantages of using Telegram as an interface, and explain how Hardbeed’s channel operates through this setup. Why Telegram? The Rise of Bot-First Crypto Tools Crypto developers and users are gravitating toward Telegram for its mobile-first, conversational interface. Unlike dApps that demand wallet integrations or technical know-how, Telegram bots deliver blockchain data and insights in a format as intuitive as texting. For newcomers, this lowers the entry barrier; for experienced traders, it offers speed, transparency, and convenience. Several bots now push market updates and on-chain data directly to Telegram chats, bypassing browser-based dashboards. Some also enable trading or airdrop farming via simple commands, while others focus on monitoring real-time stats, price movements, or contract activity. This trend reflects a user preference for lightweight tools that distill complex data into actionable insights, especially on mobile devices where most crypto activity now occurs. Telegram’s appeal lies in its flexibility. Its bot API supports real-time updates, ideal for tracking volatile markets or monitoring contract activity. End-to-end encryption ensures secure communication, while group chats increase community engagement. Traditional dApps, with their button-heavy layouts, require constant navigation. Bot-first tools, conversely, automate data delivery, serve users without friction, and eliminate the learning curve for beginners as they embed tools within a platform users already know. Hardbeed: Redefining On-Chain Insights via Telegram Unlike trading bots that execute orders or manage funds, Hardbeed tracks the performance and activity of an entirely on-chain binary options protocol. Through the protocol, users predict ETH/USDC price movements in 1-minute rounds by staking ETH directly via smart contracts and earning rewards for correct outcomes. Unlike custodial platforms, users retain full control of their funds – there are no deposits or platform-held balances. Each prediction is made through a single on-chain transaction from the user’s wallet. Payouts are automated and processed by smart contracts shortly after each round, typically within 3 to 20 blocks (around 1 to 5 seconds), removing the need for manual claims or third-party intervention. Outcomes are determined using transparent Uniswap v3 price data, allowing all results to be publicly verified. Hardbeed’s Telegram feed reports live stats, recent round results, trading volumes, and wallet-specific activity, making complex blockchain data accessible without requiring users to sift through Etherscan. This observation-only model sets Hardbeed apart. It aligns with platforms like Thales, which simplify DeFi interactions, but its focus on visibility rather than execution is unique. Beginners who aren’t familiar with dApp interfaces or blockchain explorers can follow crypto price prediction rounds via Telegram’s familiar UX. It does not require users to connect their wallets or submit KYC information; therefore, it broadens access for crypto-curious observers. Advantages and Disadvantages of using Telegram Bots as Interfaces for Crypto Projects Bots like Hardbeed provide easy access to cryptocurrency information, allowing users to track on-chain activity from their phones anywhere. They simplify complex data, making it easier to understand market movements, and foster community discussions through Telegram channels. However, on the other hand, they have limitations. Hardbeed’s simple design may not satisfy advanced users looking for detailed analytics. The text format with less visual cues, can also overwhelm users with too much information. Additionally, Ethereum ‘s fluctuating fees can discourage smaller users, highlighting challenges in scalability. The Future of Crypto Interfaces Hardbeed’s bot-first approach reflects a broader shift in crypto interface design: moving away from complex decentralized applications (dApps) toward simpler, automated conversational tools. Telegram’s dominance as a UX layer highlights that many users prefer streamlined solutions over feature-heavy platforms. Bots like Hardbeed are particularly effective at translating complex on-chain activity – such as prediction outcomes, transaction volumes, and wallet activity, into easy-to-understand insights. While text-based bots are limited by platform constraints, they offer real-time, accessible data without requiring users to navigate block explorers or dashboards. This approach lowers the barriers to understanding blockchain mechanics and promotes transparency without overwhelming users with technical complexity.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-08 10:00:11

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also noted on Wednesday he believes the U.S. should be the premier destination for digital assets. Lummis also noted in late February that the U.S. can either pave the way for digital assets or fall behind. She made the remarks as she was seeking clarification from the SEC on digital assets ETP staking restrictions to make U.S. asset managers competitive in the global market. Lummis and other senators argued that the lack of availability of protocol staking for crypto issuers impacts the investment potential of digital asset ETPs in the U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis advocates for the U.S. to embrace crypto Digital assets ARE the future. We either embrace them, or we lose. There is not an in between. — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) May 8, 2025 U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis said on Thursday that digital assets are the future of the financial industry. She also urged the U.S. to embrace cryptocurrencies or get to lose them because there’s no in between. The U.S. Senator was also named the first-ever Chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets on January 23, 2025. Lummis highlighted that cryptocurrencies are the future and Congress needed to urgently pass bipartisan legislation establishing a comprehensive legal framework for virtual assets if the U.S. wanted to remain a global leader in financial innovation. The Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets was also tasked with conducting robust oversight over Federal crypto regulations to ensure the agencies are following the law, including ensuring Operation Chokepoint 2.0 never happens again. Lummis also advocates for the GENIUS Act to be enacted, and she believes the U.S. needs the bill, which will establish the first-of-its-kind legislation ahead of a possible key vote on it on Thursday. The Senate Banking Committee advanced the GENIUS Act in March with bipartisan backing. The senator for Wyoming argued that the bill requires all stablecoin issuers, even those based overseas, to be able to freeze and recover coins when ordered by U.S. authorities. She also said the bill would create a level playing field between banking and commerce. Lummis added that the GENIUS Act will ensure stablecoins are always backed 1:1, which she believes will prevent destabilizing runs through a tailored regulatory framework. The government official acknowledged that the bill makes it clear that ethics laws apply to members of Congress and Senior Executives in the government. Her remarks came in the wake of non-Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family’s business ventures involving digital assets. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts noted that the stablecoin bill falls short of safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system, and national security. Treasury’s Bessent says the U.S. should be the premier destination for crypto Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the House Financial Services Committee on May 7 that the Trump administration wants the digital asset industry to come to the U.S. and play a global leadership role in the sector. “We believe that the United States should be the premier destination for digital assets. And as members of this committee, and the senate are attempting to create a good market structure around that so that the United States best practices are used around the world.” ~ Scott Bessent, The U.S. Treasury Secretary. Bessent believes the administration’s efforts to promote clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets will contribute to that goal. When asked about the impacts if the U.S. doesn’t take a leadership role in regulating crypto, Bessent referred to the previous administration. He noted that an unregulated and renegade ecosystem sprang up outside the U.S., where illicit actors abused the value of the transfer systems, leading to a technological loss.

After an initial buzz, these investment vehicles have hit a patch of outflows, raising questions about their immediate trajectory. What’s Happening with U.S. Spot ETH ETFs? According to data from Farside Investors, U.S. spot ETH ETFs collectively experienced a net outflow of $21.8 million on May 7th. This marks the second consecutive day these funds have seen more money leaving than entering, a notable change from the initial period following their launch. Interestingly, the data reveals that this particular day’s outflow was concentrated entirely within a single fund: BlackRock’s ETHA . While other U.S. spot ETH ETFs reported no changes in their holdings on May 7th, BlackRock’s fund accounted for the entirety of the day’s withdrawal figure. Here’s a simple breakdown of the situation on May 7th: Total Net Outflow: $21.8 million Contributing Fund: BlackRock’s ETHA Other Funds: No reported changes (Net Zero Flow) Source: Farside Investors Data Why Are We Seeing ETH ETF Outflows? The occurrence of ETH ETF outflows, even if concentrated, prompts analysis. Several factors could be at play: Profit-Taking: Investors who entered the market early or during price rallies might be cashing out some gains. Market Sentiment: Broader market corrections or uncertainty could lead to risk-off sentiment, affecting crypto-related investments like Ethereum ETFs. Fund-Specific Activity: The concentration of outflows in BlackRock ETHA could be due to specific large institutional movements or trading strategies unique to participants in that particular fund. Rotation: Capital might be rotating into other asset classes or even other cryptocurrencies perceived as having better short-term prospects. It’s crucial to remember that two days of outflows, especially when relatively small compared to overall assets under management (AUM), don’t necessarily signal a long-term trend reversal. However, they are important data points for assessing investor appetite. The Significance of BlackRock ETHA’s Movement The fact that the entire outflow on May 7th came from BlackRock ETHA is particularly noteworthy. BlackRock is one of the largest asset managers globally, and their participation in the crypto space through funds like ETHA is closely watched by the market. While the reason for the specific withdrawal isn’t public, it highlights that even large, well-regarded funds are subject to the ebb and flow of investor capital. Understanding the drivers behind movements in funds like BlackRock ETHA can offer insights into the behavior of potentially larger, more sophisticated investors participating in the Ethereum ETF market. Keeping Up with Crypto ETF News For investors and enthusiasts alike, staying informed about Crypto ETF news is vital. Fund flow data provides a tangible metric of how capital is moving into or out of these regulated investment products. While price action is the most visible indicator, fund flows offer a deeper look into institutional and retail investor sentiment via these specific vehicles. Tracking these flows helps in: Assessing demand for the underlying asset (Ethereum in this case). Understanding the impact of macroeconomic factors on crypto investment products. Identifying potential trends in institutional adoption or divestment. The current ETH ETF outflows are a piece of the larger Crypto ETF news puzzle. It’s essential to look at these numbers in context, considering overall market conditions, trading volume, and the performance of Ethereum itself. What Should Investors Consider? For those invested in or considering U.S. spot ETH ETFs or Ethereum directly, these outflows are a reminder of market volatility. It’s an opportunity to: Review Your Strategy: Are your investment goals aligned with the current market phase? Stay Informed: Keep tracking fund flow data, market news, and regulatory developments. Assess Risk: Understand that ETF flows can be influenced by short-term trading as well as long-term investment decisions. While the initial launch saw significant inflows, periods of outflows are a normal part of any market cycle for ETFs. The key is to observe whether these become a sustained trend or remain isolated events. Conclusion: Watching the Tides of the Ethereum ETF Market The recent data showing ETH ETF outflows, specifically the $21.8 million on May 7th led by BlackRock ETHA, highlights the dynamic nature of the U.S. spot ETH ETFs market. While two days of outflows don’t dictate the future, they serve as an important data point for investors tracking the pulse of institutional and retail interest in Ethereum via these regulated products.

This 30% bounce-back reflects its resilience, supported by post-halving dynamics and increased institutional adoption. However, while Bitcoin enjoys its widespread recognition, a new player, Ruvi , offers an exciting opportunity for those looking for exponential growth at the ground level. Bitcoin’s Strength Remains, But Ruvi Stands Out Bitcoin’s rebound into bull market territory has re-energized the crypto space. The $97,000 mark has become a key level of resistance, and analysts anticipate that breaking above $100,000 could spark another wave of FOMO. Yet, Bitcoin’s sheer size and dominance mean that its growth potential is more steady than explosive. For those seeking high-reward investments, Ruvi stands out as a compelling alternative. Ruvi is in its presale stage, priced at just $0.01 per token. With a capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens, its foundation is built for scarcity. Unlike Bitcoin, Ruvi also incorporates decentralized monetization and AI tools, creating additional utility and positioning itself for strong demand as these markets mature. Ruvi’s Rewarding Bonus Structure Ruvi’s standout feature is its tiered bonus structure, offering significant rewards for investors during the presale phase. This system not only multiplies token holdings but also maximizes potential returns as Ruvi gains market traction. Here’s a breakdown of how bonuses supercharge investments at different levels: $750 Investment At $750, you acquire 75,000 tokens during presale. A 40% bonus adds an extra 30,000 tokens, making a total of 105,000 tokens. If Ruvi climbs to $3 per token, your portfolio could expand to $315,000. $1,500 Investment Investing $1,500 nets you 150,000 tokens. The 60% bonus provides a further 90,000 tokens, resulting in 240,000 tokens overall. With Ruvi reaching a conservative $2 per token, your holdings would equal $480,000. $7,500 Investment For those going big with $7,500, you secure 750,000 tokens. Ruvi’s 100% bonus doubles this amount, resulting in 1.5 million tokens. If the price of Ruvi rises to $2, you’re looking at a jaw-dropping $3 million. Why Timing Matters Being an early investor in Ruvi means capitalizing on low entry prices and unbeatable presale bonuses. Bitcoin once started as an underdog, and its early adopters reaped massive rewards over time. Now, Ruvi offers a similar ground-floor opportunity. Unlike Bitcoin’s present-day stability, Ruvi’s presale ensures investors access the highest growth potential before its tokens hit the broader markets. Additionally, Ruvi’s capped supply of tokens introduces built-in scarcity, while its innovative features cater to emerging trends in AI and decentralized monetization. This unique positioning enhances its appeal and sets the stage for impressive long-term adoption. The Case for Diversification While Bitcoin’s $95,000 price is a testament to its dominance, Ruvi represents an agile, high-growth project appealing to investors chasing early-stage value. Whether you’re starting with a modest investment or committing significant capital, Ruvi’s presale creates an accessible avenue to potentially transform your portfolio. For those who hate missing out, Ruvi’s presale is a rare chance to secure high-potential tokens with significant bonus perks. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Take the first step today and position yourself for what could be one of crypto’s next big success stories.

Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, PEPE, and others also posted solid gains, while the niche added around $4 billion in value in just one day. This Meme Goes Vertical The cryptocurrency market has recorded a notable surge in the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin (BTC) inching closer to the psychological level of $100,000. Most leading altcoins are also well in the green, while the meme coin niche is full of top performers. An example is the Ethereum-based Mog Coin (MOG), whose valuation exploded by 40% for the day, rising to its highest level since the beginning of February. Its market capitalization exceeded $350 million, placing it among the 15 largest meme coins. MOG Price, Source: CoinGecko Besides the overall revival of the cryptocurrency sector, there seems to be another factor fueling MOG’s latest rally. Some influential figures have recently supported the emerging “mog/acc” movement, representing a blend of meme culture and tech futurism. The shiny “mog glasses” have become a visual signature of the trend and are also featured on the logo of the MOG meme coin. Popular individuals who added such an accessory to their profile pictures on X include Garry Tan, the President and CEO of Y Combinator, and Elon Musk, one of the wealthiest people on the planet. “Mog/acc means your brain power turns into real prosperity in the real world,” Tan recently stated on the social media platform . The cat-themed meme coin MOG saw the light of day in the summer of 2023 , but made the headlines in December last year when it reached an all-time high. The recent resurgence has infused significant enthusiasm across its community, with one X user claiming that a new peak “is not a matter of if but instead when.” How Аre the Other Memes Doing? One will find it quite challenging to spot a meme coin in the red zone for the day. Dogecoin (DOGE) – the undisputed leader of the realm – is up 6%, currently trading well above $0.18. Its biggest rival – Shiba Inu (SHIB) – has risen by 5%, while Pepe (PEPE), Official Trump (TRUMP), Bonk (BONK), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), dogwifhat (WIF), and many more have recorded double-digit increases. The sector’s market cap has spiked by 8% in 24 hours, and as of this writing, it stands at almost $61 billion. This represents serious progress compared to the sub-$45 billion level witnessed last month, but remains far from the peak towards the end of 2024, when the capitalization exploded above $120 billion.

The market is laying the foundations for a “potentially significant price breakout,” new analysis says. Profit-taking is not hindering the overall bull market rebound. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is setting new all-time highs in network value as BTC price action eyes a return to six figures. Data from onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant confirms new record highs for Bitcoin’s realized cap. Bitcoin realized cap reflects “growing conviction” Bitcoin is worth more than ever in US dollar terms if its market cap is measured by the value at which the extant supply last moved onchain. Known as realized cap, this figure has seen continued all-time highs since mid-April as BTC/USD stages a sustained recovery, and as of May 7 stood at $891 billion. “Bitcoin has experienced a steady flow of capital inflows in recent weeks, reflecting renewed interest from investors,” CryptoQuant contributor Carmelo Alemán summarized in one of its “Quicktake” blog posts on May 7. Alemán argued that the realized cap uptrend reflects a long-term market shift across the Bitcoin investor spectrum. “This new all-time high in Realized Cap not only reflects a surge in invested capital but also a growing conviction in Bitcoin's long-term potential as a financial asset,” the post concluded. “With sustained accumulation from both LTHs and STHs, the market appears to be building a solid foundation for a potentially significant price breakout. If this trend continues, we could be witnessing the early stages of a new bull cycle for Bitcoin.” Bitcoin realized cap.

In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “ The Week Onchain ,” research firm Glassnode nonetheless argues that buy and sell-side conditions are balanced at around $100,000. “A surge in profit taking can be observed in recent weeks, with the recent rally drawing in over $1B/day in net capital inflows,” it wrote. “This points to initial indicators of a return of demand-side strength, allowing sellers to lock in profits, and speaking to buyers willing to pick up coins at the current market price. Generally speaking, this points to a wave of demand which is absorbing the incoming supply.” Bitcoin net realized profit/loss (screenshot).

The official X account of leading cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com revealed a groundbreaking Crypto.com Emarat partnership . This collaboration with Emarat, a state-owned oil and gas company in the UAE, is set to introduce the very first crypto integration at Emarat service stations across the Emirates. This isn’t just another crypto news headline; it represents a tangible step towards using digital currencies for everyday transactions in a major economy. Partnering with a prominent, state-owned entity like Emarat lends significant credibility and visibility to the practical application of cryptocurrencies, specifically enabling crypto payments UAE -wide at their locations. What Does the Emarat Crypto Integration Mean? At its core, the announcement signifies that customers at Emarat service stations will soon have the option to pay for fuel, convenience store items, and other services using cryptocurrency. While the specific technical details regarding which cryptocurrencies will be accepted, the payment process, and the underlying infrastructure are yet to be fully disclosed, the intent is clear: to provide a novel and modern payment alternative. This Emarat crypto integration is a pilot program that could potentially pave the way for broader adoption of digital payments within the UAE’s retail and service sectors. For Emarat, it’s a move to embrace technological innovation and cater to a growing segment of the population that holds or is interested in using cryptocurrencies. For Crypto.com, it solidifies their position as a key player in facilitating real-world crypto transactions and expands their footprint in the strategically important Middle East market. Why is this Crypto.com UAE Partnership So Important? The significance of this development extends beyond just adding a new payment option at gas stations. It highlights several key trends: Mainstream Adoption: Partnering with a state-owned entity like Emarat signals a level of acceptance and trust in cryptocurrencies from traditional, large-scale businesses. Regulatory Environment: The UAE has been proactive in establishing regulatory frameworks for virtual assets, making it a fertile ground for such partnerships. This collaboration likely benefits from that clearer regulatory landscape. Practical Utility: Moving beyond speculation and investment, this partnership focuses on the practical utility of crypto for everyday purchases, a crucial step for mass adoption. Setting a Precedent: Success in this pilot could encourage other businesses in the UAE and the broader Middle East region to explore similar crypto payment integrations. The presence of a major global exchange like Crypto.com in the UAE market is a testament to the region’s growing importance in the crypto world. The Crypto.com UAE operations are clearly focused on driving real-world use cases. Boosting Crypto Adoption Middle East The Middle East, particularly the UAE, has emerged as a hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. Governments in the region are actively exploring and implementing strategies to become leaders in the digital economy. Initiatives like the Crypto.com Emarat partnership are direct results of this forward-thinking approach. Several factors contribute to the rapid crypto adoption Middle East : Supportive regulatory initiatives and free zones dedicated to crypto businesses. A young, tech-savvy population eager to adopt new technologies. Government diversification efforts away from traditional oil-based economies towards digital and knowledge-based industries. High smartphone penetration and digital literacy. This partnership fits perfectly within this narrative, showcasing how traditional sectors can integrate with the burgeoning digital asset space, making crypto payments UAE a more common sight. How Might Crypto Payments at Emarat Stations Work? While specifics are pending, the typical process for retail crypto payments often involves: Customer Scan: The customer uses their crypto wallet app (potentially the Crypto.com app or others) to scan a QR code displayed at the point of sale. Payment Confirmation: The app displays the amount due in the selected cryptocurrency (calculated based on the current exchange rate) and prompts the user to confirm the transaction. Instant Conversion: The payment processor facilitates the transaction, often instantly converting the cryptocurrency received into fiat currency (UAE Dirhams) before settling with Emarat. This protects Emarat from crypto price volatility. Transaction Confirmation: Both the customer and the merchant receive confirmation of the successful payment. The success of this Emarat crypto integration will heavily rely on a seamless and user-friendly experience at the point of sale. What are the Benefits and Challenges? Like any pioneering initiative, the Crypto.com Emarat partnership comes with its own set of potential benefits and challenges. Potential Benefits: For Emarat: Attracting tech-forward customers, enhancing brand image as innovative, potentially lower transaction fees compared to some traditional methods, faster settlement. For Crypto.com: Expanding utility and adoption of their platform, strengthening presence in a key market, showcasing ability to partner with large traditional enterprises. For Customers: An alternative payment method, potential convenience for those holding crypto, increased utility for digital assets. For the UAE: Reinforcing its status as a global hub for innovation and digital transformation, promoting crypto payments UAE wide, boosting overall crypto adoption Middle East . Potential Challenges: User Education: Many people are still unfamiliar or uncomfortable with using crypto for payments. Volatility: While instant conversion mitigates risk for the merchant, users are still exposed to volatility between holding the crypto and spending it. Technical Implementation: Ensuring reliable and fast transaction processing at every service station. Regulatory Evolution: While the UAE is progressive, the regulatory landscape for crypto payments is still evolving globally. Integration with Existing Systems: Ensuring seamless integration with Emarat’s current payment and accounting systems. Overcoming these challenges will be crucial for the long-term success and scalability of the Emarat crypto integration . Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Payments in the Middle East The Crypto.com Emarat partnership is more than just a pilot program; it’s a statement about the future of finance and commerce in the region. As crypto adoption Middle East continues to grow, we can anticipate more such collaborations between crypto platforms and traditional businesses. This could extend to various sectors: Retail and hospitality Real estate Transportation Government services The success of crypto payments UAE at Emarat stations could serve as a blueprint for other companies looking to integrate digital assets into their operations. It underscores the UAE’s ambition to be at the forefront of the digital revolution. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Crypto Utility The announcement of the Crypto.com Emarat partnership is a landmark moment for the practical application of cryptocurrencies. By bringing the option of crypto payments UAE to everyday locations like service stations, this collaboration significantly boosts the utility and visibility of digital assets.

44320055,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158468,1746699024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase SEC Clash: Shocking FOIA Findings Expose Regulatory Uncertainty,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-sec-foia-findings/,"In the ongoing high-stakes legal dance between cryptocurrency giant Coinbase and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a new layer of intrigue has been added. Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer (CLO) at Coinbase, has begun peeling back the curtain on internal government communications, thanks to persistent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. These requests, aimed at various U.S. agencies, are starting to yield documents that offer a fascinating, and at times, contradictory glimpse into how regulators have historically viewed and handled the burgeoning crypto space. The findings shared by Grewal raise significant questions about the consistency and preparedness of the SEC regarding Coinbase SEC interactions and the broader industry. Unpacking the FOIA SEC Revelations Coinbase has been actively pursuing transparency through the FOIA process, seeking documents that shed light on the regulatory thinking within agencies like the SEC. Paul Grewal has taken to social media platform X to share some initial, noteworthy findings from these requests. These documents are more than just bureaucratic paper trails; they represent tangible evidence of internal discussions and considerations that could be highly relevant to ongoing legal debates and the future of FOIA SEC transparency. So far, Grewal has highlighted three specific findings that seem particularly telling: An early acknowledgment of a regulatory challenge. Insights into discussions surrounding a major cryptocurrency’s classification. A revealing detail about the agency’s technical capabilities. Let’s delve into each of these revelations and explore their potential implications. The ‘Crypto Regulatory Gap’ Admission: A Key Finding One of the most striking findings shared by Grewal is an email from 2019 within the SEC itself. According to Grewal, this internal communication explicitly acknowledges a “crypto regulatory gap.” This is highly significant because the SEC, particularly in more recent years, has often asserted that existing securities laws are sufficient to regulate the vast majority of cryptocurrencies and related activities. The stance has been that the ‘rules of the road’ are clear, and the industry simply needs to comply. However, a 2019 email admitting a “ Crypto regulatory gap ” suggests that, at least internally at one point, there was recognition that the existing framework might not be perfectly suited or comprehensive enough for the unique characteristics of digital assets. This discrepancy between an earlier internal acknowledgment and later public or legal positions could be used to argue that the SEC’s current enforcement-first approach, without clear, tailored rules, is inconsistent with its own past understanding of the landscape’s complexities. It raises questions about whether the agency has genuinely closed that perceived gap or simply changed its public narrative. What About Ethereum Security? NYAG’s Plea and SEC’s Silence Another revelation comes from a 2023 email originating from the New York State Attorney General’s (NYAG) office, directed at the SEC. The email reportedly sought the SEC’s support in the form of an amicus brief in a case against crypto exchange KuCoin. Crucially, the NYAG’s proposed argument for the amicus brief was that Ethereum (ETH) should be considered a security. This finding is layered with significance. Firstly, it shows a state regulator actively seeking the federal SEC’s backing on a major classification issue. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it touches upon the contentious debate around Ethereum security status. The SEC has notably avoided making a definitive public statement on whether ETH is a security, particularly since its transition to Proof-of-Stake. Chairman Gary Gensler has often sidestepped direct questions about ETH while asserting that many other tokens are securities. According to Grewal, the SEC ignored the NYAG’s request to submit an amicus brief arguing that ETH is a security. This silence, in the face of a direct request to weigh in on such a pivotal asset’s classification, could be interpreted in various ways. It might suggest internal disagreement, a strategic decision to avoid setting a precedent, or simply a lack of priority. Regardless of the reason, the revelation highlights the continued ambiguity surrounding ETH’s regulatory status and the SEC’s apparent reluctance to clarify it, even when prompted by another regulatory body involved in crypto enforcement. Technical Hurdles or Evasion? The Wells Notice Video Saga The third finding shared by Grewal touches upon the procedural aspects of the SEC’s interaction with Coinbase. It involves a 2023 SEC email that, according to Grewal, reveals the agency lacked the technical capability to open a video response submitted by Coinbase regarding its Wells notice. A Wells notice is the SEC’s formal notification to a company that it intends to recommend enforcement action, giving the company an opportunity to respond. Coinbase reportedly submitted a detailed video presentation as part of its response to the Wells notice it received before the SEC filed its lawsuit against the exchange. The idea was presumably to provide a comprehensive, perhaps more easily digestible, explanation of their business and legal arguments. However, if the SEC email indeed indicates they couldn’t even open the file due to technical limitations, it raises concerns about the agency’s preparedness and ability to handle evidence and submissions in formats common in the digital age. While seemingly a minor point compared to regulatory classification, it could potentially speak to broader issues of operational efficiency or even suggest a lack of genuine engagement with the defense being presented by the target of an enforcement action. Broader Implications for SEC Crypto Regulation These individual findings, when viewed together, paint a complex picture of the SEC’s approach to the crypto market over the past few years. The 2019 email about a “ Crypto regulatory gap ” contrasts sharply with the agency’s later insistence that no new laws are needed. The handling of the NYAG’s request regarding Ethereum security highlights the persistent lack of clarity on a major asset and the potential disconnect between state and federal regulatory efforts. Furthermore, the technical issue regarding Coinbase’s Wells notice response could be used to question the thoroughness or fairness of the SEC’s process leading up to filing a lawsuit. These revelations, brought to light through the FOIA SEC process, contribute to the narrative that the SEC’s regulatory approach has been inconsistent, unclear, and perhaps not fully equipped to handle the nuances of the digital asset space. For the industry, these findings underscore the challenges posed by regulation through enforcement rather than clear rulemaking. Companies like Coinbase are left navigating a landscape where the rules seem to be applied retroactively or based on interpretations that may have evolved over time, sometimes contradicting earlier internal views. Why Transparency Matters The FOIA process is a critical tool for ensuring government accountability and transparency. Coinbase’s use of FOIA to obtain these documents allows the public and the industry to see internal communications that would otherwise remain hidden. This transparency is vital for understanding the basis of regulatory actions and evaluating whether agencies are acting consistently and fairly. The documents shared by Grewal provide concrete examples that can inform public debate and potentially influence legal strategies. Challenges and Criticisms Revealed The findings reinforce several criticisms often leveled against the SEC regarding crypto: Inconsistency: The “regulatory gap” email from 2019 conflicts with later statements. Lack of Clarity: The avoidance of a clear stance on Ethereum, even when prompted, fuels uncertainty. Operational Readiness: The technical issue points to potential shortcomings in handling digital submissions. Regulation by Enforcement: The need for FOIA requests to understand the agency’s thinking highlights the lack of proactive rulemaking. These challenges create a difficult environment for companies trying to innovate and operate legally within the United States. What’s Next? Actionable Insights For those following the Coinbase SEC saga and the broader regulatory landscape, these findings offer valuable insights: Stay Informed: Continue to follow legal developments and revelations from FOIA requests, as they provide crucial context. Understand the Nuances: Recognize that regulatory approaches can evolve, and past internal views may differ from current public stances. Advocate for Clarity: Support efforts that push for clear, tailored regulations for the crypto space rather than relying solely on applying old laws. Prepare for Scrutiny: Companies in the crypto space should be meticulous in their documentation and communication, anticipating intense regulatory scrutiny. These documents serve as a reminder that the path to regulatory clarity is fraught with challenges and requires persistent effort from both the industry and advocates for transparency. Conclusion Paul Grewal’s sharing of initial FOIA findings offers a compelling glimpse behind the curtain of U.S. regulatory bodies’ past interactions with the crypto industry. The revelations regarding a recognized “crypto regulatory gap” in 2019, the SEC’s silence on the Ethereum security question despite a state regulator’s plea, and the technical issues in handling Coinbase’s Wells notice response all contribute to a picture of an agency navigating complex terrain with apparent inconsistencies and operational hurdles. These findings, brought to light through the vital process of FOIA SEC requests, are not just historical footnotes; they are potentially significant pieces of evidence in the ongoing legal battles and the broader struggle for clear and effective SEC crypto regulation . As Coinbase continues its legal challenges and its pursuit of transparency, the documents unearthed through FOIA will likely continue to play a crucial role in shaping the narrative and the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. To learn more about the latest SEC crypto regulation trends, explore our article on key developments shaping crypto regulation institutional adoption.",Crypto News|COINBASE|Crypto Regulation.|ETHEREUM|FOIA|SEC,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-05-08 10:10:24

Fuelled by growing institutional partnerships and the long-awaited legal clarity from the SEC case, XRP is finally shaking off years of uncertainty. However, while XRP regains its footing, a new altcoin coin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is already trending. With a scheduled launch cemented at listing price $0.06, Phase 4 investors of the Mutuum Finance presale are poised to reap 140% returns when the token hits the open market. The venture so far has raised in excess of $7.8 million and boasts over 9600 holders. As the next altcoin rally looms, all signs suggest that while XRP may rise, MUTM could completely dominate. Implosive Presale: Over $7.6M Raised from 9,400+ Early Adopters Mutuum Finance presale is not easing off. Now in Phase 4, the $0.025 token is on the verge of a price hike. When the presale enters Phase 5, the value will rise to $0.03, treating current investors to an instant 20% gain. With a projected launch price of $0.06, the profit potential grows by the day. Crypto analysts have already designated MUTM as one of the most undervalued DeFi tokens of the year. With more than $7.8 million funded and 9,600+ users, it’s no longer a secret anymore. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance’s foundation is its lending architecture. Unlike most DeFi platforms, it offers both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending: Users get passive returns by offering stablecoins like USDT to pools of smart contracts. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending: Investors borrow or lend from each other directly, customizing terms without middlemen. The hybrid model not only amplifies flexibility and potential yield, but also drives liquidity and user scalability, positioning it as a genuine disruptor within the DeFi ecosystem.

Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is finally nearing its end. This brings XRP’s rollercoaster history back into the spotlight. Back in January 2018, XRP hit its all-time high of $3.40 . However, it quickly fell below $1 in just six months, and then dropped under $0.50 cents. XRP then saw another spike in April 2021, briefly touching $1.50 before settling again. Fast forward to November 2024, XRP crossed the $2 mark for the first time in years, and has since stayed steadily above $1.90. Now, the token is bumping up against resistance around that old $3.40 all-time high. If the market stays bullish, XRP could soon try to break through that level. XRP to $1 Million? AltcoinBuzz Runs the Numbers AltcoinBuzz has shared a fascinating question ‘How Many XRP Do You Need to Be a Millionaire?’ According to their math, if XRP manages to reach its old $3.40 peak, an XRP holder would need 294,178 XRPs to hit $1 million.

This time around, the cryptocurrency is forming a rather interesting pattern that suggests a continuation of the bullish rally that began back in April. While this pattern is yet to be complete, a total formation would be extremely bullish for the altcoin’s price. XRP Price Breaks Out Of Yo-Yo Movement So far, the XRP price has been bouncing at support just above $2, something that crypto analyst MetaShackle on the TradingView website likened to a ‘yo-yo’ movement. In place of this has been a rising bullish pattern, which is known as a Reverse Dragon Pattern. Related Reading: 72% Of Binance Traders Go Long On Dogecoin, What Does This Mean For Price? This Reverse Dragon Pattern has been forming on the daily chart, and history shows that this means the XRP price has the potential to rise faster from here. So far, the analyst explains that the Dragon head is already forming on the daily chart. This is forming above the upper trend line shown in the chart below. The next phase of this, if completed, would be a strong upward move as bulls regain control. Additionally, MetaShackle predicts “a liquidation candle in the general area of the Weak Dojo/Reverse Waterfall line.” The upward movement is expected to continue, and as this trend plays out over the next few weeks, the XRP price is expected to rise above $3 this month. Analyst Shows Where Price Could Be Headed Next While MetaShackle sees the XRP price going up with the formation of the Reverse Dragon Pattern, another crypto analyst has given possible scenarios that could play out from here besides the bullish one. This goes into whether the bulls win, the bears take over, or the current tug-of-war for control continues. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Bullish Path To $5 As Long As This Level Holds The first scenario, is if the price breaks the resistance at $2.3612. In this case, the crypto analyst does expect the price to continue to go up. This uptrend is expected to see it break multiple major levels before finally finding resistance at $2.9 again. Another scenario is when the bulls break below support at $2.03445, which is yet to happen. This could trigger further crashes for the XRP price, and the downtrend could push it toward $1.6, where there is support at $1.63339. Last but not least is if the bulls and bears continue to vie for control with no clear winner. In this case, the crypto analyst believes the sideways movement would continue. “At this moment, there is hidden divergence appearing on XRPUSD as if it will strengthen the bearish mood,” the analyst explains. “If the price breaks the resistance level, the hidden divergence will be cancelled.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",XRP|Ripple|ripple news|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|DOGE|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-05-08 11:30:49

And investors will have the US’s aggressive monetary policy to thank for the upcoming surge. During an interview with the Crypto Banter channel on YouTube, Arthur Hayes suggested that the Federal Reserve going on a money printing spree to manage deteriorating macroeconomic conditions is why Bitcoin is headed higher. Hayes also indicated that inflation is likely to continue, which pundits have argued is a boon for assets like BTC. “I think that the setup is just perfect for a rally in risk assets, just like we saw from the third quarter of 2022 until early 2025,” the former BitMEX CEO posited. “There’s a similar setup today. We have a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the markets, and the monetary authorities, especially in America, cannot handle that, so they’re going to resort to money printing.” Bitcoin adherents often laud the apex crypto as a hedge against irresponsible central bank monetary policy of printing money. BTC has historically done well when the Fed has slashed interest rates and flooded the market with cheap cash. Hayes noted that Former US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen printed a staggering $2.5 trillion from 2022 to 2025, with BTC going up 6x. He expects current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is quietly transforming global liquidity with buybacks and auction strategies to address the ballooning national debt load, to do something similar. “And so that’s why April 9th was the bottom, and we’re going to go much higher from here,” the crypto billionaire asserted. Hayes has previously forecasted a $1 million BTC price by 2028 amid growing ETF flows and investor confidence. Bitcoin Price Nears $100,000 Price Tag Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin soared past $99,000 today as President Donald Trump teased an international trade agreement with a “big, highly respected country.” While the identity of the country involved remains unclear, some reports suggest it’s the UK. BTC is now within striking distance of its current lifetime peak set on January 20, and is now eyeing the coveted $100,000 milestone. The apex crypto is up 2.9% on the day after retreating from a daily high above $99,868, according to CoinGecko data .

The rankings range from the highest tier of “Big Whale,” defined as someone holding over 100,000 XRP, to the lowest rank of “Worm,” for those with as little as 1 XRP. The tweet humorously ends with the question, “Are you a worm??” suggesting a challenge or reflection for readers to assess their holdings relative to the scale. The ranking categories are as follows: a “Big Whale” holds more than 100,000 XRP, a “Whale” has more than 50,000, a “Shark” owns over 10,000, a “Dolphin” holds over 5,000, a “Fish” possesses more than 1,000, an “Octopus” keeps over 500, a “Crab” has over 200, a “Shrimp” holds over 100, and a “Worm” owns just 1 XRP or more. The #XRP Ranking Ladder 2025: Big Whale = +100,000 XRP Whale = +50,000 XRP Shark = +10,000 XRP Dolphin = +5,000 XRP Fish = +1,000 XRP Octopus = +500 XRP Crab = +200 XRP Shrimp = +100 XRP Worm = + 1 XRP Are you a worm?? — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 5, 2025 Community Reactions Reflect Perspectives on Value and Mission Two responses from other X users highlight contrasting sentiments within the XRP community. A user identified as ovokiss commented , “I have 12,600 token of XRP and still think it’s not enough lol.” At the current market rate of $2.11 per XRP, this holding equates to approximately $26,586, placing the user in the “Shark” category according to the ladder. Despite occupying an upper-middle tier, ovokiss’s comment indicates a desire to increase their position, suggesting continued confidence in XRP’s potential. Another response came from Praetorian Nova, who took a more philosophical stance, writing , “The true strength of the $XRP $ARMY isn’t measured by ranks but by our unwavering belief in the mission. Whether a whale or a worm, our collective power drives the revolution forward!” This response shifts the focus away from the numerical classification and toward a collective sense of purpose among XRP holders, underscoring community cohesion rather than individual asset size. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Token Valuations According to Current Price Using the latest data from CoinMarketCap, which lists XRP at $2.11 per token, the value thresholds for each category can be estimated. For a “Big Whale” with 100,000 XRP, the USD equivalent would be $211,000. A “Whale” with 50,000 XRP would hold approximately $105,500, while a “Shark” at 10,000 XRP would control around $21,100. A “Dolphin” with 5,000 XRP holds $10,550, and a “Fish” with 1,000 XRP has about $2,110. Those in the lower tiers, such as an “Octopus” (500 XRP), “Crab” (200 XRP), “Shrimp” (100 XRP), and “Worm” (1 XRP), would correspond to holdings of $1,055, $422, $211, and $2.11 respectively. A Snapshot of Sentiment in a Bull Market The tweet by JackTheRippler offers more than just a humorous classification; it presents a moment-in-time reflection of the XRP community’s mindset during a period of price growth. With XRP priced at over $2.00 in early May 2025, the conversation around who holds what—and how much—indicates both individual aspirations and a broader collective narrative. While some embrace the ladder as a fun way to engage with the market, others emphasize solidarity and belief in the project’s long-term goals, irrespective of wallet size.

China is one of the countries hardest hit by the US-imposed tariffs, which have escalated the geopolitical tensions between the two economic superpowers, with effects spilling across the globe. Cracks start showing in China’s factory sector A Reuters poll of 32 economists found that outbound shipments climbed just 1.9% year on year in April, a sharp deceleration from March’s 12.4% surge, which had been driven by firms racing to beat incoming duties. At the same time, imports are projected to have fallen 5.9%, deepening March’s 4.3% decline and underscoring the drag on China’s $18.7 trillion economy. Beijing, which only late last year began shifting policy toward boosting domestic demand, has relied heavily on exports to prop up growth since the pandemic’s end. But with US President Donald Trump raising levies on Chinese goods to an effective 145% and China retaliating with duties of up to 125% on American imports, that strategy is under threat. As officials from both capitals prepare to meet in Switzerland this weekend, markets hope for a de-escalation, but the immediate picture remains grim. Meanwhile, China’s factory sector is already showing cracks. Official data released at the end of April revealed the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) plunged to 49.0, its lowest reading in 16 months and firmly in contraction territory. The non-manufacturing PMI, covering services and construction, also eased, though it stayed marginally above the 50 threshold separating growth from decline. Trade wars weaken China Zhao Qinghe , a statistician at the National Bureau of Statistics, attributed the downturn to “sharp changes in China’s external environment”. His comments echo a growing consensus that the sudden reversal from front-loaded exports in March to a pronounced slowdown in April is directly linked to the trade war’s chilling effect on business sentiment. “The weak manufacturing PMI in April is driven by the trade war.” Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, in a note to clients. Goldman Sachs has even cautioned that up to 16 million jobs in export-related industries could be at risk if high tariffs persist. Nomura analysts calculate that the US accounted for just over one-fifth of China’s goods exports in 2024, when re-exports via Hong Kong and alternative routing are factored in, and estimate that about 2.2% of China’s GDP is directly exposed to US duties. They project China could forfeit roughly 1.1% of GDP in the near term if exports to the US were halved. In response, Beijing this week rolled out a fresh round of monetary stimulus, including liquidity injections and policy rate cuts, aimed at cushioning the blow from the tariff shock. Yet analysts caution that stimulus alone may not fully offset the drag from weakening external demand and a protracted property downturn, which has already sapped domestic consumption. China’s trade surplus is also set to narrow sharply, from $102.6 billion in March to an estimated $89 billion in April, as the mismatch between faltering exports and still declining imports persists. With the Politburo pledging support for the most affected firms and workers and the vice chair of the National Development and Reform Commission expressing confidence in meeting the 5% growth target for 2025, policymakers face a delicate balancing act between fiscal support, financial stability and long term economic rebalanced. In the near term, all eyes will be on the Switzerland talks. A constructive outcome could ease uncertainty and reopen export markets, while a breakdown would likely intensify the downturn. For now, however, April’s data serve as an early warning that China’s export-led revival has lost momentum, and that the world’s second-largest economy may need more than tariffs and stimulus to chart a sustainable path forward.

The proposal, if successful, will make it so Sei users will only be able to send and receive transactions that are compatible with Ethereum. Cutting Cosmos support will significantly simplify the blockchain, reduce infrastructure overhead, and position Sei more strongly within the broader Ethereum ecosystem, Philip Su, Sei Labs’ Engineering Lead, said in the proposal. “This transition will lead to greater adoption, improved developer experience, and a more cohesive community,” he said. The move comes as blockchain infrastructure builders compete to draw in developers and expand their orbits. Ethereum-based infrastructure, which runs on software called the Ethereum Virtual Machine, or EVM, is what the majority of decentralized finance apps run on. Ethereum, as well as other big blockchains like Coinbase’s Base and the Binance-affiliated BNB Chain, all use the EVM. But there are challengers. Solana uses its own software called the Solana Virtual Machine, or SVM, while Cosmos has pioneered software called CosmWasm. Sei currently supports both EVM and CosmWasm. “While this dual architecture has provided flexibility, it also introduces significant complexity and friction for both users and developers,” Su said. If Sei pivots away from CosmWasm it could be a significant blow for the software’s adoption. The Sei Network has grown steadily since its 2023 launch. Deposits to DeFi apps on the network are at an all-time high of $1 billion, according to DefiLlama data , making it the 15th largest blockchain by total value locked. Cosmos Hub, the leading development platform for Cosmos, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Unnecessary overhead When Sei launched it didn’t support the EVM and adoption was slow. Over the blockchain’s first year it only attracted some $50 million of deposits to its DeFi apps, a paltry sum compared to other blockchains that launched around the same time, such as Sui, which soared above $600 million in deposits during its first year. But that changed in July 2024 when Sei launched its second version, which let users create DeFi apps using either CosmWasm or the EVM. Activity exploded as developers and investors flocked to the blockchain. Among DeFi developers, the EVM is the most well-known software. So by introducing EVM support, Sei was able to tap into a much larger pool of developers. New Sei users are now predominantly choosing to use the EVM instead of CosmWasm, data compiled by Sei Labs on data platform Dune Analytics shows. What’s more, the current cross-compatibility comes at a cost, Su said. It introduces “unnecessary overhead in the codebase and complicates debugging and testing,” he said. Still, there’s no guarantee others in the Sei community will feel the same way. Build with Sei, a group managed by the nonprofit Sei Foundation, will host a call on May 14 to discuss the proposal in detail and give opportunities for developers and the community to ask questions and give feedback.

At a time when mining has become inaccessible to everyday users, Bitcoin Solaris is flipping the script and bringing mining back to the people, literally in their pockets. This mobile-first approach isn’t just innovative—it’s changing the entire landscape of crypto entry points. And with the market craving efficiency, accessibility, and energy-conscious technology, Bitcoin Solaris might just be the top crypto project of 2025. Other Mining Projects Exist—but Not Like This Yes, there are several crypto projects trying to make mining more approachable. Some offer cloud mining. Others build plug-and-play mining boxes. A few like Pi Network or Electroneum teased mobile mining concepts years ago, but failed to deliver on scale or sustainability. Most of these options fall short either due to a lack of speed, unclear rewards, complex setups, or limited ecosystems. They paved the way, but the gap between centralized control and decentralized empowerment remained wide. Enter Bitcoin Solaris, which not only bridges this gap but leads a whole new movement. Bitcoin Solaris: Built for Speed, Scale, and Simplicity Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is a next-generation blockchain that combines the security of Bitcoin with the speed of Solana, running on a dual-consensus model: Proof-of-Work for its core security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake for lightning-fast performance. This design allows the network to process 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality, while using 99.95% less energy than traditional mining. But what’s really making headlines? The game-changing Solaris Nova App lets anyone mine directly from their smartphone. Cross-Platform Support: iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux, and even web. Battery-Efficient: Optimized algorithms ensure mobile mining won’t overheat your phone. One-Click Mining: Start mining with zero technical knowledge. Built-in Wallet and In-App Tutorials make it perfect for beginners. The app is now in private beta, and community members are being invited to try it before full launch—another major milestone for the project. Audited, Trusted, and Verified Security? Bitcoin Solaris is audited by two independent firms—you can view the full Cyberscope audit or the Freshcoins audit directly. Plus, some contributors have even completed voluntary KYC verification , adding more trust and transparency to the project. Early Adopters Win Big—Join the BTC-S Revolution Smart contracts? Fully audited. Validator system? Strict. Bug bounty? Already running. This isn’t just secure—it’s industry-leading. Staking, Governance, and Utility Users can stake their BTC-S using a liquid staking system that gives them sBTC-S in return—a fully usable token that lets them: Earn staking rewards without locking funds Participate in DeFi applications like lending and liquidity pools Vote on governance proposals Stay liquid and flexible at all times And with auto-distributed staking across multiple validators, decentralization is baked right into the process. Presale: A Rare, Time-Limited Opportunity Phase 2 of the presale is live now at $2, with the next phase jumping to $3, and a launch price of $20. Investors also enjoy a 14% round bonus, making the potential gain up to 1,900% if they get in early. More impressively, Bitcoin Solaris runs one of the shortest presales on the market—just 90 days total, ending July 31, 2025. After that, it goes live. No endless waiting, no extended deadlines. With Phase 1 already completed with massive support, and the Nova App beta in full swing, the buzz around the project is growing fast. Crypto analysts and enthusiasts are watching closely—some even calling it the next big thing. Check out this review from Crypto Dex World , where he breaks down exactly why this project stands out.

The latest spike comes as BTC hovers just below the $100,000 mark, buoyed by investor optimism and macroeconomic tailwinds, including improving geopolitical sentiment and a stable interest rate environment. A Strengthening Conviction in Bitcoin’s Future In an article posted on X and the CryptoQuant website, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, Gold Crypto, argued that the new all-time high in BTC’s Realized Cap signals a fundamental shift in market dynamics that could mark the early stages of a new bull cycle. The metric has become a barometer for long-term stakeholder sentiment and is calculated by summing the value of each bitcoin based on the price at which it last moved. It reflects the total dollar value of the BTC currently held by investors based on the cost basis of their assets rather than the current market price. Realized Cap often serves as a barometer of investor commitment, since, unlike market capitalization, which can be skewed by speculative trading, it captures the actual capital flowing into BTC. With the metric now sitting at more than $890 billion, the market watcher pointed out that Bitcoin is seeing a “steady stream of buying,” a trend he says conveys “renewed interest from investors.” The analyst believes this isn’t mere speculation but a sustained accumulation that speaks of growing confidence in the future of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency as a financial instrument and store of value. “This new record in the Realized Cap not only indicates an increase in invested capital but also a growing conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a financial asset,” he wrote. “With sustained accumulation from both LTH and STH, the market seems to be building a solid foundation for a significant next move.” From Correction to Rally The on-chain strength is also slowly manifesting in Bitcoin’s price action. Data from CoinGecko shows that the asset went up 2.7% in the last 24 hours and was trading at $99,700, only a hair’s breadth away from the psychologically important $100,000 level, and just 8.4% below its all-time high of over $109,000. It climbed 4.9% in the past week, outperforming the broader crypto market, which saw a more modest 2.7% uptick in that period. Furthermore, over 30 days, BTC has grown by more than 25% after navigating a brief correction earlier in the month that saw its price dip to $93,500.

European equities, by contrast, witnessed a $3.4 billion inflow in the week leading up to April 30th, and Japanese stocks saw a $4.4 billion inflow. BofA also notes that for every $100 worth of inflow into the US stock market since the presidential election last November, there was $5 worth of outflow in the past three weeks. The crypto sector witnessed inflows of $2.3 billion in the past week, and high-yield bonds saw inflows of $3.9 billion, suggesting investor appetite for risk, according to BofA. Gold and Treasuries, by contrast, saw a combined $6 billion worth of outflows. The bank notes that its clients are now more worried about deflation than inflation and have been adjusting their portfolios accordingly, acquiring shares of utilities and low-volatility, high-dividend exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Last month, Bank of America’s team of market strategists warned that the US stock market’s recovery could be short-lived, advising clients to “sell into rallies in US stocks and the dollar.” The bank strategists said debasement of the US dollar is the “cleanest investment theme to play.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to a Bloomberg source, the G7 meetings will most likely focus on armed conflicts across the globe, but will also focus on North Korea’s hacking exploits. Lazarus Group, in particular, has increased its attacks and has pulled off massive crypto hacks. The global community will no longer be able to ignore the threat and may have to make a response. North Korea’s hacking activities concern G7 countries because the stolen crypto is being used to fund nefarious activities. Mark Carney, Canadian Prime Minister, will host this year’s event at Kananaskis, Alberta, between June 15 and 17. The G7 is an organisation that brings together seven of the world’s most advanced economies, including Germany, Japan, Italy, France, the UK, the US, and Canada. North Korea-affiliated hackers hacked the Bybit exchange for $1.5 billion in crypto just this year alone. They were also responsible for hacking $1.34 billion in digital asset projects in 2024, distributed over 47 different attacks. The G7 would find it difficult to ignore such large-scale attacks that benefit one country, particularly one that is stockpiling nuclear weapons. The G7 has focused on North Korea before, with concern over its nuclear weapons, and will most likely address the growing threat of nuclear proliferation again, with a new focus on crypto hacks. The attacks are also increasing because 2023 only saw $661 million over 20 incidents, a much smaller than 2024 and 2025. North Korea has been very prosperous with its funding efforts, not only with its alleged hacking activities, but also with its employment schemes, such as with workers infiltrating Western crypto businesses and sending the proceeds back to North Korea. Just recently, Kraken caught a North Korean operative trying to infiltrate their exchange with false identity details and a computer setup to disguise his location. Lazarus Group, the main hacking collective associated with North Korea’s activities, has increased its sophistication, from simple exploits to large-scale social engineering campaigns. One of the latest campaigns that the G7 will be interested in is the large-scale infiltration of labour markets, such as with startups in the US, China, and Russia. North Korean IT workers can use legitimate means of employment to make an income and then fund military activities back in North Korea. The G7 will most likely focus on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The added caveat this year includes North Korea providing military support to Russia. North Korea’s hacking activities, therefore, could be used to extend wars that the G7 disagree with and could find a further use of crypto to bypass sanctions and render the G7’s efforts ineffective. North Korea’s hacking exploits could have been easy to ignore in the past. Still, with crypto losses reaching the billions, the G7 may find it difficult to ignore the security breaches anymore.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|North Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-08 11:53:02

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-claims-xrps-price-is-still-heavily-undervalued-heres-why/,"In the evolving landscape of digital finance, XRP’s potential remains a subject of intense discussion among experts. Jake Claver, a prominent digital asset strategist, has recently emphasized that XRP is significantly undervalued , especially considering its prospective role in global financial systems. Claver’s insightful analysis sheds light on how the convergence of derivatives trading, institutional adoption, and global transaction flows could reshape XRP’s valuation. Unpacking XRP’s Undervaluation According to Claver, XRP’s current price does not accurately reflect its potential, especially in light of emerging use cases within international finance. One of the most compelling arguments he presents is the impact of derivatives trading on XRP’s valuation. In recent months, the volume of XRP derivatives trading has seen a marked increase, reflecting growing interest from institutional investors and market participants. This surge is indicative of an evolving market sentiment, where large-scale players are positioning themselves to benefit from future price movements. XRP’s price is still heavily undervalued if derivatives trading takes off. Even in a conservative case…just capturing 10% of SWIFT's daily flow…that can drive a large price spike in the asset. And with over $6.5 trillion moving through foreign exchange markets daily, there’s… — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) May 7, 2025 XRP’s undervaluation becomes even more apparent when considering its potential involvement in global financial transactions. Claver posits that if XRP were to capture just 10% of SWIFT’s daily transaction volume, the implications for its market value would be profound. SWIFT, the global messaging system for financial transactions, processes over $6.5 trillion daily. If XRP were to facilitate even a fraction of these transactions, its price could soar exponentially, potentially reaching between $50 and $100 per coin. Given that SWIFT’s infrastructure is deeply embedded in international banking, the adoption of XRP for cross-border payments would mark a paradigm shift in global finance. The Role of Derivatives in XRP’s Market Dynamics Derivatives markets have become a focal point for understanding XRP’s price dynamics. Recently, XRP’s derivatives trading volume surged by 63%, suggesting a rising wave of speculative and hedging activities among professional traders. Such an increase not only signals heightened interest but also suggests that market participants are preparing for substantial price movements. Historically, significant upticks in derivatives activity have been precursors to increased volatility, and XRP’s market dynamics seem poised to follow this trend. Furthermore, the CME Group’s announcement of launching XRP futures contracts on May 19, 2025, represents a significant milestone. As one of the largest derivatives marketplaces globally, CME’s inclusion of XRP is a strong endorsement of its legitimacy and prospects. Institutional investors, who typically favor regulated and structured trading environments, will have more opportunities to gain exposure to XRP, whether for speculative purposes or as a hedge against other digital assets. This institutional inflow could further strengthen the asset’s price foundation. Broader Implications for Global Finance XRP’s use case in cross-border transactions remains at the heart of its value proposition. The asset’s efficiency in transferring value swiftly and cost-effectively makes it an attractive alternative to traditional systems like SWIFT. Claver’s perspective aligns with the broader narrative that XRP is not merely a speculative token but a financial instrument with the potential to facilitate global liquidity. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Considering the current market position, XRP is trading at approximately $2.21 as of report time. While this reflects moderate gains compared to previous months, it remains significantly undervalued when juxtaposed with the transformative potential Claver envisions. If derivatives trading continues to gain traction and XRP secures a foothold in international financial transactions, the current market price may appear extraordinarily low in hindsight. Market Sentiment and Investor Perspective Market sentiment around XRP remains divided, with some investors cautious about potential regulatory hurdles. However, Claver’s analysis underscores the importance of focusing on long-term fundamentals rather than short-term market fluctuations. He argues that the strategic integration of XRP into the existing financial framework could prove to be a game-changer, paving the way for unprecedented value appreciation. The crypto community has responded with a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism. While some critics argue that XRP’s reliance on institutional adoption makes it vulnerable to regulatory crackdowns, proponents highlight that Ripple’s ongoing legal battles are gradually leaning in favor of broader adoption. Moreover, the resolution of Ripple’s legal issues with the SEC could catalyze renewed confidence in XRP, setting the stage for substantial price appreciation. Jake Claver’s perspective offers a nuanced understanding of XRP’s potential. As the derivatives market expands and institutional involvement grows, the likelihood of XRP realizing its full value proposition becomes increasingly plausible. While uncertainties remain, the asset’s utility as a bridge currency and its potential to capture a portion of SWIFT’s vast daily flow could fundamentally alter its market trajectory. Investors keen on the long-term prospects of XRP may find Claver’s analysis both insightful and strategically sound, reinforcing the notion that the asset is currently undervalued concerning its prospective role in global finance.

Recall that the last time it traded above that coveted milestone was just over three months ago. With optimism regarding big trade deals between the US and another country (perhaps the UK, even though some speculate it could be China), BTC’s price jumped from under $94,000 yesterday to the current $99,500. If it pulls another impressive leg up, Sentora’s data shows that the potential resistance “may be limited” due to the relatively low amount of BTC purchased at that level. More precisely, just 3% of the total supply was accumulated at these prices, which suggests that “sell-side pressure could be relatively contained.” However, Ali Martinez brought another chart showing that 81,910 BTC (bought for well over $9 billion) was acquired at an average price of $101,673, which has now turned into a major resistance if the $100,000 line falls. In contrast, BTC has formed a “strong support” at $94,719, where 195,320 BTC was acquired, with a USD value of $18.5 billion. #Bitcoin has established a strong support floor at $94,719, where 195,320 $BTC were accumulated.

Built by MakeInfinite Labs, Space and Time offers a decentralized, verifiable database for smart contracts to query historical, crosschain and offchain data, according to a news release shared with Cointelegraph. The platform indexes data from major networks like Ethereum and makes it accessible through a decentralized network of validators. Developers can query this data using Space and Time’s Proof of SQL — a sub-second ZK coprocessor that delivers cryptographic proofs with every query. “Prior to Space and Time, onchain applications had no way to query basic user data from a database of blockchain activity without introducing security risks and tampering,” said Scott Dykstra, co-founder at Space and Time. He added that developers can now build onchain apps with built-in security, using cryptographic proofs to connect cloud databases to smart contracts. Source: Space and Time Related: How does zero-knowledge proof authentication help create a portable digital identity solution? Major builders already on Space and Time Dykstra said prominent financial institutions, major cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and Google BigQuery, and some of the biggest projects in crypto, including Chainlink, Sui and ZKsync, have either integrated or are building with tools or data services in the Space and Time ecosystem. He also told Cointelegraph that SXT, the native utility token for Space and Time, is planned for release on May 8. “Space and Time mainnet is permissionless, and we encourage the community to join the network as validators and delegated stakers,” Dykstra said. He added that the testnet had more than 30 validators worldwide, including in the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America.

The fund is scheduled to begin trading on May 14, 2025, following its inception on May 13, 2025. As the global economy shifts to a digital core, NODE offers active equity investment in real-world companies shaping that future. This ETF is actively managed , meaning a portfolio manager and not just an algorithm, selects the included stocks. The ETF may allocate up to 25% of its assets to crypto-linked exchange-traded products (ETPs) via a Cayman Islands subsidiary, providing indirect exposure to digital assets while adhering to US tax regulations . With a management fee of 0.69%, $NODE offers a diversified approach to participating in the evolving digital asset economy without direct cryptocurrency investments. How VanEck’s $NODE ETF builds its portfolio VanEck’s $NODE ETF is designed to expose investors to companies at the forefront of blockchain and digital asset innovation. The ETF plans to hold between 30 and 60 stocks selected from over 130 publicly traded enterprises integral to the digital asset ecosystem. These stocks may span across the following sectors: Data centers: Infrastructure hubs that deliver the computational power necessary for blockchain networks . Cryptocurrency exchanges: These platforms, like Coinbase, facilitate the trading and exchange of digital assets . Miners: Organizations that verify Bitcoin ( BTC ) transactions. Crypto-holding companies: Publicly listed businesses that include Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury. Traditional financial institutions: Established banks and financial service providers incorporating blockchain solutions into their offerings. Consumer and gaming enterprises: Enterprises adopting blockchain technology in consumer applications and gaming platforms. Asset managers: Professionals and firms developing and overseeing investment vehicles tied to digital asset markets. Energy infrastructure providers: Businesses offering energy solutions tailored to support blockchain and crypto mining operations. Semiconductor and hardware firms: Companies such as Nvidia that design and manufacture chips and specialized mining equipment. To further diversify its portfolio, $NODE may allocate up to 25% of its assets to cryptocurrency ETPs, providing indirect exposure to digital assets. This allocation is managed through a Cayman Islands subsidiary, allowing the ETF to navigate US tax regulations effectively. VanEck employs a rigorous selection process for its holdings, combining fundamental analysis , market trend assessment, strategic positioning and valuation metrics to identify companies leading the digital transformation. According to a Jan. 15 filing with US regulators regarding the proposed ETF, at least 80% of its investments could be allocated to ""digital transformation companies"" and digital asset instruments. Did you know? Crypto ETFs let you invest in digital assets like Bitcoin or blockchain stocks without setting up a crypto wallet . They are traded on traditional exchanges and offer regulated exposure to crypto markets, making them accessible to mainstream investors and institutions. How VanEck’s $NODE ETF uses blockchain and Bitcoin cycle metrics to optimize investment VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE) offers a unique approach to blockchain investment. It focuses on companies leveraging blockchain for real-world applications , rather than tracking the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether ( ETH ). Each company in the $NODE portfolio has either blockchain central to its business model or future strategy. VanEck evaluates firms based on their tangible progress and innovation. Companies in the ETF’s portfolio may include sectors like fintech, supply chain , gaming and digital identity . To manage market volatility , VanEck utilizes Bitcoin cycle indicators — metrics based on historical BTC price patterns — to adjust the ETF’s risk exposure dynamically. This approach helps optimize performance by aligning the portfolio with broader market sentiment and crypto-economic cycles. By investing in $NODE, investors gain exposure to the expanding influence of blockchain beyond speculative assets. This helps investors capture the long-term growth potential of real-world blockchain integration across industries. The ETF reflects a forward-looking strategy reflecting how blockchain transforms the global economy. Did you know? Canada launched the world’s first spot Bitcoin ETF – Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC) – in February 2021. It beat the US to market and sparked a wave of regulated crypto investment products globally. Difference between $NODE and general equity ETFs VanEck’s $NODE ETF stands apart from general equity ETFs in strategy and focus. Unlike broad-market funds that track indexes like the S&P 500 or FTSE 100, $NODE invests exclusively in companies adopting and building blockchain technology. While general equity ETFs typically use passive strategies, $NODE is actively managed. VanEck’s fund managers handpick portfolio companies based on their real-world contributions to the blockchain economy. A management fee supports this hands-on approach, allowing the ETF to stay aligned with the fast-changing blockchain landscape. $NODE does not hold Bitcoin or Ether. Instead, it uses Bitcoin cycle signals — like regular “halving” events that cut new supply and long-term price trends — to decide when to take more or less risk in its investments. This helps VanEck adjust the fund as the crypto market changes, which can affect how much money flows into blockchain projects, how many people start using them and overall market sentiment. By focusing on blockchain’s real-world business use rather than cryptocurrency speculation, $NODE offers investors a way to participate in the digital transformation of industries worldwide. It’s a future-facing alternative to general equity ETF models. The following table illustrates the difference between $NODE and general equity ETFs: How to buy $NODE To buy VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE), investors need a brokerage account that provides them access to the Cboe BZX Exchange, where the ETF is listed. Once you have set up and funded the account, search for the ticker symbol “NODE.” Review the ETF’s details, including its management fee and investment strategy, before placing a buy order . $NODE trades during regular market hours like any standard stock or ETF. As with any investment, you should understand the fund’s objectives, holdings and risks beforehand to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Did you know? In January 2024, the US SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs , including those from BlackRock and Fidelity. This marked a significant regulatory milestone and fueled billions in inflows within weeks. $NODE: Institutional interest and key risks amid regulatory shifts VanEck’s launch of the $NODE ETF comes amid rising institutional interest in crypto-linked investments and a more supportive regulatory backdrop. Still, the fund carries unique risks tied to the volatile crypto ecosystem. The launch aligns with positive regulatory developments, such as the proposed US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and potential stablecoin legislation , signaling stronger institutional engagement. $NODE aims to capture surging demand for crypto-equity exposure. A March 2025 survey showed that 68% of financial advisers now seek such options for their clients. Macro trends are also favorable: Bitcoin’s market dominance rose to 62.2% in Q1 2025, driven by institutional preference for regulated vehicles. Public companies collectively added 100,000 BTC to their treasuries, underscoring corporate confidence in Bitcoin. VanEck’s bullish outlook targets – $180,000 BTC and $520 Solana ( SOL ) by year-end — further reflect sector momentum. However, $NODE is not immune to crypto-sector risks. While it doesn’t hold cryptocurrencies directly, its portfolio is still exposed to market volatility, Bitcoin price swings and potential tech stock corrections. Regulatory setbacks may also affect the broader blockchain industry. Additionally, its derivatives strategy, managed through a Cayman subsidiary, introduces counterparty and liquidity risks. Investors should weigh these factors carefully, balancing the fund’s compliance-driven structure and VanEck’s asset management reputation against these sector-specific vulnerabilities.",VanEck,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-08 12:00:00

But despite their strength, analysts are increasingly pointing to MAGACOIN FINANCE — a low-cap, early-stage contender — as a potential outperformer in 2025. With smart money rotating into high-upside plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now being compared to Ethereum in 2017 and Solana in early 2020 — before their exponential runs. Ethereum: Rock Solid, but Slower to Move Ethereum continues to dominate DeFi and smart contract development. Trading around $1,826 , it holds critical support and could climb to $2,270 in the coming months, according to technical forecasts. ETH remains a “blue-chip” asset for institutions and long-term investors alike. But while Ethereum offers security and proven fundamentals, its large market cap means the days of 50x or 100x growth are likely behind it . For many investors, ETH is now a portfolio anchor — not a moonshot. Solana: High-Performance, But High Expectations Solana is trading near $146.87 , recovering from congestion issues that tested the network in April. With improved scalability and speculation around a Solana ETF, bullish sentiment is returning. A breakout above $155 could open the door to $180–$212 , say analysts. Still, Solana is already a top-10 asset with billions in market cap. While short-term upside exists, many traders are looking for earlier-stage exposure — especially as the market enters its next altcoin rotation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Still Under $0.001 — But Not for Long LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Here’s where things change. MAGACOIN FINANCE is in Stage 7 of its presale, still trading under $0.001 , and already gaining serious momentum across Crypto Twitter, Telegram groups, and presale trackers. With a target listing price of $0.007 , base ROI sits at 25x–36x , and the MAGA50X promo code boosts token allocations by 50% for a limited time. More importantly, this project is at the phase where early conviction pays off most . It’s not just about what’s already happened — it’s about what’s next. Each stage increase narrows the window, and centralized exchange listings will reset the playing field. Coins launched from similar structures have delivered high returns in past cycles. MAGACOIN FINANCE is showing every early signal of being next in line.

At this point, Solana has climbed above the $150 level, while cryptocurrency analysis firm Santiment said that Solana and some SOL-based altcoins are in the focus of crypto developers. Explaining the Solana-based altcoin that developers have focused on most in the last 30 days, Santiment stated that SOL is the first in line. Pyth Network (PYTH) came in second place on the list, while Helium (IOT) came in third. “1-Solana – SOL 2-) Pyth Network – PYTH 3-) Helium – IOT 4) Helium Mobile – MOBILE 5) Wormhole – W 6) Drift protocol – DRIFT 7) Neon EVM -NEON 8) Jito – JTO 9) Swarms – SWARMS 10) Orca – ORCA” As expected, SOL, the main coin of the Solana ecosystem, is at the top of the list with a developer score of 165.5. SOL was also at the top of the list in the previous month. The Solana ecosystem has become popular with new tokens and new token hunters, especially because the minting and transaction fees are quite low. *This is not investment advice.

It’s just released v2.0 of its whitepaper, which expands on the vision of its Proof of SQL protocol and, more importantly, its mainnet is now live. Its team is ebullient, confidently predicting that its sub-second ZK coprocessor is about to make smart contracts great. New Network, Whodis? The Space and Time brand is already well known within web3, since its team has been working away on its Proof of SQL solution for over two years now. While the mainnet launch is a milestone event, it effectively formalizes the work Space and Time has been doing up until now. What the mainnet does is provide a decentralized layer on which all of SxT’s tech can sit, giving devs access to cryptographic proofs for data that scales.There’s a lot going on under the hood with SxT’s network, so much so that even lead contributor Scott Dykstra’s tl;dr on the topic runs to several hundred words. The tl;dr of his tl;dr, though, goes something like this: SxT’s network delivers data at lightning-fast speed to smart contracts – complete with proof that the data hasn’t been tampered with en route. Smart contracts then execute decisions based on that data and include it within the next block. The longer form version of what Space and Time does can be found in its new whitepaper , which runs to 44 dense pages. This isn’t dense jargon for the sake of being smart, however: it’s detailed proof of Space and Time’s, well, proofs. In essence, smart contracts are unable to natively process data. SxT does this for them, spitting out the result in the form of a lightweight ZK proof. As a result, the document notes, “SXT Chain is ushering in a new era of data-rich smart contracts.” Sergey Bigs Up Space and Time One crypto luminary who’s big on Space and Time is Sergey Nazarov of Chainlink fame. As he reasons, “Smart contracts need context to make decisions, whether it’s real-time market data, cross-chain messaging or historical onchain activity. Chainlink provides the connective tissue for data to move securely across systems, and Space and Time brings powerful new compute capabilities that complement that vision.”That’s about as good an elevator pitch of SxT as you’re gonna get. It’s no secret that the next generation of decentralized applications will all be packing AI, some overtly and others covertly. It’s also no secret that AI consumes vast amounts of computational resources for processing. This is why Space and Time has an outsized chance of succeeding in the race to scale web3 by making smart contracts smarter, faster, and capable of drawing data from a rich array of sources. While devs are the target market for Space and Time’s tech, there’s also opportunities for validators to get involved now that its mainnet is live. Anyone can participate, be it through supplying quality datasets, staking, or operating a node. On the coal face of web3, there’s still plenty of honest work to be done and rewards to be earned. On the consumer-side, meanwhile, up on the surface, there’s a panoply of ever more sophisticated applications to await that will make the current crop of dapps look like obsolete tech. The future of onchain applications is imminent and data-rich. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Both leaders seemingly want to improve the productivity of their alliance and reduce their reliance on the United States and its allies. The four-day summit, which began Wednesday, coincides with Russia’s 80th anniversary commemorations marking the end of World War II. Per a Thursday Bloomberg report , leaders from more than 20 countries, including Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, are expected to attend the event. Russia and China to discuss trade future At the start of Thursday’s talks, Putin described the China-Russia relationship as a “fully fledged partnership” rooted in mutual strategic interests. “We are developing our ties in the interests of both our peoples and not aimed against anyone,” he remarked. The meeting marks the first in-person engagement between the two leaders since US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on foreign goods, which strained Washington’s ties with its traditional allies, particularly China. Western sanctions have made China and Russia’s economic relationship stronger, especially since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In 2024, bilateral trade between the two nations reached a record $245 billion, more than double the level in 2020. Russian exports to China are dominated by fossil fuels and raw materials, while Chinese exports include vehicles, electronics, and other manufactured goods. A joint dashboard by MERICS, OSW, and UI tracking China-Russia economic trends shows that Chinese exports of civil-military dual-use goods, like advanced machine tools and chip-making equipment, have risen sharply since 2022. Chinese imports of Russian crude oil soared to $62.26 billion in 2024, up 54% from 2021, the year before Western sanctions on Russian energy exports took effect. Russian oil exports to China also increased to over 108 million tonnes in 2024, a 30% uptick in 2 years. Russian coal exports to China also accelerated following sanctions, peaking in 2023. The momentum slowed in 2024 because China expanded its domestic coal production and diversified imports. Meanwhile, Russian LNG exports to China have more than tripled since 2019, reaching 8.3 million tonnes in 2024. Although the pandemic briefly interrupted trade in 2021, LNG volumes quickly rebounded in subsequent years. On the Pipeline gas front, the Power of Siberia-1 pipeline, launched in 2019, is set to reach its full annual capacity of 38 billion cubic meters by 2025. This infrastructure project has helped Moscow offset the collapse of gas exports to the European Union. Diplomatic ties to survive without America Beyond trade, China has provided years of diplomatic support to Russia since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Just weeks before the 2022 invasion, the two countries declared a “no limits” friendship to deepen their cooperation in the face of increasing Western influence on the global economy. This week’s meetings in Moscow will also address joint coordination in global platforms such as the BRICS collective and the Group of 20, as confirmed by Ushakov. Patricia Kim, an economist from the Brookings Institution told the Washington Post that Xi’s trip to Moscow gives China a chance to reaffirm its “close partnership with Putin” and to “remind the world” that Beijing and Moscow have “solid ties.” Close to 40% of Russia’s international trade is now settled in Chinese yuan, an increase from a meager 2% in early 2022. President Trump will not be happy about the growing ties between Russia and China, as he has stated in multiple public appearances that he views their partnership as a “ threat to America .” Speaking again in March during a Fox News interview, he warned US trade allies that they “don’t want Russia and China to get together.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

As the market moves forward, these three stand out as some of the best cryptos to buy now for those chasing performance without Ethereum’s bloated structure and developer hurdles. Vitalik Buterin warns Ethereum is too complex—could simpler alternatives take the spotlight? Ethereum’s price and philosophy are facing a critical moment. The network’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has expressed concerns about Ethereum’s increasing complexity. He declared that Ethereum has become “needlessly complicated” and needs to be simplified urgently. This comes when ETH is trading near crucial support levels, with investors watching closely to see if it can reclaim the $1,880 mark. A successful push above this zone could ignite a much-needed rally. However, as Ethereum fights to overcome both technical and structural issues, investor attention is starting to shift. The very complexity Buterin warns about is pushing users and builders alike to look for simpler, more streamlined networks that are easier to use, more transparent, and developer-friendly from day one. While Ethereum’s long-term potential is real, Bitcoin Pepe, CarterFi, and PepeX offer simpler protocols with long-term returns. Bitcoin Pepe is turning Bitcoin into a meme coin powerhouse Bitcoin Pepe is an ETH alternative creating a meme coin system similar to Solana on top of Bitcoin’s unmatched security. This project is a Layer-2 revolution. With lightning-fast transactions and a smooth user experience, Bitcoin Pepe brings the performance of Solana directly to Bitcoin’s foundation, unlocking new utility that the market has never seen before. The real breakthrough lies in Bitcoin Pepe’s creation of the PEP-20 token standard—a Bitcoin-native framework similar to Ethereum’s ERC-20 . This innovation allows for the seamless launch of new tokens directly on Bitcoin’s Layer 2 network. For investors, this opens up access to meme coin trading without needing to bridge assets or leave the safety of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Pepe presents the opportunity to convert more than $2 trillion in unused Bitcoin capital into high-growth assets for the first time. So far, the presale has already brought in over $7.7m from early buyers, with the token currently available at just $0.031. As the meme coin trend picks up steam again in 2025, Bitcoin Pepe stands out as the best crypto to buy now, both for its branding and for building the rails that could power the next cycle. CartelFi brings passive yield to the meme coin bull cycle Historically, meme coins have delivered some of the most significant returns when fresh capital floods into crypto. But this time, a major innovation is changing how meme coin investors prepare—and profit. CartelFi is turning unproductive meme holdings into high-yielding assets through its groundbreaking staking pools. Instead of waiting for meme coins to pump, CartelFi users can now earn steady returns on their bags. These staking pools offer a range of options, from single-asset meme coin staking to stablecoin and large-cap token pair staking. What makes CartelFi’s model truly revolutionary is its reward system. Investors who lock up the native CARTFI token get boosted APY, with returns as high as 1,000%, depending on the duration and the amount staked. Currently, CARTFI is priced at just $0.045 and has raised $1.7m to date. With 30 presale stages and a 5% price increase at each stage, the potential upside for early investors is massive. PepeX revolutionizes meme Coin launches with AI-driven fair launches PepeX is garnering attention in the meme coin community due to its innovative branding and cutting-edge technology. As the first AI-backed token launchpad, PepeX gives anyone the tools to create and fund a crypto project in minutes. Its AKIRA AI engine handles everything from deployment to growth, breaking the usual barriers that favor venture capitalists and gatekeepers. What sets PepeX apart is its radical fairness. The “5/95” model limits founders to just 5% of the total supply, ensuring that 95% goes directly to the community. This approach eliminates the threat of large insider dumps and puts power in the hands of everyday investors. Combined with anti-sniping tools and transparent on-chain systems, PepeX is redefining what fair launches should look like. The project has raised over $2.1m in its public presale in just weeks. PEPX is currently priced at $0.0255, with prices set to rise in future stages. With this momentum, PepeX is becoming the infrastructure behind the next generation of crypto. Time to switch from ETH to simpler alternatives? The crypto market is shifting gears fast. Ethereum once set the standard, but even its creator, Vitalik Buterin, now warns that the network has become needlessly complex. This opens the door for leaner, faster, and more user-focused alternatives. Bitcoin Pepe brings Solana-style speed to Bitcoin. CartelFi gives meme coins utility through high-yield staking. PepeX democratizes capital with AI-powered token launches.

While some may view this projection as overly optimistic, a closer examination of market dynamics, technical analyses, and regulatory developments suggests that the $20 target, though ambitious, is not entirely implausible. CONFIRMED Get ready for #XRP to hit $20+… It's coming eventually. pic.twitter.com/gwoF9chVeP — Amonyx (@amonbuy) May 7, 2025 Technical Analyses and Market Projections Several analysts have employed technical frameworks to forecast XRP’s future price movements. EGRAG CRYPTO, for instance, utilizes Elliott Wave Theory to predict a potential surge of XRP to between $20 and $66. This analysis is grounded in mathematical principles and historical price patterns, suggesting that XRP could experience significant growth in the coming years. Similarly, Jerome Greenspan’s analysis projects a target range of $20 to $40 for XRP, based on Elliott Wave patterns and market momentum . These projections, while optimistic, are contingent upon favorable market conditions and sustained investor interest. Regulatory Developments and Institutional Interest Regulatory clarity has long been a critical factor influencing XRP’s market performance. The recent settlement agreement between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has provided a significant boost to investor confidence. This legal resolution removes a substantial overhang and paves the way for increased institutional participation. In tandem with regulatory developments, the introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin aims to enhance liquidity within the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and attract institutional investors. A thriving stablecoin ecosystem has historically bolstered the utility of native blockchain tokens, positioning XRP for potential price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Long-Term Outlook Market sentiment plays a pivotal role in the valuation of cryptocurrencies. The anticipation surrounding the approval of an XRP Spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has fueled optimism among investors. According to Polymarket data, there is a 100% probability of XRP Spot ETF approval before the end of 2025, suggesting strong market confidence in XRP’s prospects. Furthermore, historical parallels are often drawn to forecast future performance. Analyst Armando Pantoja highlights XRP’s 2017 bull run, where the cryptocurrency experienced a 650-fold increase, as a precedent for potential explosive growth. He projects that XRP could reach between $8 and $20 by 2026, driven by technological advancements and increasing institutional adoption. While Amonyx’s projection of XRP reaching $20 or more may seem ambitious, it is supported by a confluence of technical analyses, regulatory advancements, and growing institutional interest. The path to such a valuation is fraught with challenges, including market volatility and the need for sustained adoption. However, the foundational developments currently underway provide a compelling case for XRP’s potential to achieve significant price milestones in the foreseeable future.

Solayer (LAYER) price has tanked 27% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $1.27, retesting a key support zone between $1.20 and $1.30 — a level that previously held firm from March 27 to April 9 before a breakout rally took the price to a peak of $3.40 on May 5. Since then, heavy bleeding started with a huge leg down from $3.40 to the current $1.27, marking 62% decline. Traders on X are comparing LAYER price crash to what happened with Mantra ( OM ).

44326749,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158552,1746711040,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Massive Bitcoin Deposit: Abraxas Capital’s Crucial Move on Kraken Exchange,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-deposit-abraxas-kraken/,"The cryptocurrency world is always buzzing with activity, and sometimes, a single transaction can tell a compelling story. Recently, the spotlight turned to a significant Bitcoin Deposit made on the Kraken Exchange , drawing attention from market watchers and on-chain analysts alike. This wasn’t just any small transfer; it involved a substantial amount of BTC linked to a notable entity, suggesting potential strategic moves in the market. Understanding the Significant Bitcoin Deposit According to insights shared by on-chain analyst The Data Nerd on X, a wallet associated with Abraxas Capital Management initiated a large transfer. Approximately two hours before the report, 1,000 BTC, valued at roughly $98.92 million at the time of the transaction, was deposited into the Kraken Exchange. What makes this particular Bitcoin Deposit noteworthy is the context around the acquisition of these coins. The analyst noted that this specific batch of BTC was acquired around three weeks prior to the deposit, at an estimated average price of $84,713 per Bitcoin. This detail is crucial for understanding the potential motivation behind the move. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key figures involved in this specific deposit: Metric Value Amount Deposited 1,000 BTC Value at Deposit Time ~$98.92 million Approximate Acquisition Price ~$84,713 per BTC Potential Profit (if sold at deposit price) ~$14.21 million This potential profit figure highlights the significant unrealized gains that were sitting in the wallet prior to the transfer to the exchange. Moving such a large sum to an exchange often signals an intention to sell, increase liquidity, or engage in trading activities. Who is Abraxas Capital Management and Why Does This Matter? While specific public details about Abraxas Capital Management ‘s crypto holdings or strategies might be limited, the association of a large Crypto Whale movement with a firm like this is significant. Institutional participation in the crypto market is a closely watched metric, often seen as an indicator of growing maturity and confidence in the asset class. Institutional investors typically operate with larger capital bases and more sophisticated strategies than individual retail traders. Their moves, especially large deposits or withdrawals from exchanges, can sometimes precede notable market volatility or signal shifts in sentiment among large holders. Decoding the Crypto Whale’s Strategy Using On-chain Data This event is a prime example of the power of On-chain Data . On-chain analysis involves examining transactions recorded on the public blockchain ledger. By tracking wallet addresses, transaction volumes, and movements between different types of addresses (like exchanges, institutional wallets, or cold storage), analysts can gain insights into market dynamics, accumulation/distribution trends, and the potential intentions of large holders or ‘whales’. In this case, tracking the coins from their acquisition three weeks ago to their deposit on the Kraken Exchange allows analysts to infer a potential strategy. The quick turnaround time between acquisition and deposit, coupled with the substantial profit margin, suggests a potentially opportunistic trade or a decision to rebalance their portfolio. Possible reasons for the deposit could include: Profit Taking: Realizing the ~$14.21 million profit from the price increase since acquisition. Increasing Liquidity: Preparing funds for other investments or operational needs. Trading Activity: Using the deposited BTC for active trading strategies on the exchange. Portfolio Rebalancing: Adjusting their holdings based on market conditions or internal investment mandates. It’s important to note that a deposit doesn’t automatically mean a sale has occurred. The BTC is now available on the exchange, but the firm could still be holding it there for various reasons other than immediate liquidation. The Remaining Holdings: A Glimpse into Abraxas Capital’s Position Despite the large deposit, the analysis also revealed that the wallet linked to Abraxas Capital Management still holds a significant amount of Bitcoin. As of the time of the report, the wallet retained 983 BTC, currently valued at approximately $97.43 million. This indicates that the deposit represented only a portion of their recent acquisition or total holdings. The decision to deposit 1,000 BTC while holding onto nearly the same amount suggests a calculated move, perhaps testing liquidity, taking partial profits, or executing a specific trading plan while maintaining a core position. What Can We Learn from This Institutional Crypto Activity? Moves by entities like Abraxas Capital Management provide valuable data points for the market. While one transaction doesn’t dictate market direction, observing institutional behavior through On-chain Data helps build a broader picture of sentiment and capital flows. It reinforces the increasing involvement of traditional finance players in the crypto space. For retail investors, tracking these large movements can offer potential insights, but it’s crucial not to blindly follow whale activity. Whales have different goals, risk tolerances, and capital structures. However, understanding where large amounts of capital are moving can be a component of a comprehensive market analysis strategy. Key takeaways from this event: Large institutions are actively trading and managing significant Bitcoin positions. Profitable opportunities are being capitalized on by sophisticated players. On-chain data provides transparency into these large movements, offering valuable market intelligence. Exchanges like Kraken continue to facilitate large-scale institutional transactions. Challenges and Considerations While On-chain Data is powerful, it’s not without its limitations. Wallet addresses are pseudonymous, and definitively linking them to specific entities can sometimes be challenging or require external information (like the analyst provided in this case). Furthermore, interpreting the intent behind a transaction requires careful analysis and consideration of multiple factors, not just the movement itself. Another challenge is the potential for misinterpretation. A deposit could be for internal transfers, OTC deals, or participation in exchange-specific programs, not necessarily an immediate market sell-off. Therefore, these data points should be used as part of a larger analytical framework. Actionable Insights for Readers How can you use information like this Bitcoin Deposit by Abraxas Capital on Kraken Exchange ? Explore On-chain Analysis Tools: Familiarize yourself with platforms and analysts who track whale movements and exchange flows. Context is Key: Don’t react solely to a single transaction. Look at the broader market trend, other on-chain metrics, and fundamental news. Understand Exchange Dynamics: Learn how large deposits and withdrawals can potentially impact exchange liquidity and order books. Diversify Your Information Sources: Combine on-chain data with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and market news. This specific event underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the increasing influence of institutional players, whose activities, when illuminated by On-chain Data , offer fascinating glimpses into the strategies driving significant capital flows. Summary: A Whale’s Profitable Maneuver on Kraken In conclusion, the recent movement of 1,000 BTC, valued at nearly $99 million, from a wallet linked to Abraxas Capital Management onto the Kraken Exchange is a notable event in the crypto space. This large Bitcoin Deposit , following a relatively short holding period with significant unrealized profit, highlights the active participation and strategic maneuvers of institutional-scale investors or Crypto Whale entities. The ability to track such movements through On-chain Data provides valuable transparency into the market, suggesting potential profit-taking or strategic positioning. While the exact reasons for the deposit remain with Abraxas Capital, the transaction serves as a clear indicator of sophisticated capital at work within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The statement by Coinbase informed that the overall value of the transaction will be approximately $2.9 billion, comprised of cash and company shares. The Wall Street-listed company described the move as a “milestone transaction,” as Deribit is the global leader in terms of crypto options, with a current open interest of roughly $30 billion. According to the statement, this acquisition will highlight Coinbase’s derivatives business, “establishing us as the premier global platform for crypto derivatives.” It will allow Coinbase to create the “most comprehensive institutional derivatives platform” using Deribit’s infrastructure, which “complements” its existing one. Further, the Brian Armstrong-founded exchange expects the deal to strengthen its market leadership and help it scale to a wider audience, especially of institutional traders. “We’re excited to join forces with Coinbase to power a new era in global crypto derivatives,” said Deribit CEO Luuk Strijers. “As the leading crypto options platform, we’ve built a strong, profitable business, and this acquisition will accelerate the foundation we laid while providing traders with even more opportunities across spot, futures, perpetuals, and options – all under one trusted brand. Together with Coinbase, we’re set to shape the future of the global crypto derivatives market.” $700 million out of the $2.9 billion total will be paid in cash, while the remaining will be in the form of 11 million shares of Coinbase Class A common stock. Although the transaction is subject to regulatory approval by US watchdogs, Coinbase’s stock prices soared in pre-market trading by almost 5% to over $200. This deal can become one of the biggest, if not the biggest, in the cryptocurrency industry, if approved. Recall that Ripple made a substantial move earlier this year by acquiring Hidden Road for $1.2 billion, but its $5 billion offer to take over Circle was reportedly rejected .

One project that continues to stand out in this search is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — a DeFi protocol still trading well under $0.05, but already drawing serious attention from those focused on long-term returns. At a glance, MUTM’s price tag of $0.025 might seem like just another low-cap presale. But that figure won’t last much longer. The next presale phase is approaching fast, and with it, the token price is set to increase to $0.03 — a 20% jump from its current level. And with a launch price locked at $0.06, the opportunity for early entry is narrowing by the day. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) There’s a simple reason strategic investors are making their move now: the math makes sense. Based on the confirmed launch price of $0.06, MUTM is projected to rise over 1000% shortly after going live, according to early analyst estimates. However, those who get in before the current presale phase concludes stand to gain even more. Take this example — an investor who puts in $1,500 at the current $0.025 price stands to receive 60,000 tokens. When the token reaches $0.60 (a 1000% gain from launch), that $1,500 turns into $36,000. That’s not just a strong return — that’s the type of move that long-term cryptocurrency portfolios are built around. Waiting until the next presale phase at $0.03 cuts into that potential. Waiting until launch reduces it even more. That’s why early movers aren’t hesitating. Timing, in this case, is everything. MUTM isn’t gaining traction just because of its price point. The project itself is building real infrastructure around decentralized finance. Mutuum operates as a non-custodial platform, enabling users to access lending and borrowing features for digital assets through self-executing smart contracts. The platform is structured to support both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models. With the P2C method, users supply assets to collective liquidity pools and receive earnings that depend on how actively those pools are being used. Borrowers access these pools by locking up collateral, and rates adjust dynamically based on how much capital is in use. Meanwhile, the P2P model offers a more direct route — letting users negotiate terms independently, especially useful for more speculative tokens. This dual-lending structure has led some analysts to include MUTM in their crypto predictions for top-performing DeFi assets in the next market cycle. Beyond lending and borrowing, Mutuum is also in the process of developing an overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted directly from collateral inside the protocol, offering a decentralized and transparent alternative to more centralized stable assets. Importantly, all interest generated from stablecoin borrowing flows back into the protocol’s treasury — reinforcing its long-term sustainability. These utilities give MUTM more than just short-term trading appeal. They’re why many analysts are labeling it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now, especially for those building portfolios focused on DeFi exposure and consistent passive income strategies. One reason Mutuum is catching on with forward-looking investors is its balance of current traction and untapped potential. With over 9,500 holders already and $7.7 million raised, the community is growing fast — but it’s still early. Once the token is listed on major exchanges, more exposure will follow, and the entry price will no longer sit below five cents. Mutuum’s team has also confirmed that all transactions will run through audited smart contracts, and a full audit with CertiK is underway. The platform’s beta release is planned to coincide with the token launch, showing that the team is prioritizing practical delivery and real functionality over marketing buzz. Opportunities like this don’t stay quiet for long. MUTM is currently flying under the radar, but not for much longer. The upcoming price jump to $0.03 is just the first step in a planned progression toward launch. Each phase not only increases price but also reduces the potential upside for new investors. By entering now — before the next presale phase begins — investors secure both a lower price and a higher margin for returns. That’s why this token, still under $0.05, is being added to long-term portfolios by those who’ve seen how early-stage crypto investments in DeFi projects can outperform when built with real use in mind.

The decision is a reversal of the agency’s previous conservative approach to digital assets. Rodney Hood, Acting Comptroller of the Currency, announced the change, stating that crypto is no longer a passing trend but a transformation of financial infrastructure. “We’ve confirmed that national banks and federal saving associations may engage in certain cryptocurrency activities responsibly, in order to serve their customers,” said Hood. Banks Can Now Actively Offer Crypto Services Banks are permitted to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in custody at the behest of the customer under the new guidance. They are also free to outsource both execution and custody services to third parties, provided those services comply with OCC risk management standards. The following other crypto services are also permitted: Record keeping Tax reporting Valuation and settlement Facilitating fiat-to-crypto exchange Banks may act as fiduciaries and sub-custodians, as long as they adhere to sound third-party risk management standards, the OCC said in its May 7 report. Regulatory Harmony Among U.S. Agencies The OCC’s move is part of a broader regulatory re-alignment. In April, the Federal Reserve withdrew regulations requiring state banks to notify regulators before engaging in crypto-related activities. It also rescinded guidelines that had restricted the use of stablecoins. Similarly, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the OCC backed away from 2023 joint statements that had limited crypto transactions. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also removed this January a rule that had counted bank-held crypto as a liability. The actions are amid heightened interest from crypto firms in acquiring bank charters to reduce borrowing costs and enhance operational legitimacy. A Turning Point for Crypto-Banking Integration This series of actions amounts to a remarkable shift in how the crypto sector is viewed by U.S. financial regulators. The OCC’s new guidance gives regulated banks the comfort and legal certainty to get more engaged in the digital asset economy. While the industry is still under regulatory oversight, banks now have the green light to enter the crypto space responsibly, which marks a very important milestone in crypto’s acceptance within mainstream finance.",Blockchain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-05-08 13:31:43

The announcement, confirmed by both American and British officials, is expected to be formally unveiled by Trump at a 2PM UTC press briefing from the Oval Office. “ The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come ,” said Trump in his social media post. President Donald Trump announced that the United States has reached a trade agreement with the United Kingdom. Source: Donald Trump (Truth Social) The US president called the UK America’s “FIRST” trade partner to reach such a deal under his latest trade initiative. A senior British official, speaking anonymously, has confirmed the deal but provided no further details beyond stating it would be mutually beneficial. Details of the trade agreement with the Trump administration yet to be revealed According to the BBC, citing several trade analysts and insiders, the agreement may not yet be finalized. Timothy C. Brightbill, an international trade attorney with Wiley Rein, said what has been announced could simply be the beginning of formal negotiations. “Tariff rates, non-tariff barriers, and digital trade are likely on the agenda,” he added, claiming there are many more difficult issues to be discussed. Talks between the two countries previously involved discussions about reducing British tariffs on US automobiles and agricultural products, and taxes targeting American tech firms operating in the UK. Britain was not among the countries hit with reciprocal tariffs, but due to its trade imbalance favoring US imports, it was affected by America’s global 10% tariff on common goods and a 25% tax on steel and aluminum. British officials have long lobbied for the removal of the steel, aluminum, and automobile levies that are pushing UK manufacturers out of business. British Parliament and business leaders react William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), welcomed the deal, explaining that it will bring a “huge sigh of relief” to many of the 50,000 firms the BCC represents. “ Firms will want to see a reduction in the 25% tariffs that have hit our steel, aluminium and automotive industries and left them reeling ,” Bain said in a statement. He added that Britain will have to make compromises, although businesses are looking for clear timelines and certainty about when tariff relief will materialize. “ This must also not be the end of the process, we must continue to push the argument for free and fair trade ,” Bain propounded. In the UK Parliament, lawmakers like Conservative MP Mark Pritchard have asked if the deal protects domestic farmers from imported goods such as chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef. Lucy Powell, the Leader of the House of Commons, assured MPs that agriculture and food standards were “redlined” in the negotiations. Farming Secretary Steve Reed supported Powell’s claims, saying that protections were in place to prevent British farmers from being undercut on environmental and animal welfare standards. Trump has sought a trade agreement with the UK since his first term in office, especially following Britain’s exit from the European Union . British officials hoped to secure an agreement with the United States to boost their economy post-Brexit and rebalance trade relations weakened by their departure from the EU. Trump believes the UK deal would be just the first of many such agreements . “Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!” he wrote online. Ongoing negotiations are also in progress with India, South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. According to the BBC, after three years of negotiations, British officials confirmed they secured a trade deal with India on Tuesday. That agreement promises to lower tariffs between the two nations and grant UK firms access to India’s financial services sector. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The milestone, last seen in mid‑February, came during mid‑morning trading before prices cooled to just under the threshold. Bitcoin’s intraday price high hit roughly $100,131 , with a session low near $95,959. Even after slipping back to about $99,300, BTC remains up more than 30 % from its April trough, when President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs rattled risk assets. 24h 7d 30d 1y All time Why is the Bitcoin Price Rally Happening Now? Trade détente hopes. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s planned meeting with Chinese officials in Switzerland — framed as a bid to “de‑escalate” tariff tensions — has reignited risk appetite across global markets. ETF money is flowing again. Spot‑Bitcoin exchange‑traded funds recorded $142 million of net inflows on Wednesday , reversing the prior day’s outflows and signalling institutional buyers are back. Macro back‑drop. The Federal Reserve’s decision yesterday to hold rates steady at 4.25‑4.50 % removed a key overhang for risk assets, according to market strategists at eToro and Wincent. Price Forecasts Heat Up Standard Chartered’s digital‑asset chief Geoff Kendrick reiterated his year‑end target of $120,000 , calling it “possibly too conservative” if geopolitical tensions continue to push capital away from U.S. equities. BTC’s breakout triggered nearly $300 million in short liquidations across major derivatives venues, wiping out $116 million in Bitcoin positions alone, CoinGlass figures reveal . Large‑cap altcoins followed suit: Ether briefly reclaimed $2,000, and Dogecoin jumped above $0.18 . Despite lower volatility — Bitcoin’s 30‑day historic volume hovers at an 18‑month low — correlations with the S&P 500 have risen back toward 0.9, a reminder that macro shocks could still derail the rally.

The partnership will see Crypto.com become the first digital asset exchange to integrate Lynq, allowing institutional clients to seamlessly fund their trading accounts and offramp to the settlement platform. Moreover, the exchange will gain access to a network of market participants that enable real-time settlement and the ability to earn yield on assets held on the platform through Lynq’s Yield-in-Transit functionality. Eric Anzaini, Crypto.com’s President and Chief Operating Officer (COO), has high hopes for the partnership, having stated that: “Joining Lynq aligns with Crypto.com’s commitment to driving innovation and fostering greater efficiency within the digital assets ecosystem. We believe that Lynq will offer significant benefits to the institutions we serve, and we are proud to be the first digital asset exchange to leverage this technology.” Lynq’s consortium consists of a bevy of large crypto players beyond just crypto.com The yield-bearing network aims to address some of the unique challenges at play with digital asset settlement, such as market fragmentation, an ever-evolving regulatory framework, and counterparty risk — while providing yield to institutional clients . To this end, Lynq leverages tZERO’s Broker-Dealer and Special Purpose Broker-Dealer licenses as well as Arca’s Registered Investment Adviser and Delaware Trust, while leveraging Tassat’s real-time blockchain infrastructure. Speaking of Arca and Tassat, Lynq’s consortium includes leading names in the cryptocurrency and decentralized finance ( DeFi ) spaces such as Arca Labs, Avalanche, tZero Group, U.S. Bank, and Tassat Group. Arca Labs President Jerald David, leader of the consortium, hailed the partnership as both a natural progression and a key solution to a market-wide issue, stating that: “Crypto.com ranks among the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, and we are honored to have the Crypto.com Exchange join the consortium.

Retail excitement is igniting, altcoin volume is rising, and institutional money is re-entering. This awakening is creating a new story around solid principles, practical applications, and tokens with momentum. A few cryptocurrencies stand out as the best candidates for exponential increases in this developing climate. Among them, Rexas Finance (RXS) leads the way as a next-generation asset tokenizing tool that might redefine digital era wealth creation. Along with it, three more tokens—Shiba Inu (SHIB), Official Trump (Trump), and Kaspa (KAS)—are catching fire and have the potential to yield notable returns in only 100 days. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Gateway for Actual Asset Investment Rexas Finance is a transforming power in decentralized finance (DeFi) and asset management, not just another speculative crypto startup. Fundamentally, Rexas Finance lets users tokenize and invest in actual assets ( RWAs) such as real estate, commodities, art, and intellectual property. By reducing conventional hurdles to access, like geographic restrictions, high capital requirements, and ineffective intermediaries, this capability opens an excellent prospect for worldwide investors. Rexas Finance has already raised over $48 million, selling more than 460 million RXS tokens at a presale price of $0.20, now in Stage 12 of its spectacular presale. Early adopters set themselves for a minimum 25% ROI before RXS ever goes public, with a launch date of June 19, 2025, and a projected first listing price of $0.250. Many experts, however, think this is only a starting point. Some estimates project that RXS might rise above 17,800% once Ethereum starts the next altcoin season, given the platform's significant use cases and increasing investor trust. The $1 million gift campaign, which awards 20 lucky winners with $50,000 in RXS tokens each, gives the idea more momentum. This increases community involvement and draws greater attention to a platform already with a CertiK-verified smart contract audit, a completely working ecosystem, and links with DeFi tools, NFT generators, and multi-chain launchpads. Those wishing to participate in the presale have an easy process. Users pay with ETH or USDT from a Web3 wallet, either MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Following their wallet's official Rexas.com DApp connection, they can choose the payment method, enter the amount to be invested, authorize the transaction, and directly get RXS tokens into their wallet. Through Ramp, Transak, and MoonPay, the platform also provides fiat purchase support, enabling access even to individuals just starting DeFi. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme Power with Long-Term Prospects Shiba Inu has kept developing outside its beginnings, even though it is now identified as a meme coin. SHIB is far from a joke, with a market valuation of $7.26 billion. Its price has jumped to $0.00001233, and daily trading volume—an indication of ongoing community interest and investment activity—is hovering above $144 million. Shiba Inu's continuous development of Shibarium, a Layer-2 blockchain meant to accelerate transactions and cut gas costs, is adding real value to the currency. Combined with a large and devoted holder base, SHIB is positioned for a big breakout should meme coins become popular during the next wave of retail speculation. Its ultra-low price per token also appeals psychologically to new investors hoping for triple—or quadruple-digit gains. Official Trump (TRUMP): The Politically Inspired Market Mover Official Trump (Trump) is one of the most unusual tokens generating news. Politically themed tokens are becoming more popular as the U.S. presidential election season gets hot; Trump spearheads the movement. Priced at $8.24 with a circulating quantity barely less than 200 million tokens, Trump has a market capitalization of around $1.64 billion. Although the token's performance over the previous week has shown some volatility, declining by roughly 10%, the general attitude is still positive. Trump is predicted to gain from more media coverage and meme-fueled market attitude as the political terrain of the United States gets more intense. Trump offers a high-volatility, high-reward opportunity for risk-tolerant investors that can burst in the short term, particularly if political memes and storylines rule internet conversation in the following weeks. Kaspa (KAS): The Infrastructure Gem Getting Ground Kaspa (KAS) is unique in technical innovation, unlike the hype-driven character of meme and political tokens. Designed as a fast, scalable proof-of-work blockchain, Kaspa dramatically increases throughput and reduces confirmation times by using a blockDAG structure that lets many blocks be generated concurrently. With a total market capitalization of $1.91 billion and a price of $0.07358, KAS has been silently becoming popular among developers and long-term investors. The token has increased 14.87%, indicating that accumulation is underway during just one week alone. The token might significantly increase as more users find the speed and efficiency of Kaspa's network, particularly if DeFi and NFT initiatives start looking for scalable Layer-1 substitutes. Conclusion For many crypto investors, the next 100 days will decide their 2025 financial results. Projects combining strong foundations, community buzz, and real-world use cases are best suited to spearhead the charge as the industry recovers momentum. A must-watch token in the weeks before its June 19 release, Rexas Finance (RXS) presents the best mix of utility, early-entry potential, and institutional appeal. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still a meme coin with significant upside, particularly should the market mood get euphoric. While Kaspa (KAS) is a technically sound project gaining real traction, official Trump (Trump) brings political conjecture into the crypto space from a different angle. For those who act now, the opportunity is wide open. As past cycles have shown, though, it has not been open for long.

In a detailed commentary shared on X, he focused on the existing structure of the financial system, specifically highlighting the scale and risk embedded in derivatives markets. According to Vandell, the current system is anchored by an immense web of derivative contracts, reportedly valued at over a quadrillion dollars. These contracts are managed through Central Clearing Counterparties (CCPs), institutions established to act as intermediaries for derivatives trades to ensure successful settlement between counterparties. The collapse will likely be the catalyst for global value to flow onto XRP & XLM. Let me explain. The financial system today is built on a giant pile of complicated contracts called ""derivatives,"" worth over a quadrillion dollars. To keep everything running smoothly, big… — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) May 6, 2025 While these entities were designed to mitigate systemic risk by centralizing and managing default risk, Vandell argues they have rather evolved into potential points of systemic failure. He notes that if a CCP were to fail, the result would be an absence of any intermediary capable of guaranteeing the settlement of trillions of dollars in contracts. This would necessitate the rapid reallocation of collateral to secured creditors such as banks, hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies, and other institutional investors. Vandell points out that this urgent need for collateral movement could expose the inefficiencies of traditional financial infrastructure. XRP and XLM as Infrastructure for Value Transfer Vandell asserts that in a scenario where the current financial framework experiences critical failure, blockchain technologies like the XRP Ledger and the Stellar network could provide the infrastructure needed to transfer value efficiently and securely globally. He emphasizes that both XRP and XLM are designed for instantaneous cross-border transactions and that their underlying networks are already operational and capable of meeting such demands. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He links the longstanding institutional interest in blockchain technology to this possibility, suggesting that the sustained funding and strategic dialogue surrounding platforms like XRP Ledger and Stellar by central banks, financial institutions, and organizations such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) indicate preparation for a systemic shift. Vandell implies that the infrastructure has been quietly developed and tested over the past decade in anticipation of a broader transition. Strategic Transition Over Catastrophic Collapse Responding to commentary on his post, Vandell acknowledged that a financial reset does not necessarily require a catastrophic event. In reply to a user who argued for a more controlled and deliberate restructuring of the current system, Vandell agreed that a strategic and managed transition is plausible and likely. He emphasized that coordinated actions by global institutions and policymakers over several years point to planning rather than reactionary measures. He concluded that a financial “reset” is not inherently negative or destabilizing. Instead, it may represent the structured replacement of outdated mechanisms with newer, more efficient technologies. Vandell sees XRP and XLM as central components of this transition, not merely as investment vehicles but as foundational elements of a new financial paradigm designed to meet the needs of a digitized global economy.

44327172,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158558,1746711643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Call: Korean Won Stablecoin Proposed to Safeguard South Korea’s Economy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/korean-won-stablecoin-proposal/,"A significant development is stirring in the South Korean political landscape, directly impacting the future of its digital economy. Lee Jae-myung, a prominent figure and the presidential candidate from the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), has put forward a compelling proposal: the swift adoption of a market based on the Korean won stablecoin . This isn’t just a technical suggestion; it’s a strategic move aimed at positioning South Korea at the forefront of global financial trends and, crucially, to prevent capital outflows . Speaking during a live talk show on May 8 with influential economy-focused YouTubers, Lee underscored the urgency and importance of this initiative. His remarks, reported by Money Today, highlight a growing recognition within mainstream politics of the transformative potential of digital assets, particularly stablecoins, for national economic stability and growth. Why the Focus on a Korean Won Stablecoin? The core idea behind a Korean won stablecoin is to create a digital currency pegged directly to the value of the South Korean won. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to maintain a stable price, making them suitable for transactions, savings, and serving as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world. Lee Jae-myung’s advocacy for a won-pegged version specifically addresses South Korea’s unique economic needs and aspirations in the digital age. Currently, much of the stablecoin activity globally is dominated by US dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT or USDC. While useful for international trade and accessing global crypto markets, relying heavily on foreign-denominated stablecoins can introduce currency risk and potentially facilitate capital moving out of the local economy into foreign digital assets. A won-based stablecoin could offer a robust, domestically controlled alternative. How Could a Korean Won Stablecoin Prevent Capital Outflows? One of the primary motivations cited by Lee Jae-myung stablecoin proposal is the potential to prevent capital outflows . But how exactly could a digital asset achieve this? Providing a Domestic Alternative: By offering a liquid and trusted stable digital asset denominated in won, South Koreans might be less inclined to convert their won into foreign currencies (like USD) or foreign-pegged stablecoins solely to participate in the digital asset space or seek perceived stability outside the local currency. Boosting Domestic Crypto Markets: A widely adopted Korean won stablecoin could significantly enhance liquidity and trading efficiency on South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, making the domestic market more attractive for both local and international investors. Increased activity within the won ecosystem keeps capital circulating domestically. Facilitating Local Digital Commerce: If won stablecoins become integrated into everyday transactions and digital commerce platforms within South Korea, it further solidifies the won’s role in the digital economy, reducing the need for conversion to foreign currencies for online activities. Attracting Foreign Investment in Won Assets: A well-regulated, accessible won stablecoin could potentially attract foreign investors looking for exposure to the South Korean economy or assets in a digital format, leading to capital *inflows* rather than outflows. Lee’s vision aligns with a broader global trend where nations are exploring digital currencies, either through central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or by fostering environments for private stablecoins, to maintain monetary sovereignty and control in an increasingly digital world. What Does This Mean for South Korea Crypto Policy? The proposal from a major presidential candidate signals a potential shift or acceleration in South Korea crypto policy . While South Korea has a vibrant crypto trading market, its regulatory stance has often been cautious, particularly regarding new forms of digital assets and their integration into the traditional financial system. Lee’s call suggests a willingness to embrace stablecoins more proactively. However, implementing such a policy would require careful consideration and likely involve significant collaboration between regulators, financial institutions, and technology providers. Key policy areas that would need attention include: Regulatory Framework: Establishing clear rules for the issuance, reserve requirements, and oversight of Korean won stablecoin issuers. This is crucial for ensuring stability and protecting users. Robust stablecoin regulation is paramount. Integration with Traditional Finance: Defining how won stablecoins would interact with existing banks, payment systems, and financial infrastructure. Consumer Protection and AML/KYC: Implementing strong measures to prevent illicit activities and safeguard users’ funds. Technological Standards: Ensuring interoperability and security for stablecoin platforms. The proposal opens up a national conversation about how South Korea can best leverage blockchain technology and digital assets to strengthen its economy and financial system in the face of global digital transformation. Exploring the Benefits Beyond Preventing Outflows While preventing capital flight is a major driver, the potential benefits of a well-implemented Korean won stablecoin ecosystem extend further: Enhanced Payment Efficiency: Stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper, and 24/7 payments compared to traditional banking systems, both domestically and potentially for cross-border transactions. Financial Innovation: A stable digital base layer can spur innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), smart contracts, and other blockchain-based applications within the won ecosystem. Increased Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins could potentially offer access to digital financial services for individuals or businesses underserved by traditional banking. Global Competitiveness: By actively participating in the stablecoin market, South Korea can maintain its position as a technologically advanced nation and a leader in the digital economy. Keeping pace with global trends, as mentioned by Lee, is vital. These benefits collectively contribute to a more robust and dynamic digital economy, which in turn can help retain and attract capital. What are the Challenges and Considerations? Despite the potential upsides, the path to widespread adoption of a Korean won stablecoin is not without obstacles. Addressing these challenges will be critical for successful implementation. Challenge Area Description Regulatory Uncertainty Developing comprehensive and effective stablecoin regulation that fosters innovation while ensuring stability and preventing misuse. Reserve Management Ensuring that stablecoin issuers hold sufficient, high-quality reserves (like actual won deposits or short-term government bonds) to back the stablecoins 1:1, maintaining the peg. Adoption & Trust Gaining widespread public and business trust and encouraging adoption over existing payment methods. Technological Risks Ensuring the security and resilience of the underlying blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Impact on Monetary Policy Understanding how a large-scale stablecoin market might interact with or impact the central bank’s monetary policy tools. These challenges require careful planning, collaboration between the public and private sectors, and a phased approach to implementation. The specifics of stablecoin regulation will likely be the most significant factor determining the success and safety of a won stablecoin market. Lee Jae-myung’s Stance in Context Lee Jae-myung’s comments place him among a growing number of global policymakers acknowledging the increasing importance of digital assets. His focus on a won-based stablecoin specifically highlights a nationalistic economic perspective – using digital innovation to strengthen the domestic currency and financial system. While the proposal was made during a live talk show and may require formal policy articulation, it signals the Democratic Party’s potential direction regarding digital currency and South Korea crypto policy if they hold influence. The discussion around Lee Jae-myung stablecoin proposal is likely to evolve, prompting further debate on the role of private versus public digital currencies (like a potential CBDC from the Bank of Korea) and the overall strategy for integrating digital assets into the national economy in a way that maximizes benefits while mitigating risks, including the risk to prevent capital outflows . Concluding Thoughts: A Digital Future for the Won? The call for a Korean won stablecoin market by a prominent political figure like Lee Jae-myung is a pivotal moment for South Korea crypto policy . It moves the conversation beyond just regulating speculative trading to actively exploring how digital assets can serve strategic national economic goals, such as enhancing financial efficiency and, critically, helping to prevent capital outflows by providing robust domestic digital alternatives. While significant challenges related to stablecoin regulation , implementation, and adoption lie ahead, the potential benefits – from boosting financial innovation to strengthening the won’s position in the digital economy – make this a proposal worth serious consideration. The coming months and years will reveal how South Korea navigates these complex issues and whether a won-based stablecoin becomes a reality, shaping the nation’s economic future in the digital age.

The same bill they voted for just two months ago . Why the flip-flop? Because they don’t like Trump and they think the bill will help him profit . Why the Democrats keep hitting “replay” on this losing message is beyond me. Hating on Trump does not win elections. Just refer to the electoral bloodbath of 2024. But here’s the kicker: Crypto isn’t the threat, it’s the opportunity. If Democrats dropped their losing soundbites long enough to really learn crypto, they wouldn’t just write better policy, they’d rewrite their political future in 2026. By the Numbers In 2024, Democrats lost a generation. Young men who had historically leaned in hard for Democrats, fled. In just four years, young men went from backing Biden to giving Trump a 30-point swing, flipping hard against the very candidate they once rejected. While there’s plenty of soul-searching to be done about why, one answer is hiding in plain sight: crypto. Yes, crypto. And despite Big Crypto’s talking points, it’s not because young male voters are single-issue crypto voters. They’re not . It’s because crypto, like other emerging technologies of the past, reflects generational and gender divides that mirror the trends we’re seeing among young male voters. According to a Pew Research Center survey , 41% of young men have used crypto. This is orders of magnitude greater than young women (16%) and people over 50 (8%). So even if that young male voter isn’t holding crypto himself, 42% of his peer group is. It’s in his social media feeds, his podcast rotations, his group chats. And right now, he’s hearing only one side of the story, because Democrats have refused to learn the tech. It’s important to remember that these young men aren’t all online crypto scammers. They are the same ones who overwhelmingly share Democratic values such as “basic health insurance is a right” and the “government should spend more to reduce poverty.” The Democrats can keep calling crypto a criminal enterprise over and over, but it doesn’t make it one. The only effective thing it does is tell all young men that the Dems want to cancel them. And we’ve seen how young men have punished them for it at the voting booth. Mistaking Trump for Crypto Let’s say the quiet part out loud: the crypto-natives don’t want to see Trump as the face of this community. He and his family are promoting the same kind of rug-pull projects that the crypto community has spent years battling. So why did young men vote for him? Because even with the grifting, he isn’t completely ignoring them or, worse, pretending they’re something they’re not. Go to any crypto meetup or conference and you’ll know that the builders aren’t about hype tokens or centralized projects propped up only by endorsements. Crypto is about giving people control of their money, their data, and their digital identity. The ethos is grounded in the earned distrust of centralized institutions: Wall Street, Big Tech, and the federal government (most recently proven by the speed of DOGE’s access to all of our data). The community’s oft-quoted mantras prove the point: ● “Don’t trust. Verify.” ● “Not your keys, not your coins.” ● “If you don’t know where the yield comes from, you are the yield.” These are not the vibes of blind allegiance. The crypto community was born out of the 2008 financial crisis, when banks collapsed under their own misconduct and taxpayers footed the bill. Embedded within Bitcoin’s genesis block is the hardcoded reminder: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” The Democrats’ insistence of conflating that community with Trump’s opportunism is lazy. The obvious consequence has been to push away the very voters they desperately need. The Fix Is Simple, But Time-Limited Sure, some politicians may be a little scared of the campaign money involved: Crypto PACs have raised over $260 million, making crypto the sixth largest Super PAC, dwarfing any other industry-supported Super PAC (all the others are related to a particular party or candidate). But those donations came from just 50 individuals. That’s not a movement. It’s a small elevator lobby. Meanwhile, there’s a whole voter base of millions of young men who turned to crypto because of their mistrust of Wall Street and Big Tech. The same mistrust Democrats share of those same centralized entities. Democrats don’t have to embrace hype coins or endorse bad legislation. In fact, they shouldn’t. But they do need to actually learn to embrace the core values of the builders in the crypto community: individual digital ownership and decentralization. Democrats also need to start demonstrating this now. They can’t risk another cycle without bringing young men back under the tent. One cycle can be a blip, but two cycles in a row becomes a habit, and habits are hard to break. The Course Correction The GENIUS Act is actually the perfect opportunity for the Democrats to show that they’re a party that is more interested in voters than soundbites against Trump. The current draft is 57 pages of legislative jargon to elevate the roles of centralized entities in overseeing stablecoins. No surprise. Remember those 50 individuals who raised $260 million for the crypto Super PAC? They’ll definitely benefit from an increased reliance on their intermediation. But embedded in the draft legislation is a small definition that is doing a lot of work, and that’s the definition of “distributed ledger.” Instead of hating on Trump, the Democrats could band together to say that the definition doesn’t require decentralization or network security, and until that happens, they can’t advance a stablecoin bill that only promotes fee-taking central intermediaries. Now that could be the beginning of a real sea-change. The Democrats wouldn’t even need to mention Trump. The reality would be that none of the Trump family crypto projects would survive a definition that required true decentralization. So here’s the real question: do Democrats want to keep losing elections just to avoid learning new tech? Or are they finally ready to act like a party that wants to win votes again?",Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-08 13:41:32

While the project was already doing plenty of business both in enterprise and web3, its mainnet launch will allow it to kick things up a notch. SxT already has a clear idea of the sort of use cases its zero-knowledge proofs will be supporting. Not surprisingly, AI is near the top of that list. Rich Data and Cryptographic Proofs One of the challenges with complex projects, particularly those working with cryptographic proofs – in this case of the zero-knowledge variety – is conveying to the average web3 user the significance of it all. Thankfully for Space and Time, its target audience is developers rather than end users, which helps significantly: it’s in the middleware game. It also helps that SxT has done a very good job of explaining how its core products slot together and why they’re such a big deal. As the project’s Scott Dykstra explains, “Prior to Space and Time, onchain applications had no way to query basic user data from a database of blockchain activity without introducing security risks and tampering. In addition, enterprises had no way to securely connect their cloud databases with smart contracts.” With the launch of SxT’s mainnet, Dykstra is confident that the quality of decentralized applications is about to level up now they can access more data with greater reliability from on- and off-chain sources. Petabyte-Scale Storage Space and Time has a lot of moving parts to it, centered around its Proof of SQL solution which serves as a sub-second ZK coprocessor. Among its bold promises is the ability to deliver “petabyte-scale” blockchain storage though an elastic scaling solution. This effectively means that dapps will never run out of storage, even when addressing memory-intensive use cases. But this is about more than simply multiplying web3’s storage capacity: Space and Time is equally interested in ensuring that this data can be accessed in a private manner. This is particularly vital for enterprises, which struggle to reconcile the transparency of public blockchains with the need to keep sensitive financial data to themselves. With Space and Time, this data can be securely stored off-chain and then a ZK proof transmitted onchain. Microsoft and Chainlink Rally Round While the quality of Space and Time’s tech is its primary selling point, it’s also got some quality backers behind it. Most famously, Microsoft has invested in the web3 startup, while Chainlink has also forged close ties, its Co-Founder Sergey Nazarov noting how, “Chainlink provides the connective tissue for data to move securely across systems, and Space and Time brings powerful new compute capabilities that complement that vision.” This compute is going to be dialed up in the coming years as AI agents take over and artificial intelligence permeates everything. Creating dapps that consume vast amounts of computational resources without relying on centralized sources is difficult at present due to the inherent limitations of Layer 1 blockchains. Ethereum’s struggling to scale just to match the demands of ordinary DeFi usage; how’s it meant to handle the exponentially larger burden placed by AI-intensive dapps? It’s here that Space and Time is likely to gain ground, positioning itself as the scaling solution aspiring AI dapp developers can rely on. As the project’s website summarizes, “Smart contracts can use Space and Time to ask data-driven questions about activity on their own chain, other chains, or offchain sources and get back a ZK-proven answer next block.” Apply that formula to an emerging generation of AI-powered applications and it’s easy to see why Microsoft and Chainlink are so bullish.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|LINK|TRADING|ZK,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-05-08 13:44:59

The South American nation is making a bold move into the digital age, announcing plans to launch its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This initiative, dubbed the ‘virtual boliviano’ , is set to be a game-changer, aiming to streamline international payments and bolster the country’s foreign currency reserves. What is Bolivia’s Digital Currency Plan? According to reports, including one from Bitcoin.com, the Central Bank of Bolivia is actively developing a digital version of its national currency. Central Bank President Edwin Rojas Ulo confirmed that the new system, the ‘virtual boliviano’, is slated for a public unveiling on a date of immense national significance: August 6th. This date marks Bolivia’s 200th anniversary of independence, underscoring the symbolic importance of this financial innovation for the nation’s future. The primary drivers behind this Bolivia digital currency project are clear: enhancing the efficiency and reducing the cost of cross-border transactions and helping the country better manage and preserve its valuable foreign currency reserves, particularly US dollars, which are often used for international trade. Why is Bolivia Developing a CBDC Now? The decision to pursue a virtual boliviano isn’t happening in a vacuum. Many countries globally are exploring or implementing CBDCs for various reasons. For Bolivia, specific economic factors likely play a role. A digital boliviano could potentially: Reduce reliance on foreign currencies: By facilitating domestic and potentially regional international trade in bolivianos. Lower transaction costs: Especially for remittances and international business payments, bypassing traditional, often expensive, correspondent banking networks. Increase financial inclusion: Providing access to digital payment systems for citizens who may not have traditional bank accounts. Improve monetary policy control: Giving the Central Bank more direct tools to manage the money supply and track economic activity. Boost payment system efficiency: Offering faster, potentially 24/7 settlement of transactions compared to existing systems. The move aligns with a growing global trend where central banks see CBDCs as a way to modernize their financial infrastructure and maintain control over their monetary systems in an increasingly digital world. How Does the ‘Virtual Boliviano’ Compare to Cryptocurrencies? It’s crucial to understand that the ‘virtual boliviano’, as a Central Bank Digital Currency , is fundamentally different from decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Virtual Boliviano (CBDC) Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin) Issuer Central Bank of Bolivia (Centralized) Decentralized Network (No single issuer) Value Backing Backed by the full faith and credit of the Bolivian government; Pegged to the value of the physical boliviano. Market demand and supply; Not backed by any government or physical asset. Purpose Digital form of national currency for payments, potentially monetary policy. Store of value, medium of exchange (depending on the crypto); Often speculative asset. Control & Regulation Fully controlled and regulated by the Central Bank. Decentralized and generally less regulated (varies by jurisdiction). Privacy Transactions likely traceable by the Central Bank. Pseudonymous or anonymous (varies by crypto). The virtual boliviano will essentially be digital cash issued and controlled by the Central Bank, maintaining the stability and regulatory oversight associated with traditional fiat currency. What are the Challenges and Opportunities for this Digital Currency Launch? While the potential benefits are significant, the successful rollout of the Bolivia CBDC will face several challenges: Technological Infrastructure: Ensuring robust, secure, and accessible technology for issuance, distribution, and usage across the country. Public Adoption: Educating citizens and businesses about the new currency and encouraging its use, especially in areas with limited digital literacy or internet access. Cybersecurity: Protecting the system and users from hacks, fraud, and other digital threats. Privacy Concerns: Addressing public worries about government surveillance of transactions. Impact on Banks: Managing the potential disruption to traditional commercial banks. However, overcoming these challenges presents opportunities. A successful digital currency launch could position Bolivia as a leader in financial innovation in the region, potentially fostering greater economic integration with neighboring countries who are also exploring similar technologies. The collaboration with international organizations and neighboring central banks, as mentioned by President Rojas Ulo, is a positive sign that Bolivia is seeking guidance and potentially interoperability with other systems. What Happens Next? Actionable Insights As the August 6th launch date approaches, stakeholders should watch for several key developments: Implementation Details: How will the ‘virtual boliviano’ be accessed and used? Will there be a mobile app, digital wallets, or integration with existing banking systems? Regulatory Framework: What specific regulations will govern the use of the digital currency? Pilot Programs: Will there be pilot tests before the full rollout? Public Education Campaigns: How will the Central Bank inform and train the public on using the new currency? International Cooperation: Further details on collaborations with international bodies and regional central banks. For businesses involved in international trade with Bolivia, understanding how the virtual boliviano will facilitate payments will be crucial. For citizens, it could mean new, more convenient ways to send and receive money. Conclusion: A New Era for the Boliviano? Bolivia’s plan to launch the ‘virtual boliviano’ on its bicentennial Independence Day is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a strategic move aimed at modernizing its financial system, enhancing control over its economy, and potentially reducing reliance on foreign currencies for international transactions. While the path to widespread adoption and seamless integration will undoubtedly have its hurdles, the initiative signals Bolivia’s commitment to embracing digital innovation in finance. The success of this digital currency launch could pave the way for a new era in how money moves within and beyond Bolivia’s borders, making the virtual boliviano a key development to follow in the evolving global landscape of central bank digital currencies.

According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. “As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.” Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW. Related: Bitcoin mining — Institutions boost investments amid favorable US climate Hut 8 is scaling up operations Genoot said the financial results follow large-scale investments by Hut 8, including upgrading the firm’s application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) fleet and launching the majority-owned subsidiary of Hut 8, American Bitcoin. American Bitcoin was announced at the end of March, with several members of the US President Donald Trump’s family as partners . According to the announcement, the new venture “aims to become the world’s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Early April reports also revealed that American Bitcoin has plans to raise additional capital , including through an initial public offering. In today’s quarterly earnings announcement, Genoot stated: “The streamlined capital allocation framework made possible by the American Bitcoin launch reinforces our ability to scale lower-cost-of-capital businesses such as high-performance computing.“ Related: Browser-based crypto mining in 2025: Still viable or virtually dead?

The dispute centers around the US’s imposition of tariffs on cars and car parts from the EU, which Brussels sees as a “clear violation of international trade rules.” According to a statement from the European Commission, the bloc will initiate the process by formally requesting consultations with the US through the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism. The Commission claims that US tariffs have breached WTO rules, vowing to “reinstate” the legitimacy of multilateral trade agreements. “ It is the unequivocal view of the EU that these [US] tariffs blatantly violate fundamental WTO rules,” the Commission stated. “ The EU’s objective is thus to reaffirm that internationally agreed rules matter, and these cannot be unilaterally disregarded by any WTO member, including the US .” Tariff dispute escalates, EU prepares countermeasures The Trump administration has threatened a 20% reciprocal tariff on all imports from the EU and implemented a 25% tariff on all imported vehicles, directly affecting European automakers. European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said at a press conference Wednesday that the EU could negotiate for a resolution, but it is preparing for “ any scenario .” In parallel with the WTO filing, the Commission has opened a public consultation on a list of US products that could be hit with countermeasures if talks fail. The targeted goods span industrial and agricultural sectors and are valued at €95 billion ($107.4 billion). The bloc drew up a 200-page list of more than 4,800 US products that could face tariffs, including passenger cars, medical devices, chemicals, plastics, and agricultural products. Bourbon and other American spirits have also reappeared on the list, reportedly after pressure from France and Italy, which had earlier lobbied to exclude them to avoid provoking a stronger response from Trump on their own wine exports. According to Eurostat data, European bloc imports of the targeted goods totaled over €109 billion ($123 billion) in 2024. Among them, aircraft accounted for the largest share at more than €13 billion, followed by automobiles at €7 billion. In addition to retaliatory tariffs, it is weighing restrictions on exports of scrap steel and certain chemical products to the US, which could affect roughly €4.4 billion ($5 billion) in trade. As reported in late April by Cryptopolitan, the union temporarily suspended some of its retaliatory measures introduced earlier in April to give diplomatic efforts a chance. That package targets €21 billion ($24.1 billion) worth of US goods with potential 25% tariffs, affecting sectors like agriculture and textiles. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reiterated that the bloc prefers diplomacy. “The EU is ready to find negotiated outcomes with the US. We believe there are good deals to be made for the benefit of consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, ” von der Leyen said in a Thursday statement. EU eases car emission rules to boost domestic industry The European bloc approved an initiative this week that involves loosening emissions regulations to give carmakers flexibility in meeting carbon targets. Under a scheme proposed in March by Commission President von der Leyen, manufacturers will now be able to average vehicle emissions over a three-year period from 2025 to 2027. Previously, companies faced fines if they missed the emissions target in any single year. The change was approved in Strasbourg with a majority of 458 to 101 votes. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) said the reform was a “much-needed flexibility” in meeting CO2 targets in their transition toward zero-emission mobility. “ This is incomprehensible. It is yet another step back in the fight against climate change, ” said Bricmont, who represents Belgium. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The world of crypto derivatives just got more exciting. A significant Bybit BANK listing has hit the platform, bringing new opportunities for those looking to trade the BANK token. Bybit, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, officially announced the addition of the BANK/USDT perpetual contract, complete with the option of up to 50x leverage. This move opens the door for traders to potentially amplify their gains, but it also comes with inherent risks. What Does the Bybit BANK Listing Mean for Traders? The inclusion of the BANK/USDT pair as a perpetual contract on Bybit is a key development for the token’s ecosystem and for traders on the platform. Perpetual contracts are a popular type of derivative in the crypto market, allowing traders to speculate on the price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. Unlike traditional futures contracts, they don’t have an expiry date, making them flexible for both short-term and long-term strategies. The BANK token is associated with the Bond Protocol, a decentralized protocol focused on improving liquidity for digital assets through innovative bonding mechanisms. Listing a token like BANK on a major exchange like Bybit increases its visibility and accessibility, potentially leading to increased trading volume and liquidity for the token. Exploring the BANK Perpetual Contract Opportunity The introduction of the BANK perpetual contract on Bybit allows traders to take long or short positions on the price movement of BANK against USDT. This means you can potentially profit whether you believe the price of BANK will go up or down. Key aspects of this new listing include: Pair: BANK/USDT Contract Type: Perpetual Contract Maximum Leverage: Up to 50x Trading Platform: Bybit’s derivatives trading interface This listing caters to traders interested in altcoins and looking for sophisticated trading instruments beyond simple spot trading. Understanding Crypto Leverage Trading on Bybit Leverage is a powerful tool that allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. With up to 50x leverage available for the BANK/USDT perpetual contract, a trader can open a position worth 50 times their margin. For example, if you use 50x leverage with 100 USDT of your own funds (margin), you can open a position worth 5,000 USDT. This means that a small percentage move in the price of BANK can result in a significant percentage gain (or loss) on your initial margin. Benefits of Leverage: Increased Profit Potential: Amplify gains from small price movements. Capital Efficiency: Control larger positions with less capital. Shorting Opportunities: Profit from falling prices. Risks of Leverage: Amplified Losses: Just as profits are magnified, so are losses. Liquidation Risk: High leverage increases the risk of your position being automatically closed (liquidated) if the market moves against you beyond a certain point. Increased Volatility Exposure: Small market swings can have a large impact on your position value. It is crucial to understand the mechanics of leverage and manage risk effectively, especially when using high leverage levels like 50x. Why Consider Bybit Trading for Perpetual Contracts? Bybit has established itself as a major player in the crypto derivatives market. Traders often choose Bybit for several reasons: Key Features of Bybit: Feature Description User Interface Intuitive and powerful trading platform. Liquidity Generally high liquidity for major pairs, aiming for good liquidity on new listings. Security Robust security measures to protect user funds. Trading Tools Advanced charting, order types, and analytical tools. Customer Support Responsive support for trader inquiries. The addition of the BANK/USDT perpetual contract enhances Bybit’s offering, providing more options for users engaged in Bybit trading strategies. Are Perpetual Contracts Right for You? Trading perpetual contracts, especially with high leverage, is not suitable for everyone. It requires a strong understanding of market dynamics, technical analysis, and rigorous risk management practices. New traders should exercise extreme caution and potentially start with smaller position sizes or lower leverage. Actionable Insights for Trading BANK/USDT on Bybit: Start Small: Don’t commit a large portion of your capital, especially when new to the contract or leverage. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the market moves against your position. Understand Funding Rates: Perpetual contracts involve funding rates paid or received by traders holding positions, which can impact profitability. Stay Informed: Keep up with news and developments related to the BANK token and the broader crypto market. Practice Risk Management: Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Leverage increases potential rewards but also significantly increases risk. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the New Opportunity The BANK perpetual contract listing on Bybit with up to 50x leverage presents a significant opportunity for experienced traders looking to capitalize on the volatility of the BANK token. While the potential for amplified profits through crypto leverage trading is attractive, the risks, particularly liquidation, are substantial. Bybit’s platform offers the necessary tools and liquidity for Bybit trading, but success hinges on careful planning, diligent risk management, and continuous learning. Approach this new listing with a clear strategy and a thorough understanding of the mechanics of perpetual contracts and high leverage.

It’s a new feature that will allow users to hold cryptocurrencies in the form of stablecoins. Currently, Stripe only supports two dollar-denominated stablecoins: $USDC and $USDB. However, Stripe will introduce support for more stablecoins in the future. We’re seeing an increasing adoption of stablecoins as a store of value due to their ease of cross-border movement. After all, stablecoins make transactions easier and faster. Payment companies like Stripe have recognized that crypto is the future, and it’s high time they integrated it into their systems. Keep reading to learn more about Stripe’s new AI-powered features. We’ll also talk about a brand-new crypto, the MIND of Pepe AI agent, and discuss why it could be next in line to benefit from the accelerated AI-crypto movement. More About Stripe’s New Features Stablecoin Financial Accounts will initially be available in 101 countries. Interestingly, it has come just three months after Stripe’s $1.1B acquisition of Bridge, a stablecoin payment platform. Although stablecoins make it easy to store currency without worrying about volatility, it’s difficult to spend that stablecoin at merchants that only accept fiat currency. To solve this, Bridge is in talks with VISA to launch a global card, which can convert your stablecoin balance directly into fiat while making a purchase. You’ll be able to use this card at around 150M merchants that accept VISA cards. Stripe’s New Multi-Currency Account Additionally, Stripe has also launched a multi-currency account, which, as the name suggests, will allow businesses to hold their funds in multiple currencies. As of now, you can keep your money in USD, GBP, and EUR. For instance, if a US business has a store in London, it can accept payments in GBP, hold its own money in GBP, and then pay UK-based suppliers directly in GBP. Earlier, a business had to incur unnecessary forex fees to convert GBP into USD and vice versa while making cross-border payments. Thanks to Stripe’s new multi-currency account, there’s no need to incur any such fees. Stripe has also leveraged AI to develop a world‘s first Payment Foundation Model. This is an AI model built to identify fraudulent transactions. It’s trained on billions of transactions and can capture hundreds of subtle fraud signals that other contemporary detection models aren’t capable of. Stripe’s new updates are a telltale sign that the company is focusing on two major economic trends: stablecoins and artificial intelligence. It’s already one of the world’s fastest-growing companies. In 2024, it processed $1.4T in total payment volume, which was 38% more than the previous year. As AI finds new applications almost every day, it’s the AI-crypto market that will ultimately benefit, especially with billions of dollars of global funds being poured into AI and Web3. If Stripe’s integration of AI features into its payment infrastructure is a sign of rising AI adoption in the fintech sector, the MIND of Pepe AI agent is redefining what’s possible with AI in the crypto niche. Unlike Stripe, however, $MIND’s AI integration offers you a chance to become a pro crypto investor. Read on to find out everything you need to know about this revolutionary project.

SOL Strategies, a Canadian public company focused on Solana ( SOL ) infrastructure, will be the first to list shares through the new system. The move marks a significant step in integrating public capital markets with digital assets. Using Superstate’s infrastructure , companies can issue real, company-authorized equity, rather than synthetic or wrapped tokens, on-chain. These shares are fully transferrable, programmable, and can settle in real-time, according to a note shared with crypto.news. “This is a fundamental shift in capital markets,” said Robert Leshner, CEO of Superstate. “We’re bringing real equities into DeFi—making them transferrable, programmable, and accessible to global investors.” Opening Bell is available to existing public firms and late-stage private companies looking for blockchain-native investor access. The product is built on the same infrastructure that powers Superstate’s earlier tokenized funds, such as USTB and USCC. Superstate is a New York-based fintech company focused on bridging crypto and traditional finance.

CEO Leah Wald emphasized that the strategy reflects the firm’s long-term commitment to blockchain-native infrastructure while preserving access to traditional capital. “We believe these two initiatives serve complementary objectives in our capital markets strategy,” Wald told crypto.news when asked about the company’s Nasdaq endeavors. “A potential Nasdaq crosslist would provide access to a broader range of institutional investors, enhanced liquidity, and greater market visibility through traditional financial channels,” Wald said. “Meanwhile, exploring blockchain-based equity representation through Opening Bell allows us to potentially engage with forward-thinking investors who value innovation in market access and technology.” Wald added that the company is taking a measured approach to align investor experience across both platforms. “We’re taking a careful and compliance-focused approach to this innovation in capital markets access,” she said. Opening Bell aims to enable continuous trading and global participation without the constraints of centralized exchanges or traditional market hours. With this launch, Superstate and SOL Strategies are exploring new ways that public equity can operate in the blockchain age.

Test Transactions Fuel 11% Surge,https://cryptonews.com/news/pi-coin-binance-listing-near-test-transactions-fuel-11-surge/,"Speculation around potential Binance-linked wallet activity may soon boost Pi Coin price prediction , as signs of untapped exchange demand emerge. The rumors have positioned PI as a frontrunner in the “best crypto to buy” conversation, notching an 11% rally in early Thursday trading—though momentum has since cooled. On the back of a hawkish-but-uncertain FOMC meeting and an anticipated US-UK trade agreement, PI finds itself in a fertile environment for growth as market headwinds begin to clear. Is a Binance Listing Imminent? Experts Think so A popular crypto community researcher known as Moon Jeff noted that a Binance-linked Stellar deposit wallet is now active on the Pi mainnet. Is $PI finally coming to Binance? The Binance stellar deposit wallet which is the same as their $PI wallet has started testing transactions on the $PI chain.

While neither Binance nor the Pi Network core team has issued an official statement, traders are interpreting these moves as a potential prelude to a listing. Adding to the buzz, Pi Barter Mall—a prominent X Pi community platform— claimed on May 1 that Pi Network is “in final negotiations” with Binance. PI Coin Price Analysis: Could This Be the Catalyst for a Surge A Binance listing could be the catalyst Pi Coin needs to complete a breakout from the descending channel forming since its mainnet launch rally. PI / USDT 1-day chart, descending channel breakout. Source: TradingView / OKX. Since its initial breakout in mid-April, Pi Coin has been range-bound between $0.55 and $0.80, struggling to break higher. It currently stands 65% below the pattern’s $1 target. This stagnation is largely driven by inflationary pressures. Despite buyer dominance, the MACD line remains in a sidetrend, closely tracking above the signal line. With $151 million in tokens set to unlock in the next 30 days, according to PiScan data , supply continues to outpace demand, limiting bullish momentum. That said, the RSI has moved out of oversold territory near 30, reaching 47, signaling a potential momentum shift as it approaches the neutral line at 50. Looking ahead, May could be pivotal for Pi Coin, with an expected May 14 ecosystem announcement and a showcase at Consensus 2025. We have seen Binance $PI deposit and withdrawal simulation. Now PCT has an announcement on the 14th of this month. Your guess can be as good as mine. Or even better. #PiNetwork pic.twitter.com/korkEVY6mb — MOON JEFF (@CRYPTOAD00) May 8, 2025 Commentators believe these events could spotlight the Pi Network’s ecosystem, shifting its narrative beyond a highly inflationary, speculative asset with limited use case. With these stacking catalysts, Pi Coin could break the $1 target, potentially eying further resistance at $1.40 and $1.70.

The price is now expected to extend its bullish trend toward the significant $2.1K resistance region, which aligns with the 100-day moving average. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart A surge in buying activity near the critical $1.5K support level triggered a strong upward move, propelling Ethereum above the key $1.8K resistance zone, an encouraging bullish signal. This breakout raises the question of whether a fresh bullish phase has begun. However, ETH now faces a substantial resistance region ahead, marked by the $2.1K level, which coincides with the 100-day moving average. As such, the asset is likely to continue its upward trajectory toward this resistance. A temporary consolidation near $2.1K may follow, allowing the market to absorb supply. If buyers manage to breach this level decisively, the next target will likely be the $2.5K mark. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Ethereum confirmed a bullish market structure shift with a breakout above a short-term ascending flag pattern at $1.8K, an area previously established as a significant swing low. This breakout sparked a sharp surge in its price. However, ETH is now approaching the critical $2.1K resistance level, which also aligns with a major prior swing high. In the near term, the price is expected to approach this level with increased buying pressure. Should buyers succeed in pushing above it, the next bullish target would be $2.5K. Conversely, a rejection at this resistance could result in a consolidation phase within the $1.8K–$2.1K range. Sentiment Analysis The Binance liquidation heatmap continues to provide valuable insights into Ethereum’s market structure and potential price trajectory. Following the recent uptrend, a significant cluster of liquidation levels was targeted just above the previous swing high near the critical $1.8K mark. Historically, during periods of recovery or heightened bullish sentiment, markets often gravitate toward such liquidity pockets, as institutional players and smart money exploit trapped sellers by triggering forced liquidations. At present, Ethereum’s price action reflects strengthening momentum, having rebounded decisively from the key $1.5K support and reclaimed several important technical levels. Meanwhile, the heatmap shows a lack of significant liquidity zones ahead, particularly in the path toward the $2.1K region. This absence of nearby sell-side liquidity suggests minimal resistance and supports the likelihood of a continued rally toward the $2.1K threshold.

As a result, the crypto market cap rose nearly 3%, surging past the $3 trillion mark to $3.07. Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded from a low of $95,866 earlier in the session and surged past $98,000 to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 3% over the past 24 hours and is on the brink of claiming $99,000. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is up over 4% in the past 24 hours and has crossed $1,900 to trade around $1,905. Ripple (XRP) also shed recent sluggishness, rising over 2% to $2.18. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) reclaimed $150 after rising over 3% and is currently trading around $151. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR), Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Steady The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates steady between 4.25% and 4.5% after its May meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee highlighted higher inflation and unemployment as key factors behind its decision. The Federal Reserve must strike a delicate balance while contending with market uncertainty caused by President Trump’s tariffs and a slowing economy showing resilience (April payrolls) and weakness (GDP report). Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell ruled out pre-emptive rate cuts, pointing out that inflation was still higher than targeted levels. The Fed Chair stated, “It’s not a situation where we can be preemptive because we actually don’t know what the right responses to the data will be until we see more data.” Powell stated that trade negotiations could have a material impact on the economic outlook. President Trump imposed higher-than-expected tariffs on trading partners, catching even the Federal Reserve off-guard. “It seems to be we’re entering a new phase where the administration is beginning talks with a number of our important trading partners, and that has the potential to change the picture materially — or not. It’s going to be very important how that shakes out.” Powell also denied asking for a meeting with US President Donal Trump or any other US President, stating, “I’ve never asked for a meeting with any president, and I never will. I wouldn’t do that. There’s never a reason for me to ask for a meeting. It’s always been the other way. I don’t think it’s up to a Fed chair to seek a meeting with the president.” Robinhood Developing Blockchain-Based Trading Platform For US Securities Trading platform Robinhood is developing a blockchain-based platform to allow European investors to trade US securities. According to reports, the initiative will be launched in partnership with a digital asset firm, with Arbitrum and Solana under consideration for the collaboration. The move aligns with a broader trend in the financial industry as institutions see an opportunity to cut costs associated with traditional trading infrastructure while benefiting from increased transparency and standardization. Matt Hougan, CEO of Bitwise, stated, “While everyone is focused on Jerome Powell, Robinhood is evaluating whether to use Solana or Arbitrum as the backbone of a new service that will let European retail investors trade US stocks. The long-term outlook for crypto is dependent on crypto-specific fundamentals, not 25bps rate cuts.” Arizona Governor Signs Crypto Law Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has signed a bill that allows the state to keep unclaimed crypto and establish a reserve fund without requiring taxpayer money or state funds. Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law on May 7, allowing the state to claim ownership of unclaimed digital assets if the owner fails to respond or communicate for three years. The bill stipulates that state custodians can stake the unclaimed crypto to earn rewards and airdrops. These rewards and airdrops can be deposited into what Arizona calls a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund. Bill sponsor Jeff Weninger stated, “This law ensures Arizona doesn’t leave value sitting on the table and puts us in a position to lead the country in how we secure, manage, and ultimately benefit from abandoned digital currency. We’ve built a structure that protects property rights, respects ownership, and gives the state tools to account for a new category of value in the economy.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its gains during the ongoing session as it surged past $99,000 as bulls set their sights on shattering the $100,000 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency has traded in positive territory this week despite registering a substantial decline over the weekend, which saw the price drop to a low of $94,252. BTC has broken past the immediate resistance at $97,000 and is set to test $100,000, with analysts believing it could surge past this level. Data from crypto analytics platform Santiment suggests that Bitcoin wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC are positive about further gains and have acquired 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks. Investor interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs has also surged, with BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF registering strong inflows for the last sixteen days, boosting its capital inflows to $4.7 billion, according to ETF Store President Nate Geraci. Analysts believe if BTC can hold current levels, it would represent a structural shift into bullish territory and open the doors for a new all-time high. However, analysts expect a deeper correction if BTC is driven below $95,000. BTC’s realized cap also hit a record high, suggesting sustained investor interest. Analysts believe the consistent increase in the realized cap highlights a continuation of accumulation by long and short-term investors. The increased capital invested in BTC suggests market participants are positioning themselves for a potential price breakout. BTC registered a notable decline on Sunday (April 27), dropping to $93,803. The price recovered on Monday, rising 1.28% to claim $95,000 and settle at $95,002. However, price action turned bearish on Tuesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $95,000 and settling at $94,342. BTC encountered volatility on Wednesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal decline and settled at $94,155. Bullish sentiment returned on Thursday as markets rallied. As a result, BTC rose over 2% to surge past $96,000 and settle at $96,458. The price surged to an intraday high of $98,000 on Friday as bullish sentiment intensified and settled at $96,939, ultimately registering an increase of 0.50%. Source: TradingView BTC lost momentum over the weekend as selling pressure returned. As a result, the price fell 0.98% on Saturday and 1.66% on Sunday, slipping below $95,000 and settling at $94,390. BTC started the current week positively, rising 0.41% on Monday and settling at $94,773. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied over 2%, surging past $96,000 and settling at $96,485. BTC registered a marginal increase on Wednesday despite volatility, claiming $97,000 and settling at $97,013. The price has rallied during the ongoing session as bulls set their sights on $100,000. BTC is up almost 3% and trading above $99,500. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has rallied during the ongoing session as the crucial Pectra upgrade went live on the mainnet, raising staking to a maximum of 2,048 ETH. Pectra is the Ethereum blockchain’s biggest overhaul since 2022. Analysts and market watchers hope it can power a comeback for ETH, especially with the cryptocurrency breaking out of its narrow trading range during the ongoing session. ETH is up nearly 7% during the ongoing session as it looks to push above $2,000. ETH started the previous week on a volatile note, facing considerable selling pressure. However, it registered a marginal increase and moved to $1,799. ETH lost momentum on Tuesday and Wednesday, registering marginal declines and settling at $1,794, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $1,736. Sentiment changed on Thursday as markets rallied. As a result, ETH rose over 2%, surging past $1,800 and settling at $1,838. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH lost momentum on Friday and registered only a marginal increase to $1,842. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment returned over the weekend as ETH dropped 0.40% on Saturday and 1.34% on Sunday to settle at $1,810. ETH started the current week positively, rising almost 1% to $1,820. Price action turned bearish as ETH plunged to an intraday low of $1,752 on Tuesday. However, it rebounded from this level to settle at $1,816, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as ETH fell to $1,812. Markets have surged during the ongoing session following the conclusion of the FOMC meeting. As a result, ETH has rallied to reclaim $1,900. The price is currently up over 7%, with ETH trading around $1,941 as it sets its sights on $2,000.

Here’s Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/donald-trump-backed-world-liberty-financials-wlfi-stablecoins-value-hits-record-highs-in-a-short-time-heres-why/,"Launched by World Liberty Financial (WLFI), an organization with ties to US President Donald Trump, the new stablecoin USD1 has seen its supply explode, rising from under $130 million on April 27 to over $2.1 billion in early May. Trump-Linked USD1 Stablecoin Surpasses $2 Billion Market Cap in a Few Days According to data from CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and DefiLlama, the market cap of USD1 had increased by over $720 million by April 28 and surpassed $2 billion just two days later. Blockchain scanner BscScan, which tracks the Binance Smart Chain where the token was first launched, showed multiple large print runs ranging from $50 million to $99 million during this period. MGX Deal Triggers Massive Supply Surge The dramatic increase in supply appears to be directly linked to the May 1 announcement by Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX that it would invest $2 billion in the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, using USD1. Brandon Kae, research analyst at The Block, said the MGX-Binance deal could explain the latest minting activity. WLFI has not publicly commented on the minting activity or the details of the MGX transaction. USD1 was officially launched in April 2025 after its development was announced by WLFI in March. Like other fiat-linked tokens, this stablecoin is backed by short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, cash reserves, and bank deposits, aiming to provide a transparent and fully collateralized digital dollar infrastructure. As part of its launch, WLFI plans to airdrop a portion of USD1 to token holders, positioning the move as both a promotional effort and a way to test its on-chain distribution capabilities. Despite being a new player, USD1 enters a mature and highly competitive $231 billion stablecoin market that is currently dominated by Tether (USDT) with $149 billion and Circle’s USDC with a market cap of $60 billion. Together, USDT and USDC account for more than 90% of the US dollar stablecoin market. *This is not investment advice.

BREAKING: The launch of Tuttle Capital #XRP ETF is finally set for Wednesday, May 21, 2025! pic.twitter.com/dDL07uSn5o — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 8, 2025 Understanding the Tuttle Capital XRP ETF The Tuttle Capital 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF is designed to provide investors with twice the daily return of XRP’s performance. Unlike traditional ETFs, this leveraged product aims to amplify daily gains and losses by 200%, utilizing financial instruments such as swaps, call options, and direct investments in XRP and related exchange-traded products. This approach caters to experienced traders looking to capitalize on short-term price movements in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Broader Context: Tuttle Capital’s Leveraged Crypto ETFs Tuttle Capital’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) encompasses a suite of ten leveraged crypto ETFs, including those tracking assets like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and memecoins such as TRUMP and MELANIA. The inclusion of XRP in this lineup underscores the asset’s growing prominence and the increasing demand for diversified investment vehicles in the crypto space. Regulatory Outlook for XRP ETFs The SEC’s evolving stance on cryptocurrency-related financial products has been a topic of considerable discussion. Following the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, attention has turned to other digital assets, with XRP being a notable contender. The regulatory body’s decision to delay rulings on several XRP ETF applications , including those from Grayscale and Bitwise, has heightened anticipation for potential approvals soon. Analysts predict a high likelihood of XRP ETF approvals by May 2025, influenced by the ongoing Ripple legal case and shifting regulatory sentiments.

Market Implications and Investor Sentiment The launch of the Tuttle Capital 2X Long XRP Daily Target ETF represents a significant milestone in the maturation of cryptocurrency investment products. As the market continues to evolve, such offerings provide investors with innovative avenues to engage with digital assets, balancing the pursuit of amplified returns with the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading.

On May 7, 2025, the U.S. Federal Reserve held rates at 4.25%—4.50%, yet Bitcoin saw only brief weakness near $96,000 before rebounding, underscoring resilience against monetary-policy headwinds. Bitcoin On-Chain Technical Outlook Realized Capitalization—which sums the USD value of each BTC at its last on-chain movement—hit a record $890 billion, marking its third straight week of new all-time highs, according to CryptoQuant data . Source: X That streak reflects growing capital inflows from both long-term and short-term holders, as wallets between 10 BTC and 10,000 BTC added over 81,000 BTC since late March 2025. CryptoQuant data confirm that this metric often precedes major price moves, as it captures the actual cost basis of coins in circulation rather than speculative market cap figures. In late April, the metric had already climbed to $872.2 billion—up from $800 billion at the start of that month—indicating a sustained accumulation phase. Expert Eyes $500,000 BTC Rally In an X post today, financial commentator Max Keiser has predicted a 410% rally from current levels. According to Keiser, such a rally would take BTC to roughly $500,000—a forecast grounded in the asset’s limited supply and growing adoption. Source: X Keiser’s view joins a chorus of bullish voices but stands out for its scale: while many analysts eye $150,000–$200,000 in the next cycle , Keiser’s half-million price point hinges on continued on-chain strength and macro tailwinds. Max Keiser’s $500,000 projection adds a high-water mark, though execution will depend on sustaining the on-chain and macro momentum observed in early May 2025.

To review, the world's largest crypto first pushed through $100,000 in December as it rallied hard following Donald Trump's November election victory. The price eventually rose above $109,000 in the hours prior to the Trump inauguration on Jan. 20. With the bulls furiously revising their upside price targets higher, things began to crack at that moment. What followed in ensuing weeks was a steady decline, which reached its denouement at just under $75,000 in the panic following Trump's early April announcements of punitive tariffs against U.S. trading partners. The carnage in many altcions was far worse. Solana (SOL) and ether (ETH), for instance, had peak to bottom declines of more than 60%. Prices have quickly reversed since, though, with traditional markets joining crypto in looking past the tariff shock. As with bitcoin, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both currently at higher levels than prior to Trump's Liberation Day. This latest push to above $100,000 appears to be due to a trade deal between the U.S. and UK. It's all about the flows ""The dominant story for bitcoin has changed again,"" wrote Standard Chartered's Geoff Kendrick in a note Thursday morning. ""It is now all about flows. And flows are coming in many forms."" Kendrick took note of the well-reported story about surging inflows into the spot bitcoin ETFs of late. These are sometimes dismissed thanks to a sizable chunk of those flows being offset by basis trades (where hedge funds put on an equal short of bitcoin futures and bank a small yield). Kendrick, however, argued that basis trades have barely moved higher during this latest bout of inflows, suggesting real money is moving into the ETFs. The 13F institutional reporting of not just spot BTC ETF holdings, but also ownership of major corporate bitcoin holder Strategy (MSTR) will begin rolling in one week from now, and Kendrick expects further confirmation of important players boosting their allocations. ""I apologize that my $120,000 second quarter target may be too low,"" concluded Kendrick.",Markets|Breaking News|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-05-08 15:38:56

In a major data breach , sensitive internal data, including a staggering number of Bitcoin addresses associated with their operations and victims, has been leaked online. This event marks another blow against the group, following increasing pressure from global law enforcement agencies. What Exactly Was Leaked in the LockBit Ransomware Breach? According to reports, the breach exposed a wealth of information previously held secret within the LockBit network. The leaked data is extensive and provides an unprecedented look inside the workings of a major ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation. Key components of the leak include: Nearly 60,000 unique Bitcoin addresses . While these addresses themselves don’t automatically identify individuals, they are crucial data points linked to ransom payments and victim interactions. Over 4,400 negotiation messages exchanged between LockBit affiliates and their victims. These messages offer insight into the negotiation tactics, demands, and interactions during a ransomware attack . Detailed internal operational data, such as admin panel information, ransomware configuration details, and logs. Chats between LockBit affiliates, revealing communication patterns, strategies, and potentially identifying information about individuals involved. Crucially, reports indicate that victim private keys for cryptocurrency wallets were not compromised in this breach. The leaked Bitcoin addresses represent transaction points, not the keys required to spend funds from those addresses. Why Are So Many Bitcoin Addresses Significant? The leak of 60,000 Bitcoin addresses is highly significant for several reasons, even without directly identifying victims or attackers: 1. Scale of Operations: This vast number of addresses underscores the sheer scale and reach of LockBit’s operations over time. Each address potentially represents a point of interaction related to a ransom payment or affiliated activity. 2. Financial Tracing: For law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms, these addresses are invaluable. They can be used to map out the flow of funds, identify patterns, potentially link different attacks or affiliates, and trace funds to exchanges or services where they might be cashed out. 3. Understanding Payment Channels: Analyzing the transaction history associated with these addresses can reveal common methods used by LockBit and its affiliates to receive and potentially launder ransom payments. While simply possessing a Bitcoin address doesn’t expose the holder’s identity directly due to the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin, linking these addresses to known LockBit activities provides investigators with concrete leads to pursue through further analysis and cooperation with cryptocurrency platforms. How Does This Data Breach Impact LockBit and Cybersecurity? This data breach is a major blow to the LockBit ransomware group, compounding the pressure they’ve faced recently. Earlier this year, a global law enforcement operation dubbed ‘Operation Cronos’ successfully disrupted LockBit’s infrastructure, seizing control of their website and obtaining internal data. The newly leaked data likely comes from a separate or subsequent compromise, further undermining the group’s stability and trust among its affiliates. The exposure of internal structures, configurations, and affiliate communications makes it harder for the group to operate stealthily and recruit new members. For cybersecurity researchers and law enforcement, this leak is a treasure trove of intelligence, providing deeper insights into the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Analyzing the LockBit Ransomware Leak: Beyond the Addresses While the Bitcoin addresses grab headlines, the leaked internal data is arguably more damaging to LockBit’s operational capability. Details like admin panel configurations and affiliate chats can expose vulnerabilities in their systems, reveal the identities or pseudonyms of key players, and provide blueprints for their attack methodologies. This intelligence can be used to: Develop better detection and prevention methods for LockBit attacks. Identify and track down affiliates globally. Understand the evolution of their ransomware variants and infrastructure. Potentially predict future targets or attack vectors. The leak of victim negotiation messages also offers unique insights into the human element of a ransomware attack , showing how criminals interact with victims, their pricing strategies, and their demands beyond just decryption. Protecting Yourself and Your Assets from Ransomware Attacks The ongoing threat posed by groups like LockBit highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures. While law enforcement and researchers work to dismantle these groups, prevention remains the best defense. Here are actionable insights: Regular Backups: Implement a strong backup strategy, storing backups offline or on a separate, secure network segment. Test your restore process regularly. Patch and Update: Keep all operating systems, software, and firmware updated to patch known vulnerabilities that ransomware often exploits. Security Software: Use reputable antivirus and anti-malware software and keep it updated. Consider advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions for businesses. Email Vigilance: Be extremely cautious of phishing emails, suspicious attachments, and links. Email is a primary vector for delivering ransomware. Strong Authentication: Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible, especially on critical accounts and systems. Network Segmentation: Segment your network to limit the lateral movement of ransomware if one part of your network is compromised. Employee Training: Regularly train employees on cybersecurity best practices and how to recognize phishing attempts and other social engineering tactics. Cryptocurrency Security: If you hold Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, use strong, unique passwords for exchange accounts, enable MFA, and consider using hardware wallets (cold storage) for significant holdings. Be wary of unsolicited messages or software promising easy crypto gains. Conclusion: Another Win in the Fight Against Cybercrime The recent data breach impacting the LockBit ransomware group and exposing nearly 60,000 Bitcoin addresses is a significant development. It provides valuable intelligence for law enforcement and cybersecurity professionals, further disrupting the operations of a major cybercriminal entity already reeling from previous disruptions. While this doesn’t eliminate the threat of ransomware attack s, it represents another crucial step in the ongoing global effort to dismantle these pervasive criminal networks. The incident also serves as a stark reminder of the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures for individuals and organizations alike in safeguarding their data and digital assets.

The latest withdrawal for Binance was for 2.3K ETH. The large-scale withdrawals and accumulation took around 50,000 ETH from exchanges in the past day. Holding ETH in private wallets happened after the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which allows for easier staking of 2,048 ETH in one deposit. ETH exchange reserves remain low at around 8.4M tokens on spot exchanges, and around 10M ETH on derivative markets. Demand from ETF remains uncertain, with days of net inflows and outflows shifting direction without warning. ETH scarcity is not as pressing as that of BTC. The recent rounds of buying follow a capitulation even from some of the earliest ETH holders. Recently, an ICO buyer liquidated more than 7,200 ETH. However, in the past day, sentiment shifted to decisively bullish for smart money, expecting a breakout for ETH after weeks of trading at a lower range. Ethereum traders switch to long positions On derivative markets, ETH traders quickly accumulated larger open positions. Overall open interest on leading centralized markets jumped to over $11B within hours, from recent lows around $9B. ETH traders rebuilt long positions, with significant accumulation in the $1,700 range. | Source: Coinank The recent recovery of ETH above $1,900 allowed trades to open more long positions in the $1,700 range. Trader behavior shows bullish expectations, but may also lead to liquidations in the case of an unexpected market downturn. A risk-taking whale also returned to Hyperliquid. The whale deposited over $14.5M USDC to open a long position on ETH. In the past day, the position was in the green, accruing unrealized profits of $500K to over $600K at one point. The whale kept the position as ETH broke out to $2,001.05, breaking the price tier for the first time since March 10. ETH trading activity picked up during the early US trading hours, as BTC continued on its path to reclaim $100,000. The ETH rally follows the Pectra upgrade, which is expected to become a bullish factor and boost both usage and trading activity on Ethereum. Briefly after the Pectra upgrade, the Ethereum network turned deflationary, as more coins were burned for gas. Increased activity also pushed fees to $0.80, from recent lows of $0.01, with swap prices on DEX rising to over $13. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Analysts say a reversal is possible if key technical and market shifts align in the Dogecoin price movement. While the Dogecoin price fights to reclaim this level, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , the meme sensation trading under $0.0001, is gaining serious traction across crypto circles. The Dogecoin Price Could Hit $1 Again, But Only If This Key Trigger Plays Out The Dogecoin price could be gearing up for a major breakout towards the $1 mark. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade highlighted the emergence of a falling wedge pattern on the Dogecoin/Total Market Cap chart. The last time this pattern appeared, the Dogecoin price rallied by over 300%, underscoring its potential for explosive upside. Strong buyer activity across spot and futures markets further strengthens the Dogecoin price rally case. Data shows cumulative volumes in favor of buyers, with long positions now making up nearly 70% of all futures contracts, indicating that traders expect upward momentum in the Dogecoin price. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Under $0.0001 Smart AI Meme Coin To Hit $1 First FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out as a distinctive meme coin that provides more than just entertainment. This meme coin is centered around an AI-powered ecosystem, setting it up to hit the $1 mark before Dogecoin.

Meanwhile, FloppyX manages complete video production through intelligent automation. The Floppy Agent delivers real-time, actionable market insights, a resource for which even top traders are willing to pay significant amounts. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Holders are consistently ahead of market trends, a disruptive advantage uncommon among altcoins. TRY FLOPPYAI NOW!! Profit-Driven Tokenomics: Deflation and Passive Income Combined FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) tokenomics represent a remarkable model of sustainability and reward. Every transaction incinerates 1% of the total supply, decreasing the circulation. At the same time, holders earn 3% of the tokens redistributed as passive income. In contrast to many meme coins that implement harsh tax mechanisms, FloppyPepe (FPPE) refrains from penalizing traders while encouraging long-term growth. Trust is crucial in the world of altcoins. This is why the platform collaborated with SolidProof to conduct a smart contract audit , guaranteeing that the code is rigorously validated. FloppyPepe (FPPE) To Follow And Surpass The Dogecoin Price’s Growth Although it may come across as overly ambitious to compare to the Dogecoin price’s growth history, it’s evident that the underlying principles are similar. DOGE met a distinct market demand for memes, but FloppyPepe (FPPE) has taken it to another step with AI-driven meme content creation. This positions it as a strong contender for becoming the next leading player in the market. FloppyPepe (FPPE) tokens are presently offered at an exceptionally low presale price, providing early investors with significant potential for gains. Numerous cryptocurrency analysts have identified this meme coin as the next promising crypto presale. Diverse Earning Opportunities For Strategic Crypto Holders Apart from holding tokens, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers multiple avenues for income generation. Token holders can lock their assets to earn passive rewards through staking pools, which helps reduce market sell pressure and improves price stability. With redistribution rewards, community airdrops, and referral bonuses, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem promotes long-term holding, turning it into a true income-generating asset in the growing altcoin market. Don’t Miss Out – FloppyPepe (FPPE) Aims For Massive Gains Exceptional projects, like FloppyPepe (FPPE), can be challenging to discover. Nevertheless, its presale presents investors with a chance to benefit from its low ICO price before it potentially soars. Currently, each FloppyPepe (FPPE ) token is priced at $0.0000002 . Those who take immediate action will also receive an 80% bonus using the code “ FLOPPY80 .” Timely action is essential for making the most of opportunities like this.

The Trump Coin ( TRUMP ) token rose to $12.45, its highest level since May 3, and up by 72% above its lowest level in April. This rebound pushed its market cap to over $2.46 billion. The rally coincided with Bitcoin ( BTC ) crossing the $100,000 milestone and the total crypto market cap climbing 2% to reach $3.2 trillion. TRUMP’s latest upswing also comes as the market anticipates an exclusive dinner event with President Trump at his Virginia golf club. Over 200 of the top TRUMP holders are expected to attend, with the 25 largest holders receiving a VIP tour. The event has sparked backlash from Democrats and ethics watchdogs, who accuse Trump of monetizing his presidency. Several Democrats have pledged to pursue impeachment if they retake the House or Senate in the midterms.

A study by Bloomberg noted that 56% of the leaderboard were foreigners as they used foreign exchanges not allowed in the US, like Binance, OKX, and Bybit. There are chances that the Trump Coin price will continue rising ahead of the dinner as more investors buy it, hoping to take part and meet the president. However, there are substantial risks that may push it to drop before and after the dinner. The most notable risk is that Trump postpones the dinner to a later date, possibly after receiving counsel from his lawyers. Trump has a long history of postponing major issues to later dates. For example, after announcing his Liberation Day tariffs , he postponed most of them for three months. He has also postponed the TikTok ban as he is engineering a sale for the Chinese social media company. The other risk is that many investors will start selling the coin before and after the dinner. Those who miss the dinner invitation will likely sell ahead of it, while some of the buyers will dump after it happens, in a process known as buying the rumor and selling the news.

Recent developments like a U.S.-China trade breakthrough and chart patterns hinting at a bullish breakout to $109,000 have captivated traders worldwide. Yet, while Bitcoin keeps marching upward, savvy investors are eyeing Ruvi , a revolutionary cryptocurrency project expected to deliver life-changing returns. Bitcoin’s Outlook Brightens With Bullish Signals Bitcoin's latest price move has reignited enthusiasm among traders and investors. Here’s why BTC’s trajectory looks promising. U.S.-China Trade Deal Progress The news of progressing U.S.-China trade talks has created a ripple effect across financial markets, with risk assets like Bitcoin seeing notable gains. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's upcoming visit to Switzerland for discussions has fueled optimism, helping BTC climb 3% in just two hours. The broader crypto market, including equities linked to blockchain, has followed suit, reflecting growing investor confidence. Chart Patterns Signal Aggressive Upside Potential BTC’s price movement is mirroring patterns from late 2024 when it broke through resistance levels and surged to its all-time high of $109,000. Key indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the forming golden cross suggest bullish momentum is building. Analysts believe Bitcoin could repeat last year’s rapid ascent if these technical signals play out, raising hopes of breaking the $100,000 threshold once again. While Bitcoin’s bullish momentum paints a promising picture, seasoned investors understand its mature status leaves limited room for exponential gains. This is where Ruvi enters the narrative, offering unparalleled opportunity in a thriving early-stage market. Why Ruvi Steals the Spotlight Ruvi is a revolutionary cryptocurrency project that goes beyond traditional tokenomics. Using a combination of blockchain and artificial intelligence, Ruvi is designed to deliver utility while maximizing returns for investors. Unique Features of Ruvi Limited Supply for Enhanced GrowthRuvi has a fixed token supply of 1.5 billion, ensuring scarcity. This mechanism fuels long-term price appreciation as demand increases with adoption. AI Integration for Real-World SolutionsUnlike speculative cryptocurrencies, Ruvi uses artificial intelligence to deliver practical utility in areas like logistics optimization, fraud detection, and predictive analytics. This unique value proposition sets it apart from hype-driven projects. Presale Bonuses for Early AdoptersInvestors who participate in Ruvi’s ongoing presale can earn attractive bonuses, amplifying their token holdings and portfolio growth potential. Ruvi is not just a cryptocurrency; it’s a disruptive platform designed to redefine blockchain’s role in solving real-world challenges. The Return Potential of Ruvi Despite Bitcoin’s immense value, its yearly gains are unlikely to replicate the explosive multipliers seen in its early days. Ruvi , however, presents a ground-floor opportunity for exponential returns, with analysts forecasting its price to grow from $0.01 to $2–$3 within its first growth phase. Sample Investment Scenarios $500 Investment Tokens Acquired: 50,000 Bonus: 40%, increasing total to 70,000 tokens Projected Value (at $2 per token): $140,000 $3,000 Investment Tokens Acquired: 300,000 Bonus: 80%, bringing total to 540,000 tokens Potential Portfolio Worth (at $3 per token): $1.62 million $10,000 Investment Tokens Acquired: 1,000,000 Bonus: 100%, doubling total to 2,000,000 tokens Forecasted Value (at $3 per token): $6 million These examples demonstrate how early participation in Ruvi can take advantage of low entry points and exponential growth, making it an investor’s dream. Bitcoin vs. Ruvi While Bitcoin remains the flagship cryptocurrency and continues to lead the market’s narrative with its bullish momentum, it has matured significantly in terms of price growth. Moving from $97,200 to $109,000 represents a respectable increase but pales in comparison to the wealth potential Ruvi’s early adopters could realize. Ruvi stands out as a next-generation opportunity, combining real-world utility with unprecedented growth potential, making it ideal for forward-thinking investors seeking transformation rather than incremental gains. Seize the Moment With Ruvi Bitcoin's continued ascent underscores the growing importance of cryptocurrency as an asset class. However, for investors aiming for life-altering returns, Ruvi provides a once-in-a-generation chance to secure financial freedom. Whether investing $500, $3,000, or $10,000, Ruvi’s innovative model ensures early buyers are well-positioned to capitalize on its future success.

Positive net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and declining exchange balances signal strong investor confidence, but the RSI breached 70, which could be a precursor of an incoming correction. What Are the Next Targets? The primary cryptocurrency has been on a serious uptrend lately, with its price currently standing just south of the psychological mark of $100,000. That said, it’s hard to believe that nearly a month ago, it briefly tumbled below $75,000, but after all, such fluctuations are quite common in the crypto world. Bitcoin’s latest rally (and that of the entire digital asset market) was likely fueled by US President Donald Trump, who teased a “major trade deal” with a “respected country.” The price jump also came shortly after the FOMC meeting, during which the US Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged at 4.25%- 4.50%. Bitcoin’s pump toward $100K has sparked fresh optimism among analysts, with many envisioning more room for growth in the short term. X user Rekt Capital thinks the asset needs to stay above $98,700 “for the retest of the week to position itself for a breakout towards $104.5K .” For their part, CRYPTOWZRD predicted that a push beyond $100,000 can trigger further upside pressure to as high as $108,000. “On the other hand, any geopolitical shift with China can cause extreme volatility, where $91,500 will be the main daily support target from a worsening situation,” they warned. Crypto Yoddha and Merlijn The Trader also gave their two cents. The former believes BTC is about to break a long-term range high resistance, which could fuel an ascent towards a new ATH of roughly $140,000. Merlijn The Trader did not set an exact price target, simply forecasting that the asset “is ready to detonate.” He based the potential scenario on the “perfect rising channel” and “momentum building.” The Signals From the Indicators In addition to the bullish forecasts mentioned above, some important metrics hint that BTC’s rally is nowhere near its end. Data compiled by SoSoValue shows that the daily total net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have been positive on most days in the past few weeks. This means that more capital is entering these funds than exiting, signaling growing investor confidence and the asset’s growing appeal as an investment choice. On the other hand, BTC’s exchange netflow has been negative in the last several days, reflecting a shift from centralized platforms towards self-custody methods. This is generally considered a bullish factor since it reduces the immediate selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Still, not all indicators suggest a continued upswing. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), which measures the speed and magnitude of the latest price changes, has surged past 70. Readings above that level are interpreted as bearish since they indicate the asset might have entered overbought territory and could be due for a pullback.

Table of Contents Remittix set to explode with PayFi features Bitcoin price meets resistance at $97,000 Pi Coin crashes after unverified news Conclusion It seemed like Bitcoin (BTC) was on its way to reclaiming $100,000 in early May, especially after the April bull run that drove the Bitcoin price from around $76K to $98K. However, a market correction has caused the BTC price to drop to around $99K despite the surge in institutional purchases. Pi Network (PI) has also moved similarly, falling to around $0.63 after a fake Pi Network news hit the community. Meanwhile, a new Payment Finance (PayFi) token called Remittix has been the shining star in the altcoin market lately, raising over $14.7 million during its presale. Investors are tipping the new altcoin to outperform Ripple’s XRP this year. Let’s find out why. You might also like: Cardano, Dogecoin, and Remittix feature as analysts pick most undervalued cryptos Remittix set to explode with PayFi features The Remittix presale has taken the market by storm after reaching a milestone of over $14.7 million in a few months. The fast presale speed has caused analysts to tip the Remittix presale as the biggest this year, and investors have been purchasing RTX tokens in massive numbers. These investors are backing Remittix early because of its massive potential for short-term and long-term gains. In the short term, the RTX token has seen its value increase across the presale stages, returning decent ROI to the earliest investors. Similarly, long-term investors are optimistic about the project’s promising future, especially after the RTX token gets listed on major exchanges. One major driver for Remittix’s success in the future is its utility in the PayFi space. Currently, the sector is plagued with challenges like the availability of only crypto-to-crypto transactions and no support for traditional banking features. However, Remittix is solving these issues with its solution called the Remittix API, which enables direct crypto-to-fiat transactions. With the Remittix API, users can make direct bank payments using cryptocurrencies and have the recipients get the funds in 30+ fiat currencies. Global businesses can also extend their products and services to crypto enthusiasts who prefer using digital assets for online payments and remittances. This is why some investors believe RTX would outshine established coins like BTC, XRP, and PI over the coming months. Bitcoin price meets resistance at $97,000 The Bitcoin price has been moving between a support level of around $92,000 and a resistance level of around $99,000. Despite the late April breakout that sparked a mini bull run, the current BTC price movements show that a breakout through one of these levels will determine the next direction for BTC. Nonetheless, Bitcoin maxis like Strategy founder, Michael Saylor and other BTC bulls are optimistic that the BTC price is set for bigger gains in the coming months, especially since it’s still holding to its month-on-month gains worth nearly 20%. Pi Coin crashes after unverified news In the past month, PI has seen its trading volume surge by over 30%, indicating investors’ strong demand for the altcoin. However, recent Pi Network news has impacted the PI price, which has now dropped by nearly 4% within the same month. For context, the PI price dropped from over $0.7 to around $0.5 after a fake news article stating that PI had partnered with BNP Paribas to build a Pi Nexus Banking System. However, the PI community remains hopeful that the token would maintain its recent bullish move instead of crashing further. Conclusion While PI and BTC battle the ongoing market correction, Remittix is flying and tipped for bigger gains this year. Buy RTX in presale for $0.0757 before it increases.

The ongoing phase 4 of the project exists at $0.025 per token while selling out 60% of phase’s tokens with substantial market interest. During Phase 5 of the presale MUTM tokens will increase by 20% to reach $0.03 while current holders will immediately profit from this price rise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers investors a 140% return opportunity at $0.06 listing price and envisions reaching a valuation of $3 in 2025 which could transform $1,000 into $120,000. The DeFi platform drives its unstoppable market growth through its lending system together with its well-designed tokenomics framework. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Lending System The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project achieves its position in decentralized finance. Users supply their ETH or DAI tokens to obtain mtTokens which generate interest during the time they are stored. The transferable mtETH tokens together with other defi tokens represent an opportunity for users to gain value while maintaining inter-platform liquidity. Borrowers receive loans through a system where they guarantee safety by providing assets with values higher than the amount they borrow. The approach of having excess collateral serves as a risk mitigation strategy that makes it attractive to more conservative investors. The smart contract audit by Certik will complete soon and the team plans to release the results to social media platforms to enhance trust. The security measures at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) strike the right balance between utility and safety to make it an exceptional crypto market choice. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism Mutuum Finance (MUTM) executes a distribution format that buys and transfers tokens to maintain market demand. Revenue generated through the platform enables Platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens which then get distributed to holders of mtToken. The continuous buying activity through this mechanism drives away selling behavior while creating better conditions for investors who stay invested. The dashboard released by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) features all top 50 token holders who receive additional bonus tokens while they keep their holding positions. The phase 4 price of $0.025 enables buyers to profit by 20% when it reaches $0.03 in phase 5 while delivering a 140% profit assurance at the $0.06 listing. Analysts expect MUTM tokens to reach $3 after initial launch which will create a return on investment equivalent to 11,900% from insignificant starting capital that could generate significant earnings. Tokenomics and Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains rapid growth in its current stage because sixty percent of their tokens have been attracted by users. The presale distribution features planned price increases which reach a peak of $0.06 before the exchange listing. Present buyers can capitalize on a 140% launch profit while analysts project $3 as the future value which would further increase investment returns. The 4 billion token supply allocates 45.5% to presale, supporting liquidity and growth. This calculated distribution fosters ecosystem stability. Certik’s forthcoming audit completion will raise confidence levels which suggests it will attract more investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides investors with an exclusive opportunity to make purchases ahead of the upcoming phase 5 price rise so they should act quickly. Path to Millions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers an exceptional chance for transformation in the market. A single $1,000 dollar investment would purchase 40,000 tokens when priced at $0.025 yet these tokens can reach a value of $2,400 after the upcoming $0.06 listing price occurs. The investment stake will grow to $120,000 if MUTM reaches $3 in 2025 thus creating a transformative financial result for investors. The Phase 4 token sell-out is happening rapidly because of its strong tokenomics backing with secure lending features that create immediate market demand. Investors need to analyze Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in its current phase since the lucrative opportunity will soon reach its conclusion.

The SKALE team says that BITE stands for ‘Blockchain Integrated Threshold Encryption’. It prevents anybody from accessing transaction contents before a block is finalized. The protocol encrypts transactions before they enter the mempool and decrypts them after block finalization. According to the press release shared with Cryptonews , the new protocol benefits decentralized exchanges, non-fungible token ( NFT ) marketplaces, lending protocols, on-chain games, prediction markets, and real-world asset ( RWA ) tokenization platforms. Here, “transaction fairness and privacy are essential for bringing traditional assets onto blockchain networks,” the team says. Meanwhile, MEV is the maximum amount of value miners, validators, and sequencers can extract from transactions waiting for confirmations. They do this by rearranging and reordering these transactions. MEV is a well-known issue in the blockchain world. The announcement notes that MEV extraction has been responsible for over $1.8 billion since 2020. BITE Protocol works below the surface level, with its cryptographic protocol integrating threshold encryption directly into the consensus layer. Therefore, the team says, it creates a level playing field for all blockchain participants through privacy and fairness. Also, it brings blockchain transactions “in line with that of traditional finance transactions, eliminating front-running tactics that have plagued the industry as more traditional institutions enter the space.” That said, per the announcement, the BITE protocol transforms the blockchain space “from one where privileged actors can exploit ordinary users to one where everyone operates with the same information at the same time, bringing blockchain closer to the fairness expected in traditional financial markets while maintaining its decentralized nature.” You might also like Opinion: Is MEV Destroying Blockchain’s Promise of Fairness? First Jump Over 100M Monthly Transactions The SKALE team has recently published its performance data for the month of April. It described the month as “milestone-filled.” Notably, the network has surpassed 100 million transactions in a one-month period for the first time. This record, the team argues, “highlights SKALE’s ability to support high-throughput applications at zero gas cost.” Furthermore, April saw the new Block Explorer 2.2.0 go live on all SKALE Chains. The upgrade boosted UI, token and contract visibility, and chain navigation. SKALE featured in @ournetwork__ L1 report: 250M txs in Q1 9.7M active wallets 46% growth QoQ SKALE is climbing while others stall. The @Dune metrics don’t lie. pic.twitter.com/uUOmOxrcWj — SKALE (@SkaleNetwork) May 7, 2025 Next, three new titles joined the SKALE GameFi ecosystem in April, with zero gas fees. These are Cropbytes , For Loot and Glory , and GoArt Worlds . As for the first quarter, the chain’s onchain metrics increased, “despite uncertain market conditions and a drop in market participants.” SKALE generated nearly 250 million transactions and 9.7 million unique active wallets, it reported. This is a 46% and 33% quarter-over-quarter increase, respectively. Commenting on the latest launch, SKALE Labs CEO and co-founder Jack O’Holleran said that BITE Protocol “represents a watershed moment for blockchain technology.” It could make current L1 blockchain technology obsolete, he argued. “BITE Protocol encrypts consensus and completely removes MEV from blockchain, finally putting an end to front-running, sandwich attacks, time bandit attacks, and other methods of taking value from end users. Rather than applying band-aid solutions to the MEV problem, BITE addresses it at its root through cryptographic guarantees in the consensus layer itself,” O’Holleran said. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, the SKL token trades at $0.0217. It’s up 5% in a day and 15% in a month. It decreased by 10% in a week and by 70% in a year.

The chart covers late-December 2024 through the first week of May 2025 and shows XRP after breaking above a descending trend line that originates at the January 16 high near $3.40. XRP Is ‘Holding Strong’ Dom’s analysis hinges on a trio of anchored Volume-Weighted Average Prices, or VWAPs, which are plotted as adaptive bands on the chart. VWAP represents the average price of an asset over a specified period, weighted by trading volume; in essence it tells traders the level at which the bulk of transactions have occurred. Because large institutional desks often benchmark execution quality against VWAP, the line tends to act as dynamic support or resistance when price retests it. When the anchor point is shifted—from the start of the month, quarter or year, for example—each VWAP offers a lens on how supply-and-demand has evolved over that discrete window. Related Reading: Analyst Says These Factors Will Drive XRP Price To $1,000, But What Does Market Cap Say? The cyan line marks the quarterly anchored VWAP, currently situated at $2.2796, a level that rejected price last week and precipitated the ongoing pullback. The orange line denotes the monthly VWAP, now at $2.0574, and price is hovering just above it; Dom sketches a curved route suggesting that a constructive bounce here could propel XRP back toward the mid-$2.20s. Below, a green ribbon captures the yearly anchored VWAP at $1.8731, flanked by its standard-deviation envelopes at $1.7863 and $1.6996. The April 7 capitulation wick bottomed precisely into that yearly mean before snapping higher, underscoring its significance as a structural foothold. “The VWAPs continue to play perfect, local low was yearly VWAP, rejection last week was off quarterly VWAP and now we are heading to retest the monthly VWAP,” Dom states. The Key Support Zone Horizontal action is equally telling. Since early December the market has ranged between roughly $1.94 and $2.05, a zone highlighted on the chart by a grey rectangle and six green arrows flagging prior deflections. Dom characterises the present retreat as a “healthy retest” of that floor; only a decisive daily close below the band would tilt the bias decisively bearish. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts How High XRP Could Soar If Bitcoin Hits $250,000 Until then, XRP is, in his words, “already strong” relative to other large-capitalisation altcoins that have broken comparable ranges, even though it is temporarily exhibiting weakness versus a surging Bitcoin dominance index. “XRP is still holding its range from Dec (no other large cap is anywhere near that) so it’s already been strong while others just bled. BTC.D is on a terror run and BTC is just dominating the flows,” Dom writes via X. Technicians will focus on two intersecting signposts over the coming sessions: whether bulls can defend the $2.00 handle and whether the monthly VWAP can again flip from resistance to short-term support. A failure at any of those checkpoints opens the door for a deeper voyage toward the yearly VWAP around $1.87, while a successful defense would reinforce the narrative that the larger consolidation remains merely a pause within a still-valid structural up-trend. “I am expecting a reaction off this range low, losing that would be where things turn bearish/murky, but for now, it’s a healthy chart,” Dom concludes. At press time, XRP traded at $2.20.

SHIB Dips 10% More & BlockDAG Confirms Launch Readiness After CertiK’s Nod The biggest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), just flashed a bullish signal after reclaiming key support, with $2,100 now back on the radar. In the memecoin world, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drop continues to weigh heavily, falling another 10% while quiet accumulation hints at a possible rebound. ETH and SHIB are both trying to stabilize their prices, but one project is moved fast ahead. BlockDAG (BDAG) has just cleared its CertiK audit, unlocking the next phase of its roadmap. With $229 million raised and launch prep in motion, BDAG is quickly gaining traction as the top decentralized crypto buyers are watching closely. Pullback Deepens in Shiba Inu Price Drop The Shiba Inu (SHIB) price drop has pushed the token down 10% over the past week, landing near $0.000012. Despite the slide, indicators like the Chaikin Money Flow show rising inflows, hinting at quiet accumulation. A bullish divergence is forming, supported by a negative Network Realized Profit/Loss metric, which suggests holders are reluctant to sell at a loss. Futures traders also lean positive, with funding rates reflecting demand for long positions. While the Shiba Inu price drop is clear, short-term recovery to $0.000014 remains possible if SHIB can break above the 20-day EMA and maintain buying pressure. Support Reclaim Sparks New Ethereum Bullish Signal A recent price rebound has triggered a clear Ethereum (ETH) bullish signal, according to analyst Michaël van de Poppe. ETH briefly dipped below a key support level before swiftly recovering, which he interprets as strong buyer interest. This reclaim of support is seen as a turning point, with $2,100 marked as the next target. The Ethereum bullish signal is built on the idea that retaking lost support often precedes upward momentum. For now, ETH appears to be defending its ground, and the Ethereum bullish signal reflects growing confidence in its near-term outlook. BlockDAG Clears CertiK Audit: Launch & Exchange Announcements Incoming! BlockDAG just hit another major milestone: CertiK has officially approved its audit! As the second security check following Halborn, this double-audit strategy sets BlockDAG apart from most presales. It confirms not just BlockDAG’s robust security, but its full readiness for the open market. But this is more than just a technical win. CertiK’s approval signals a shift from BlockDAG being just a presale project to now getting launch-ready. Buyers looking for strong, verified coins are now watching BlockDAG closely. With CertiK audit now completed, BlockDAG is reportedly preparing to reveal major updates related to its 10 upcoming exchange listings. That next announcement could mark the official countdown to its official launch. Confidence in the project is running high. Batch 28 is still active, holding its special $0.0019 pricing. The batch’s original price is $0.0262, but until May 13, buyers can make the most of the special price. With a $0.05 confirmed listing price, the special price offers a projected ROI of 2,531%. BlockDAG has already sold 19.7 billion BDAG coins and raised $229 million in presale funds. For buyers tracking the top decentralized crypto choices this year, this level of preparation is rare. CertiK’s approval is more than a green light. It’s a signal that this presale is about to flip into open trading. Buyers Respond to What’s Verified Ethereum bullish signal suggests renewed strength, with support reclaim marking a key moment for short-term direction. Shiba Inu price drop highlights hesitation, though some signs point to quiet buildup under the surface. The picture feels unsettled, but not unclear. BlockDAG changes the pace entirely. CertiK’s approval, layered on top of Halborn’s, removes guesswork. Exchange announcements are now in sight, and the presale continues to accelerate. At $0.0019 until May 13, and with 2,531% ROI locked at launch, BDAG is stepping into its next phase. Among the top crypto projects, only a few projects carry this kind of confirmation.

44331739,https://nulltx.com/?p=149204,1746720048,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Cold Wallet’s 4,900% ROI vs Ethereum’s 2025 Fall: Privacy Wins",https://nulltx.com/cold-wallets-4900-roi-vs-ethereums-2025-fall-privacy-wins/,"As Ethereum Shows Seasonal Cracks, Cold Wallet Builds a Future on Privacy, Security, and 4,900% Potential Some of the most significant risks in crypto are not tied to market crashes but to user exposure. Ethereum’s recurring Easter price cycles reveal how market sentiment often outweighs technical progress. Despite strong fundamentals, price movements have historically followed emotional trends. At the same time, privacy remains a weak point across Web3 infrastructure. Cold Wallet enters with a clear contrast. While Ethereum evolves through visible developments and applications, Cold Wallet focuses on the unseen layer that prioritizes security, discretion, and regulatory alignment. For those assessing long-term value in crypto, projects like Cold Wallet ($CWT) offer structural advantages. Rather than responding to headlines, its approach is grounded in solving a real and growing concern: digital privacy. In a visible landscape, Cold Wallet builds where silence is essential. Ethereum’s Easter Price Patterns Offer Short-Term Trading Clues Ethereum has shown a clear pattern of price movement around Easter over the past five years. In 2021, ETH traded at $2,093. By Easter 2022, it had risen to $3,042. A drop followed in 2023 to $1,865, before a strong surge to $3,648 in 2024. This year, however, ETH slipped to $1,575. These shifts aren’t random. Holiday periods, including Easter, often bring lower trading volume and higher speculation, making markets more sensitive to sentiment. The sharp rise in 2024 likely reflected bullish confidence, while the decline in 2025 may signal growing uncertainty. These seasonal movements are worth noting for traders. They shouldn’t be used in isolation, but they can improve timing when paired with broader technical and macro indicators. The Privacy Layer Web3 Forgot, Cold Wallet Builds It from the Ground Up Web3 has made progress in digital assets, finance, and governance, but it has overlooked one essential layer: privacy. As decentralized protocols expanded, security tools failed to keep pace. Most wallets focus on usability and integration, yet still expose personal data through background tracking. Cold Wallet was created to solve this, not as an add-on, but as a foundational shift in how privacy is handled. Unlike typical hot wallets that store IP addresses or log user behavior, Cold Wallet uses zero-knowledge proofs to protect identity and usage data. This approach allows users to confirm ownership, make transfers, and authenticate without revealing who they are or what they do. Privacy is not an optional layer but part of the system’s core design. Cold Wallet runs on the $CWT utility asset, enabling access to its features and governance options. Currently in stage 3 of its crypto presale at $0.00728, with a projected listing price of $0.35171, it presents a strong value case with a potential 4,900% gain based purely on product functionality. Rather than chasing attention, Cold Wallet focuses on completing what Web3 started. It offers a secure infrastructure designed to meet the growing need for digital privacy. Developers, teams, and privacy-conscious users are considering it a critical building block for secure on-chain activity. In a space driven by exposure, Cold Wallet focuses on what matters most: ensuring privacy by design, not as an afterthought. Cold Wallet Prioritizes Infrastructure Price patterns like Ethereum’s seasonal moves may offer short-term signals but often fail to build lasting value. Cold Wallet takes a different approach by focusing on structural gaps that most projects overlook. Instead of following market cycles, it delivers solutions rooted in long-term utility. While many platforms chase attention, Cold Wallet concentrates on core security. It is built to protect user data from the ground up, addressing the growing demand for privacy across Web3. Its focus is not visibility but resilience. In assessing crypto platforms, Cold Wallet stands out with a foundational advantage. It does not rely on hype but offers a secure, private digital interaction infrastructure.

Shiba Inu famously transformed small bets into millions, climbing over 80,000,000% from its launch price to its all-time high, making headlines as one of the biggest gainers in crypto history. Similarly, Pepe followed a similar explosive path, rising quickly to dominate meme coin rankings and rewarding early adopters with massive profits during its peak. However, while both coins saw extraordinary success, their futures now look limited. With Shiba Inu’s market cap sitting in the multi-billion range and Pepe hovering near its top price levels, the potential for similar gains has largely faded, as it becomes difficult to achieve exponential growth at such high valuations. That’s why investors are turning their attention to the next big contender: Pepeto. Still in its presale phase, Pepeto is generating serious buzz with its dramatic backstory, growing community, and real-world utility through the upcoming Pepeto Exchange and zero-fee PepetoSwap. Currently priced at just $0.000000127 per token, Pepeto offers a rare chance to buy in early. With a listing expected soon, excitement is building for what could be the next breakout in the meme coin space. Pepe vs. Pepeto: Rumors, Shiba’s Legacy, and Why Pepeto Could Be the Next Big Thing Rumors are circulating about the intriguing relationship between Pepe and Pepeto, sparking plenty of buzz in the crypto community. According to Pepeto’s backstory, Pepe rose to fame by taking only part of the original concept, claiming four key values: Power, Energy, Precision, and Efficiency, but leaving behind two critical components: Technology and Optimisation. Pepeto now brings the complete package, offering real long-term value and utility that sets it apart from typical meme coins. With plans for the Pepeto Exchange and zero-fee PepetoSwap, Pepeto is positioning itself as a stronger project than both Shiba and Pepe. As speculation builds, many see Pepeto as the next major opportunity, with the potential to match or even surpass the legendary gains of Shiba and Pepe. Presales like Pepeto’s highlight why early entry can be a game-changer, lower price, more potential, and a vision backed by real tools. PEPETO presale enters its final stretch ahead of exchange launch Investors can still secure $PEPETO at the presale rate of $0.000000127 on pepeto.io. Supported payment options include USDT, ETH, BNB, and card via MetaMask or Trust Wallet.

The activity positions Dogecoin back in the best “best crypto to buy” conversation, fuelling an 8% rally in early Thursday trading. On the back of a hawkish-but-uncertain FOMC meeting and an anticipated US-UK trade agreement, DOGE finds itself in a fertile environment for growth as market headwinds begin to clear. Derivatives Market Points to Short-Squeeze Traders seem to be positioning for a major DOGE rally, with Coinalyze data showing a daily long-to-short ratio of 2.27—70% of traders are betting on a price increase. Dogecoin Fear and Greed Index is 57 – Greed pic.twitter.com/pSsqzxnoe2 — Doge Fear and Greed Index (@DogecoinFear) May 8, 2025 The funding rate, which briefly dipped into negative territory, has now returned to neutral and is poised to turn positive. This dynamic suggests that investors are increasingly confident about a bullish Dogecoin price move. If momentum prevails, these shorts might face forced buybacks, driving the price higher. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Could DOGE Hit $1 in May? This renewed bullish sentiment could fuel a move toward the upper resistance of the descending channel that has defined Dogecoin’s multi-month downtrend. DOGE / USDT 1-week price chart, descending channel pattern. Source: TradingView / Binance. This week’s surge may be the first leg of a 30% climb to $0.23, driven by a rebound from a long-term support trendline marking bottoms since mid-2024. Momentum indicators further support this outlook. The MACD is on track for a golden cross, approaching an overtake of the signal line—often signaling a long-term trend shift on such a high time frame. More so, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) follows suit, trending upward toward neutral after an extended stint in bearish territory, signaling building buying pressure. If this momentum holds, a breakout could ignite a push toward $0.44, marking a potential 135% gain from current levels. However, a push to a $1 Dogecoin price seems unlikely in the near term, especially as economic concerns tied to US trade relations cast a shadow over risk assets.

Recent developments, including an $18 million purchase of SOL tokens by SOL Strategies and bullish technical indicators suggesting a rally to $220, have solidified its position as one of crypto’s heavyweights. However, while Solana thrives on institutional interest, Ruvi is carving a path for those aiming to unlock unprecedented gains in this dynamic market. Solana’s Bullish Developments Solana’s recent performance has been fueled by significant milestones, drawing both investor interest and market optimism. Institutional Investment : SOL Strategies, a Toronto-listed asset firm, invested a staggering $18 million into Solana tokens at an average price of $148.96. This move underscores Solana’s growing appeal among institutional players. Bullish Chart Pattern : Technical analysis points to a bull flag pattern , hinting at a potential price rally of up to 53%, placing Solana’s price target at $220 . Ecosystem Growth : Solana boasts a record $13 billion stablecoin market cap , growing by 156% this year. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has surged by 25% in just one month, reaching $7.65 billion . While these achievements affirm Solana’s long-term prospects, the appeal of projects like Ruvi lies in their ability to deliver exponential returns that established cryptos like SOL can no longer match. Why Ruvi Is the Standout Ruvi is an emerging cryptocurrency that blends innovative AI-driven solutions with blockchain technology, positioning itself as a high-growth opportunity in its presale phase. With tokens priced at $0.01 , Ruvi offers a golden chance for early adopters to capitalize on explosive returns. Key features that set Ruvi apart include: Token Scarcity : Ruvi offers a 1.5 billion token supply cap , ensuring greater demand as adoption rises. Ground-Floor Opportunity : Unlike Solana, which has already seen exponential growth, Ruvi provides the chance to enter at the start of an anticipated major uptrend. Comparing Ruvi to Solana in its early days highlights the potential for similar, if not greater, breakthroughs. Ruvi Investment Scenarios Consider these potential investment outcomes to understand Ruvi’s financial power: $500 Investment With $500, investors can acquire 50,000 tokens during the presale. Add a 40% bonus , and the total becomes 70,000 tokens . If Ruvi reaches $2 , this translates to a portfolio worth $140,000 . $3,000 Investment A $3,000 investor secures 300,000 tokens , expanding to 540,000 tokens with an 80% bonus . If Ruvi climbs to $3 per token , the value skyrockets to $1.62 million . $10,000 Investment For high-stakes investors, $10,000 provides 1,000,000 tokens , which double to 2,000,000 tokens with a 100% bonus . When Ruvi reaches $3 , this turns into a staggering $6 million . Solana vs. Ruvi Solana’s growth highlights its undeniable strength in the blockchain space. However, for those seeking life-changing returns, the early-stage advantage of Ruvi cannot be ignored. Investing in Ruvi today mirrors those who entered Solana when it was priced at single digits. Don’t Miss the Opportunity The cryptocurrency market rewards foresight, and Ruvi embodies the next massive wave for early-stage investors. Solana’s impressive metrics position it as a solid long-term player, but Ruvi is where the real opportunity for exponential growth lies. Secure your stake in Ruvi now and harness the future of blockchain innovation. Whether your starting point is $500 , $3,000 , or $10,000 , Ruvi offers the potential to redefine your financial landscape.

The new artificial intelligence agent dubbed Mia, short for ‘Movement in Action’, eyes scalability for the consumer crypto market, with users able to swap, bridge and manage crypto rewards across multiple chains. NEAR.AI powered Mia will be accessible on top blockchain networks including Ethereum, Base, BNB Chain and Arbitrum. Amid web3 adoption , the multichain integration expands the utility of SWEAT’s native token, $SWEAT. Users can now use the token for gas fees, turning physical movement into usable crypto rewards—a move that enhances utility and lowers entry barriers. Mia enables consumers across multiple networks to experience the benefits of the sweat economy.

The addition of the agents to the Sweat Wallet app, the platform said at the time, aimed at incentivizing onboarding of web2 users to web3. Lowering of the entry barrier is key to this goal, and personalized approach gives users this. Mia, beyond accelerating adoption, boosts engagement and ensures retention. “SWEAT is delivering a Web3 x AI use case with true utility, showing how AI and chain abstraction together can provide novel opportunities to everyday people. Mia and $SWEAT Wallet bring the power of NEAR technology to millions of users,” said Illia Polosukhin, chief executive officer and co-founder of NEAR Protocol and NEAR.AI.

As Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 mark, bullish expectations for BTC have also increased. While many analysts expect BTC to reach a new ATH in the near future, Standard Chartered said that the $120,000 Bitcoin target may be too low. Speaking to CNBC, Standard Chartered analyst Geoffrey Kendrick argued that the previous prediction that Bitcoin would reach $120,000 in Q2 may now be too low. At this point, Kendrick said in a statement today that the $120,000 Bitcoin price prediction is currently “very achievable” and that this estimate may be too low a target. Kendirick stated that the market narrative is shifting towards strong capital inflows, especially from institutional investors, and that the rise will now be driven by increased institutional interest and inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs: “I apologize that my Q2 target of $120,000 on Bitcoin may be too low. The bullish narrative for Bitcoin has changed again. It was correlation with risk assets… Now, with the flight from US assets, it has started to be adopted as a strategic asset again. “It's all about flows now.

The rally is being fueled by strong technical support and renewed bullish momentum. The recent pump in Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price is no accident. After testing a key support level at $94,300, the market bounced sharply, validating that zone as a firm base. This bounce coincided with a prior rejection from Fibonacci resistance, highlighting growing strength on the daily time frame. With higher lows forming week after week, the bullish market structure has remained intact, laying the groundwork for the explosive move we’re seeing today. Key technical points: Support confirmed at $94,300: Strong daily candle closes and wick rejections show buyer demand Bullish market structure intact: Higher lows throughout the consolidation period hint at continuation Key resistance ahead at $101,200: Final major level before a potential breakout into new all-time highs BTCUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s recent price behavior shows a textbook bullish reaction at support. The $94,244–$94,300 zone has been tested multiple times, with price wicks dipping below only to be aggressively bought up, a strong indication of demand. These repeated defenses have boosted trader confidence, solidifying the area as a springboard for higher prices. The market responded with a swift expansion, clearing local resistances and pushing toward the $100,000 zone. Adding further strength is the broader weekly structure. Each week during the recent consolidation has formed a higher low, reinforcing the bullish outlook. This consistent structure, paired with sustained closes above the $94,300 region, suggests accumulation and readiness for a breakout. Traders who spotted these bullish cues likely positioned early, fueling the current momentum. You might also like: BingX unveils ChainSpot: A CeDeFi innovation for simpler and safer on-chain trading Now, Bitcoin is testing the $101,200 resistance, arguably the last line of defense for bears before new all-time highs are in play. This level carries historical significance and acts as a key high-timeframe resistance. Given the velocity of this rally, a direct breakout may not occur immediately. Instead, it’s more likely that Bitcoin enters a consolidation phase, forming a new range between $94,300 and $101,200. What to expect in the coming price action Following such a strong rally, rotational consolidation between $94,300 and $101,200 is likely. If bulls maintain control above $94,300 and absorb selling pressure near $101,000, the chances of a breakout into price discovery increase significantly.

With cryptocurrencies in upward mode as Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaimed the $100,000 mark, Uniswap ( UNI ) soared above $5.50. The gains had Uniswap in vertical mode amid a spik in daily volume, with the altcoin seeing more than $214 million traded in the past 24 hours to represent a 70% increase. Bitcoin’s rally to $100,000 could provide new momentum. However, analysts at market intelligence platform Santiment caution that it could be a “double-edged sword.” “On one hand, retail FOMO can add a bit of extra fuel to this rally as major media outlets spam Bitcoin’s 3-month milestone and bring in many new entries to the space. On the other hand, we typically see rallies put on the brakes when there is an overwhelming amount of calls related to ‘higher’ or ‘above’ (in relation to crypto) like we’re seeing now,” Santiment posted on X . Although UNI gains align with the broader market’s uptick catalyzing bullish sentiment, tailwinds include the recent Ethereum Pectra upgrade . Read more: What tariff shock?

The 11 included improvement proposals enhance user experience via smart accounts and delegation, upgrade staking mechanics, and improve layer 2 integration. Unichain ’s rapid rise as a go-to platform for the Uniswap community also supports the bullish case. The Uniswap team announced on May 7 that Pectra’s activation ensures all 7,702 smart wallets on the network are now fully supported on the Uniswap web app. Per DeFiLlama data , Unichain has become one of the top chains in the decentralized exchange ecosystem. Latest data shows the DEX’s volume of $1.99 billion over the past week. The weekly change of +14% outpaces that of Etthereum, Solana and Base among others in the same period. In the past 24 hours, Unichain’s volume stands at over $354 million , accounting for most of the daily volume for Uniswap V4. As well as Unichain’s growth in terms of user accounts and total transactions, the Uniswap platform itself is seeing a notable flip. The total value locked on Uniswap is around $4.27 billion.

While the latest XRP price prediction is making bold claims of a breakout to $3, Dogecoin flirts with short-term resistance amid ETF bullish hype. Meanwhile, a new contender, Remittix has entered the conversation. This utility-driven token is quickly gaining attention for its real-world use case, which is revolutionizing crypto-to-fiat payment for everyone. Remittix launches a PayFi revolution set to improve crypto-to-fiat worldwide Remittix’s fundamental ethos is to make the process of sending remittances easier than ever before. This real-world potential is indispensable as the traditional remittance services take days to process at a very steep cost. Remittix is changing the narrative by introducing the latest blockchain technology that comes with fast transactions and complete transparency. Importantly, every transaction made on the Remittix platform is processed on the same day and is slippage-free. This makes the crypto platform offer the lowest transaction cost in the market as it charges a flat fee with no extra costs for wires. Businesses are the major beneficiaries of Remittix’s PayFi solutions. Through its Pay API, merchants can accept crypto payments and settle in fiat, cutting costs and expanding reach. With its flat‑fee model and 40+ supported coins, Remittix is on a solid path to chipping away at the $5‑trillion‑a‑day SWIFT market. Like most innovative projects, the $RTX governance token powers the platform’s ecosystem. Its smart contract has passed rigorous Blockchain audits by SolidProof and BlockSAFU. Also, the team locks RTX’s liquidity pool and team tokens for three years to prevent any rug pull scams and selling pressure. XRP price prediction : Bulls target $3 after market reports hint at a major institutional move The XRP price momentum is waning, as the digital asset slips below key technical levels amid growing macroeconomic pressures and shifting sentiment. Despite this market sentiment, the XRP price prediction is favorable, as market experts suggest that its current downturn is a result of profit-taking actions from the smart money. Source: CoinMarketCap CoinGlass reports that, in early April alone, more than $1 billion worth of XRP positions were liquidated at an average price of $2.10. Investors’ momentum is still optimistic, especially after XRP’s Q1 2025 Markets Report was released in May. In the report, the company announced it will sunset its existing quarterly format after Q2, citing the need to offer deeper institutional insights. The report noted that transparency, originally a strength, had at times been used against Ripple, especially during confrontations with former SEC Ripple leadership. This institutional move is arousing a $3 XRP price prediction, especially as whales accumulate more than 900 million XRP in April. Dogecoin ETF update: Investors’ sentiment changes as breakout looms for DOGE With the Dogecoin price consolidating since the beginning of the year, its future now hinges on the approval of a Dogecoin ETF. The likelihood that a Dogecoin spot ETF will soon materialize is rapidly increasing, especially with the appointment of Chair Paul Atkins . Source: Polymarkets Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, reports that the chances of a Dogecoin ETF approval have increased to 70% in April before correcting to its current point. The increasing enthusiasm coincides with the SEC’s recognition of Dogecoin ETF filings and a stronger pro-crypto U.S. Congress. Conclusion While the XRP price prediction and the Dogecoin ETF update hint at their growing institutional interest, Remittix is positioning itself as a hub for global payment solutions. Remittix coins are becoming viral in the crypto market, as the tokens are selling out at bargain rates. Each token sells for $0.0757, with high potential for presale profits.

Institutional players and global participants are increasingly backing altcoins that go beyond hype—demanding scalable infrastructure and tangible problem-solving capabilities. Avalanche (AVAX) has risen to this challenge with a GameFi and enterprise push, while Tezos (XTZ) is leveraging self-amending governance and energy-efficient smart contract design to draw new partnerships and technical adoption. Qubetics ($TICS), however, is distinguishing itself with a much-needed real-world solution: a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet designed for seamless interoperability. Avalanche recently drew attention with a 380% rise in large-holder netflows, signaling serious institutional accumulation. The upcoming launch of MapleStory N, a blockchain-based game built on the Avalanche network, further positions AVAX as a bridge between the worlds of gaming and finance. Meanwhile, Tezos continues to expand its EVM-compatible roll-up platform, Etherlink, which has contributed to rising transaction revenue and developer activity. This momentum, alongside its secure proof-of-stake foundation and smart contract formal verification, is cementing Tezos as a low-volatility, high-security platform for dApps and financial tooling. Qubetics brings to market the type of blockchain infrastructure that legacy altcoins were never built to handle—solving accessibility, scalability, and network fragmentation. Its ongoing presale and multi-layered utility place it firmly among the best altcoins to invest in now for both early adopters and strategic participants looking for functional value and upside. Qubetics ($TICS): The Multi-Chain Wallet Driving Real Blockchain Integration Qubetics is introducing a secure, non-custodial multi-chain wallet that simplifies access to multiple blockchain networks without sacrificing control or privacy. This wallet lets users store, manage, and transact with assets across different chains—Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and more—all from a unified interface. For freelancers working with international clients, professionals managing Web3 assets, or enterprises building cross-chain tools, this eliminates the hassle of switching wallets and bridging funds. Built with enterprise-grade encryption and on-chain validation, the Qubetics wallet is more than just a tool—it’s a gateway for universal blockchain usage. Users maintain full custody of their assets while leveraging automation and integration features that optimize productivity, reduce fees, and enable real-time settlements across blockchain networks. This core product alone places Qubetics among the best altcoins to invest in now , as demand for cross-chain, user-controlled infrastructure grows. Qubetics Presale Update and ROI Opportunities The crypto presale for Qubetics is in its 33rd stage. Over 511 million tokens have already been acquired by more than 25,900 backers, and the project has raised $16.7 million to date. The current token price sits at $0.2302, offering new participants a meaningful entry into a feature-rich ecosystem. Stage 1 adopters—who joined at $0.01—are currently seeing a 2,202% gain. Yet even at Stage 33, early backers can capitalize on significant ROI potential. Based on current projections: A $TICS token price of $1 equates to a 334% ROI At $5, the return is 2,071% At $6, the ROI reaches 2,505% A $10 target delivers a 4,243% return A $15 post-mainnet milestone results in a 6,414% ROI These figures have drawn significant attention to Qubetics from early buyers looking for both utility and upside. With strategic partners, toolkits for developers, and a growing user base, the presale window offers an opportunity that continues to define Qubetics as the best altcoin to invest in now . Avalanche (AVAX): GameFi Innovation Meets Institutional Strength Avalanche is quickly becoming one of the most dynamic blockchain ecosystems for both gaming and enterprise adoption. Currently priced around $20.94, AVAX is seeing a resurgence in accumulation—driven largely by a 380% spike in large-holder netflows. This signals renewed confidence from market participants aligned with long-term performance. The forthcoming launch of MapleStory N, a blockchain-native version of the popular game, is a strategic leap into GameFi. It highlights Avalanche’s strength in high-throughput performance, quick finality, and composable smart contract support. The network handles transaction volumes at a scale fit for both entertainment and institutional-grade use cases. Avalanche balances retail appeal with a robust ecosystem of scalable subnets, institutional integrations, and developer incentives. Its dual-purpose strategy makes it one of the best altcoins to invest in now, especially for participants seeking a balance between speculative growth and infrastructure use. Tezos (XTZ): A Secure, Energy-Efficient Smart Contract Platform with Built-In Governance Tezos remains a leading protocol in secure, governance-driven blockchain design. As of May 2025, XTZ trades at approximately $0.567, with a market cap of $590 million. Its standout feature—on-chain governance—allows community participants to propose and approve protocol upgrades without needing forks, making it adaptable, resilient, and community-governed. In late 2024, Tezos’s network activity saw a 30.4% increase in transaction fee revenue, attributed to Etherlink, its first EVM-compatible roll-up. Etherlink recorded a 44% quarter-over-quarter rise in adoption, providing Tezos with a bridge to the Ethereum developer community while preserving its core security principles. Tezos supports smart contracts using Michelson, a formally verifiable language that adds a layer of mathematical certainty for secure deployment. This makes the network attractive to industries where security, compliance, and low-energy requirements matter most—legal tech, government, and enterprise finance. As it expands its presence in DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, Tezos is once again being recognized as one of the best altcoins to invest in now, especially for those prioritizing governance, sustainability, and risk-mitigated innovation. Final Thoughts Speculative buzz alone no longer moves markets. As 2025 unfolds, backers are prioritizing ecosystems with real utility, mature development environments, and use cases aligned with both retail and enterprise adoption. Qubetics, Avalanche, and Tezos exemplify this shift. Qubetics stands out with a ready-to-use multi-chain wallet and ecosystem-wide tools aimed at simplifying blockchain for everyday and institutional users. Avalanche is leveraging its speed and scalability to onboard the next generation of gamers and financial platforms. Tezos continues to provide unmatched protocol flexibility and energy efficiency for mission-critical smart contracts. Each of these three altcoins offers something uniquely valuable—and each one stands as a strong example of the best altcoins to invest in now . Timing matters, and with presales active, partnerships growing, and on-chain performance surging, the opportunity to participate early still exists.

Pepe ( PEPE ) token jumped to a high of $0.000010, its highest level since February 18, and 65% above its lowest level this year. The 24-hour volume soared by 140% to $1.20 billion, higher than other popular meme coins like Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), Bonk ( BONK ), and Floki ( FLOKI ). Its futures open interest also soared to $475 million, the highest point since January. Pepe Coin price jumped as the crypto fear and greed index moved to the greed zone, following Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) move above $100,000. Most altcoins continued rising, with Bitcoin moving above the psychological point at $2,000. You might also like: Trump Coin price prediction: Will it rise or fall after the exclusive dinner? The rally happened after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged and embraced a wait-and-see approach. Also, it rallied after Coinbase acquired Deribit , one of the biggest players in the futures and options industry. Internally, there are signs that Pepe investors are not dumping their tokens as exchange balances have dropped. All tokens on exchanges dropped slightly in the last seven days and currently stand at 255.16 trillion, down from 255.2 trillion last week. Pepe price technical analysis Pepe price chart | Source: crypto.news The coin’s surge also happened for technical analysis. As we wrote here and here , Pepe Coin formed a giant falling wedge pattern in the first quarter. This pattern comprises two descending and converging trendlines and often leads to a bullish breakout. Most recently, Pepe price formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.0000057. It has now jumped above the neckline at $0.0000095. The distance between the double-bottom and the neckline is about 62%. Measuring the same distance from the neckline brings the Pepr Coin price target at $0.00001545, up by 55% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.0000759 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

This made crypto assets more appealing to investors. As a result, the market is rising today, with Bitcoin hitting $100,000. Ethereum is also going up, but experts believe STHs might soon sell to take profits. This is backed by a decline in key on-chain activity, which could lead to a price reversal soon. ETH’s MVRV Ratio to Trigger Reversal In the past 24 hours, the crypto market has seen a strong surge. Bitcoin has climbed back to the $100,000 level, which it last reached in February. Ethereum also rose above $2,000, recovering from losses linked to earlier tensions between the U.S. and China. According to Coinglass, more than $175 million worth of Ethereum positions were liquidated during this period. Of that, buyers closed $27 million in positions, while sellers saw $148 million in forced liquidations. The rise in Ethereum’s price also led to an 18% jump in open interest, now totaling $24.8 billion. Also read: Altcoin Season is Here: XRP, ADA, SUI, ETH Rally Ethereum’s recent gains are partly due to increased interest from large investors since April. CoinShares reported two straight weeks of money flowing into Ether-based ETFs. Some also believe the Pectra upgrade, launched on May 7, helped boost the price. The current buying demand in the crypto market might not last long. Data from IntoTheBlock shows the MVRV ratio has dropped to 0.888, meaning many investors are selling at a loss even though prices are rising. This kind of panic selling could encourage more selling and lead to a downturn. Still, some major players (“smart money”) are buying. Wintermute made large purchases in the last 24 hours, possibly to benefit from the surge and earn market-making fees. Similarly, Lookonchain reported that Abraxas Capital withdrew over 41,000 ETH (worth $75M) from Binance and Kraken. Despite the price rise, nearly half of all Ethereum wallets, about 65.5 million, are still holding at a loss. What’s Next for ETH Price? Sellers are having a hard time pushing Ether below its moving averages, which suggests there’s not much pressure to sell during the upward rally. Buyers are holding the price around immediate resistance line. As of writing, ETH price trades at $2,048, surging over 13% in the last 24 hours. Buyers may use this as a chance to break through the resistance at $2,109. If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could gain momentum and head above the $2,500 level. There’s a smaller hurdle at the immediate 23.6% Fib level, but it’s expected to be overcome. On the flip side, sellers will likely try to drag the price below the moving averages. If that happens, ETH could drop to $1,734. Buyers will probably step in there, but if they can’t hold that level, the price might fall further to key support at $1,542. As the RSI trades within the overbought region at level 78, ETH price is poised for a short-term downward correction.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-08 17:25:57

With SHIB’s growth curve slowing and meme coin fatigue setting in, attention is rapidly shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently in Phase 4 in presale, Mutuum Finance has already pulled in over $7.8 million from more than 9,600 investors. The token is currently priced at $0.025, but that’s set to increase by 20% to $0.03 once Phase 5 begins. With over 60% of Phase 4 already sold out, this is the ideal moment for investors to get in before prices climb. As the next bull run approaches, smart money is betting big on function over fame. Mutuum Finance: The Next Big Thing in DeFi Mutuum Finance presents itself as an outstanding innovator in decentralized finance through its dual-lending model that has impressed the entire crypto community. The project stands out for its combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending models through its new uniquely connected system. The project has gained substantial investor trust as it already surpasses 9,600 investors together with its $7.8 million presale total. Despite the $0.025 token price in Phase 4 it is expected to rise to $0.03 in the upcoming phase as demand intensifies before the supply dwindles. Mutuum Finance has introduced a dynamic dashboard featuring real-time leaderboards of the 50 highest token holders and provides additional MUTM tokens for leaders. The additional MUTM token rewards for board leaders create friendly competition which motivates investors to spend more time in the platform. This gamified aspect contributes to the development of an extremely interactive environment. How Mutuum Finance’s Dual Lending System Works At the heart of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its hybrid lending system. Through the P2C model, users can earn passive income by lending USDT to smart-contract-powered liquidity pools that handle everything automatically. On the other hand, the P2P model eliminates third-party interference entirely giving users the freedom to borrow or lend directly ensuring more privacy, flexibility, and control. This blend of two systems strikes a strong balance between decentralization and efficiency, offering something that appeals to both cautious and adventurous DeFi users alike. The $100,000 Giveaway and Growing Community Mutuum Finance isn’t stopping at just building tech, it’s also building a thriving user base. To that end, the team has launched a $100,000 token giveaway, in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. There’s also a referral program designed to reward users for bringing others into the ecosystem, with incentives for individuals and organizations alike. Holders of MUTM tokens gain access to exclusive updates and features, helping them stay closely connected to the platform’s progress and direction. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) may provide marginal gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the actual breakout sweetheart for 2025. With Phase 4 of the presale already sold out 60%, there is no time to wait. The rates will increase by 20% in Phase 5, and experts are projecting humongous returns for early birds. More than $7.8 million has already flowed into this next-gen DeFi project, and with a $100,000 giveaway and increasing community incentives, the momentum keeps building. Act fast before the price rises, Mutuum Finance could be your chance to 10x your investment.

If so, the analyst indicated that the altcoin could witness a 2017-like rally, which would send its price to double digits. XRP Price To Reach $10 If History Repeats Itself In a TradingView post, ArShevelev predicted that the XRP price could reach as high as $10 if history repeats itself. He remarked that the current XRP chart screams “déjà vu” with the altcoin’s price action mirroring the 2014 to 2018 cycle. The analyst noted that XRP broke out from its 2014 all-time high (ATH) in 2017, leading to a massive rally. Related Reading: XRP Price Is Eyeing Another Breakout To $4: Analyst Says Watch This Level A similar setup is playing out for the XRP price, but with a twist. ArShevelev stated that XRP is struggling to break through the 2018 ATH resistance zone around $3.31, which he claimed reminded him of the breakout consolidation phase in 2017. The analyst added that this consolidation has historically led to a breakout, and the chart hints at a potential repeat. He affirmed that the price could witness a parabolic move if it breaks out soon, potentially targeting much higher levels. However, the analyst warned that the current resistance is a tough hurdle, and XRP might pull back to lower supports if it fails. ArShevelev also provided key levels to watch out for. He highlighted $3.31 as the major resistance while $1.643 is the major support. The breakdown risk is $0.650, meaning the XRP price could still drop to last year’s lows. The analyst admitted that he isn’t fully convinced about the setup but considers it intriguing. He added that this could be XRP’s moment to shine. The Altcoin Needs To Break Out Of Its Current Range Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted the need for the XRP price to break out of its current range. In an X post, he stated that the key levels to watch are $2 and $2.26. The analyst added that a decisive close outside this range could set the tone for the next major trend. Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Above ‘Magic Line’ With Bullish Continuation Toward $3 Martinez looks to be favoring a downtrend for the altcoin’s price in the short term. In another post, he stated that XRP could be due for a retracement, with the TD Sequential flashing a sell signal on the 3-day chart. Crypto analyst CasiTrades also didn’t rule out a possible correction for the XRP price. However, she claimed the altcoin could bounce off key supports to new highs, noting that momentum was building. She revealed that the RSI is showing signs of selling exhaustion on the lower timeframes, and the price action is beginning to compress. This often signals a bigger move is on the horizon. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.17, up almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This breakout could mark the beginning of a major rally toward $2,820, a 40% upside potential if momentum holds. After weeks of range-bound consolidation, Ethereum ( ETH ) has finally broken through the highly contested $2,000 resistance. This level has acted as a psychological ceiling for several months, and reclaiming it marks a significant shift in short-term market structure. The move was triggered by a strong reaction at the $1,800 support zone, and now all eyes are on the next major resistance level at $2,820. Key technical points Support Bounce: Ethereum surged off the $1,800 support, igniting a fresh bullish wave. Break Above Resistance: ETH reclaimed the key $2,000 level, confirming strength in price action. Next Target: The next major resistance sits at $2,820 — roughly 40% above current levels. ETHUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Ethereum’s breakout above $2,000 is both a technical and psychological milestone. It represents a reclaim of control by bulls after weeks of uncertainty and sideways movement. More importantly, the move was supported by a strong foundation: multiple higher lows formed during consolidation, showing growing demand and buyer interest at increasingly higher levels. The $1,800 support held firm and acted as a springboard for this rally, with price slicing through $2,000 on strong momentum. To sustain this breakout, Ethereum needs to secure daily candle closes above the $2,000 level. So far, the current structure shows a clear bullish trend, a higher low, followed by a higher high, and now an attempt to stabilize above resistance. If this level is converted into solid support, it could act as a launchpad for price to accelerate toward the $2,820 resistance, the next major technical barrier on the chart. This level has acted as resistance in previous cycles and could be a critical test for bulls if reached.

If price pulls back and forms another higher low above the $1,800–$1,900 range, it would reinforce the ongoing bullish structure. Such a move would likely reset momentum and attract fresh buyers, giving Ethereum a stronger foundation for a future breakout. Consolidation near $2,000 should be expected, and even welcomed, as it can provide the market with structure and continuation strength. What to expect in the coming price action Ethereum’s ability to hold above $2,000 in the coming days will be critical. If bulls manage multiple daily closes above this level, the path toward $2,820 becomes increasingly probable. Even a minor pullback forming a higher low would maintain the bullish bias, suggesting that Ethereum is positioning itself for a broader upside continuation in the weeks ahead.

Among the various tokens trying to make their mark, Unstaked stands apart by offering tangible value beyond speculation. While projects like Hedera and Stellar continue to evolve through strategic partnerships and technical growth, Unstaked is focused on building real utility by integrating AI-powered community engagement. As the Unstaked presale attracts growing support and analysts forecast a promising future, it is quickly becoming a project to watch, especially when considering the long-term potential of tokens with practical, real-world applications. With this in mind, the Unstaked model presents a promising alternative for investors seeking more than just speculative gains. Unstaked: Ending the Meme Token Burnout with Real Utility Most meme and altcoins thrive on short-lived hype before fading into obscurity. However, Unstaked is shifting this pattern by offering more than just a speculative token. By tying the value of the $UNSD token to real, on-chain AI engagement, Unstaked ensures that its community-building efforts are both organic and sustainable. With AI agents that grow communities through actual interaction and contribution, $UNSD offers lasting utility that extends well beyond typical meme coin trends. Furthermore, analysts are now predicting a $5 target for $UNSD, fueled by its unique model and strong early performance. In just 24 hours, the presale raised $1 million, attracting early supporters eager to capitalize on the token’s long-term potential. As of now, the presale is in stage 4, with $2 million raised in only a few weeks. The current price stands at $0.007102, but the token will launch at $0.1819, giving presale participants a significant upside. For investors looking for the best crypto to invest in now, Unstaked stands out by aligning value creation with real utility, positioning itself as a token that delivers more than just speculation. With these attributes, Unstaked is setting the foundation for a meaningful, enduring crypto project that could shape the future of meme tokens and decentralized communities alike. Hedera (HBDR) Forecast: Ecosystem Growth Fuel Optimism Hedera’s recent surge in the stablecoin sector has garnered attention, with analysts projecting a potential rise to $1.00. This optimism is bolstered by strategic partnerships with major corporations such as Tata, Boeing, and Mondelez, which have joined Hedera’s governing council. These alliances enhance Hedera’s credibility and facilitate broader adoption of its blockchain solutions. Moreover, the network’s ecosystem is also experiencing significant growth. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in Hedera has surged to over $169 million, driven by platforms like SaucerSwap and Stader. SaucerSwap V2, in particular, has seen increased transaction volumes, indicating a growing DeFi presence on the network. Technological advancements further support the positive outlook. Hedera’s upcoming Verifiable Compute initiative aims to ensure the integrity of AI-driven systems, while a blockchain-based grant management platform is set to launch in Q2 2025, promoting transparency and community-driven funding. Stellar (XLM) Price Rise: A Technical Perspective Stellar (XLM) has recently demonstrated a bullish breakout from a falling wedge pattern, a technical formation often indicative of a potential upward price movement. Following this breakout, the price has retested the $0.2500–$0.2700 accumulation zone, forming higher lows, a signal that buyers may be regaining control. Technical analysts have set price targets at $0.4594, $0.5601, and $0.6719, aligning with historical resistance levels and Fibonacci extensions. In addition, Stellar’s market activity has seen a 10% increase, accompanied by four consecutive price rises, suggesting the formation of a golden cross, a long-term bullish indicator. This uptick in trading volume and price momentum reflects growing investor optimism. However, it’s important to note that while these technical indicators point towards a potential price rise, market conditions can be volatile. Therefore, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Unstaked: A New Path for Meme Tokens As many projects rely on hype and short-term trends, Unstaked offers a fresh approach by tying its value to real, on-chain AI engagement. Unlike other tokens like Hedera and Stellar that focus primarily on partnerships and technical growth, Unstaked is focused on building lasting utility. With a strong presale performance and analysts projecting significant growth, it’s clear that the project’s focus on community-driven development and sustainability sets it apart. For investors looking beyond mere speculation, Unstaked offers a promising and practical path forward, making it a project with potential for long-term value.

This is the central bank’s first rate cut of the year and comes amid growing concerns about global trade tensions triggered by new US tariffs. The move from the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) marks the fourth rate cut since August 2024. It also warned that the UK economy would slow by a further 0.3% over the next three years in addition to dramatic cuts to its forecasts made earlier this year. In a setback for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the MPC warned that a combination of uncertainty surrounding the impact of US trade policy and clouds hanging over the UK economy meant economic growth would be almost stagnant for the rest of the year. Governor Andrew Bailey said the global outlook had become more uncertain. He noted that the past couple of weeks had shown how volatile the global economy could be, which was why the Bank of England took a cautious and phased approach. The MPC was at loggerheads. Five of the nine officials voted in favor of the 0.25-point cut. Two preferred a more aggressive 0.5% reduction. The two others voted to keep the rate unchanged. This three-way division is unusual and reflects the extent of disagreement within the Bank. Economists Swati Dhingra and external member Alan Taylor lobbied to cut rates more deeply because demand is slackening. Chief Economists Huw Pill and Catherine Mann also expressed worry that inflation remains too high and favored keeping rates on hold. The final vote, 5 to 4 in favor of a smaller cut, demonstrates how closely the decision was divided. Tariffs trigger global shock, forcing BoE to act The Bank of England cut came after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new import tariffs from major trade partners, including many of the country’s allies like the UK and the EU. The move spurred a sell-off in global markets and revived trade war fears. The Bank warned that the new tariffs would contract the UK economy. While the immediate effect on British exports is expected to be modest, officials are more concerned about the broader disruption to global trade that could weigh heavily on growth. Two-thirds of the projected growth drag comes from the global shock, not direct UK-US trade. The IMF has already cut its estimate for global growth. The BoE piled in behind it, slashing its 2026 UK growth forecast from 1.5% to 1.25%. In the short term, it sees GDP growing 1% this year, a tad above its previous forecast, but warns that recent growth seems “erratic.” BoE signals cooling inflation but warns of lingering risks The rate cut also signals that inflationary pressures may be easing. The Bank of England now expects inflation to peak at 3.5% this year, slightly below earlier forecasts, and projects that its 2% target could be reached by spring 2027, nine months ahead of schedule. This change of perspective indicates declining energy prices and slowing pay growth. Wage growth, now in the vicinity of 6%, should slow to 3.75% by year-end. However, risks to the economy persist. The Bank has also designed two new alternative economic scenarios . In the first, prolonged policy uncertainty prompts consumers and businesses to hold back on spending and investment, further weakening growth. In the second, stagnant labor productivity combined with persistent wages could trigger a wage-price spiral, pushing inflation higher and making additional rate cuts far more precarious. The markets cheered the move, but only so much. Before the decision, markets priced in a cut of almost 3.5% by year-end. That is lower than an earlier range of 3.75% to 4%, given before the full outline of the US tariff plans was released. The British pound rose modestly against the dollar, and yields on British government bonds dipped as investors started to anticipate deeper cuts. Still, the Bank of England made its stance clear: there is no predetermined path for interest rates. Future moves will be made “gradually and cautiously,” guided by how inflation evolves and global risks unfold.

The announcement was made on the penultimate day of the SEC's 31st International Securities Market Growth and Development Institute. Commissioner Peirce said it was important to modernise regulatory frameworks to accommodate innovation without compromising investor protection. The proposed exemption would allow companies to operate in a controlled environment, similar to international “regulatory sandboxes”, to test new trading systems and technologies. Tokenization, which involves formatting traditional securities like stocks and bonds as cryptocurrency assets on a blockchain, is a key focus area for the SEC’s evolving crypto oversight. According to Peirce, limited trading venues and regulatory uncertainty have discouraged the wider adoption of tokenized securities. A conditional exemption could break this cycle and provide regulatory relief to firms while ensuring market integrity and risk disclosure. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces It Will List a New Altcoin - Both for Spot and Futures Such exemptions could still require firms to adhere to anti-fraud standards, maintain records, and undergo SEC oversight. Additional requirements could be placed on custody services and trading limits to mitigate risks. Successful implementation by firms could lead to increased flexibility over time, Peirce said. Calling for both local innovation and international collaboration, Peirce encouraged global regulators to collaborate on cross-border sandbox initiatives. “Regulatory balancing act is not a solitary exercise,” Peirce said, touting the benefits of coordinated innovation to strengthen global capital markets. The SEC has not yet formalized the exemption and is awaiting feedback from industry stakeholders as it considers next steps. *This is not investment advice.

Once a market flush with opportunities for anyone and everyone who had lunch money to grow, crypto is now dominated by big-caps with comparatively lower upside for massive gains. Dogecoin, Worldcoin and HBAR are among the big names, but their large-cap status makes them less palatable to investors looking for big gains in 2025. However, one newcomer is looking like good value to hit $1 before its big-cap cohorts do. Remittix (RTX) is a newly launched PayFi protocol enabling instant crypto-to-fiat payouts to any bank account anywhere in the world. With RTX tokens still available at just $0.0757, Remittix is tipped to hit $1 sooner than Dogecoin, Worldcoin and HBAR will. Here’s why. Remittix presale tapping into trillion-dollar cross-border payments industry With its presale approaching a sensational $15 million raise, Remittix has emerged as one of the top candidates to hit $1 from its current presale price of just $0.0757 and for good reason. Remittix disrupts the trillion-dollar cross-border payments industry by enabling instantaneous crypto-to-fiat transfers at low fees and zero delays without the recipient having to know their payment came from crypto. Source: Remittix Powered by its native token RTX, the Remittix platform also offers high-yield staking pools offering up to 18% APYs, while its smart contracts have been audited for security by BlockSAFU. Throw in just a 1% flat fee on all transactions and no foreign exchange charges and it’s easy to see why Remittix is positioned for parabolic growth this year. Dogecoin : From meme to mainstream momentums Since breaching the $0.43 mark earlier in February, Dogecoin has gone on a major correction, trading at the $0.16 level as of press time. Nevertheless, Dogecoin is still up by a modest 4.4% in the past month, even as DOGE prices have struggled to stay afloat on an upward ascent to trade sideways thus far. Source: Coingecko Based on on-chain data, Dogecoin buyers are slurping the dip, accumulating Dogecoin at its current levels. If this trend continues, DOGE could break past resistance at $0.187 and finally on the next level out of the consolidation range. If trade volumes falter, Dogecoin could slip below $0.16. Whatever the case, $1 doesn’t look likely anytime soon. Worldcoin pump loses steam Worldcoin went on a major run to close out April, surging from $0.58 last April 6th to peaking at $1.22 last April 27th. However, Worldcoin failed to sustain its momentum entering May, going on a precipitous 22% decline in the first week of May amid major controversy involving the Kenyan High Court’s decision to delete all biometric information the protocol collected in the nation, including iris and facial scans. Source: Coingecko Nevertheless, even at its current price of $0.877, WLD holders who stuck around at earlier price levels are solidly in the green. But with more turbulence due to regulatory issues, Worldcoin appears to be in for a major correction. HBAR to $1? Possible in 1-2 years HBAR was also on a decent run in the past month, with token prices on a solid 12% increase. Currently trading around the $0.17 range, HBAR, due to its DAG technology and ability to scale to 100k TPS not to mention being governed by a council including some of the world’s biggest names, is bullish over the long run. $1 isn’t a matter of if, but when. However, that run to $1 could materialize in the next 2-3 years. With a mainnet live since 2019 and a blockchain built specifically for enterprise adoption, HBAR looks like it has the goods to achieve that target if only in a longer time frame. Source: Coingecko Remittix offers clear shot at $1 in 2025 Dogecoin, Worldcoin and Hedera face different paths to $1. All have the potential to do so. However, in terms of immediate potential to hit $1, Remittix easily takes the cake. RTX is still available at presale prices and remains a low-cap, undervalued opportunity that could go parabolic as soon as it hits exchanges. $1 is about 13x from $0.0757 and with the proven ability of low-caps to pump, Remittix has the clearest path out of all 4.

In a post on Truth Social, the president wrote, “’Too Late’ Jerome Powell is a FOOL, who doesn’t have a clue. Other than that, I like him very much!” The attack came less than 24 hours after Powell and the Fed announced they would keep interest rates where they are for the third straight month. Trump also once again lied that oil and energy prices had dropped, said grocery and egg prices were down, and bragged that there was “virtually NO INFLATION.” He added, “Tariff Money Pouring Into the US — THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF ‘TOO LATE!’ ENJOY!” The president launched this tirade after days of tension between the Fed’s rate policy and his push to show the American economy is recovering. Trump has been repeatedly pushing the narrative that his trade policies are bringing in revenue, cutting costs, and doing what Powell can’t. Trump announces 10% tariff floor, praises UK but slams other trade partners While the Powell jab got all the attention online, Trump used the same day to confirm a new round of tariff policy . Standing in the Oval Office, he told reporters that 10% will now be the lowest rate on imports from countries looking to secure trade deals with the United States. “Some will be much higher because they have massive trade surpluses and in many cases they didn’t treat us right,” he said. Trump made these remarks during a formal announcement of a new trade deal with the United Kingdom. He said the UK had earned the 10% baseline because it “always treated us with great respect.” He then told the room, “That’s a low number, they made a good deal.” He was clear that this rate wouldn’t apply across the board and shot down a question from a reporter asking if it was a template for future deals. “No, no,” he said flatly. The president said the final touches of the UK agreement were still being worked on, but claimed the outcome would include “billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.” He also said that Britain had agreed to reduce or eliminate several non-tariff barriers that had blocked US products unfairly in the past. A post from Trump’s Truth Social account shared a chart during the event that showed US tariffs on the UK will remain at 10%. The same chart showed British tariffs on US goods dropping to between 5.1% and 1.8%, though there was no explanation on how those numbers were calculated. Starmer praises alliance, experts call deal limited UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined the Oval Office event remotely and said, “We’ve built an incredible platform for the future.” But the response in Washington wasn’t all clapping and nods. Josh Lipsky, who chairs international economics at the Atlantic Council, told CNBC that the deal “is a very small win, and it’s limited in scope.” He argued that deals like this can’t easily be repeated with countries that have larger trade imbalances with the US Meanwhile, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said she will travel to Britain next week to continue talks about expanding US beef exports under the new agreement. Back in London, 10 Downing Street issued its own statement following the announcement. A spokesperson for Starmer said, “Talks on a deal between our countries have been continuing at pace and the Prime Minister will update later today.” The statement stressed that Starmer “will always act in Britain’s national interest,” and called the US “an indispensable ally for both our economic and national security.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-08 17:38:03

Jupiter (JUP) , the biggest DEX aggregator on Solana (SOL) , is taking advantage of the latest market rally. On Thursday, May 7, the token was up 11.83%, reaching $0.4622, driven by both market momentum and ecosystem growth. Altcoin momentum has started to pick up, as Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the $100,000 mark.

In fact, it was one of the worst, losing 44% of its value over the past 90 days. Still, the strength of Solana’s ecosystem—where Jupiter continues to maintain dominance, is fueling renewed optimism. Jupiter rises on Solana DeFi Growth Part of the reason why Jupiter is recovering is thanks to the growth of Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. The surge coincided with Solana’s DEX volume breaking $800 billion so far in 2025. While more than half of this volume was in January, trading volumes remained consistent so far this year.

The plan, tied to the now-infamous government unit called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, was supposed to reward taxpayers with cash from federal cost-cutting. But the numbers have crashed, the rules have tightened, and more than half the country is now out of the running. The idea was sold as simple: 20% of all government savings produced by DOGE would be returned to taxpayers. Elon said DOGE could save up to $2 trillion, which would mean $400 billion gets paid out, roughly $5,000 per person. That number is dead now. In a meeting with Trump on April 10, Elon admitted savings for the year wouldn’t even hit 10% of that. DOGE is only on track to save $150 billion, dropping the possible payout to $375 per taxpayer. That figure didn’t last long either. Elon lowers estimates again as checks shrink fast The official DOGE website later updated the expected payout to just $1,000, using the same 161 million taxpayer base. That’s now the government’s public estimate. But even that’s only for those who qualify. And that number is shrinking fast. The man who pushed the check idea into the DOGE plan is James Fishback, the CEO of investment firm Azoria. James pitched it as a reward for Americans who pay more into the system than they take out. “Checks would only be sent to tax-paying households,” James said . Anyone making under $40,000 a year in adjusted gross income was out. He said most of them don’t pay much, if any, federal income tax. That knocks out about half of the country immediately. James also explained why this wouldn’t be a regular stimulus. “Many low-income households saw transfer payments of between 25 and 30 percent of their annual income,” he said. That’s why DOGE checks are limited to what he called “net taxpayers” — people who owe nothing back and pay more than they get. “They have a lower propensity to spend and a higher propensity to save a transfer payment like the DOGE Dividend,” James said. Republicans push back while inflation concerns rise Speaking in Wisconsin, Elon made it clear that the whole idea still needs political sign-off. “Whether the checks even get sent depends on Congress and maybe the president,” he told the crowd. That means even the $1,000 estimate is just floating in the air. Nothing has been signed. And every new conversation about it waters the plan down further. Some Republicans want it gone altogether. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said the country can’t afford it. “We have a $36 trillion federal debt,” Mike said. “We have a giant deficit that we’re contending with. I think we need to pay down the credit card, right?” Inflation warnings are also rolling in. Preston Brashers, a tax policy fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said sending out checks could light inflation up again. “It could come back with a vengeance,” he warned. But James doesn’t agree. He said that as long as the payments are “deficit-financed” and funded from savings already created by DOGE, there’s no reason for inflation to spike. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The announcement marked the first big agreement since the White House rolled out sweeping tariffs against most global economies earlier in the year. Speaking from Washington, Trump told Americans, “You better go out and buy stock now. Let me tell you. This country will be like a rocket ship that goes straight up. This is going to be numbers that nobody has ever seen before.” The markets moved immediately. The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 523 points, ending the day 1.3% higher. The S&P 500 rose by 1.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.7%. Source: TradingView The Russell 2000, a small-cap benchmark, gained the most—2.3%—beating all other indexes. That index is now up 3.6% for the month. But it’s still down by 8.7% in 2025 overall, compared to the S&P’s 2.9% drop. Bitcoin clears $100K as crypto rallies hard While stocks soared, Bitcoin did exactly what traders have been praying for. It broke past $100,000 again, hitting its highest point since February 7. Data from CoinGecko showed it trading at $101,508, up nearly 5.1% for the day. This surge also pulled other cryptocurrencies up with it. Ether spiked 13%, Solana’s native token rose 9%, and Dogecoin jumped 11%. Even crypto stocks joined the rally. Coinbase advanced more than 5%, while Strategy surged nearly 7%. But not everyone’s convinced the crypto rally is safe. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of the crypto exchange Nexo, said Bitcoin has more to prove. “Bitcoin isn’t out of the woods,” Trenchev said. “It needs to break its January high of around $109,350 to fully escape the range it’s been stuck in.” Still, he didn’t ignore the comeback. “The retaking of $100,000 must go down as one of Bitcoin’s more formidable feats,” he said. “Buying peak fear — just last month, Bitcoin was languishing around $74,000 — can be exceptionally lucrative.” The bigger story may not be just about crypto rising. It’s about traditional investors walking away from the US economy and using Bitcoin as an alternative. A recent report from BCA Research said foreign investors are pulling capital out of US assets. They’re doing it, the firm said, because they’re worried the White House is now targeting capital with its new trade policies. BCA said it’s staying cautious. Their current positioning is underweight US equities, overweight fixed income, and avoiding direct US market exposure in their portfolio mix. They also flipped their position on Bitcoin for the first time in a while. Back in February, they called it too risky. Now, they’ve moved it from underweight to neutral, saying it’s time to reconsider the role of crypto as a hedge. “Bitcoin should benefit in a world where investors divest from US assets,” the note said . They also pointed out that sentiment around Bitcoin had cooled off, and that’s helped its price action. The percentage of coins recently traded has dropped hard since the start of the year. BCA also said that Bitcoin, now acting like “digital gold,” is holding up surprisingly well despite the wider selloff in US financial assets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The regulator is “considering a potential exemptive order” for firms using blockchain technology to “issue, trade, and settle securities” that would release them from certain registration requirements, Peirce said in the speech. For example, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) may no longer need to register “as a broker-dealer, clearing agency, or an exchange,” Peirce said. The SEC has previously brought numerous charges against DEXs such as Uniswap for failing to register as securities exchanges. Firms should “not have to comply with inapt regulations, which, in many cases, were developed well before the technologies being tested existed and may be obviated by attributes of that technology,” Peirce said. Commissioner Peirce described the planned changes in a May 8 speech. Source: SEC Under such an exemption, companies would still be expected to comply with rules designed to prevent fraud and market manipulation, the commissioner said. They may also need to meet certain disclosure and recordkeeping requirements.

Under the leadership of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the agency brought upward of 100 lawsuits against crypto firms for alleged securities law violations. However, under Trump nominee Paul Atkins, who was sworn in as chair on April 21 , the agency has claimed jurisdiction over a narrower segment of cryptocurrencies. In February, the SEC issued guidance stating that memecoins — if clearly identified as purely speculative assets with no intrinsic value — do not qualify as investment contracts under US law. In April, the regulator said that stablecoins — digital tokens pegged to the US dollar — similarly do not qualify as securities if they are marketed solely as a means of making payments .

The token serves as the governance and coordination engine for over 800 active node operators securing more thn $1 billion in ETH across leading protocols and institutions including Lido, EtherFi, StakeWise, Swell, Bitcoin Suisse and many more. ""After years of building reliable, distributed validator technology that eliminates single points of failure, we're now putting governance in the hands of the community,"" said Thomas Heremans, CEO of Obol Association. ""The OBOL Token represents more than just governance—it's the coordination mechanism for an entire ecosystem of operators who are revolutionizing how Ethereum secures its infrastructure."" The token unlock follows a strategic airdrop to thousands of Ethereum solo stakers, Rocketpool node operators, and contributors to the Ethereum ecosystem, ensuring broad distribution among those already actively participating in network security. New Liquid Staking Mechanism In collaboration with Tally, Obol is introducing an innovative staking mechanism that allows OBOL holders to stake their tokens and receive a liquid staked governance token in return. This approach provides stakers with both staking rewards and full participation rights across the ecosystem, creating a powerful alignment between governance participation and protocol rewards. Stakers will retain all core benefits of the OBOL token, including: Governance over the Obol Collective Voting power in Retroactive Funding Rounds (RAF) Restaking capabilities with partner protocols Use as premier collateral within eligible DeFi protocols Obol Distributed Validators (DVs) have become foundational to Ethereum's decentralization roadmap, enabling fault-tolerant validator clusters operated across multiple geographies that outperform traditional validators. This technology has already transformed the staking landscape: Enabled Lido to expand from 36 to over 200+ operators Helped EtherFi create Operation Solo Staker, onboarding home stakers to the protocol Allowed solo stakers to outperform professional operators in validator performance Enabled institutional grade staking entities to lower their operating costs while improving performance As a founding member of both the Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) and the Node Operator Risk Standard (NORS), Obol is shaping both the technology and policy frameworks that will define institutional staking for years to come. ""Distributed Validators represent the gold standard for secure, scalable, and decentralized Ethereum staking,"" added Heremans. ""With the OBOL Token, we're ensuring that the future development of this critical infrastructure stays in the hands of the community it serves."" About Obol The Obol Collective is the largest Decentralized Operator Ecosystem and the champion of Distributed Validators. We bring better performance, more rewards, less risks to Ethereum and other decentralized infrastructure networks.

But while XRP explores its next big chapter, another tech trailblazer, Ruvi AI, is taking the blockchain world by storm, redefining innovation with a powerful blend of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Ruvi AI – Bridging AI and Blockchain Like Never Before Ruvi AI is at the forefront of a new technological movement, merging advanced artificial intelligence with blockchain capabilities to solve some of the most pressing challenges. This unique combination ensures not only efficiency and insight but also data transparency and robust security. With a tailored approach to a diverse range of industries, Ruvi AI delivers cutting-edge solutions for finance, supply chain optimization, healthcare diagnostics, and more. For instance, healthcare providers can analyze intricate data for precision diagnostics, while logistics companies can predict and resolve distribution bottlenecks in real-time. Ruvi AI’s blockchain foundation ensures that the data driving these decisions is tamper-proof and trustworthy. User accessibility is a key pillar of Ruvi AI’s success. Whether you’re a seasoned tech entrepreneur or an industry newcomer, the platform offers intuitive tools and interfaces that make the adoption of AI and blockchain seamless. A Stand-Out Presale Performance Ruvi AI’s vision has already inspired significant confidence among investors, as demonstrated by its highly successful presale launch. The platform has sold over 10 million tokens and raised more than $100,000 in just a few days after the start. This performance reflects not only market excitement but also anticipation for Ruvi AI’s impactful potential. The presale tokens are currently priced at $0.01, giving early investors an attractive entry point. However, the opportunity won’t last long, Phase 1 sold already over 30% of the total tokens. Window for getting in is closing fast and the second phase comes with the token price set to rise by 50% to $0.01. This price increase marks a crucial milestone on Ruvi AI’s roadmap, indicating growing demand and value. Adding to Ruvi AI’s credibility, its beta version will roll out shortly after the presale ends, giving users early access to test the platform’s capabilities. VIP Tiers Rewarding Early Investors For investors seeking more than just token price appreciation, Ruvi AI offers exclusive VIP tiers designed to maximize rewards. Individuals backing the platform at these tiers enjoy significant advantages that compound their returns. VIP Tier 3 Those who accumulate 100,000 tokens which at the current price of $0,01 per token means $1,000 qualify for VIP Tier 3 and receive a 60% bonus, yielding a total of 160,000 tokens. At the expected listing price of $0.07, this investment would be worth $11,200. However, Ruvi AI’s long-term goal of $1 per token could turn this same stake into $160,000, showcasing its potential for exponential growth. VIP Tier 5 VIP Tier 5 is the ultimate package for high-level participants. With a $5,000 investment, contributors are allocated 500,000 tokens and receive a 100% bonus, translating to a total of 1,000,000 tokens. At the $0.07 listing price, this investment would be valued at $70,000. If Ruvi AI achieves its projected $1 milestone, VIP Tier 5 investors could see returns soar to an astonishing $1,000,000. Boosting Community Engagement with Rewards Ruvi AI places a strong emphasis on rewarding its community through an innovative leaderboard system. This feature is designed to encourage participation while offering lucrative returns for contributors, regardless of their investment size. Top 10 contributors earn 500,000 tokens each, equivalent to $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors secure 250,000 tokens, valued at $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors collect 100,000 tokens each, worth $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1. Top 200 contributors receive 75,000 tokens, totaling $5,250 at $0.07 or $75,000 at $1. Top 500 contributors gain 40,000 tokens each, worth $2,800 at $0.07 or $40,000 at $1. Top 1,000 contributors are rewarded with 20,000 tokens, valued at $1,400 at $0.07 or $20,000 at $1. This tiered rewards structure not only acknowledges the contributions of early supporters but also ensures equitable participation across the community. Innovating the Future of Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI stands at the cusp of a new era in tech innovation, with its seamless integration of AI and blockchain paving the way for smarter, more transparent solutions.

BONK has surged in price, bringing new energy to the meme coin space. At the same time, PI network analysis shows mixed signs, with the token struggling to stay above key levels. But for those chasing bigger gains, early access, and working features, one project is gaining fast. Web3 ai , still in presale and offering a planned 1747% ROI, is now the clear option for anyone aiming to lock in the best crypto investment in 2025. BONK Rally Sparks Buzz, but Traders Stay Cautious The BONK rally has captured the attention of short-term traders. After a period of sideways action, BONK jumped sharply, backed by rising volume and stronger sentiment around meme coins. Chart watchers point to flipped resistance zones and more upside if momentum continues. Indicators show that buying interest is high during this BONK rally. The $0.000033 level is now the key spot traders are watching for signs of a full breakout. Its low market cap and meme-driven nature make BONK appealing for quick trades. But even with the current rally, BONK’s gains are built on short-term movement. Like many similar coins, these moves tend to fade fast. That’s why it may not be the first choice for those looking at long-term strategies. PI Network Faces Pressure as Signals Remain Unclear The latest PI network analysis shows the token in a tough position. After a long drop in price and limited updates from the team, investor interest has started to fade. While the token holds some support, many are unsure if it will hold up in the long run. Charts show weak signals, with lower highs and shrinking volume. Some parts of the PI network analysis also mention slow progress in development, raising doubts about the project’s strength in 2025. This has made it harder for investors to stay confident in the project. While some still hold due to the community backing, others are now exploring new options. Web3 ai is quickly becoming the best crypto investment thanks to its working features and clear presale value setup. Web3 ai’s Game Plan: $0.0003 Entry, 12 AI Tools, and 1747% ROI As BONK rides a short-term pump and PI struggles to find direction, Web3 ai is quickly becoming the early-stage project that’s hard to ignore. With its presale price at $0.0003 and a confirmed listing at $0.005242, it sets up a 1747% ROI path for those getting in now. But this isn’t just about numbers. Web3 ai is rolling out a full set of 12 AI-driven tools made for both traders and long-term holders. These include trading signal generators, smart portfolio tools, scam alerts, and automated DeFi risk checks. All of them are powered by the $WAI token. This token runs the platform, unlocks tool access, and supports governance. As more people use the tools, token demand grows naturally, linking price to usage instead of hype. This isn’t just another hype project or a stalled idea. Web3 ai brings early access and real features. Its roadmap is clear, the tools are built for real use, and the ROI structure draws growing presale demand. That’s why many now call it the best crypto investment going into 2025. Top Crypto Picks for 2025 BONK’s rally has brought fresh energy into the meme coin space, giving traders a quick play for short-term gains. On the other side, the PI network remains unclear, with investors still waiting for clear updates on progress and plans. But cutting through the noise, Web3 ai is standing firm. With its opening price at $0.0003, top crypto presale tier at $0.003267, and a listing target of $0.005242, it offers a mapped-out 1747% ROI. The platform runs on AI tools, its token has real use, and momentum is building. That’s why many now see Web3 ai as the best crypto investment for those chasing real returns. If you’re aiming beyond quick trades, this might be the project to watch as the next big wave begins.

44335692,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=28366,1746727314,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/98/default.png,"Poorly understood, widely unaccepted: The Bitcoin-at-$100,000 opportunity",https://blog.kraken.com/crypto-education/bitcoin-at-100000-opportunity,"By Pete Rizzo, The Bitcoin Historian Back then, Bitcoin was the toast of the financial mainstream. Books were being written about the subject, Bloomberg hosted a “12 Days of Bitcoin” Christmas special (where the host got robbed on air ), and every Silicon Valley thought leader had an opinion about its future. Then, reality hit. The trough of disillusionment. Startups pivoted and failed. These were my formative years in the Bitcoin industry. I never stopped believing that the world envisioned by the technologists of the day was possible, but sky-high price projections felt far away. Bitcoin was embroiled in a civil war, there was a fight over what the infrastructure of blockchains would be and banks were even offering private versions of the technology. Suffice to say, if you had asked me then to imagine what the world would be like when Bitcoin hit $100,000, I would have likely had the following answer – Bitcoin would be understood and accepted, the scientific experiment of the industry’s early days would be over, and its technology would be accepted and mainstream. I was sure it would be a far cry from what things were like when I started – with Bitcoin users having to wire money through strange Russian payment intermediaries to transact (or else needing to buy it, in person, from strangers on the street). While that part certainly has changed, I would have been wrong about rest. Today, that just makes me even more optimistic about Bitcoin’s future price appreciation. Going mainstream Of course, I’m willing to admit the obvious. In 2025, Bitcoin is mainstream. The President of the United States doesn’t just own it, it’s a major part of his policy platform. Major pop stars like Drake don’t just trade it, their rap nemeses name-check it on their diss tracks . Yet there’s still widespread confusion about both what Bitcoin is and how future financial infrastructure will look as a result of its proliferation. Already, it’s a fact that the new administration has had to confront with its policies. As the debate around the U.S. Digital Asset Market Structure bill shows, there isn’t yet consensus on what cryptoassets are, even within the industry. Some (like me) see Bitcoin as a differentiated digital gold, one that will likely scale to be the world’s settlement network. Others see cryptocurrencies as an asset class, competing monies with different properties. Sure, many Americans own Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, but they aren’t using crypto for everyday financial transactions. For most it’s a long-term savings or speculative vehicle, one that’s only a small part of their financial planning. Polls show they’re open to alternatives to traditional finance, but that they don’t quite take digital assets – even bitcoin – seriously. Even those who invest in it don’t understand it, according to polls . Certainly this disconnect makes for a thriving market. Every day now there are thousands of digital assets being launched, and Coinmarketcap already tracks 15.1 million of them. But are these really just memes? The Bitcoin movement started out with the intent to revolutionize finance. Many of the builders I know are still working on the effort. Doubtless, eventually the market will have to have a clear and widespread agreement on the difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There may have been a time when there were hundreds of internet competitors, and businesses may have had to question whether to build a website on AOL or EarthLink. Today, I doubt you’re reading this article on either. The case for $1,000,000 Bitcoin Unfortunately, those who have entered the industry of late may have a similar reaction as I had in 2013, hearing the sky-high projections for Bitcoin’s price and assuming they missed the boat. If you’re one of these newcomers, I’d ask you to take a step back. Has Bitcoin reached its full potential? Sixteen years after its launch, Bitcoin remains a unique entry on the global monetary scene – if you look at a list of the world’s top currencies , it’s the only one that’s: Not issued by a corporation or government Has a finite money supply Has a transparent and auditable monetary policy Add in the fact that top-level layers like the Lightning Network make it possible for Bitcoin to compete in global payments, and hopefully you get the picture, Bitcoin is money reimagined as a network, one that unshackles money from its current form – databases owned and operated by centralized entities within distinct geographical areas. Consider the trends – public companies and nation states are buying Bitcoin, as are Wall Street investment firms via vehicles like ETFs. Then there’s the sheer scale of the computer network that operates Bitcoin – it’s already over 7 times the size of Google and growing. Now imagine the network when all the aforementioned trends reach maturity. Doesn’t sound like we’re quite close to the dream does it? Slowly, immutably, toward acceptance What is Bitcoin? Well, today that’s a question that still might make your friend send you a 30-minute documentary. There’s a famous TV clip that summarizes the phenomenon – one from 1994 in which the hosts of “The Today Show” debate the internet . None knew how to describe it. Today, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are an “internet superhighway,” “an internet of money,” the kind of technology that is capable of great things, but limited by our ability to describe it. My feeling now is that this best sums up what the transition to a Bitcoin and crypto-powered world will be like, this gap closing between the aspiration of language and reality. By the time Bitcoin is at $1,000,000, no one will need exotic analogies to describe it. If we do, buckle up, because we just might just be headed far higher prices still.

44335938,https://zycrypto.com/?p=105715,1746727374,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson Agrees ADA Price is About to Explode — Here’s Why,https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-agrees-ada-price-is-about-to-explode-heres-why/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes ADA is poised for a major liftoff once the bull cycle begins. On Thursday, Hoskinson commented on the growing potential for a significant surge in ADA’s price, following a chart analysis by investor Rick McCracken. Displaying ADA’s price chart, which showed a strong uptick that day, McCracken suggested that ADA is primed for a substantial price increase, describing it as being on the verge of a “face-melting rip.” Hoskinson, echoed the sentiment, commenting , “and the bull market hasn’t even started yet,” hinting that the full bullish trend for ADA is yet to materialize. Hoskinson’s remarks came after ADA experienced a notable surge Thursday amid a broader rally in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin tapping $100,000 for the first time since February. Notably, ADA’s surge also aligns with a new Cardano price risk model, suggesting that the bull market for ADA is still in its infancy. Despite early-stage bullish indicators, the model implies that Cardano’s market has not yet entered its full bull run. On Wednesday, Dan Gambardello, founder of Crypto Capital Venture, provided a deeper look at ADA’s market conditions through the model. According to this model, ADA’s Long-Term Risk Score currently stands at 37, categorized as a “Moderate Buy.” The analyst emphasized that while the price has increased by 37% historically, this suggests the bull market for Cardano has not yet begun. The risk model classifies ADA’s risk level as moderate, which is favorable for investors looking to enter the market early in the cycle. “It’s not that there is a lot left of the Cardano bull market. It’s that the Cardano bull market hasn’t even started. Brand new CCV ADA risk model looking primed,” he wrote. Meanwhile, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez presented a chart illustrating ADA’s movement within a descending parallel channel over the past two weeks. While ADA has faced resistance near $0.72, Martinez believes a breakout above this resistance could trigger a rise toward the $0.80 level, signaling a potential upward breakout. In addition to technical indicators, on-chain metrics reveal encouraging signs for ADA. Data from IntoTheBlock highlights a notable increase in network activity, with new addresses growing by 4.79% and active addresses rising by 11.99%. These figures suggest that more users engage with the Cardano network, which typically precedes price surges. Whales have also been scooping up ADA at high-rate, in anticipation of a major price surge. ADA traded at $0.73 at press time, reflecting a 9.43% surge in the past 24 hours. The coin also saw a 53% increase in its 24-hour trading volume, reaching $952.6 million. While the current price is still far from its 2021 all-time high of $3.10, analysts view it as an attractive entry point for those anticipating a major price surge.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-08 18:02:54

In a new post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author says the US may be on the verge of an economic collapse. “I hope I am wrong, but as I forecasted, the biggest market crashes in stocks, bonds and real estate are about to happen in the very, very near future.” Kiyosaki believes that the economic collapse will force the US Federal Reserve and Treasury to increase global market liquidity (M2), debasing the US dollar. “If the markets do crash odds are the Fed and Treasury will print trillions in fake dollars, increasing M2 money supply which will probably cause massive inflation. Simply said: I do not trust the Fed and Treasury. They will turn on the fake money press.” He predicts that the dollar debasement will lead to inflation and higher prices for store of value investments like gold, silver and Bitcoin. “I trust gold, silver and Bitcoin to protect me from the coming massive inflation caused by the loss of purchasing power of fake money, which is why I have been warning for years, ‘savers are losers.'” He also says that silver may double in value by next year, reaching $70.

The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close by the end of this year. Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), a veteran cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, announced that it has agreed to acquire Deribit, a top-tier derivatives exchange. According to the announcement, Coinbase is acquiring Deribit for $2.9 billion, which will include $700 million in cash and 11 million in shares. Meanwhile, Coinbase announced that the deal is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. As a result, Coinbase expects the deal to be closed by the end of this year. “As the leading crypto options platform, we’ve built a strong, profitable business, and this acquisition will accelerate the foundation we laid while providing traders with even more opportunities across spot, futures, perpetuals, and options – all under one trusted brand.

This surge came amid optimism following US President Donald Trump’s promises of the “biggest tax cut” and a “major trade agreement.” The promises of fiscal changes seemed to lift spirits across the market, with analysts now predicting that XRP could potentially surge by over 1000% soon. Notably, popular crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto tweeted, referencing a December 2023 prediction, which hinted at a significant price movement for the crypto asset. On Wednesday, he shared a chart showcasing the “Epic Gravitational Fall” for XRP, paired with the bullish chart pattern of a “Giant Cup.” Based on his analysis, the analyst set bold price targets for XRP , predicting it could reach as high as $7.02 and $13.77. These levels are consistent with XRP’s past surges, including the 1,500% increase in 2017, and imply that the asset’s current momentum could mirror the significant growth seen in previous market cycles. In a subsequent post on Thursday, Egrag Crypto provided an updated XRP price analysis, emphasizing the significance of the Bull Market Support Band (BMSB), which combines the 20-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). According to him, XRP’s current price, ranging between $2.15 and $2.41, shows “micro noise,” signaling that a sustained move above $2.41 could trigger a bullish rally, while a drop below $2.15 could indicate bearish sentiment. Historically, the BMSB has proven to be a reliable indicator of significant price rallies for XRP, such as the surge in 2017. Analysts Steph has echoed bullish sentiment elsewhere, predicting XRP could hit $30 in the current market cycle. Steph’s reasoning is based on the long-term Elliott Wave pattern, signaling a final bullish phase for the asset. Meanwhile, analyst Jim Knox also chimed in, comparing over 12 years of XRP and Bitcoin price data. According to Knox, XRP typically sees significant price movements in two key scenarios. First, when Bitcoin breaks its all-time high (ATH) and enters price discovery, and when Bitcoin reaches the new cycle top. Knox further pointed out XRP’s 1000% surge from $0.30 to $3.30, noting that such surges are consistent with Bitcoin’s price movements. “Every time BTC hits price discovery, XRP follows with a massive move. Then? Between BTC’s ATH breakout and its final cycle top… XRP goes quiet.” He noted “If history rhymes, XRP might now be in a consolidation phase while other projects outperform.” However, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a descending channel pattern for XRP with a key resistance level at $2.26 in the shorter term. If XRP breaks through this resistance, Martinez suggests the asset could see a breakout towards $2.60. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.25, reflecting a 6.19% surge in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-08 18:11:41

USDT deposits grew 2.6% as investors shifted to stablecoins amid volatility. Government partnerships establish practical crypto use beyond speculation. On May 8, Binance released an update on its crypto reserves, revealing strong backing for major digital assets. The exchange holds 102% of the Bitcoin (BTC) required to cover user deposits and a 206% surplus for Binance USD (BUSD). Reserve Surpluses Create Withdrawal Safety Nets The report details reserves for 37 assets, including 616,886 BTC, which exceeds the 604,886 Bitcoins held by users. Other tokens like ETH, USDT, and SOL maintain their reserves above the 1:1 target. Crypto reserve surpluses also ensure the platform can honor withdrawal requests without drawing on corporate funds. The disclosure follows Binance’s 30th monthly Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) report, captured on May 1, which broke down the changing customer balances. Binance released the 30th proof of reserves (snapshot date May 1).

This method lets users verify their balances without exposing the data of others—corporate wallets are not included in the calculation to prevent double-counting. PoR statements have also become the sector’s preferred transparency tool after FTX collapsed in 2022. At press time, Binance users held Bitcoin valued at $58 billion, down 1.35% from April, while 5.28 million ETH slid 3.36% to roughly $9.5 billion. Additionally, BNB balances dipped 0.74% to 39.24 million, about $23 billion. At the same time, USDT deposits rose 2.61% to 29.05 billion, indicating a shift toward dollar-pegged tokens amid market turbulence. Non-Bitcoin assets altogether stood at nearly $82 billion. Binance has issued an attestation every month since, contending that public on-chain evidence fosters confidence more effectively than private audits. Regulators still debate formal reserve mandates, yet Binance now supplies one of the longest uninterrupted data sets in the industry. How Binance is Shaping Central Asia’s Blockchain Future After proving its financial stability through reserves, Binance expands its influence beyond day-to-day trading. The company is seeking to shape blockchain infrastructure in emerging markets, starting with a collaboration in Central Asia. The global exchange teamed up with Kyrgyzstan to build a nationwide crypto payment network and roll out blockchain education programs. Both parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on April 3. Binance Academy will work with local universities and training centers to deliver hands-on blockchain and digital assets courses for the government, institutions, and the general public. By training Kyrgyz professionals in Web3 technologies, Binance seeks to develop homegrown talent for creating a digital-first economy.

Trust in Binance has played a key role in its acceptance by governing bodies worldwide , paving the way for major innovations in the financial sector. The platform’s Binance Pay service continues to transform global commerce. The most recent implementation comes from the Kingdom of Bhutan. Over 130,000 tourists are expected to visit Bhutan in 2025.

Before this, Binance Pay announced a partnership with xMoney, a leading European web3 payment solutions provider, to expand crypto payments across Europe in its quest to be a leading cross-border financial provider. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Does Binance’s PoR system account for off-chain liabilities that could affect solvency? Binance’s PoR currently only verifies on-chain assets. It doesn’t audit off-chain liabilities like loans or derivatives exposures that could impact overall solvency—a key transparency gap. How would Binance handle a bank-run scenario where withdrawals exceed liquid reserves? In 2022, the exchange faced mass withdrawals. Users moved out over $1 billion in the aftermath of the FTX collapse. Despite the pressure, Binance held firm, and the exchange has published its reserves every month since then. But no fortress is unbreakable. When market confidence shatters, even the strongest might struggle. Why doesn’t Binance use third-party auditors instead of self-reported Merkle proofs? Binance uses Merkle proof systems to provide faster, user-verifiable snapshots of on-chain reserves. However, this approach lacks independent third-party audits to verify asset ownership and off-chain liabilities, leaving a substantial transparency gap in assessing overall solvency.

However, he also clarified that he has no plans to return as a leader in the world’s largest crypto exchange. Former CEO Files For Clemency Zhao said on the Farokh Radio podcast that the application was submitted through his legal team two weeks ago. He explained that the decision to proceed came after news reports in March by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal alleged he was seeking a pardon in connection with crypto ventures linked to the Trump family. “We only submitted after the Bloomberg article and the Wall Street Journal article came out,” Zhao said, referring to his initial denial of the reports. “If they are writing this article, we might as well just officially apply,” he added. Back in March, Zhao publicly dismissed the report on X, saying the news outlet had reported incorrect information and that he had not held any discussions regarding a Binance U.S. deal. However, he acknowledged that he would not object to receiving amnesty: “No felon would mind a pardon, especially being the only one in U.S. history who was ever sentenced to prison for a single BSA charge.” In the recent interview, CZ further explained that part of the motivation came from President Trump’s previous decision to pardon the BitMEX founders, including Arthur Hayes, who pleaded guilty to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). CZ Won’t Be Returning to Binance Although Zhao is seeking clemency, he revealed he has no plans to return to the company’s leadership. “I’m not really looking to become CEO of Binance again,” he said. Despite stepping down, he remains the largest shareholder of the crypto exchange. His legal troubles began in November 2023, when he pleaded guilty to a money laundering violation in a settlement with U.S. authorities. Binance agreed to pay a $4.3 billion penalty, with CZ contributing $50 million. The former executive was also ordered to resign as the company’s CEO. He was later sentenced to four months in prison and banned from holding any role at Binance. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), while a presidential pardon would not erase his conviction, it could allow him to take on a managerial or operational position at the firm. Since completing his prison term, Zhao has taken up advisory positions abroad. In Pakistan, he supports the nation’s crypto council with policy and infrastructure planning. He also signed an MOU with the National Investment Agency in Kyrgyzstan to assist with Web3 initiatives and digital finance development.

If this level holds, a 41% move toward $29 could be on the horizon. After a series of consistent higher lows and higher highs, Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) has reclaimed a major technical level: the $20 resistance. This breakout confirms that bulls are in control, with price action positioned above a previously significant ceiling. If this newly established support holds, it could fuel a substantial continuation of the current uptrend. Key technical points: Major Resistance Flip : The $20 level, previously a strong resistance, has now flipped into support. Fibonacci Confluence: The 0.618 Fib retracement aligns perfectly with the $20 SR level, offering strong support in the case of a pullback. Next Target: The next resistance lies at $29 — a 41% potential move from current levels. HyperLiquid USDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView The price action has established a new high within this trending structure, essential for maintaining bullish momentum. With a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows, the overall structure remains intact. The breakout above $20 not only confirms bullish intent but also clears the way for additional upside — provided the level is respected during any near-term retracements. Should Hyperliquid pull back from current levels, a retest of the $20 region would be expected. Rather than signaling weakness, this would represent a classic bullish SR (support/resistance) flip — a healthy sign in trending markets. The fact that this zone coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement adds further weight to its significance. You might also like: Ethereum price reclaims $2000: is this the start of a major bull run? Adding further strength to this scenario is the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, which aligns precisely with the $20 support zone. The convergence of horizontal SR and Fibonacci support significantly increases the likelihood of bulls stepping in to defend this level, making a continued rally far more probable. From a risk-reward perspective, this zone presents one of the better setups in current market conditions. A bounce from the $20 region could initiate a rally toward the next resistance at $29. If this level is reached, it would represent a 41% gain — a move that would reinforce Hyperliquid’s momentum and strengthen the overall bullish market structure. What to expect in the coming price action If the $20 support holds during any short-term pullbacks, the bullish structure will remain intact, increasing the likelihood of a move toward $29. Traders should watch for volume spikes and daily candle closes above $20 as key signals of continued strength.

XRP is trading at $2.24, marking a gain of more than 5% from yesterday and more than 20% from last month. The token also touched $2.27, its highest level over the past week. This price movement signals a renewed wave of momentum in the broader crypto market, with XRP currently leading much of the activity. Donald Trump’s Major Announcement Trump teased a major announcement on Tuesday, and the anticipation paid off as he announced a major trade deal with the United Kingdom. The President announced the deal on Truth Social, his social media platform, calling it a “full and comprehensive one” that would “cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come.” Notably, he emphasized that it was the first announcement, suggesting more international trade deals are coming. In a follow-up post , the president revealed that the deal will raise $6 billion in external revenue from 10% tariffs and $5 billion in export opportunities, causing excitement in the financial markets and a notable rise among major cryptocurrencies.

While Trump’s tariff threats initially affected the crypto market’s performance, this resurgence shows that his America-first approach is paying off. Bitcoin has also experienced a notable 4.9% surge, climbing above $100,000 for the first time since early February. XRP’s strong response reflects the shift in sentiment caused by the deal, especially given its positioning as a cross-border settlement solution. Trump has promised many other deals, stating that the U.S. is open for business to those who respect it and bring serious deals. With more deals on the horizon, detractors who panicked and sold their XRP early will miss out on the massive resurgence. While XRP’s price struggled, a crypto expert revealed that the short bearish phase would separate the tourists from the truthers . These truthers who believed that Trump’s policies would favour XRP and the broader crypto market are now seeing the results of their belief. Market participants will watch closely to see whether Trump’s upcoming deals or future statements reinforce this shift and help XRP climb further.

Expert Weighs In,https://timestabloid.com/could-u-s-adopt-xrp-backed-bonds-expert-weighs-in/,"Vandell Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently sparked discussion across the digital asset space with a provocative proposal: the issuance of U.S. government bonds backed by XRP. Shared on X, Aljarrah’s idea centers on replacing conventional Treasury securities with debt instruments denominated in XRP. Under his proposal, the U.S. government would sell XRP directly to investors, who would receive fixed returns, such as 2% annually, in either XRP or U.S. dollars. At maturity, holders would redeem the XRP for its market value, functioning similarly to traditional bonds. While this concept aligns with the growing trend of blockchain integration into financial infrastructure, several substantial barriers stand in the way of implementation. XRP-backed bonds. Imagine the U.S. government issuing XRP as a debt instrument instead of bonds. Investors buy XRP from the Treasury & earn a yield, just like with government bonds, but in a digital format. For example a fixed yield (e.g., 2% annually paid in USD or XRP) &… — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) May 2, 2025 Key Obstacles Facing XRP-Linked Bonds One of the foremost challenges to XRP-denominated sovereign debt is the issue of price stability. Unlike fiat currencies used in government bond markets, cryptocurrencies like XRP are highly volatile. For XRP to be viable as a debt instrument, significant progress would be required in reducing price fluctuations or implementing a stabilizing mechanism similar to those employed by stablecoins. Another major consideration is the regulatory landscape. At present, XRP is not classified as a reserve asset under U.S. law, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically maintained a cautious stance toward digital assets. Despite evolving attitudes within the government and increasing legislative efforts aimed at defining cryptocurrencies, issuing bonds backed by XRP would likely require comprehensive regulatory reform and a formal reclassification of the asset. At the state level, some progress has been made toward embracing cryptocurrencies in public finance. For instance, New Hampshire has passed legislation allowing treasury investments in digital assets, although the threshold is currently limited to cryptocurrencies with market caps exceeding $500 billion, a benchmark XRP has not yet met, while Bitcoin qualifies. Beyond these technical and regulatory issues, the financial system itself presents a structural challenge. Aljarrah himself acknowledged that a severe disruption in the traditional debt market, such as a widespread crisis or erosion of confidence in Treasury securities, might be necessary before alternative frameworks like XRP-backed bonds are seriously considered. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Context: Blockchain in Sovereign Debt While the idea of XRP-backed bonds remains speculative, blockchain-based government debt instruments are already beginning to take shape globally. El Salvador, for example, has explored issuing bonds using Bitcoin as the underlying asset. This reflects a broader trend in the digital finance sector: the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), which is increasingly viewed as a viable pathway for integrating blockchain technology into mainstream finance. Bitcoin-Based Proposals Gain Traction In contrast to XRP, Bitcoin has already been featured in bond-related proposals at the institutional level. During the recent Bitcoin For America summit , Andrew Hohns, CEO of Newmarket Capital, advocated for the U.S. government to issue $2 trillion in bonds, with 10% of that value allocated to Bitcoin. According to Hohns, this strategy, offering a 1% interest rate compared to the standard 4.5% on Treasury bonds, could reduce national debt service costs by $70 billion annually. Similarly, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel has suggested leveraging Bitcoin to help refinance $14 trillion of U.S. debt, signaling growing acceptance of digital assets in fiscal planning. Although Aljarrah’s idea of XRP-backed government bonds is currently more conceptual than practical, it contributes to a larger conversation about the role of blockchain in reshaping public finance. For now, significant volatility, legal uncertainty, and structural inertia limit the feasibility of such instruments. However, the continued exploration of tokenized debt by governments and institutions alike suggests that digital assets may play a growing role in sovereign finance in the years ahead.

In 2028, SHIB can reach a maximum value of $0.000085. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach an average value of $0.000256 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has transformed into a comprehensive Shiba Inu ecosystem, significantly impacting Shiba Inu’s value and utility. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about SHIB’s future and its price trajectory. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs and influence the price action in the market? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and strengthen its position in the crypto market by flashing bullish signals? Will SHIB ever reach $1? In this Shiba Inu price prediction, analyzed by Cryptopolitan, we’ll find out the future SHIB price trends. Overview Cryptocurrency Shiba Inu Token SHIB Price $0.00001405 Market Cap $8.28 Billion Trading Volume $249 Million Circulating Supply 589.24T SHIB All-time High $0.00008845 (Oct 27, 2021) All-time Low $0.00000000008165 (Aug 31, 2020) 24-hour high $0.00001405 24-hour low $0.00001258 Shiba Inu coin price prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.44% 50-Day SMA $ 0.00001291 14-Day RSI 47.51 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 65 (Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $0.00001711 Shiba Inu price analysis: SHIB price skyrockets toward $0.000014 SHIB maintains a strong uptrend toward $0.000014, supported by consistent buying pressure and increasing trading volume. The price broke its consolidation range, positioning itself above EMA trend lines. If SHIB maintains its current buying demand, a breakout above immediate Fib levels could trigger further bullish continuation. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.000014 as of May 8, 2025, showing over 10% daily gain. The token is approaching its immediate resistance level of $0.00001405, with support established at $0.00001258, signaling a well-defined trading range. The bullish breakout is driven by increasing investor demand and sustained trading volume, pushing SHIB higher within a short timeframe. The day’s price movement has been particularly favorable, with SHIB climbing from a low of $0.00001258 to a high of $0.00001405. The skyrocketing trend above the EMA trend lines shows strong buying domination. Shiba on the 1-day chart: SHIB attempts to meet additional buying demand On the 1-day chart, SHIB shows a clean breakout above the previous consolidation zone around $0.00001300, confirming a bullish bias. Price has consistently made higher highs and higher lows, characteristic of a healthy upward trend. Resistance at $0.00001405 is the immediate level to watch; a close above it could open the path for further upside. SHIB/USDT Price Chart The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains within the bullish territory, slightly below overbought levels, suggesting room for continuation of the current bullish trend before any reversal takes place. The trading volume has steadily increased alongside price, indicating increased activity from meme coin traders. The support level at $0.00001258 is critical; if breached, it could lead to a short-term retracement, but current momentum favors the bulls. Shiba on the 4-hour chart: Overbought RSI might trigger correction On the 4-hour chart, SHIB has posted a series of strong green candles, with a significant upward move starting from the $0.00001300 breakout level. The current price action remains bullish, as each dip is being quickly bought up. Price structure indicates a solid intraday uptrend with minimal resistance until the $0.00001405 level. SHIB/USDT Price Chart The MACD continues to print long green bars above the signal line, supporting the upward momentum. Short-term Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are aligned in a bullish stack, confirming trend strength. However, the RSI level is now hovering around the overbought region, at level 73.65. This could be a hurdle for bulls and trigger a minor downward correction to cool down the momentum. SHIB price remains well above the immediate support levels, adding further confidence for short-term bulls.

SHIB is approaching key resistance at $0.00001405, and a breakout above this level could trigger further upside. Momentum and volume support a bullish continuation and they might send the SHIB price toward $0.0000157. If SHIB fails to break resistance, a pullback toward $0.00001258 support is possible. Failing to hold above this level might send the SHIB price toward $0.0000115. Is Shiba Inu a good investment? Shiba Inu (SHIB) continues to draw strong retail interest, supported by sustained volume and a well-defined technical structure. The token’s ability to maintain higher lows and break resistance levels suggests growing market confidence. However, as a high-volatility meme coin, SHIB remains a speculative asset. Investors should consider the broader market environment and personal risk tolerance before committing capital. While short-term momentum is bullish, long-term investment decisions should be based on thorough research and not just technical trends. Why is Shiba Inu up today? Following a rate pause by the Fed in recent FOMC meeting, the market gained momentum. As Bitcoin touched the $100K mark after several months, it triggered a surge in meme coin prices including Shiba Inu. According to our analysis, a breakout could trigger further price gains as SHIB approaches the key resistance at $0.0000157. Will Shiba Inu recover? Buyers are strongly defending a drop below the immediate support channels on the price chart. If SHIB price holds its momentum above $0.000014 level, we might see further surges. Will SHIB reach $0.00005? Yes, according to the long-term SHIB price prediction, the current Shiba Inu price is projected to reach up to $0.00005 by 2027. Will SHIB reach $0.0001 Yes, according to the long-term predictions shared by crypto experts , SHIB is projected to reach up to $0.0001 by 2029. Will SHIB reach $100? Reaching $100 for SHIB is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply in the meme coin market. Additionally, to reach $100 mark, SHIB would require a strong push in its market cap, which is beyond imagination for a meme coin. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? Shiba Inu price made headlines in January 2025 after the Shiba Inu’s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama stepped down. However, SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on partnerships, broader market adoption trends, and other regulatory developments. It is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile crypto market.

While AI promises efficiency and innovation, a critical challenge persists: AI hallucination. This refers to AI models generating false or nonsensical information presented as fact. A recent AI study sheds light on a surprising factor that can worsen this problem: simply asking for concise answers. Why Requesting Concise Answers Impacts AI Hallucination According to a new AI study conducted by Giskard, a company specializing in AI testing, instructing a chatbot to provide short responses can significantly increase its tendency to hallucinate. Researchers found that prompts demanding brevity, especially when dealing with ambiguous or misinformed questions, negatively affect chatbot accuracy. Key findings from the AI study include: Simple changes in system instructions, like asking for short answers, dramatically influence a model’s hallucination rate. Leading generative AI models, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Mistral Large, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, show reduced factual accuracy when forced to be brief. The need for concise answers appears to prioritize brevity over accuracy, potentially leaving no room for models to identify and correct false premises in user prompts. Giskard researchers wrote, “When forced to keep it short, models consistently choose brevity over accuracy.” This suggests that detailed explanations are often necessary for models to effectively debunk misinformation or navigate complex, potentially flawed questions. Implications for Chatbot Accuracy and Generative AI Deployment This AI study has important implications for how generative AI models are deployed and used. Many applications prioritize concise outputs to reduce data usage, improve latency, and minimize costs. However, this focus on efficiency could come at the expense of chatbot accuracy. The tension lies in balancing user experience and technical performance with factual reliability. As the researchers noted, “Optimization for user experience can sometimes come at the expense of factual accuracy.” This is particularly challenging when users ask questions based on false assumptions, such as the example provided: “Briefly tell me why Japan won WWII.” A model forced to be concise might struggle to correct the premise without appearing unhelpful or failing the prompt, leading to a higher chance of hallucination. Beyond Brevity: Other Insights from the AI Study The Giskard AI study also revealed other interesting behaviors of generative AI models: Models are less likely to challenge controversial or incorrect claims when the user presents them confidently. Models that users report preferring are not always the most truthful ones, highlighting a potential disconnect between perceived helpfulness and actual chatbot accuracy. These findings underscore the complexity of building reliable generative AI systems. Achieving high chatbot accuracy requires more than just training on vast datasets; it also involves understanding how prompting and user interaction styles can influence model behavior and the risk of AI hallucination. In summary, the Giskard AI study provides crucial insights into the behavior of modern generative AI. It demonstrates that seemingly simple instructions, like asking for concise answers, can significantly increase the risk of AI hallucination and compromise chatbot accuracy. Developers and users alike must be aware of these nuances to build and interact with AI systems responsibly, prioritizing factual reliability alongside efficiency and user experience.

Following a market resurgence, the flagship asset rebounded above the $99,000 mark. During the sudden price recovery, a significant portion of BTC moved back into profit territory. Millions Of Bitcoins Return To Profit The renewed general market upsurge pushed Bitcoin’s price to key resistance levels. As the cryptocurrency stages a price rebound, Glassnode, a leading financial and on-chain data platform, has called attention to a huge portion of Bitcoin returning to profit. At the time of Glassnode’s report, Bitcoin had gained momentum as its price soared to $97,900, marking the highest level in the past two months. The data shows that more than 3 million BTC are now back in the profit zone, following the price recovery, which provided relief to market participants. The return of previously underwater BTC holdings into profit territory is likely to bolster investor confidence and strengthen market sentiment about the sustainability of the recent rally. Furthermore, the development could set the stage for a potential sustained upside movement to crucial levels such as the $100,000 mark. Presently, the percentage of Bitcoin’s overall supply in profit has risen to 88%, with losses previously concentrated among buyers from the $95,000 and $100,000 range . This positive advancement in supply profitability signals an impending euphoria phase. After examining the supply profit oscillator, Glassnode highlighted that the metric had bounced back from its long-term mean, suggesting a broader resetting of investor expectations without a widespread surrender. Should the percentage of supply in profit continue to increase, it might spark a major rally for BTC as investors’ engagement rises in anticipation of the upsurge. Thus, the ongoing upward move above the $99,000 threshold could be part of a larger trend. Short-Term BTC Holders Selling In The Face Of Growing Profitability While a significant number of BTC returning to profit is believed to trigger investors’ confidence, this is not the case for short-term holders. Alphractal, an advanced on-chain data platform, revealed a surprising trend among these investors even as the recent rebound pushes short-term holders back into profit. According to the on-chain platform, the short-term holders’ cost basis has been hit, but these players are persistently distributing their holdings. Surprisingly, this growing selling pressure is attributed to their return to profitability, raising questions about a potential short-term pullback . Alphractal stated that the STH Realized Price currently stands at $93,400, and Bitcoin should ideally maintain this level in the near future to prevent a fresh selling wave from happening. In the meantime, this area serves as a solid base against pullbacks, and short-term holders will probably make every effort to protect it. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $99,700, demonstrating a nearly 4% rise in the past week. Trading volume has also grown sharply alongside price. CoinMarketCap data shows a more than 60% rise in trading volume in the past day, reflecting bullish conviction.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|Bitcoin supply|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|Glassnode|Profit|Short-Term Holders Realized Price|short-term holders’ cost basis,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-08 19:30:26

Despite the skepticism surrounding ambitious forecasts, the analyst suggests that XRP could eventually rise to $1,000, referencing its exceptional performance during the 2017–2018 bull cycle. Price Behavior and Analyst Optimism Over the past quarter, XRP has maintained a largely sideways trading pattern, fluctuating between localized highs of around $3 and lows near $1.60. This extended period of consolidation has fueled both doubt and hope within the community. While some market observers view this stagnation as a signal of limited growth, others, including analysts such as BarriC , remain optimistic about XRP’s long-term trajectory. People will always say something can’t be done…. Until it happens It happened with $XRP in 2017-2018 when it went from $0.006 to $3.80 And it will happen with #XRP going from $2 to $1,000 — BarriC (@B_arri_C) May 7, 2025 Matthew Brienen , Chief Operating Officer of CryptoGuard, is among those who believe XRP could eventually reach between $100 and $1,000 over the next decade. His outlook aligns with other bullish commentators who continue to reference XRP’s historical precedent to support long-term growth scenarios. Reviewing XRP’s 2017–2018 Bull Run BarriC’s perspective is rooted in XRP’s dramatic performance in the previous market cycle. In early 2017, XRP was trading at approximately $0.0055. Over the following nine months, it experienced a series of substantial gains, culminating in an all-time high of $3.80 in January 2018. This climb represented a staggering increase of nearly 69,000%. Notably, the asset did not follow a straight trajectory to its peak. Initial momentum carried the price up to nearly $0.40 by May 2017, followed by a period of consolidation that lasted until late in the year. The next leg of the rally began in November and drove XRP to its record high in January 2018. BarriC uses this past surge to argue that sharp, unexpected price increases are not without precedent for the token. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Skepticism and Market Cap Considerations Despite the optimistic outlook, many experts remain unconvinced that XRP can replicate this level of growth, particularly to the extent of reaching $1,000. Critics highlight the issue of market capitalization. At that price, XRP’s fully diluted valuation would approach $100 trillion, several times higher than the total market capitalization of gold, which is widely regarded as one of the most valuable global assets. Financial commentator Rajat Soni has strongly dismissed such projections, stating that even targeting $100 is fundamentally unrealistic. He has gone so far as to question the rationality of those who believe such valuations are feasible. While projections of XRP reaching $1,000 are met with significant resistance from financial analysts, proponents like BarriC remain confident that history could repeat itself. Drawing parallels to the asset’s 2017–2018 rally, they maintain that what once seemed improbable ultimately became reality. Whether XRP can achieve similar results again remains a subject of intense debate within the crypto community.

44338992,https://cointelegraph.com/news/mashinksy-enforcement-sentence-court,1746732957,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Mashinsky’s 12-year sentence sets tone of enforcement in Trump era,https://cointelegraph.com/news/mashinksy-enforcement-sentence-court?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"The US federal court for the Southern District of New York has sentenced former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky to 12 years in prison for fraud. Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions. Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher. Source: Polymarket President Donald Trump began his second term with high-profile pardons of crypto executives, signalling that his administration may bring leniency to crypto fraudsters like Mashinsky. His sentencing today, however, suggests otherwise. Trump’s DOJ wants Mashinsky sentence to serve as a warning Crypto-related crimes have their limits, according to the current US Department of Justice. Jay Clayton, the Trump-nomianted US attorney leading the prosecution, said on April 28 that the suggested 20-year sentence serves as a “critical warning to other entrepreneurs, executives, and promoters in the cryptocurrency industry and in any future industry as-yet unconceived: that fraud will be punished severely, regardless of the technology or industry in which it occurs.” Bitcoin advocate Jameson Lopp quotes the prosecution’s argument that Mashinsky targeted retail investors. Source: Jameson Lopp Clayton argued that a strong sentence was warranted as the fraud targeted unsophisticated retail investors rather than institutional parties with protections and expertise. Mashinsky “preyed on ordinary individuals who relied on his promises of safety and financial security.” The Mashinsky defense team drew attention to Mashinsky’s character, highlighting his long career in business, devotion to family and service with the Israel Defense Forces. His lawyers also drew distinctions between Mashinsky’s case and that of Bankman-Fried, claiming, “There are no allegations — let alone any proof — that Alex misappropriated, embezzled or stole any customer assets or any Celsius money.” On May 5, Mashinsky’s legal team argued that these mitigating factors should warrant a sentence of no more than 366 days. “The government’s venom-laced submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” his team said. Mashinsky’s lawyers called the suggested 20-year term a “death-in-prison sentence.” Mashinsky’s sentence follows high-profile Trump pardons for crypto execs Trump started his term with the pardon of Silk Road 2.0 founder Ross Ulbricht, whose acceptance of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on his narcotics trading platform endeared him to the crypto community. The president also commuted the sentences of Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, three BitMEX crypto exchange executives who pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and failing to establish a proper Anti-Money Laundering program. Sam Mangel, a consultant to white-collar convicts who advised former Trump staffer Steve Bannon and Bankman-Fried, told Politico there has been a large spike in interest in presidential pardons. “Everybody that is in prison now is keenly aware of the environment, and it’s become a very hot topic within the low- and minimum-security inmate communities,” said Mangel. Related: US stablecoin bill loses democrats amid Trump corruption concerns High-profile crypto defendants seem to have taken notice, too. Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin advocate and libertarian activist, is facing federal tax evasion charges. In January, he released a video making an outright plea to Trump for a commutation. Ver claimed that he is the victim of lawfare and likened his persecution to Trump’s legal problems following the Jan. 6 scandal. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO of now-defunct exchange FTX, likened his court experience with Trump’s defamation lawsuit in an interview with The New York Sun on Feb. 18. He claimed his trial was politicized under the Biden administration and that he didn’t think there was “a very fair and balanced view or approach.” His parents also reportedly met with lawyers and people close to the Trump administration to explore the possibility of a presidential pardon. Trump’s commutation of the BitMEX executives has even led former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to apply for clemency. On May 6, Zhao said that his lawyers had submitted an application and were awaiting a response. The current administration is still writing the rules of the road as regulators reshuffle personnel and priorities and new legal frameworks for crypto take shape. The picture is further muddled by Trump’s own crypto projects, which have raised concerns over corruption and conflicts of interest. Mashinsky’s sentence shows that, for the financial world, certain crimes will not go unpunished.

Space and Time (STX), the project backed by tech giant Microsoft, has officially launched its permissionless mainnet. This isn’t just any network launch; it’s designed to bring something truly powerful to the table: ZK-proven data infrastructure. This development promises to transform how decentralized applications (dApps) interact with information, making data more secure, verifiable, and accessible than ever before. What Exactly is Space and Time’s ZK Data Infrastructure? At its core, Space and Time is building a decentralized data warehouse. Think of it as a massive, secure database specifically designed for the needs of Web3. What makes it unique is its focus on cryptographic guarantees, particularly through the use of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. Traditional databases require you to trust the operator to provide accurate data. In the decentralized world, where trust minimization is key, this is a problem. Space and Time aims to solve this by allowing anyone to cryptographically verify that the data they are querying is accurate and hasn’t been tampered with, without needing to reveal the underlying sensitive information itself. This is the magic of Zero-Knowledge proofs applied to data querying. The platform is engineered to handle vast amounts of data, both from within blockchain networks and from external, off-chain sources. This capability is crucial for building sophisticated Decentralized applications that need real-world context or data from multiple chains. How Does it Handle Blockchain Data with Zero-Knowledge Proofs? One of the biggest challenges for dApps is reliably accessing and using Blockchain data , especially data from different chains or data that originates outside the blockchain entirely. Space and Time tackles this head-on. Here’s a simplified look at how it works: Data Ingestion: Space and Time pulls data from various sources – multiple blockchains (cross-chain data) and off-chain databases or APIs. Processing: This data is processed and stored in their decentralized data warehouse. Querying: Developers and users can query this data using standard SQL. ZK Proof Generation: For every query, Space and Time generates a cryptographic proof (a ZK proof) that verifies the computation and the integrity of the data returned. This proof confirms that the query was executed correctly on the actual, untampered data set. Verification: Anyone can verify this ZK proof on-chain, ensuring the query result is trustworthy without needing to trust Space and Time itself or see all the data. This process essentially bridges the gap between verifiable on-chain activity and the vast amounts of off-chain data needed for complex applications, all while maintaining a high degree of trustlessness thanks to Zero-Knowledge proofs . Why is This Crucial for Decentralized Applications (dApps)? The launch of the Space and Time mainnet with its ZK capabilities opens up a world of possibilities for Decentralized applications . Until now, many dApps have been limited by their inability to securely and reliably access and verify data beyond their native chain. This new infrastructure changes that. Benefits for dApps include: Enhanced Functionality: Build dApps that react to real-world events, integrate data from various sources (e.g., supply chain data, financial market feeds), or provide analytics across multiple chains. Increased Trust & Security: Users can have higher confidence in dApps that use ZK-proven data, knowing the information driving the application is verifiable. New Use Cases: Enables more complex applications in areas like DeFi (risk assessment based on off-chain data), gaming (integrating real-world game stats), supply chain (tracking goods with verifiable data), and more. Improved Performance: Offloading complex data queries to Space and Time can potentially improve the performance and reduce the costs associated with performing such operations directly on a blockchain. Major networks and developers are already reportedly using or testing this infrastructure, a testament to its potential impact on the dApp ecosystem. The Significance of the Space and Time Mainnet Launch The move to a permissionless Space and Time mainnet is a critical milestone. It means the platform is now open for anyone to build on and utilize its powerful ZK data infrastructure . This shift from a potentially more controlled environment to a fully open one aligns with the core principles of decentralization. This launch signifies that the technology is maturing and ready for broader adoption by developers looking to build the next generation of dApps that require verifiable access to both Blockchain data and off-chain information. Looking Ahead: The SXT Token and Future Impact Adding to the excitement, Space and Time’s native token, SXT, is scheduled for release on May 8. While the exact utility of the token will become clearer upon launch, native tokens in similar ecosystems often play roles in: Paying for data queries and computation on the network. Staking to secure the network or participate in validation. Governance, allowing token holders to vote on the future direction of the protocol. The SXT token launch is expected to further decentralize the network and incentivize participation in its ecosystem. As more Decentralized applications leverage Space and Time’s capabilities, the demand for its services and potentially the SXT token could grow. Conclusion: A Leap Forward for Verifiable Data The launch of the Space and Time permissionless mainnet marks a significant step forward for verifiable data infrastructure in the Web3 space. By combining secure data warehousing with cutting-edge Zero-Knowledge proofs , Space and Time is empowering developers to build more robust, trustworthy, and functional Decentralized applications that can finally bridge the gap between on-chain and off-chain data worlds. This ZK data infrastructure is poised to become a foundational layer for the next wave of innovation in blockchain technology, making secure and verifiable Blockchain data accessible to everyone.

In a recent post on X , Gordon reported that a senior contact at BlackRock shared insights regarding growing interest in digital assets among the firm’s ultra-wealthy clients, with XRP specifically mentioned as a focus of attention. Had lunch with my friend Alex earlier (he’s high up at Blackrock) He said that the majority of his clients ($50M networth and above) have been increasingly interested in crypto, apparently there is some HUGE news coming soon regarding XRP Will let you know when I hear more — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) May 6, 2025 Increased Demand for Crypto Among High-Net-Worth Investors According to the post, individuals with net worth exceeding $50 million are now actively inquiring about exposure to cryptocurrencies. Gordon suggested that a significant development involving XRP may be forthcoming, although he did not provide concrete evidence or additional details. He indicated that updates would follow as more information became available. This statement has reignited discussion within the XRP community, which has long speculated on the possibility of BlackRock becoming directly involved with the token. Although some have welcomed the post as a potential sign of institutional momentum, others criticized it for lacking verifiable sources, dismissing it as speculative and overly reliant on anecdotal input. Community Expectations and Industry Trends The XRP community has previously drawn connections between the asset and BlackRock, often based on unconfirmed reports and perceived indicators. Many believe that any move by BlackRock to officially support XRP, whether through accumulation or investment vehicles like ETFs , would be a pivotal moment for the asset’s long-term value proposition. Notably, a number of major asset managers have already submitted applications to offer XRP-based investment products in the United States. Grayscale, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton are among the firms pursuing approval for XRP exchange-traded funds. However, BlackRock has not yet entered this arena, despite its established presence in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. ETF Landscape and Market Influence BlackRock’s participation is viewed as a potential game-changer due to the firm’s dominance in the ETF space. Its Bitcoin spot ETF has attracted approximately $44.25 billion in assets, while its Ethereum spot ETF has seen inflows of over $4.2 billion. In comparison, Franklin Templeton’s similar offerings have captured far smaller market shares, with their Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs bringing in $250 million and $36.5 million, respectively. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Given this stark contrast, industry experts suggest that a BlackRock-backed XRP ETF would likely draw the highest level of institutional capital among similar products. Nate Geraci, President of ETFStore, has commented that he expects BlackRock to eventually pursue an XRP ETF, potentially outpacing its competitors in the same way it has with Bitcoin and Ethereum. Legal Clarity May Be Key Market analysts believe that any formal move by BlackRock toward launching an XRP ETF will likely depend on the outcome of Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With negotiations between Ripple and the SEC reportedly underway, clarity around XRP’s regulatory classification could pave the way for broader institutional participation. Until official confirmations are made, discussions around BlackRock’s involvement with XRP remain speculative. However, increasing demand among high-net-worth investors and the evolving regulatory environment suggest that institutional engagement with XRP may expand shortly.

44339301,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158662,1746733804,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"1inch Team Fund Executes Strategic WBTC Sell, Securing Substantial Crypto Profit",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/1inch-team-fund-sells/,"In the fast-paced world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency trading, keeping an eye on the moves made by prominent entities can offer valuable insights. Recently, attention has turned to the actions of the 1inch team fund , which has completed a notable transaction involving Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). This move, tracked through publicly available on-chain data , highlights strategic asset management and profit realization within the crypto space. What Did the 1inch Team Fund Do? According to analysis shared by on-chain expert @EmberCN, the 1inch team fund has finalized its position in WBTC. The fund sold its remaining 55.38 WBTC, completing a series of transactions that began earlier in the year. This final sale was executed at a price of $99,283 per WBTC, totaling approximately $5.5 million. This sale is significant because it represents the full divestment of a position the fund had built. Tracking these movements via on-chain data provides transparency into how large holders manage their portfolios in response to market conditions. A Look at the WBTC Trading Strategy The recent WBTC sell wasn’t an isolated event but the conclusion of a trading strategy. The 1inch team fund had previously accumulated a substantial amount of WBTC. Here’s a breakdown of their activity: Purchases: Between February 2 and March 10, the fund bought 160.8 WBTC. Average Buy Price: These purchases were made at an average price of $88,395 per WBTC. Sales: The fund sold its WBTC holdings in stages, including the final 55.38 WBTC. Average Sell Price: Across all sales, the average selling price was $94,219 per WBTC. This sequence of buying and selling demonstrates a calculated approach to capitalizing on market movements during that period. Did the Fund Make a Crypto Profit? One of the key takeaways from this activity is the financial outcome. By buying at a lower average price and selling at a higher average price, the 1inch team fund successfully realized a profit on its WBTC holdings. The reported profit from this specific trading strategy amounts to $936,000. Realizing a substantial crypto profit is the primary objective for many funds and traders. This example illustrates how active management and timely execution, informed by market analysis and potentially on-chain data , can lead to significant gains, even within relatively short timeframes. Why Does Crypto Fund Activity Matter? Monitoring the trading patterns of entities like the 1inch team fund offers several benefits for market observers and participants: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large fund movements can sometimes signal broader market sentiment or expectations. Strategy Insights: Analyzing their buy and sell points provides insights into potentially successful trading strategies. Transparency: Public on-chain data allows anyone to verify these transactions, adding a layer of transparency often missing in traditional finance. Potential Market Impact: Large trades can have short-term effects on the price of the asset being traded, although the impact of this specific WBTC sale was likely limited in the broader market context. Understanding the actions of a crypto fund can help individuals refine their own trading approaches or simply stay informed about significant capital flows within the ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations in Crypto Trading While the 1inch team fund realized a profit, crypto trading isn’t without its challenges. Market volatility means prices can change rapidly, potentially eroding gains or leading to losses. Timing entries and exits perfectly is incredibly difficult. Furthermore, relying solely on on-chain data , while powerful, needs to be combined with other forms of market analysis to form a complete picture. Actionable Insights from This Event For those interested in crypto trading or market analysis, this event offers a few actionable insights: Leverage On-Chain Data: Tools and analysts tracking on-chain data can provide early signals about significant holder activity. Understand Fund Strategies: Observing how professional funds build and exit positions can inform your own approach. Focus on Average Prices: Profit is determined by the difference between average buy and average sell prices over time, not just individual trades. Risk Management: Even profitable strategies involve risk; funds manage this through position sizing and timing. The successful WBTC sell by the 1inch team fund serves as a practical example of a profitable trading strategy executed within the current market environment. Conclusion: A Profitable Exit for the 1inch Team Fund The decision by the 1inch team fund to sell its remaining 55.38 WBTC marks the successful conclusion of a profitable trading strategy. By accumulating WBTC at an average price below their selling average, the fund was able to secure a significant crypto profit of nearly $1 million. This move, transparently visible through on-chain data , underscores the potential for strategic trading in the crypto markets and provides valuable insights for anyone following the movements of major players like this crypto fund .

The pact, hailed as a “ historic day ” by both UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump, will slash tariffs on a range of exports, helping to preserve thousands of UK jobs in sectors such as automotive manufacturing, steel, and agriculture. The UK reportedly becomes the first country to strike a deal with the US after it imposed sweeping tariffs on imports into the US. The US and UK trade deal makes provision for several goods Announced days after a similar deal with India, this UK-US agreement represents a substantial shift in transatlantic trade relations. Under the terms of the deal, US tariffs on British car exports will drop from 27.5% to 10% for up to 100,000 vehicles annually—a figure that nearly matches total UK automotive exports to the US last year. Jaguar Land Rover, a key beneficiary, is expected to save hundreds of millions of pounds. “This deal secures greater certainty for our sector and the communities it supports,” said JLR CEO Adrian Mardell, who emphasized the vital role of the car industry in sustaining 250,000 UK jobs. Equally significant is the removal of a 25% tariff on UK steel exports, a move that comes just weeks after the British steel industry teetered on the edge of collapse. The agreement follows Prime Minister Starmer’s direct intervention to stabilize British Steel, ensuring operations in places like Scunthorpe continue and thousands of jobs are maintained. “This is jobs saved, jobs won, but not job done,” said Starmer . “My government is determined to go further and faster to strengthen the UK’s economy, putting more money in working people’s pockets as part of our Plan for Change.” Starmer. The agreement also includes provisions for agricultural trade. British farmers will be able to export up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef to the US tariff-free, while maintaining strict domestic food safety standards. Trump acknowledged that while there would be no relaxation of UK beef import rules, the US would benefit from “unprecedented” new market access, citing a $5 billion opportunity for American exporters. UK reciprocates the gesture In a reciprocal move, the UK will eliminate tariffs on ethanol—used heavily in British manufacturing—and provide greater access to UK markets for US ethanol, machinery, and vehicles. Trump, who announced the deal from the Oval Office, praised it as “a tremendous trade deal for both countries.” While some details remain unresolved, including digital service taxes affecting US tech firms, Trump said, “The final details are being written up and will be concluded in the coming weeks.” The agreement has also sparked optimism around broader collaboration. A future partnership is being discussed in advanced technologies, including biotech, nuclear fusion, quantum computing, and aerospace. The deal is also expected to pave the way for a digital trade pact aimed at reducing paperwork for British firms exporting to the US. Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds called the agreement “a major win” for UK industries. “Our calm and proactive approach has cut tariffs for UK industry and cut costs for businesses. But this is only the beginning—we are working towards a broader economic framework with the US.” Reynolds. Though questions remain, particularly around pharmaceuticals and digital taxation, both governments have agreed that the UK will receive preferential treatment in any future tariff investigations under Section 232 . As Prime Minister Starmer noted that: “The new global era demands a government that steps up, not stands aside.” With back-to-back deals with India and the United States, the UK appears to be making a decisive statement on its post-Brexit economic strategy—one built on strong global alliances and protecting domestic industries.

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 546,600 followers on the social media platform X that if the crypto king can stay above a key level, it could shoot up to $104,500 by the middle of June. “Bitcoin is on the cusp of breaking its downtrend dating to mid-December 2024 (black diagonal). Bitcoin just needs to stay above ~$98,700 for the retest of the week to position itself for a breakout towards $104,500 (red).” Source: Rekt Capital/X According to the trader, BTC is almost done with its first price discovery correction period, a time, he says, was an optimal time for investors to reaccumulate the flagship digital asset. “Bitcoin has almost concluded its first price discovery correction period. Granted, the corrective phase lasted longer than has historically been the case. But it didn’t change the fact that the correction was an optimal re-accumulation opportunity with a high probability of price reversal to the upside. Bitcoin is just below $100,000 right now.” In December, Rekt Capital noted that BTC’s price discovery correction phase was starting. The analyst goes on to say that, based on historical precedent, altcoin season should start in early 2025 after BTC dominance begins to falter around 71%. Currently, BTC’s dominance level, or the percentage of the total crypto market cap it takes up, is sitting at about 65%. “If history repeats, the real Altseason everybody is waiting for would begin once Bitcoin Dominance rejects from 71% (red) And right now, 71% is only ~6% away.” Source: Rekt Capital/X BTC is trading for $100,792 at time of writing, a 4.2% gain during the last 24 hours.

44339655,https://timestabloid.com/?p=66659,1746734264,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Breaks Falling Wedge Pattern. Breakout Imminent,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-breaks-falling-wedge-pattern-breakout-imminent/,"Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme token by market capitalization, has recently broken out of a falling wedge formation, triggering speculation about a potential upward move toward the $0.000015 resistance level. A modest 5.2% gain in the last 24 hours accompanies this technical breakout, as short-term market sentiment for meme coins turns optimistic. Technical Indicators Suggest Bullish Momentum Following a rapid rebound from the $0.00001240 support level, SHIB has posted four consecutive daily gains. This price action confirms a breakout from a multi-week resistance trendline, signaling a potential trend reversal. The asset is now trading at approximately $0.00001277 and is testing the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a crucial level that often acts as dynamic resistance. If the price maintains momentum and closes above the 200 EMA, currently near $0.00001297, it could validate the breakout and support further upside. A bullish crossover in the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator further reinforces the possibility of an emerging uptrend, with both the MACD and signal lines turning positive. However, some caution remains warranted. The 50-day and 100-day EMA lines are displaying a negative crossover, and unless SHIB sustains its bullish trajectory, a “death cross” between the 50-day and 200-day EMAs could materialize. Continued upward movement would be necessary to avoid this bearish development. Forecasting SHIB Price Targets with Fibonacci Analysis Using a trend-based Fibonacci retracement tool, analysts have identified potential price levels for SHIB if the breakout holds. The next key resistance lies at the 23.60% Fibonacci level of $0.00001344. A successful break above this point could clear the path toward the 61.80% retracement level at $0.00001531, representing a potential upside of approximately 20% from current prices. Historically, falling wedge breakouts often lead to a retest of previous swing highs. In SHIB’s case, this would place a medium-term target slightly above the $0.000015 psychological threshold. However, if the rally loses steam, the token may revisit the $0.00001240 support zone. A breakdown from this level could lead to a deeper correction toward $0.00001156. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On-Chain Metrics Indicate Growing Demand On-chain analysis from IntoTheBlock offers additional support for a bullish outlook. The “In/Out of the Money Around Price” (IOMAP) data shows that SHIB is currently navigating a critical price zone around $0.000013. This level represents a high-activity area where many addresses acquired tokens, suggesting strong interest and potential resistance. Data indicates that approximately 12.11 trillion SHIB is held by over 18,000 addresses, slightly above the current price, forming a supply zone. However, the volume of SHIB held by addresses currently in profit is significantly larger, indicating growing buying pressure that could facilitate continued upward movement. As SHIB attempts to build on its recent breakout, the relatively low volume in upcoming resistance zones may further strengthen the possibility of a sustained bullish trend.

A keen market observer noticed this astronomic rise of both investors’ interest and technical indicators which revealed the future movement of XRP. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently become the focus of this experienced expert who forecasts the protocol will expand by an astounding 13,380%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates in its fourth presale phase while gaining $7.8 million and securing 9,600 holders with over 448 million token sales that indicates a strong potential for future growth. But what factors drive Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to attract widespread attention? XRP’s Q4 2024 Surge XRP maintains strong upward movement in its market performance. At a starting price of $0.50 during November 2024 XRP climbed to $3.39 in January 2025 when combined with increased network usage and substantial institutional support. XRP’s price surged by 578% after showing a Bull Flag pattern within technical indicators that triggered a strong market upward trend. The regulatory issues XRP faces do not reduce its attraction because of its existing utility in cross-border payment solutions. Extension of its growth path requires extensive adoption by users but this key development will probably slow short-term value gains. The cautious attitude towards future prospects drives investors toward the promising project MUTM where they can access tangible benefits along with growth opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) generates strong interest because its fourth presale phase has reached 60% of completion. The presale phase sells at $0.025 which has attracted 9,600 owners who have collectively invested $7.8 million. Investors acquire MUTM tokens now at $0.025 because the upcoming presale phase will propel the token to $0.03 with the tokenomics system guiding prices to $0.06 during the exchange debut. Proficient analysts predict MUTM will reach $3.50 after its launch while offering potential investors up to 13,380% ROI during its early stages. A Certik smart contract audit is nearing completion by the team before planned social media announcement to strengthen credibility. Phase four growth operates under a predefined plan that creates an urgent need because capacity reaches its limit. Innovative Lending Model The lending platform of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings disruptive changes to the DeFi space. Users gain interest through mtTokens when they provide assets to liquidity pools as the tokens automatically increase in value with time. Users acquire funding through asset contributions which surpass the value of the requested funds for security purposes. The application enables users to engage in direct loans through its peer-to-peer feature which provides improved flexibility. The MUTM dashboard currently features the top 50 token holders who receive bonus tokens by preserving their rank positions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto market through its loyalty incentive mechanisms which boost demand as well as through its secure position in the market. Tapping Into DeFi’s Future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings forth a guiding light among DeFi’s progressive development framework. The combination between well-designed crypto token models and practical usage with a quickly expanding presale signals early success similar to XRP’s expected 2024 performance. The analyst made a daring prediction that MUTM could bring 13,380% worth of opportunity in decentralized lending value. The time becomes shorter for investors to obtain MUTM tokens before the fourth phase completes at its current price of $0.025.

According to the Wall Street Journal’s report , the company will acquire Deribit, a cryptocurrency futures and options exchange, for $2.9 billion. This deal includes $700 million in cash and 11 million Coinbase Class A common stock shares. Coinbase Acquisition Brings Lots of Benefits The Dubai-based Deribit specializes in trading options, futures, and spot trading for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). In 2024, Deribit’s trading volume nearly doubled to $1.2 trillion, mainly because more institutional investors got involved. As such, this acquisition is an essential step for Coinbase as it enters the profitable crypto derivatives market. Meanwhile, the acquisition happens amid a surge in crypto-industry deal-making, driven by a favorable regulatory environment under President Trump’s administration. It is worth noting that Coinbase plans to use this acquisition to expand globally and take advantage of the increase in crypto trading activity. If the deal goes through, Coinbase would transfer Deribit’s operating license to the US. Notably, this potential deal shows growing interest in the increasingly competitive crypto derivative market. Kraken, a leading asset manager, has also entered this space. The company recently acquired NinjaTrader in a deal worth $1.5 billion. Deribit Looks to Enter the US Market Recently, the world’s largest crypto options exchange started considering expanding its operations into the U.S. market . Last year, the company processed $1.3 trillion in notional volume. However, the exchange is now looking beyond its Dubai base to explore new opportunities in the United States. Deribit’s CEO, Luuk Strijers, revealed why the exchange is considering entering the US market. Strijers believes that the US is becoming more supportive of the crypto industry, as there have been recent changes in the country’s crypto regulations. However, these relaxed crypto rules come after crypto firms in the country have faced challenges over the past few years . Sygnum Bank Integrates Deribit in Expansion Move Recall that crypto-friendly financial institution Sygnum Bank expanded its business by integrating Deribit into its custody platform. This move is significant as it presents institutional clients with the avenue to store their assets in a regulated bank. Likewise, the clients would enjoy direct access to Deribit’s liquidity. As reported by TheCoinRise, both entities will leverage Fireblocks’ “Off-Exchange” service. With this service, traders can “mirror” their assets held in custody on a trading platform. Meanwhile, Deribit sees this integration as an opportunity to provide additional security and transparency to institutional clients.

44339712,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=158664,1746734404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Missouri Bill Offers Unprecedented Capital Gains Tax Freedom on Crypto, Stocks, Real Estate",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/missouri-capital-gains-exemption/,"For investors navigating the complex world of assets, particularly in the rapidly evolving digital asset space, tax implications are always a major consideration. The potential for significant gains often comes with the reality of capital gains taxes. However, a groundbreaking development in Missouri is poised to change this landscape dramatically for residents. What is the Missouri Capital Gains Tax Exemption Bill? In a move that could set a precedent for other states, the Missouri House of Representatives has passed a significant bill aimed at providing substantial tax relief to investors. This proposed legislation seeks to fully exempt capital gains taxes on several key asset classes: stocks, real estate, and notably, cryptocurrencies. This makes Missouri the first state in the U.S. to adopt such a comprehensive policy covering these diverse investment types. The bill, which originated in the state legislature, reflects a growing interest among policymakers in fostering economic growth and attracting investment by reducing tax burdens. By eliminating capital gains taxes on these assets, Missouri aims to encourage long-term investment and potentially draw new residents and businesses to the state. According to reports, including one from @solidintel_x, the bill has successfully cleared the House and is now awaiting the signature of the governor to become law. This final step is crucial for the bill’s enactment, and investors across the state and potentially nationwide are closely watching for the outcome. How Does This Impact Crypto Tax Missouri Residents Pay? For cryptocurrency holders in Missouri, this bill represents a potentially massive shift. Currently, gains from selling, trading, or otherwise disposing of cryptocurrencies held for over a year are typically taxed at long-term capital gains rates at the federal level, and in many states, at the state level as well. Short-term gains (assets held for a year or less) are usually taxed at ordinary income rates. If signed into law, this bill would eliminate the state-level capital gains tax liability on these transactions for Missouri residents. This means that profits realized from the appreciation of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency would not be subject to a state tax when sold or exchanged, regardless of the holding period (assuming the exemption applies broadly to both short-term and long-term gains, which is typical for a full exemption). This could have several positive effects: Increased Trading Activity: Lowering or eliminating the tax burden can incentivize more frequent and larger transactions. Encouraging Long-Term Holding: While a full exemption benefits all holding periods, it particularly rewards those who have seen significant appreciation over time without the looming state tax bill upon selling. Attracting Crypto Investors: Missouri could become a more attractive domicile for individuals heavily invested in cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to an influx of wealth and talent. Simplified Tax Reporting: While federal taxes still apply, eliminating state capital gains tax simplifies the overall tax calculation and reporting process for crypto investors in the state. Why is a Capital Gains Tax Exemption Significant? A capital gains tax exemption is a powerful economic tool. Capital gains taxes are levied on the profit made from the sale of an asset that has increased in value. These taxes can represent a significant percentage of an investor’s returns, potentially discouraging investment or encouraging investors to hold onto assets longer than they otherwise might (the ‘lock-in effect’). By removing this tax barrier, Missouri is making a strong statement in favor of investment and wealth creation within its borders. The exemption applies not just to crypto but also to traditional assets like stocks and real estate, broadening its potential impact significantly. This holistic approach recognizes the interconnectedness of various investment markets and aims to provide a favorable environment for all types of investors. Benefits of the Exemption: Stimulates Investment: Makes investing more financially rewarding, potentially leading to increased capital flow into Missouri businesses and real estate. Boosts Economic Activity: Increased investment can lead to job creation and overall economic growth. Attracts High Net Worth Individuals: States with favorable tax laws often attract wealthy residents, who bring tax revenue from other sources (like income tax) and contribute to the local economy. Signals a Pro-Innovation Stance: Including cryptocurrency in the exemption signals that Missouri is forward-thinking and open to digital asset innovation. Could This Bill Influence Stock Tax Missouri Residents Pay? Absolutely. While the focus for many in the crypto space is on digital assets, the bill’s inclusion of stocks is equally significant for traditional investors. Gains from selling stocks, mutual funds, and other securities held in taxable accounts are currently subject to both federal and state capital gains taxes in Missouri. The proposed exemption would mean that profits from selling stocks would no longer be taxed at the state level. This could encourage residents to invest more actively in the stock market or reallocate their portfolios without the state tax penalty on realized gains. For retirees living on investment income or individuals saving for major life events through brokerage accounts, this represents a substantial potential saving. This part of the bill aligns Missouri with states that already have no state income tax or no state capital gains tax, making it more competitive in attracting residents who are heavily invested in the public markets. What About Real Estate and Other Assets Under Missouri Crypto Law? The exemption extends to real estate, which is a major asset class for many Missourians. Selling a primary residence often has federal exemptions (up to a certain gain), but gains on investment properties, second homes, or commercial real estate are typically subject to capital gains taxes. Eliminating the state tax on these gains could significantly impact real estate investors and developers. For example, someone selling a rental property that has appreciated significantly would save a considerable amount on state taxes, potentially freeing up capital for reinvestment in other properties or businesses within the state. This could stimulate the real estate market, encouraging transactions and development. While the primary assets mentioned are crypto, stocks, and real estate, the exact wording of the bill will clarify if other capital assets are included under the ‘Missouri crypto law’ umbrella or if the exemption is strictly limited to these three categories. Investors should review the final text if the bill is signed into law to understand its full scope. Challenges and Considerations While the benefits for investors are clear, a move like this isn’t without potential challenges or criticisms: Impact on State Revenue: Capital gains taxes contribute to state budgets. Eliminating this source of revenue could put pressure on other areas of state finance, potentially requiring cuts elsewhere or shifts in other tax burdens. Equity Concerns: Critics might argue that capital gains tax exemptions disproportionately benefit wealthier individuals who hold significant taxable assets, while offering little direct benefit to lower-income residents. Economic Forecasting: Predicting the exact economic impact is complex. Will the increased investment and potential influx of wealthy residents offset the lost tax revenue? This is a key question policymakers will need to monitor. These are important considerations in the broader debate about tax policy and its role in state economies. Actionable Insights for Investors If you are a Missouri resident invested in crypto, stocks, or real estate, or if you are considering moving to Missouri, here are some actionable steps: Monitor the Bill’s Status: Keep a close eye on news regarding the governor’s decision. The bill is not law until signed. Understand the Details: If signed, review the full text of the law to understand the specifics – which assets are covered, effective dates, and any limitations. Consult a Tax Professional: Tax laws are complex. Speak with a tax advisor familiar with both federal and Missouri state tax laws to understand how this change (if enacted) affects your specific financial situation and investment strategy. Evaluate Your Portfolio: Consider how the elimination of state capital gains tax might influence your future investment decisions, such as realizing gains or rebalancing your portfolio. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Missouri Missouri’s potential move to fully exempt capital gains taxes on crypto, stocks, and real estate is a bold and unprecedented step in U.S. state tax policy. By aiming to eliminate a significant tax burden on investment profits, the state is signaling a strong desire to become a hub for capital and innovation. While questions remain about the long-term economic impact and the governor’s final decision, this bill represents a significant development that could substantially benefit investors and reshape Missouri’s economic landscape.

Web3 ai introduces a new layer of intelligence to crypto trading by removing the need for code, offering a fully automated bot powered by reinforcement learning. This shift positions Web3 ai as more than just another platform; it’s a functional toolkit built for hands-free decision-making. For those seeking the top crypto to invest in, automation may be the edge. Web3 ai’s No-Code Trading Bot Turns Passive Income Into a Power Move For those searching for the top crypto to invest in, the game is changing, and Web3 ai is leading the shift. One of its most talked-about features is the AI Trading Bot, a no-code, reinforcement-learning tool that executes trades 24/7 across multiple exchanges. In other words, no scripts, no setup, just pure, automated performance that improves with every trade it makes. Designed for crypto investors who want the edge without the workload, the bot analyzes technical indicators, tracks market sentiment, and adjusts strategies in real time, all without any human intervention. Whether you’re asleep, working, or offline, this bot keeps trading. More importantly, it’s not just a gimmick. This level of automation used to require complex code and expensive infrastructure. Now, thanks to Web3 ai’s machine learning engine, it’s built right into the platform and accessible with a few clicks. As a result, over $1 million was raised in days during the presale. Currently priced at just $0.000315 in stage 2, the $WAI token will list at $0.005242 post-presale, offering early adopters a shot at 1747% returns. Furthermore, with analysts already eyeing the $1 mark as a future target, the upside potential is creating serious FOMO. All things considered, the decision is simple: automate your trading strategy now, or watch others reap the benefits while you wait on the sidelines. Web3 ai isn’t just making tools, it’s building a system that thinks, acts, and earns for you. With the crypto presale heating up fast, this might be the smartest passive income move of 2025. Pepe (PEPE) Prediction: Can the Meme Coin Sustain Its Momentum? Pepe (PEPE) has captured significant attention in the crypto community, with its price currently hovering around $0.0000084. To begin with, analysts suggest that while PEPE could face short-term resistance at $0.000010, a breakout beyond this level might pave the way for further gains. On the other hand, some experts express caution, noting that PEPE’s recent price predictions have softened, and its trajectory may depend heavily on broader market trends and investor sentiment. Nevertheless, despite these concerns, PEPE’s strong community support and viral appeal continue to drive interest. If the coin maintains its current momentum and overcomes resistance levels, it could potentially reach new highs. Therefore, investors are advised to monitor market developments closely and consider both the opportunities and risks associated with PEPE. Polkadot (DOT) Update: Analysts Forecast Steady Growth Ahead Polkadot (DOT) is drawing attention with its projected upward trajectory. Specifically, analysts anticipate that by 2025, DOT could reach a maximum price of $5.91, with a minimum estimate of $5.10 and an average around $5.30. Looking further ahead, forecasts suggest that by 2030, DOT might attain a maximum value of $42.16, with a minimum of $35.89 and an average trading price of $37.12. These projections are underpinned by Polkadot’s commitment to enhancing its ecosystem, including plans to support up to 1000 parachains. In turn, such developments aim to bolster network scalability and interoperability, potentially influencing DOT’s market performance positively. Ultimately, while market conditions can fluctuate, the current Polkadot (DOT) update indicates a cautiously optimistic outlook. As a result, investors and enthusiasts are keeping a close eye on these developments, considering them in their strategic decisions. From Hype to Hands-Free Speculation will always have its place in crypto, but tools that offer tangible utility are beginning to stand out. While Pepe (PEPE) leans on viral potential and Polkadot (DOT) builds toward long-term scalability, Web3 ai delivers a ready-to-use solution that addresses everyday investor needs. It’s a no-code trading bot that simplifies complex strategies into fully automated performance, making it accessible without sacrificing sophistication.

EOS , Ethena , and IOTA are drawing attention with their recent activities. The market is buzzing with anticipation around these digital assets. Readers will discover which coins are primed for potential growth. EOS Market Update: 75% 6-Month Surge and Bullish Key Levels EOS recorded an 8% gain in the last month and an impressive 75% surge over the past six months. The price action demonstrated steady growth, defying market volatility with a strong recovery. Throughout this period, EOS managed to hold its ground, attracting positive sentiment among traders as its technical indicators showed consistent improvement. Currently, EOS is testing a support level at $0.41 and a resistance level at $1.01, with an additional target at $1.32. A recent increase of 23.52% within the week and an RSI of 69.16 indicate robust bullish momentum. Traders might consider buying near support while watching for breakouts above resistance to capitalize on potential upward movements. Ethena Trading Range Sparks Mixed Signals ENA past price action shows a slight monthly gain of 2.02% offset by a steep six-month loss of 40.10%. The coin has experienced a modest recovery in the short term while still struggling from a deeper setback over half a year. The data indicates a volatile history influenced by broader market trends. Current prices lay between $0.25 and $0.39, with immediate resistance near $0.45 and further overhead at $0.59, while support is tracked at $0.18 and $0.05. Bears hold control as negative momentum and oscillator readings point to a lack of clear uptrend. Traders should consider ranges and key levels for potential entry or exit opportunities. IOTA Price Surge and Key Levels IOTA price over the past month has seen a notable rise with a 42.60% increase, while the half-year trend shows a 76.05% climb. The coin has experienced steady upward movement during these periods, indicating strong historical growth. Recent gains of 3.58% over the week add to a record of robust performance. Current prices trade in a range between $0.1441 and $0.2555. Resistance is seen near $0.30 and $0.41 while support is found around $0.08. The RSI of 61.15 and a slightly positive Awesome Oscillator suggest that bulls are active despite a minor negative momentum reading. Trading within these levels may offer opportunities to capitalize on dips near support and manage risk as prices approach resistance levels. Conclusion EOS , Ethena , and IOTA are gaining traction. EOS is showing increased activity with new developments. Ethena is attracting attention with its unique features. IOTA is making headlines due to partnerships and advancements. Keep an eye on how each of these evolves in the coming weeks. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The analytics platform says the whales and sharks that hold between 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin have collectively added BTC worth $7.89 billion in about one and a half months. “As May progresses, Bitcoin’s key stakeholders are mostly moving in the right direction if you’re rooting for $100,000 BTC in the near future. Wallets with the highest correlation with crypto’s overall market health (10 – 10,000 BTC wallets) have accumulated a combined 81,338 more BTC (+0.61% of their holdings) during these past six weeks of volatility.” According to Santiment, the accumulation by the Bitcoin investor cohorts is a bullish signal. “When large wallets gradually accumulate in tandem with retail panic selling/selling out of boredom, it is generally a strong long-term sign of prices biding their time before another breakout.” The crypto analytics platform further says the holdings of smaller Bitcoin wallets have fallen as the whales and sharks were accumulating. “Meanwhile, small wallets that tend to have an inverse, lagging correlation to price (wallets with less than 0.1 BTC) have dumped 290 BTC (-0.60% of their holdings) in the past six weeks.” Source: Santiment/X Turning to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) inflows, Santiment says , “…Bitcoin ETF inflow money has been sky-high since mid-April.

Whether it’s OpenAI’s AutoGPT or Shopify’s Sidekick, these automated systems now drive workflows, handle moderation, and enhance interaction. In the decentralized Web3 space, where activity runs nonstop and communities grow fast, smart autonomous support is more than useful; it’s essential. This is exactly where Unstaked (UNSD) stands out, and why it’s steadily positioning itself as one of the most grounded and forward-looking crypto presales in 2025. Unstaked is creating the first AI agent protocol that functions entirely on-chain, developed specifically for Web3 platforms. These agents can support chats, guide users, manage groups, and help grow online communities on platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram. Instead of focusing on theoretical AI tools or vague features, Unstaked will release functional agents after launch that complete real tasks with full visibility. AI Agents Are Rising, Web3 Is Where They Matter Most The popularity of autonomous agents is growing fast. Projects like BabyAGI and AutoGPT prove how these systems can operate independently, break tasks into steps, and manage entire sequences. While Web2 companies are using them for things like support and logistics, the decentralized Web3 space has an even deeper need. Right now, many DAOs, NFT communities, and DeFi setups rely heavily on human moderators and paid managers to function day to day. This approach is not only expensive but also struggles to scale or stay consistent. As more Web3 platforms grow, the demand for reliable, always-on support increases too. Unstaked steps in with its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) mechanism, a fully on-chain system that tracks and scores how agents perform. Every task, reply, or post gets recorded and evaluated. Agents only earn rewards by meeting quality and output standards. The setup is fully transparent, there’s no way to manipulate it behind the scenes. This structure mirrors the “reputation economy” discussed by leading AI experts, but Unstaked is taking it from theory to actual use. Growing Presale, Clear Use Case, No Private Deals Unstaked is currently in Stage 4 of its crypto presale with the UNSD token priced at $0.007102. Those joining early aren’t just reacting to hype; they’re stepping into a project already aligned with real use cases. A locked liquidity pool of $20 million is in place for post-launch trading, helping ensure steady pricing. Importantly, Unstaked hasn’t set aside any shares for private firms or secret early buyers. Instead, 60% of the total token supply is set aside for public buyers, supporting a true community-first vision. Its expected launch price is $0.1819. This means early presale participants could see gains of over 2700% if demand continues rising, something quite possible given the interest in AI agent systems. The AI agents being built will be ready to launch once the presale ends. They are not live yet, but their rollout will happen at launch. This makes Unstaked especially useful for DAOs or NFT projects looking to reduce manual work and offer full-time interaction. Why Unstaked Sets a Standard for AI and Web3 What makes Unstaked stand out is its focus on core systems, not just automation. It addresses the increasing need for autonomous tools in Web3 communities and delivers it through a tech framework that’s easy to track, verify, and use. Its model is much like how AWS became essential in Web2. However, Unstaked is aimed at user-driven protocols rather than centralized hosting. This could make it a must-have for Layer 1 projects, DAOs, and decentralized platforms as they grow. While many AI-based projects chase trends, Unstaked is focused on solving real problems. Its Proof of Intelligence design filters out low-quality work, encourages value-driven output, and creates a public reputation system that fits Web3 ideals.

Surprisingly, it is not just retail traders entering a growing number of seasoned XRP and Cardano (ADA) holders are beginning to reposition into this fast-rising asset. With $8 million already raised , MAGACOINFINANCE has captured market attention not through hype, but through a disciplined rollout, transparent tokenomics, and a roadmap that analysts are beginning to take seriously. In contrast, while ADA and XRP remain in consolidation zones, MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground offering a fresh alternative with clear upside and short-term actionability. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! The Context: What’s Going On With XRP and Cardano? Both XRP and Cardano remain headline tokens in May 2025, but for different reasons: Cardano (ADA) is showing bullish reversal patterns, fueled by speculation over a possible Cardano ETF , and a growing list of real-world partnerships ahead of the LAOS protocol upgrade . However, despite recent gains, ADA is still trading between $0.70–$0.72 , with resistance levels at $0.81 and $1.17 yet to be broken. XRP sits near $2.22 , following recent volatility tied to ETF filing delays and a dip in trading volume. Bloomberg analysts still give an 85% chance of a 2025 XRP ETF approval, but market sentiment remains mixed due to the SEC’s postponed decision and lack of a spot ETF approval. Both tokens are still seen as high-potential assets — but limited short-term catalysts and broader market fatigue are driving capital to emerging high-ROI alternatives . That’s where MAGACOINFINANCE enters the equation. 3,000%+ Upside and 50% Bonus Fuel Early Demand MAGACOINFINANCE is currently offering what many analysts view as a rare early-stage setup, especially when compared to saturated Layer 1 ecosystems: Over 3,000% ROI potential projected from current entry to listing 50% bonus tokens available during the current round A fixed supply of 100 billion tokens , with 45% allocated to presale Bonuses decreasing and pricing rising hourly as demand accelerates This disciplined structure — with no vague promises or open-ended timelines — is what sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart from the typical meme-driven noise. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Positioned for 25x–35x Returns by Year-End PRESALE SELLING OUT — TAP TO SECURE YOUR SPOT NOW! Current projections suggest MAGACOINFINANCE could reach its target listing price of $0.007 , which would represent a 25x to 35x return from today’s levels — making it one of the most potentially lucrative early altcoin plays of 2025. Backing this forecast is more than speculation: A global marketing campaign is set to launch Agency partnerships are confirmed Exchange listing discussions are already underway Unlike traditional token sales that offer little more than ambition, MAGACOINFINANCE is executing on all fronts — drawing attention from crypto analysts, early-stage investors, and now, capital rotation from ADA and XRP whales. Why Analysts Say MAGACOINFINANCE Could Outperform in 2025 MAGACOINFINANCE is increasingly being referred to as a strategic early entry , particularly for investors who missed prior runs in Ethereum , SHIBA INU , or DOGE . While ADA and XRP continue to trade within structured ranges, MAGACOINFINANCE is still in a price discovery phase — and momentum is building fast. With institutional-grade branding , real-time traction , and a growing community of over 20,000 supporters, Project is quickly climbing up the 2025 altcoin watchlist. This is not a question of potential anymore — it’s a question of timing . The window to secure the 50% bonus and enter before mass exposure begins is rapidly narrowing.

(Analysts Weigh in),https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-eth-is-waking-up-how-high-can-it-go-analysts-weigh-in/,"TL;DR After a brutal drop below $1,400 in April, Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of life again, reclaiming key technical levels and surging past $2,000. Many analysts are optimistic that the price can go much higher in the near future, with some envisioning a new ATH. ‘The Bull Run Has Begun’ The second-largest cryptocurrency has been among the biggest disappointments of the market during this cycle. It not only failed to chart a new all-time high, but it also trades now lower than it did before the US elections. However, i n the past 24 hours, the asset experienced a substantial uptick, rising by over 10% and exploding above $2,000. ETH Price. Source: CoinGecko Its positive performance could be attributed to the resurgence of the entire cryptocurrency sector, where BTC skyrocketed past $100,000, while the industry’s market capitalization surged above $3.250 trillion. ETH’s rally also followed the implementation of Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade , designed to enhance staking, scaling, and overall network efficiency. Crypto X is now rammed with analysts predicting a further uptrend for the asset. Captain Faibik argued that ETH is finally reclaiming the daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $1,855. The X user believes that the next critical resistance zone is the $2,100-$2,140 range, and if taken back, “bulls will regain control.” For their part, Ledger Bull suggested that ETH “is no longer bearish” and “it’s officially waking up.” The analyst assumed that the asset had entered the accumulation flat zone, which, combined with the latest pump, signals the potential start of a bull run. “Old king ETH is back, and it’s ready to roar,” they added. Lucky and Merlijn The Trader also outlined optimistic forecasts. The former envisioned a jump towards $4,000 in the following months, while the latter believes ETH could skyrocket to a whopping $12,000 by the start of 2026. He based this theory on the supposed analogy between Ethereum’s price chart in the past three years and the one of bitcoin formed between 2019 and 2021. Observing Some Signals ETH’s overall condition appears quite bullish when taking a closer look at some vital indicators. The asset’s exchange netflow, for example, has been negative in the last week or so, hinting at a shift from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. ETH Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant In addition, Google searches involving Ethereum have been on the rise for the past several days. This signals increased interest from investors, especially from retail. ETH Google Searches, Source: Google Trends Market participants, though, should keep an eye on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which recently entered the bearish zone of over 70. Readings above that level indicate that ETH has likely experienced a rapid price increase over a short period, which could be a precursor to an incoming correction.

On-chain data shows whale investors are on a crypto shopping spree for heavily undervalued altcoins. The total crypto market cap gained more than 4 percent in the last 24 hours to hover about $3.25 trillion on Thursday, May 8, during the late North American trading session. Bitcoin (BTC) price surged over 5 percent to reach a local high of about $101,784. The wider altcoin market recorded double percent digit gains in the past 24 hours, led by memecoins. Ethereum (ETH) price had surged over 15 percent in the past 24 hours to trade at about $2,070 at the time of this writing. Major Forces Behind Today’s Crypto Market Surge Short Squeeze Impact In the past 24-hour, more than $626 million was liquidated from the wider crypto market, with the short traders amounting to over $536 million. As a result, the odds of a short squeeze significantly increased, amid notable greed and bullish sentiment. Federal Reserve Monetary Policy On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held its lending rate at between 4.25 and 4.5 percent, as widely predicted by Wall Street economists. Notably, the rising stagflation risks, as highlighted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have compelled investors to seek alternative investments, with crypto assets emerging among the top. Rising Demand from Institutional Investors On-chain data analysis for the last few days and weeks shows a strong demand for crypto assets by institutional investors. For instance, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs have recorded a net cash inflow of about $1.58 billion since the beginning of May, thus completing April’s $2.97 billion cash inflow. More institutional investors – led by Strategy and Metaplanet – have been leveraging the global equity market to buy more Bitcoins and top-tier altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum . Geopolitical and Trade Developments The demand for altcoins and Bitcoin has continued to increase fueled by the global geopolitical tensions and ongoing trade war negotiations. Earlier on Thursday, the United States and the United Kingdom announced a strategic trade deal. Meanwhile, tensions between Pakistan and India have pushed more investors to the Bitcoin market to hedge against short-term macroeconomic uncertainties. Regulatory Catalysts As Coinpedia reported, two of the U.S. states – including New Hampshire and Arizona – have already approved respective legislation to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves. More states are expected to follow in the same direction in the near term and ultimately the federal government under the leadership of Donald Trump.

Experienced Analyst Shares What's Needed for a Bull Run If the court so decides, the parties will seek a limited remand in the appeals process to send the case back to the district court, after which both the SEC and Ripple will drop their appeals, which are currently pending with the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The SEC said the settlement did not include an assessment of the merits of the lawsuit’s claims and was taken solely to support efforts to update and restructure its regulatory approach to the cryptocurrency market.

According to a widely cited post by economic news account Walter Bloomberg on X, the leading U.S.-based crypto exchange, Coinbase, is reportedly in advanced stages to acquire Deribit, a major player in the crypto options and derivatives market. Unpacking the Reported Coinbase Acquisition of Deribit The report, shared by Walter Bloomberg, suggests that Coinbase is poised to make a strategic move by acquiring Deribit. The purported deal is valued at a staggering $2.9 billion . This isn’t just a simple cash transaction; the reported payment structure involves a mix of assets: Cash Component: $700 million in cash Stock Component: 11 million shares of Coinbase Class A stock It’s crucial to note that as of this writing, this information stems from a specific news account on X and has not been officially confirmed by either Coinbase or Deribit. However, the scale and strategic implications of such a deal have ignited considerable discussion within the crypto community. Who Are the Key Players in This Potential Deribit Acquisition? To understand the magnitude of this potential deal, let’s look at the entities involved: Coinbase: Founded in 2012, Coinbase is one of the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges globally. It’s a publicly traded company (NASDAQ: COIN) and serves millions of retail and institutional clients primarily in the United States and other regulated markets. While a giant in spot trading and retail access, Coinbase has been actively expanding its offerings, including venturing into derivatives. Deribit: Launched in 2016, Deribit is a leading platform specializing in cryptocurrency futures and options trading. It is particularly dominant in the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options markets, known for its deep liquidity and advanced trading features catering to professional and institutional traders. Deribit operates primarily offshore, which has allowed it to offer products like high-leverage futures and complex options strategies that are subject to different regulatory environments compared to exchanges operating under strict U.S. regulations. Why Focus on Crypto Options and Derivatives? This reported Coinbase acquisition highlights the growing importance of crypto options and derivatives in the digital asset space. While spot trading involves buying or selling an asset for immediate delivery, derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum). Options are a specific type of derivative contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a specific price (strike price) on or before a certain date (expiration date). Futures contracts, another type of derivative, are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. These instruments are crucial for several reasons: Hedging: Traders and institutions use derivatives to hedge against potential price movements in the underlying assets. Speculation: Derivatives allow traders to speculate on the future price direction of cryptocurrencies with leveraged positions. Price Discovery: The derivatives market contributes significantly to the price discovery process for underlying assets. Market Maturity: The presence of robust derivatives markets is often seen as a sign of a maturing financial asset class. For Coinbase, a platform historically focused on spot trading, acquiring a derivatives powerhouse like Deribit represents a significant strategic shift towards becoming a full-service crypto financial institution, competing more directly with global giants like Binance and Bybit. Potential Benefits of a Deribit Acquisition for Coinbase Should the reports of the Deribit acquisition prove true, the benefits for Coinbase could be substantial and multi-faceted: 1. Immediate Entry into a Dominant Derivatives Market Position: Deribit is a leader in crypto options trading. Acquiring them instantly gives Coinbase a significant footprint and expertise in a market segment where it currently has a limited presence. 2. Diversified Revenue Streams: Derivatives trading generates fee revenue distinct from spot trading. This acquisition would significantly broaden Coinbase’s revenue sources, potentially making it less reliant solely on spot trading volumes which can be volatile. 3. Access to a Professional and Institutional Client Base: Deribit is known for its sophisticated platform catering to professional traders and institutions. This aligns with Coinbase’s stated goal of expanding its services for institutional clients. 4. Technology and Expertise: Deribit has built robust infrastructure and developed deep expertise in derivatives trading technology and risk management. Coinbase could integrate this technology and leverage Deribit’s team’s knowledge. 5. Global Expansion (with Caveats): While Deribit operates offshore, integrating its technology and potentially its global user base (outside restricted jurisdictions) could accelerate Coinbase’s international expansion in the derivatives space. What Challenges Could the Deribit Acquisition Face? A deal of this magnitude is not without its potential hurdles. The integration of Deribit into Coinbase could present several challenges: 1. Regulatory Scrutiny: This is perhaps the biggest challenge. Deribit operates in a less stringent regulatory environment than Coinbase, particularly concerning products offered to U.S. customers. Integrating Deribit’s operations and products while adhering to U.S. and other global regulations will be complex and likely face significant scrutiny from regulators like the SEC and CFTC in the U.S. 2. Integration Complexity: Merging two large companies with different cultures, technologies, and operational structures is always difficult. Ensuring a smooth transition for users and employees, and integrating trading platforms without disruption, will be a major undertaking. 3. Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile. The value of the stock component of the deal (11 million COIN shares) could fluctuate significantly, impacting the final value of the acquisition. 4. User Base Differences: Deribit’s user base is heavily skewed towards professional and sophisticated derivatives traders, while Coinbase has a larger retail spot trading base. Bridging the gap and ensuring both user segments are well-served post-acquisition will be important. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community While awaiting official confirmation, this reported Coinbase news provides several points for market participants to consider: Impact on COIN Stock: Investors in Coinbase stock (COIN) should watch for official announcements and how the market reacts to the potential strategic shift and the financial implications of the $2.9 billion deal. Future of Crypto Derivatives Access: If successful, this acquisition could potentially lead to increased access to regulated crypto derivatives products for a wider audience, especially if Coinbase can navigate the regulatory landscape effectively. Competition: This move intensifies competition among major exchanges in the derivatives space. Expect other platforms to potentially react or enhance their own offerings. Regulatory Landscape: Keep an eye on how regulators in various jurisdictions respond to this potential consolidation and expansion into derivatives by a major regulated entity like Coinbase. Conclusion: A Potential Game-Changer for Coinbase and Crypto Derivatives The reported Coinbase acquisition of Deribit for $2.9 billion, if confirmed, would be a landmark deal in the cryptocurrency industry. It signals Coinbase’s strong intent to move beyond its core spot trading business and establish a dominant position in the lucrative and growing crypto derivatives market. While significant challenges, particularly regulatory ones, lie ahead, the potential benefits in terms of diversification, revenue growth, and access to a sophisticated client base make this a strategically compelling move for Coinbase. The crypto community will be watching closely for official confirmation and further details on how this potential integration will unfold and reshape the future of crypto trading.

Bessent Shares His Take On Crypto Policy During the hearing titled “The Annual Testimony of the Secretary of the Treasury on the State of the International Financial System,” Bessent doubled down on his conviction that U.S. lawmakers should develop “good market structure” so the country’s “best practices are used around the world.” We believe the United States should be the premier destination for digital assets. Digital assets are an important source of innovation that can drive usage of the U.S. dollar around the world with stablecoin legislation. pic.twitter.com/ZqWVMrjYaD — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) May 7, 2025 “We believe the United States should be the premier destination for digital assets,” he said. “Digital assets are an important source of innovation that can drive usage of the U.S. dollar around the world with stablecoin legislation.” Crypto-friendly comments from Scott Bessent come amid a turbulent week regarding the establishment of a regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. On Monday, several key House Republicans, including House Financial Services Committee Chair Representative French Hill, unveiled the discussion draft of their Digital Asset Market Structure Bill, seeking to enact comprehensive federal crypto regulation. “Our discussion draft builds upon that work and provides much-needed regulatory clarity for the digital asset ecosystem by protecting consumers and safeguarding the long-term integrity of digital asset markets in the United States,” Hill said in a May 5 statement . Crypto Causes Partisan Clash In Congress A House Financial Services Committee hearing titled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets: A Blueprint for the 21st Century” was then held on Tuesday, though a handful of House Democrats, spearheaded by ranking member Maxine Waters, stormed out in protest of U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures. “I object to this joint hearing because of the corruption of the President of the United States and his ownership of crypto and his oversight of all the agencies,” Waters said. Whether emerging crypto legislation will advance or be halted by political gridlock is still unclear.

Over the past week, these cryptocurrencies have seen gains exceeding 20%. Investors are now eyeing AAVE as a possible candidate for the next big rally. Dive into the article to uncover which coins might be primed for growth in the evolving market landscape. Uptrend Momentum for Quant Signals Altcoin Opportunity QNT 's past month and six-month performance show steady gains with a 45.91% and 50.89% rise respectively, suggesting consistent upward movement. The coin’s recent week surge of 23.57% underlines its robust growth, with the price steadily rising within a well-established range. These figures reflect a coin that has experienced strong buying interest over recent periods, setting the stage for a potential altcoin season as market momentum builds. Current prices sit between $63.20 and $82.20 with key nearby support at $51.40 and resistance at $89.40. Bulls are driving prices higher, though caution is warranted given an RSI near 70.31. The trading idea is to watch moves within these levels for entry points, keeping an eye on the second support at $32.40 and resistance at $108.40. EOS Market Update: 75% 6-Month Surge and Bullish Key Levels EOS recorded an 8% gain in the last month and an impressive 75% surge over the past six months. The price action demonstrated steady growth, defying market volatility with a strong recovery. Throughout this period, EOS managed to hold its ground, attracting positive sentiment among traders as its technical indicators showed consistent improvement. Currently, EOS is testing a support level at $0.41 and a resistance level at $1.01, with an additional target at $1.32. A recent increase of 23.52% within the week and an RSI of 69.16 indicate robust bullish momentum. Traders might consider buying near support while watching for breakouts above resistance to capitalize on potential upward movements. Upbeat Aave Rally Amid Uncertain Trends Last month showed Aave surging by over 40% with a 1-week jump of 14%, while the half-year change remained modest at around 3%. The recent rally hints at renewed investor interest, with price momentum gaining pace. Rallying in the shorter term contrasts with the slower movement over six months, showing a volatile yet energetic trend in the market. Price currently ranges between $125.92 and $191.14. Immediate support stands at $87.40 and resistance at $217.84, with a secondary resistance at $283.06. Bulls seem active given the high short-term gain, but RSI near 65 suggests caution as overbought conditions might arise. Aave may present buying opportunities near support with stops at key resistance levels. Conclusion Quant (QNT) and EOS have shown strong performance with gains over 20% in the past week. These increases highlight their potential and investor interest. Attention now shifts to AAVE as it might be the next to experience significant growth.

Ominous Pump.Fun Token Metrics Over seven million tokens have been created since the platform launched in 2024. However, only about 97,000 of these tokens, or just 1.4%, have kept at least $1,000 in liquidity. This is a basic sign of ongoing trading interest and value. This data shows that many projects gain short-lived hype, leaving unsuspecting investors with worthless tokens. Pump.Fun has become popular because it is easy to use, allowing anyone create a token in just a few minutes. While this makes it easier for people to innovate and engage with their communities, it has also led to people taking advantage of the platform to scam others. The report has sparked discussions about improving oversight and educating investors in decentralized finance (DeFi) and meme coin markets. While platforms like Pump.Fun promotes decentralization and creativity, but their lack of safety measures raises concerns about the long-term stability of these ecosystems. Memecoin Market Cools Off Notably, the memcoin hype that fueled Pump.Fun’s rise has started sputtering. Rug pulls like Libra have left retail investors wary. Similarly, interest in meme-tokens like TRUMP has nosedived: it is now down over 90% from January peaks, per CoinGecko. Data from Dune Analytics reveals that token graduation is rated on Pump.Fun has also plunged below 1%. Furthermore, weekly token launches have collapsed from 5,400 in January to under 1,500 in March. Even the broader Solana network is not immune : just 31,651 tokens were launched on April 5, compared to 95,578 at January’s fever pitch. Pump.fun Faces Legal Pressures Pump.Fun’s drop-in token launches come when the launchpad starts dealing with legal problems . Law firms have sued the platform on behalf of investors, who allegedly suffered significant losses. The law firm claimed the platform exploited users and allowed harmful content to thrive while profiting from its fees. Recall that another lawsuit dragged the platform to court for memecoin impersonation . Adding to its woes, Pump.Fun’s X official account was hacked, leading to fraudulent token promotion. At the same time, the platform faced backlash over testing its Automated Market Maker (AMM) feature, which could replace Raydium. This move sparked concerns within the community.

The Hedera (HBAR) price breakout has grabbed attention with growing real-world usage, while Dogecoin (DOGE) whale action hints at future moves by large holders. But the story doesn’t stop there. BlockDAG is taking a grassroots approach by rewarding users directly, not influencers, through a 25% referral program. With more than $229 million raised and over 170,000 unique holders already on board, it’s quietly becoming the next crypto to explode in 2025. Hedera (HBAR) Price Breakout Gains Traction Toward $2 The Hedera (HBAR) price breakout is making waves, as the token currently trades at $0.172 despite a 0.93% dip over the past 24 hours. HBAR still posted a 1.01% gain for the week, showing that accumulation is holding strong. Analysts point to a technical breakout that ended a long consolidation period dating back to late 2023. Resistance levels last seen in mid-2022 are back in play, backed by volume spikes and moving average crossovers. Behind the charts, Hedera’s fundamentals are just as strong. The Nairobi Securities Exchange has launched Kenya Digital Exchange (KDX) on the Hedera network, spotlighting real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Plus, HBAR’s February 2025 filing for a spot ETP is drawing interest, with Bloomberg estimating an 80% approval chance by November 11, 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Whale Action Signals Long-Term Confidence While DOGE price hasn’t moved much, Dogecoin (DOGE) whale action is sending a different signal. Whales have accumulated 100 million DOGE, worth about $17.5 million, without making noise. This data from The Currency Analytics suggests strategic buying rather than a reaction to price hype. DOGE’s price remains steady, but large-scale buying like this often sets the stage for future volatility. It can influence both liquidity and sentiment. The accumulation might not have triggered a price spike yet, but it’s a clear vote of confidence from key players. Tracking whale behavior like this offers valuable clues about where DOGE could go next. BlockDAG’s Referral System Drives Community & Marks It as a Top Crypto to Explode BlockDAG is shaking up how crypto adoption works by turning every buyer into an active part of its growth. Instead of pushing empty hype, it’s using a 25% referral reward and a 5% bonus for new buyers to encourage real engagement. The numbers speak for themselves: over $229 million raised, 19.8 billion coins sold, and a growing community of more than 170,000 unique holders, all without flashy influencer campaigns or big ad spends. The system is built around shared benefits. When you introduce someone to BlockDAG, you both win. The referrer earns 25% in BDAG from each purchase, and the newcomer gets 5% back. It’s a model that builds trust, sparks real conversations, and grows through community, not just clicks. And timing couldn’t be more important. BlockDAG is now in Batch 28, priced at $0.0262, but there’s still a special offer at just $0.0019 running until May 13. Since the first batch, early participants have already gained a 2,520% ROI, putting BDAG firmly on the radar as the next crypto to explode in 2025. While other projects chase viral trends or celebrity plugs, BlockDAG is taking a grassroots path. This referral setup isn’t a gimmick, it’s a long-term strategy that builds through real relationships and rewards loyalty. With the mainnet launch nearing and the testnet picking up steam, BlockDAG’s quiet, community-driven rise is showing that real crypto momentum doesn’t need to shout to be heard. Why These Projects Are on Buyers’ Radar Hedera is earning credibility with enterprise use cases. DOGE whales are loading up quietly, showing long-term conviction. But BlockDAG is doing something rare, turning every supporter into a growth partner through rewards that fuel organic expansion. With its strong $229 million presale, proven ROI, and people-first strategy, BlockDAG is creating a different kind of buzz. As traders scan the market for the next crypto to explode , projects like BlockDAG show that community-driven models may be the future.

Ethereum plans to launch Pectra before 2025 as an upgrade which aims to improve its scalability and user interaction capabilities. Spot ETF approval holds attention for XRP holders because it could substantially transform their market performance. Prices may show variations but investors maintain their focus on Solana because this project offers both mature architectural elements with an expanding network of users. The Ethiopia-based Pectra upgrade for Ethereum which will launch on May 7, 2025 brings a set of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to boost network performance. EIP-7691 proposes to boost data blob throughput by 100% which could raise transaction speeds to 420 TPS thus decreasing fees that affect platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism. XRP shows price depreciation since it trades at $2.08 despite bearish technical indicators and worldwide economic risks. XRP ETF spot approvals still hold a 77% likelihood according to analysts which suggests both institutional demand and higher prices. At present Solana (SOL) operates at a trading level of $144.18 USD and maintains a daily trading volume exceeding $2.2 billion and attains a market capital value reaching $67.2 billion. The price dropped by approximately 1.7% throughout the previous day. Solana has maintained a yearly price fluctuation between $96.59 and $294.33. CLICK HERE – CLAIM YOUR SPOT BEFORE 5000% RUN The emerging crypto space has recently noticed the rising presence of MAGACOINFINANCE as a new addition to digital currencies. The alternative crypto solution is still in its inception phase and offers investors an opportunity to spread their investments outside of conventional digital currencies. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP: Navigating Market Shifts Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade: Ethereum plans to release its Pectra update on May 7 of 2025 to give its platform improved scalability together with better user experiences. EIP-7691 brings the capability to double data blob throughput which might lead to transaction speeds reaching 420 transactions per second. Layer 2 solutions together with payment costs will benefit from these upcoming improvements. CryptoRank XRP’s ETF Prospects: XRP trades at $2.08 due to multiple market variables which led to the current decrease in price. The odds of XRP spot ETF approval reaching 77% will likely draw institutions to invest according to analysts’ projections within the upcoming 2025 timeframe. Ripple’s investment in RLUSD stablecoins creates market attention that threatens XRP’s historical use. Finance Magnates Solana’s Market Dynamics: Solana currently sells for $144.18 USD while maintaining a market capitalization exceeding $67.2 billion. The last day brought a minor 1.7% drop to XRP price. The infrastructure alongside the ecosystem of Solana maintains investor fascination despite price instability. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW MAGACOINFINANCE: Emerging in a Competitive Landscape As a newly established entity MAGACOINFINANCE enters the cryptocurrency market sector.

However, beyond the buzz of the meme world, blockchain innovation is taking a serious leap forward with Ruvi AI, a platform that combines the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology. While Dogecoin thrives on community engagement, Ruvi AI is driving real-world transformation in industries like logistics, healthcare, and finance. What Is Ruvi AI and What Does It Offer? Ruvi AI is at the forefront of using AI and blockchain to create practical solutions for industry challenges. By integrating advanced AI algorithms with blockchain’s secure, transparent architecture, the platform offers tools designed for optimization, data analytics, and workflow management. Whether it’s refining supply chains in logistics or enhancing patient care in healthcare settings, Ruvi AI’s applications are diverse and impactful. The Beta version of Ruvi AI is now live, giving businesses and users the chance to experience its innovative offerings firsthand. Its user-friendly interface ensures accessibility to individuals and companies of all sizes, removing technical barriers that often accompany cutting-edge technologies. A Strong Start to the Presale Ruvi AI’s presale performance has been nothing short of impressive. Over 30% of the tokens allocated for Phase 1 have already been sold, demonstrating robust interest from early investors. At $0.01 per token, Phase 1 offers an attractive entry point. However, with a 50% price increase ahead in Phase 2, the window for investing at this initial stage is closing fast. Industry analysts are bullish on Ruvi AI’s potential, with many predicting that the token could achieve a $1 valuation shortly after listing. Blockchain analyst Sarah Cheng calls the project “a paradigm shift,” noting that “Ruvi AI’s ability to merge sophisticated AI capabilities with blockchain’s decentralized framework sets it apart as a truly unique offering.” VIP Tiers With Exceptional Benefits Ruvi AI’s VIP program is designed to reward early supporters and foster greater engagement. Investors can qualify for various VIP tiers based on the number of tokens they accumulate. Here’s a detailed breakdown of standout tiers: VIP Tier 3 VIP Tier 3 offers a 60% bonus to investors who accumulate 100,000 tokens. At the current token price of $0.01, an investment of $1,000 is required to qualify. With the bonus, participants receive an additional 60,000 tokens, bringing their total holdings to 160,000 tokens. At a listing price of $0.07, these tokens would be worth $11,200. If Ruvi AI achieves a $1 valuation, the total value would jump to $160,000. This represents a return on investment (ROI) of 1,020% at the listing price and a staggering 15,900% at the projected $1 price point. VIP Tier 5 For larger investors, VIP Tier 5 offers the most lucrative rewards with a 100% bonus. To qualify, participants need to accumulate 500,000 tokens, requiring an upfront investment of $5,000 at the current price. The 100% bonus adds another 500,000 tokens, resulting in a total balance of 1,000,000 tokens. The returns at the listing price of $0.07 would be $70,000, while the projected $1 valuation could result in a value of $1,000,000. This translates to an ROI of 1,300% at the listing price and an extraordinary 19,900% at $1. These returns highlight the immense potential of the VIP program for those ready to make significant investments. Leaderboard Rewards for Active Participants To further incentivize participation, Ruvi AI features a robust leaderboard system for rewarding its top contributors. Here’s how it works: Top 10 contributors receive 500,000 tokens each, worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1. Top 50 contributors earn 250,000 tokens each, valued at $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1. Top 100 contributors secure 100,000 tokens each, valued at $7,000 at the listing price or $100,000 at $1. This leaderboard structure adds a gamified element to the presale, keeping the community engaged and rewarded beyond monetary investments. A Promising Future for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI is not just another blockchain project; it’s a glimpse into the future of technology at the intersection of AI and decentralized networks. With its Beta platform live, a growing presale, and industry experts praising its innovation, Ruvi AI is poised to become a leader in its field. For investors seeking an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a revolutionary blockchain platform, Ruvi AI presents unparalleled potential. Combining real-world utility with a strong investment model, it stands as a beacon of innovation in a rapidly evolving space. While Dogecoin captures the internet’s imagination, Ruvi AI is quietly changing the game in ways that could define the next phase of blockchain technology.

The BTC price is only 6% away from a new all-time high. Ethereum, on the other hand, has had a truly impressive and surprising rally today. The largest altcoin has gained over 20% in the last 24 hours and is trading at $2,186 at the time of writing. With this rise, ETH has made its biggest gain since 2021. The reason for the increases is that the US is holding more moderate talks and signing agreements with many countries regarding customs duties. A 10% customs duty agreement was signed between the US and the UK. In addition, the environment with China, which is perhaps the most tense side of the customs duty crisis, has softened. The US administration has stated that the customs duties applied to China could be reduced to around 50% next week. Related News: What Did Huge Altcoin Whales Do During the Rally? They Couldn't Escape On-Chain Data Finally, the US's statement that it is determined to end the Russia-Ukraine war, Ukraine's positive view of a 30-day ceasefire, and the positive talks between Zelenskiy and Trump also helped reduce tensions in the geopolitical environment and sparked a rally in cryptocurrencies. Along with the rise in the cryptocurrency market, major liquidations were also observed. According to Coinglass data, the cryptocurrency market experienced a massive liquidation of $793 million in the last 24 hours. $694 million of these were in short positions.

The settlement agreement includes provisions for both parties to drop their appeals if the court agrees to lift the injunction related to the case. The SEC has formally filed the settlement agreement letter, signaling the closure of the case. Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen are also part of the settlement.

You’re creating new data every day. If your health app counts your steps? That’s new data. The Oura ring that’s tracking your bio-metrics? Valuable data. Your social media posts, even the stupid jokes that got zero likes? More data. This is all data that AI companies would love to harvest. You can’t build good AI without good data, which is why many view data as the “new oil’ in the race for AI. The problem, though, is that while your data is valuable in theory , the reality is that it’s hard to monetize your own personal data, as you have no leverage as an individual. (Open AI isn’t knocking at your door to buy your old tweets.) Enter Vana . “I think data is this fundamental resource powering the next generation of AI, and really the next generation of our digital economy,” says Anna Kazlauskas, co-founder of Vana and CEO of Open Data Labs. “A lot of people frankly just don't realize that they actually own their data.” But you do own your data. And it’s valuable… if you can somehow join forces with millions of others who also own their data. This would give you bargaining power. And that’s the mission of Vana: To create an ecosystem for user-owned data, which in turn fuels user-owned AI. That ecosystem involves a mix of Data DAOs (a “labor union” for data), decentralized data marketplaces, the recently launched VRC-20 token , and a new collaboration with Flower Labs to build the world’s first user-owned foundational model. (Exhibit A that Decentralized AI is creeping into the mainstream: The Vana/Flower collaboration was covered by WIRED .) Kazlauskas will give a keynote at the AI Summit at Consensus 2025 outlining this vision, and she gives a glimpse here. And she sees the momentum shifting. “We're already starting to see this shift where more people realize that, ‘My data is really important to AI’ and ‘I’m actually the owner of that.’” She predicts that in a few years, over 100 million users will be onboard. In 10 years? “World population. Above 10 billion.” Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity. Why is user-owned data so important to you? Anna Kazlauskas: Most people assume data is owned by the platforms that it's sitting on, but that's not the case. In the same way that when you put your car in a parking lot, the parking lot doesn't own your car. You can always take it back. You have full ownership over it. And there's a huge amount of money being made today, mostly by big tech companies, off of that data, but users are the legal owners. So I think it's important that we restore that ownership, both from a user perspective and from a developer's perspective. Can you connect the dots of how this helps developers? As a developer, especially in an AI world, having access to the right data is really important. And it's super hard to do right now, because most of the data is locked up within the walled gardens of big tech. So many of my really smart friends who do stuff in AI go work at the big labs, because that's where the data is and that’s where the compute is. But that doesn't have to be the case. How do Data DAOs fit into this vision exactly? So a DataDAO is kind of like a labor union for data. Where basically you have a large group of people who pool their data together, and then can make collective decisions over what happens to that data. The reason why that's important is that your data, on its own, is not that useful, right? It's much more useful when there's a big pool of it. When there’s enough of it to train an AI model. What are some of the Data DAOs you’re most excited by? There are a few in the health space that are really interesting. There's an early one that's actually doing full exports of patient medical records, which I think can really help advance a lot of research in the space. There's some related to biometrics, sleep, and health. There’s one with the DLP [Driver Loyalty Program] Labs; they’re building car data. And within their data-set, the Tesla data is really interesting because most people think about Tesla as valuable because they have a data lead, right? Actually, the users can get a lot of that data-set. You’re pivoting from theory to practice with the new collaboration with Flower Labs to build COLLECTIVE-1. What’s the goal there? COLLECTIVE-1 is the first user-owned foundation model. Usually when people think about a foundation model, they typically think of one company running a very large training job in a single data center, right? Like OpenAI. And the reason why it's typically done in a centralized way is because it requires, one, a whole lot of compute power, and two, a whole lot of data. Flower AI is kind of the leader in federated [decentralized] training. They've done a really great job of building these great open source libraries. They’ve come in from the training side and the algorithm side. And with Vana, we really focus on that data piece, right? So we basically have all this data that people can train on. Then you give users end-ownership of the model, and users can decide on what the model is allowed to do? So this is the first foundation model of its kind. And the theory is that eventually, with better data, you can build AI that’s not just competitive with the central players but better , is that right? So it’s not just about ideology, but also performance. Exactly, yeah that’s 100% right. From a decentralized context, I think often people agree in principle that, “Yes, we should have AI that's owned by the people. We should have decentralized AI.” But what’s the thing that we can actually do better in a decentralized context? Data is the answer. For each company, they only have their single slice of a data-set. Apple’s got their data. Google’s got their data.

Bitcoin is once again attempting to reclaim the $100,000 mark, a level that has become more than just psychological—it’s symbolic. This steady approach toward six-figure territory has reignited both short-term excitement and hesitation. Meanwhile, altcoins are diverging. Some are trapped in correction zones, others are struggling to reclaim resistance. What’s becoming clear is that the market is looking for structure and predictability. And that’s exactly where Qubetics is beginning to separate itself from the rest. Qubetics ($TICS) offers a response to this demand for clarity. Unlike many tokens reacting to market movements, it operates on a timed model that delivers price progression through structured smart contract stages. While Avalanche approaches a technical cliff and VeChain extends its downward channel, Qubetics continues building from within—through scheduled presale milestones, real-world application, and on-chain mechanics. In this article, the distinct positions of these three coins will be unpacked to help clarify which are the top cryptos to hold for short term—and why some paths offer far more reliability than others. Qubetics Is Reshaping Real-World Ownership with Tokenization at Its Core Qubetics is one of the few blockchain platforms addressing the practical gaps traditional finance hasn’t filled. Its tokenized asset marketplace isn’t theory—it’s built to convert real-world assets like real estate, intellectual property, and rare collectibles into digital shares that anyone can buy and trade. For example, a developer in Dubai can tokenize a hotel project, allowing early contributors to hold fractional ownership. A legal firm in Toronto can tokenize patents and grant rights to stakeholders, unlocking capital without losing ownership. Qubetics doesn’t generalize. It provides real use cases for freelancers, enterprises, and creators who need fast, verifiable, and accessible liquidity channels. As the top cryptos to hold for short term continue shifting, Qubetics holds attention for another major reason—it’s a Web3 aggregator. Unlike many single-chain projects, Qubetics unifies leading Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains into a seamless platform, giving developers low-code tools to deploy smart contracts, verify identities, and scale digital operations. Its IDE (QubeQode) allows even non-developers to configure and launch blockchain applications visually. From logistics companies managing decentralized records to indie creators building digital storefronts, Qubetics brings practical functionality that short-term market hype can’t replace. It is not built for speculation—it is structured for adoption. Why Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Hold for Short Term in 2025—Backed by a Timed Presale Model The Qubetics presale is running on a schedule that favors structure over speculation. Each presale stage lasts exactly seven days, closing at 12 AM every Sunday. After each close, the price increases by 10%—no delays, no guesswork. Right now, in Stage 33, $TICS is priced at $0.2302. Already, over 511 million tokens have been sold and more than $16.7 million has been raised. There are currently 25,900+ unique participants involved—each locking in their tier before the next scheduled increase in this structured crypto presale event. What makes Qubetics stand out among the top cryptos to hold for short term is that its growth doesn’t depend on speculative pumps or market sentiment. A $2,000 purchase at the current price brings in 8,684 tokens. If $TICS climbs to $6, that equals $52,104—an ROI of 2,505.96%. If it hits $10, the return stretches to $86,840, and at $15, it grows to $130,260, delivering a 6,414.90% return. These projections are based on code, not chatter. With each presale stage hardcoded to rise in price weekly, Qubetics is offering a crypto presale that aligns logic with opportunity. That’s why it’s being viewed as one of the top cryptos to hold for short term by those prioritizing structure over risk. The mainnet launches in Q2 2025, giving current participants a defined timeline—not just hope. Avalanche Dips Below Comfort Zone as Support Becomes Critical Avalanche has fallen under pressure after failing to sustain upward momentum in early 2025. With AVAX now floating dangerously near the $18 level, market analysts are warning of a potential breakdown that could erase more of the gains it made during late 2024. Trading volumes have weakened, and resistance has proven tough to break. Avalanche’s ecosystem is still intact from a development standpoint, but the token price is painting a bearish picture that continues to concern short-term holders. The current outlook points to declining confidence unless a strong reversal pattern forms. Any drop below $18 could open the door to further downside, especially if broader sentiment stays neutral or slips. Avalanche’s performance in early 2025 highlights how vulnerable even strong projects are to short-term trendlines. AVAX needs to reclaim strength soon—or risk falling behind in a cycle that’s rapidly rewarding coins with either innovation or structured market planning. VeChain Slides Deeper Into Bearish Channel Amid Market Caution VeChain is locked in a downward channel with minimal near-term upside, based on recent market activity. The token has posted a sequence of lower highs and continues to face downward pressure, with analysts citing the current chart formation as a sign of continued weakness. Unless trading volume picks up sharply or a major announcement changes sentiment, VET may continue grinding lower in the weeks ahead. This comes at a time when participants are already moving cautiously, particularly within enterprise-focused altcoins. While VeChain’s long-term enterprise strategy is still respected in certain circles, its short-term price structure is acting as a deterrent. Resistance levels have consistently rejected each attempted rally, and no clear floor has yet formed. Until this trend is broken, VeChain’s inclusion in short-term strategies carries a heavy risk. Its descent underscores how price movement alone can impact participation decisions, regardless of underlying fundamentals. Today’s Macro Calm Is Not Helping All Coins—But Structure Wins in Uncertain Times The Fed’s rate pause has not injected strong momentum into the market—it’s paused the panic, not created clarity. Bitcoin’s renewed push toward $100,000 has sparked renewed focus, but the impact on altcoins remains mixed. Projects like Avalanche and VeChain are reacting with technical slippage, while Qubetics is operating on a completely different rhythm. Its presale model, based on a hard-coded weekly price increase, offers predictability when the market fails to deliver it. For Qubetics, each Sunday brings a new stage. That means the presale progresses regardless of BTC volatility, ETH rallies, or macroeconomic headlines. It offers a kind of programmed calm that many participants now prefer. When broader sentiment holds back big moves, structured systems like the Qubetics presale continue building value. That’s the difference between hoping for a breakout and owning one that’s already scheduled. Conclusion: Timing and Structure Separate the Winners in This Cycle Qubetics, Avalanche, and VeChain each represent a different track in today’s crypto market. Avalanche has potential but faces short-term fragility near key technical support. VeChain is contending with a bearish channel that continues to suppress its recovery. Qubetics, on the other hand, is growing through scheduled progression—on-chain, measurable, and participant-driven. It’s not a reaction to market cycles; it’s a structured climb with use-case depth, a tokenized asset marketplace, and a fast-approaching mainnet. For those exploring top cryptos to hold for short term, the difference lies in how each project handles volatility. And for those who prefer a structured path to entry, it’s time to join this best crypto presale before the next stage kicks in.

Qubetics, Avalanche, and VeChain are top mentions due to their distinct positions in the current market cycle—each representing unique strategies and structures. Is Qubetics still in its presale phase? Yes, the Qubetics presale is currently active at Stage 33, with the price set at $0.2302 and more than 511 million tokens already sold. How does the Qubetics presale generate such strong ROI projections? Because each stage raises the price by 10% weekly, early participants lock in lower costs, and projected prices of $6 to $15 offer high ROI potential across different investment tiers.

Wellgistics cited the finality time of XRP transactions and reduced transaction costs, which are fractions of a penny, compared to legacy financial architecture like automated clearinghouse (ACH) payments or wire transfers, as reasons for using XRP. Brian Norton, CEO of Wellgistics Health, said in the announcement: ""I believe that the future winners in healthcare will not be the companies with the biggest buildings, they will be those with the fastest rails, cleanest data, and most efficient platforms. We are betting on infrastructure — not inertia.” The integration of XRP will reduce cross-border friction and allow transactions between different businesses in the supply chain to settle instantly, in real time, the announcement reads. Blockchain payment rails and cryptocurrencies can significantly reduce international transaction costs, giving rise to business opportunities that were previously out of reach or too expensive to implement and opening up global trade for residents in developing economies. Related: Can XRP price reach $4 in May? Analysts are watching these key levels Legacy banking system pushes back against crypto innovation Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) disintermediate banks and financial institutions by providing peer-to-peer transactions over a trustless network of decentralized nodes that are censorship-resistant and give the holder self-sovereignty over their money. Other cryptocurrencies like stablecoins and altcoins still feature a third-party issuer, but have the benefit of trading on blockchain payment rails, through the internet, without markets closing. Banks and legacy financial institutions pushed back against the GENIUS stablecoin bill in March 2025, arguing that stablecoins would erode the banking industry's market share of financial services and eventually drive out banks altogether. US Senator Elizabeth Warren also fought to include several provisions in the bill that would force any stablecoin firm that wants to do business in the United States to issue their stablecoin with the oversight of an established financial institution. The bill, hailed as a bipartisan success, failed to advance to a floor vote on May 8 after pushback from Democratic senators.

Still flying under the radar but rapidly gaining traction, MAGACOINFINANCE is drawing attention from investors who’ve seen this setup before — low entry, strong tokenomics, and a clear path to breakout. And now, with realistic projections pointing to a 3500% ROI , the numbers are starting to tell a compelling story: a $500 investment today could be worth $25,000 or more by the end of 2025 . JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! A Forecast That’s Turning Heads MAGACOINFINANCE is not yet on major exchanges. That alone places it in a rare early-stage category, the type of access point that historically delivers the most explosive returns before public hype catches on. Current projections based on listing targets, price trajectory, and early accumulation behavior suggest: Expected ROI: +3400% to +3500% from current levels Potential Return: up to $3250% , depending on early entry bonuses and stage pricing In pure numbers, that means even a small $500 position could scale to $17,000–$25,000 based on prevailing models. And for many risk-tolerant investors, that’s more than enough reason to take a second look. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Taken Seriously Several fundamentals are helping MAGACOINFINANCE cut through the noise: Still trading under $0.07 , with upside before exchange listings No VC overhang , which prevents early sell-offs Community-driven momentum that’s accelerating organically Clean tokenomics built for supply scarcity and long-term upside Unlike many high-promise tokens that rely on short-term influencer hype or meme-fueled volatility, MAGACOINFINANCE is built on a structure designed to scale — without compromising early investor integrity. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X Still Early — But Not for Long With its market presence expanding and word-of-mouth beginning to spread across analyst circles and private communities, MAGACOINFINANCE appears to be entering the next phase of exposure.

The company recently bought Hidden Road , a global prime brokerage firm for digital and traditional assets, for $1.25 billion. As part of this deal, Ripple will open a new Hidden Road office in Abu Dhabi, a city quickly becoming a major center for crypto and finance. New Opportunity in Abu Dhabi Hidden Road is a company that helps big investors trade both crypto and traditional assets. With Ripple’s support, it is opening a new office in Abu Dhabi. This is not just a new branch. It is a smart move into a region that welcomes new ideas and blockchain technology. Abu Dhabi is more than a place with easy rules or tax benefits. It is building a full financial system that supports innovation . Ripple’s decision to expand here shows that it sees real regional potential. In a recent statement, James Stickland, the CEO of Hidden Road UAE, said the company is getting ready to serve big clients. it will offer services like prime brokerage and clearing, essential for large financial trades. Ripple’s bigger goal is to make Hidden Road the world’s top non-bank prime broker, and opening this new office in Abu Dhabi is an integral part of that plan. Ripple Backs Hidden Road in Global Growth Move This move comes shortly after Ripple secured regulatory approval for Hidden Road to operate as a broker-dealer within the United States. In addition, the fintech firm is increasing its investment in Hidden Road to improve its service offerings across both the United Arab Emirates and the U.S. markets. Abu Dhabi’s financial regulators have already given Hidden Road the first round of approval. Once full approval is granted, the company can fully operate and work with big investors. Some sources hinted that a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family may join the board of the local office. This would show even more local trust and support for the project. Notably, this strategic expansion is part of a broader trend. Circle, the company behind USDC, recently launched a new cross-border payment platform and is expanding into the UAE. This shows that more crypto companies are looking to the region for long-term business growth and real opportunity, not just license approvals. Ripple Labs Is Building, Not Just Fighting This expansion shows that Ripple is currently in an ongoing legal debacle with a U.S. regulatory agency and is changing its focus. The company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, said Ripple is now focusing on building firm crypto services, not legal battles. With Hidden Road and support from Abu Dhabi, Ripple is helping shape the future of global finance.

Fresh data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment has revealed a striking pivot: talk of AI agents and altcoin season is now stealing the spotlight. From Tariffs to Tech The catalyst behind the earlier conversations was Trump’s announcement in April of the imposition of harsh new tariffs on imports from some of the United States’ biggest trade partners. The move shook global markets and briefly pulled crypto into the macroeconomic storm. However, the U.S. President is teasing something very different: a “major trade deal” with a “big and highly respected country,” fueling renewed bullish sentiment across risk assets, including crypto. Nonetheless, Santiment’s social data shows engagements around the topic have ebbed, replaced by growing interest in AI agents, altseason, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and Real World Assets (RWA). With blockchain and artificial intelligence increasingly intersecting, AI-related crypto tokens are gaining traction. According to CoinGecko, the two biggest gainers in the crypto market in the last 24 hours are AI-focused. Agent Ted (TED), which skyrocketed 111.2% since yesterday, and almost 5,000% over the previous two weeks, powers an AI-driven sports betting platform. REVOX (REX), on the other hand, registered a 47.2% jump in its price in 24 hours. It is the native token of a platform building a shared AI interface through a permissionless machine learning infrastructure. In general, the category is up almost 5% over the past day compared to Bitcoin’s 2.5% rise in the same period. Altseason Speculation Ramps Up Talk of an impending altcoin season, when alternative crypto assets outperform BTC, is also heating up. While the flagship cryptocurrency maintains a strong market dominance at around 62%, the rise of mid-cap and AI tokens has sparked debate over whether a broader rotation into other coins is underway. Although historically, true altseasons have required a more substantial decline in Bitcoin’s dominance, the uptick in altcoin activity, paired with growing retail interest, is fueling speculation. Interestingly, this conversation has emerged with BTC pushing toward $100,000, aided by macro tailwinds, including a rate pause by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the easing of trade tensions. Additionally, mentions of crypto ETFs and RWAs have also risen slightly per Santiment’s analysis. This trend could be a reflection of ongoing experimentations with tokenizing real estate and other off-chain assets, as well as the recent good performances of spot Bitcoin ETFs led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which recently registered its second-highest inflow in a day, with its Bitcoin holdings crossing the 600,000 BTC mark soon after.

(WLFI), has experienced a meteoric rise in market capitalization, surging from just $128 million on April 27 to over $2.1 billion by early May. This represents a 1,540% increase in less than a week, positioning USD1 as the seventh-largest stablecoin in the global market. Source: CoinMarketCap The surge follows a series of massive token mints recorded on BscScan, the block explorer for Binance Smart Chain, where most USD1 tokens are issued. Between April 27 and April 30, several large mintings occurred, some exceeding $90 million per transaction. These events led to a spike in supply that catapulted USD1 past the $2 billion market cap mark on April 30, according to data from CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and DefiLlama. WLFI’s Stablecoin Surges Following $2 Billion Investment Deal Driving much of this growth was an announcement on May 1 from Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, which revealed plans to use USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance . A state-backed investment firm in Abu Dhabi is set to make a $2 billion investment into crypto exchange @Binance using USD1. #Trump #Binance https://t.co/2s6LBsx0SL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 3, 2025 The partnership marks one of the first major institutional uses of the newly launched stablecoin and was likely the catalyst behind USD1’s extraordinary supply expansion. USD1 launched officially in April following a March announcement from WLFI, which has backing from figures close to U.S. President Donald Trump. The coin is designed to maintain a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar and is reportedly fully collateralized by short-term U.S. Treasuries, USD bank deposits, and cash equivalents. The stablecoin has found particular popularity outside the United States, with nearly 90% of its current investor base located in regions such as Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Centralized exchanges like HTX have rushed to list USD1 in response to growing demand, offering zero-fee withdrawals on the BEP-20 network. Over 99% of USD1’s total supply currently resides on Binance’s BNB Chain, with a smaller share on Ethereum. USD1 Challenges Stablecoin Titans with Political Backing and Community Momentum USD1 enters a competitive $231 billion stablecoin market, largely dominated by industry giants Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), which together account for more than 90% of the sector. Still, USD1’s early success suggests a rising global appetite for politically backed or alternative stablecoin models, particularly amid the geopolitical and regulatory shifts shaping the future of digital finance. Trump family-backed WLFI is testing its on-chain airdrop feature by airdropping USD1 stablecoin to token holders. #WLFI $USD1Airdrop #Stablecoin https://t.co/066d51P8S6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 7, 2025 In line with its mission to promote on-chain adoption, WLFI also launched a community vote to airdrop USD1 to $WLFI holders , gaining 99.97% approval within hours. The airdrop is designed to test the project’s Ethereum-based distribution system and reward early supporters, with voting open until May 14. Despite concerns over Trump’s political ties and foreign backing, WLFI denies direct Trump family involvement. Since launching in 2024, WLFI has raised $550 million and is positioning USD1 to challenge stablecoin giants like USDT and USDC. In January, the president issued an executive order emphasizing stablecoins as part of the United States’ digital financial leadership strategy.

GENIUS stablecoin bill blocked in US Senate The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) of 2025 Act was blocked by Democrat lawmakers in the Senate on May 8, stalling the bill's progress. Although the bill initially received bipartisan support from US lawmakers, Democrats opposed the bill last minute due to concerns over President Donald Trump pushing crypto policies for self-benefit. Senior officials in the Trump administration have repeatedly stated that using stablecoins to protect the US dollar's global reserve status was a key policy objective. Following the stalling of the GENIUS stablecoin bill in the Senate, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote : ""This bill represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to expand dollar dominance and US influence in financial innovation. Without it, stablecoins will be subject to a patchwork of state regulations instead of a streamlined federal framework."" The Treasury Secretary added that if the US does not encourage innovation in digital assets then crypto firms will move offshore. Source: Scott Bessent Coinbase to acquire options trading platform Deribit for $2.9 billion Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US by trading volume, has agreed to acquire Deribit , one of the world’s biggest crypto derivatives trading platforms. Coinbase Global will acquire Deribit for about $2.9 billion, the exchange announced on May 8. The acquisition will allow Coinbase to expand into the profitable crypto derivatives market and continue scaling the platform’s global growth, Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s vice president of institutional product, said in the announcement. “With Deribit’s strong presence and professional client base, Coinbase is making its most substantial move yet to accelerate our international growth strategy,” he said. Source: Coinbase The $2.9 billion deal includes $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase Class A common stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. “This transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by year-end,” the announcement said. Previous reports in March suggested that Coinbase and Deribit had alerted regulators in Dubai about the potential deal, as Deribit holds a license in Dubai, which would need to be transferred to Coinbase if the deal is successful. Arizona gets a crypto stockpile Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs signed a bill into law on May 7 that allows the state to keep crypto that’s been unclaimed for at least three years to put into a “Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund.” House Bill 2749 allows Arizona to claim ownership of abandoned digital assets if the owner fails to respond to communications within three years. The state’s custodians can stake the crypto to earn rewards or get airdrops. House Representative Jeff Weninger, who sponsored the bill, said it “ensures Arizona doesn’t leave value sitting on the table.” Source: Jeff Weninger Hobbs had vetoed a similar Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve bill, Senate Bill 1025, which would have allowed the state to invest seized funds into Bitcoin, citing concerns over using public funds for ""untested assets.” Meanwhile, on the same day, a Texas House Committee passed a Republican-backed bill to create a Bitcoin reserve in a 9-4 vote down party lines, which now only needs a successful full floor vote before heading to Governor Greg Abbott’s desk.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-08 21:53:27

After receiving bipartisan support, Hagerty’s legislation fell 48-49 on the Senate floor on Thursday, prompting a wave of disappointment from key members of the cryptocurrency community. “This bill represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to expand dollar dominance and U.S. influence in financial innovation,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a May 8 X post. “Without it, stablecoins will be subject to a patchwork of state regulations instead of a streamlined federal framework that is more conducive to growth and competitiveness,” he added.

The Facebook parent held talks with several crypto infrastructure firms in consultation but has not chosen a decisive course of action, according to the report. One source said the company may take a multi-token approach and integrate support for popular stablecoins such as Tether's USDt ( USDT ), Circle's USD Coin ( USDC ) and others.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts numerous investors during its phase 4 presale at $0.025 and has already raised $7.8 million from token sales. As of now MUTM has sold 448 million tokens and attracted 9600 investors to become holders. The experts foresee MUTM reaching $3 after its launch date with similar growth patterns as ADA. Buyers are driving up the market demand for these tokens to reflect the strong vitality of the crypto industry. The investors rush to participate in MUTM’s presale because they understand this phase offers excellent opportunities for capital growth. Cardano’s Steady Ascent ADA has started its journey toward market recovery but remains at $0.7099 as the time of writing. Current market valuation of $0.7099 rises above the 20-day moving average which indicates a conservative bullish trend. Technical indicators point to an increase in market demand through the RSI measure of 59.04 that shows no potential for overbought conditions. The upcoming Resistance at $0.725 presents an opportunity for a potential price rise to reach $0.80. The latest predictions indicate Cardano will reach $1.00 by 2025 while market experts project a significant increase to $3.29 dollars by 2028. The two-layered architecture design of Cardano along with its energy-saving Ouroboros mechanism make the platform more appealing to users. The price growth of Cardano shows slower pace compared to newer tokens which poses concerns about its market performance. The investor sentiment remains optimistic but the market now focuses on newer competitive assets like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance’s Presale Frenzy The phase 4 presale of Mutuum Finance attracts growing investor interest because 60% of tokens have already been purchased at $0.025. The project has become successful raising $7.8 million and now has 9,600 holders while selling 448 million tokens. Future investors will obtain a higher price as Phase 5 introduces a 20% price increase from $0.025 to $0.03. The tokenomics predict a maximum profit of 140% when listing at the $0.06 price but analysts expect post-launch valuation to reach $3 delivering an 11,900% ROI. The platform launched its top 50 holder dashboard which gives bonus tokens as rewards to steady ranked users. The new innovative strategy between Mutuum Finance and its users has triggered intense competition which strengthens demand levels while presales continue. Mutuum Finance’s Security Push Mutuum Finance (MUTM) places trust at the top of its organizational priorities. The platform actively seeks a security review by Certik as the leading blockchain audit firm. Mutuum Finance will share its audit results through all its social channels after completion to build trust among investors. The project demonstrates its dedication to market transparency through this step during cryptocurrency market volatility. Phase 4 seeks rapid funds because sellouts are accelerating rapidly and the price will soon reach $0.03. The well-designed tokenomics system combined with high-yield DeFi operations puts Mutuum Finance in a competitive position against Cardano (ADA). Investors hurry to acquire tokens because they want substantial exponential returns. Racing Toward $3 Two cryptocurrencies MUTM and ADA show different yet promising routes toward reaching a value of $3. Mutuum Finance shows better growth potential through its quick presale dynamics and infrastructure as a decentralized financial platform than the established nature of ADA’s blockchain development. The MUTM listing effort will generate a 140% value at launch and could create 11,900% total return while ADA presents limited growth potential. Before phase 4 completes the investor interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rise higher. Cardano (ADA) brings investors reliable stability whereas MUTM demonstrates explosive growth potential that cannot be ignored.

Building on this technical signal, a crypto analyst has forecasted that Bitcoin could mirror historical trends and potentially surge to a new all-time high. Bollinger Band Signal Hints At Bitcoin Price Rally A closer look at Bitcoin’s weekly chart presented by Bitcoinsensus on X (formerly Twitter) reveals a critical pattern that has only appeared four times since 2022. Each occurrence has marked the beginning of a strong upward movement in Bitcoin’s price, making this a highly bullish setup. Related Reading: Elliot Wave Theory Shows Where Bitcoin Is In This Cycle – Bull Rally Over? The signal in question is the Bollinger Bands, which is known to identify potential reversal zones. The analysis shows that Bitcoin has recently touched the lower Bollinger Band on the weekly chart and bounced upward, confirming a support level that historically acted as a springboard to sustained bullish momentum. This marks the fifth time this specific signal has occurred during this cycle. Each of the past four signals, highlighted by the white circles on the chart, was followed by strong price rallies. Notably, in early 2023, Bitcoin rallied from below $2,000 to over $30,000 following the appearance of this Bollinger Band signal. A similar pattern played out in mid-2023 when this setup triggered a surge that pushed Bitcoin above $45,000. Later that year, the same signal preceded a breakout, with BTC soaring past $60,000. Most recently, in early 2024, the Bollinger Band signal sparked a parabolic run above $100,000. Now, in Q2 of 2025, Bitcoin is once again flashing this historically reliable indicator. Its price found strong support near the $77,500 level, with resistance levels set above $106,000. As the Bollinger Bands align, Bitcoinsensus predicts a potential rally toward $130,000 – $160,000. This would mark a historical all-time high for Bitcoin, representing a maximum increase of over 46.7% from its current ATH above $109,000. BTC Poised For Breakout As Price Nears $100,000 Again The Bitcoin price is once again approaching the $100,000 mark after its latest 4.75% surge this past week. Amidst its price recovery, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade predicts that Bitcoin will soon break out of bearish resistance to reach new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Raging Bull Indicator Turns Back On, But This Level Holds The Key The analyst shared a BTC chart analysis highlighting a recurring breakout pattern that has historically preceded large upward moves after a breakout from a descending resistance trendline. This pattern has emerged three times in the past: first from late 2022 to early 2023, then from mid-2023 to early 2024, and finally from late 2024 to early 2025. In the current setup, Bitcoin is once again testing the descending trendline resistance and appears to be breaking out from it. If history is any indication, the analyst projects a potential target zone between $100,000 – $136,000, marking a new ATH.

According to a new CNBC report , Trump crypto adviser David Bailey has raised $300 million in funding for a new BTC investment company, Nakamoto. The $300 million fundraising includes $200 million in equity and $100 million in convertible notes. Following the approach of Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, the investment firm intends to buy and hold BTC. Stripe payments app founder Jack Mallers, himself launching a different BTC-holding venture called Twenty One, said in the report: “What we really pride ourselves on is being blue-chip credibility with startup upside. We feel like we’re big enough to win entering the market with billions of dollars of capital upon launch, but we’re small enough to grow and we’re small enough to post bitcoin-denominated returns in what’s becoming a really competitive capital markets appetite for Bitcoin exposure.” Nakamoto is expected to merge with a Nasdaq-listed company and go public sometime this summer. The venture plans to use some of the BTC for international investments in companies in Brazil, Thailand and South Africa. Bailey is also the CEO of the media group BTC Inc. BTC is worth $100,068 at time of writing, up 3.4% in the last week.

As May kicks off, four names are drawing renewed attention — XRP, SUI, Solana, and MAGACOINFINANCE — each offering a different path to potential upside. XRP Hovers at $2.19 With Resistance Ahead XRP is currently priced at $2.19 , posting a modest +0.37% gain over the last hour, but showing a -0.68% decline over 24 hours . Its 7-day chart is nearly flat at +0.01% , suggesting the asset is locked in a tight range. While XRP remains a dominant force in cross-border payments, analysts say it faces tough resistance near $2.30. Despite its global utility and institutional support, near-term momentum appears muted, leaving tactical traders searching for more dynamic setups. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Solana Dips Despite Strong Network Activity Solana (SOL) trades at $147.87 , with a +0.44% move in the last hour but a -1.50% drop over 24 hours . The 7-day change of -0.54% reflects a slight downtrend despite ongoing developer activity and ecosystem growth. While Solana maintains a top-tier position among Layer 1 chains, its recent dip could indicate exhaustion following earlier rallies. With many believing Solana has already priced in most of its mid-term gains, investors are considering alternative Layer 1 plays or undervalued microcaps. SUI Slides to $3.36 With Broader Weakness Sui (SUI) is currently trading at $3.36 , posting a minor +0.06% hourly uptick but down -2.53% over 24 hours and -2.11% over the week . While it still commands attention for its unique Move-based infrastructure and scalable architecture, market confidence appears to be cooling. Technical traders note SUI’s drop below recent support levels could open up further downside if sentiment weakens. Still, its fundamentals remain strong enough to keep it on radar for a recovery play in Q2. LIMITED TIME OFFER-GET 50% EXTRA BONUS WITH MAGA50X MAGACOINFINANCE Emerges With Rare Upside While top altcoins tread water, MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming a focal point for those seeking serious returns. Still trading below major listings, the project is gaining traction thanks to its unique structure, early scarcity, and roadmap designed for exponential growth. Analyst buzz is growing as projections estimate 34x–35x ROI potential from current price levels. The token avoids VC influence, embraces a limited-access model, and is already capturing early community momentum. In addition to its ROI potential, what makes MAGACOINFINANCE stand out is its combination of aggressive tokenomics and a viral grassroots push. Unlike speculative meme coins or overleveraged DeFi tokens, MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning itself as a calculated growth vehicle — engineered to deliver long-term upside without early-stage dilution. It’s the kind of asymmetric setup investors look for before major listings drive mass adoption.

BlackRock’s expansion of its $1.7 billion BUIDL fund to Solana adds institutional credibility to the blockchain’s use for regulated financial products. Robinhood is reportedly preparing to launch tokenized stock trading in the EU, potentially using Solana. SOL Strategies is exploring a move to bring its public equity on-chain through a potential partnership with blockchain infrastructure firm Superstate. According to an announcement today, the companies signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) on April 25, 2025, to examine the feasibility of issuing tokenized shares of SOL Strategies on the Solana blockchain using Superstate’s new “Opening Bell” platform. The move would mark one of the first attempts by a publicly traded company to put regulated equity on a high-performance blockchain. BIG NEWS SOL Strategies is working to become the FIRST public company to bring registered shares on Solana through @superstatefunds ' Opening Bell platform. We believe tokenized equity represents the natural evolution of capital markets, and we're excited to pioneer this… — SOL Strategies (CSE: HODL | OTCQB: CYFRF) (@solstrategies_) May 8, 2025 For SOL Strategies, an active validator and ecosystem builder within Solana, the move reflects its mission to expand institutional trust and participation in decentralized networks. However, the company emphasizes that the project remains exploratory, with no immediate plans to issue tokens or convert existing shares, and regulatory engagement is still pending. Building Regulated Equity Infrastructure on Solana Superstate’s “Opening Bell” platform, launched alongside this announcement, seeks to modernize capital markets by allowing SEC-registered equities to be issued and traded on blockchain networks. As a junior transfer agent, Superstate would handle the backend infrastructure to allow SOL Strategies’ common shares to be represented as tokens on the Solana network. According to the announcement, key benefits of such an infrastructure include real-time settlement, interoperability with DeFi protocols, and expanded access to investors globally. According to CEO Leah Wald, SOL Strategies sees Solana’s speed and scalability as important advantages for tokenized financial products. “Publicly listed tokenized equity represents a natural evolution in capital markets,” she said. Still, the company has made no financial commitment, set no timeline, and has not approached regulators like the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) to begin formal proceedings. The plan remains entirely experimental to assess viability without impacting current shareholders or operations. This cautious, compliance-first strategy aligns with growing regulatory interest in tokenized assets and blockchain’s use in traditional finance. While still early-stage, if the effort succeeds, SOL Strategies could set a precedent for how traditional equities work with public blockchains like Solana. SOL Strategies’ exploration comes as major fintech platform Robinhood is reportedly preparing to offer tokenized stock trading to its European Union users. Robinhood is set to launch a blockchain-based platform that will provide European retail investors with access to US stocks, expanding trading opportunities. #Robinhood #Securities https://t.co/SgNj3E1Vr4 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 Although not officially confirmed, reports suggest the platform may deploy this product using either Arbitrum or Solana as the underlying blockchain infrastructure. The tokenized stocks will allow European investors to trade fractionalized, blockchain-based versions of public equities, opening new pathways for real-time trading, broader access, and potentially lower settlement risks. If Solana is chosen, it would strongly reinforce the network’s viability as a platform for regulated financial instruments, especially given its reputation for low fees and high throughput. BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund Expansion Instills Institutional Confidence in Solana This isn’t the first institutional move to use Solana for tokenized finance. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently expanded its $1.7 billion BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) to the Solana blockchain, adding another layer of credibility to Solana’s viability for regulated assets. @BlackRock expands its $1.7B tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, to Solana, leveraging the blockchain’s speed and low fees for enhanced on-chain access to U.S. dollar yields. #Crypto #Tokenization https://t.co/nUUkiEFJGR — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 25, 2025 Launched in March 2024, BUIDL offers qualified investors on-chain access to U.S. Treasury-backed yields with daily dividends and near-instant peer-to-peer transfers. Initially issued on Ethereum, BUIDL has since expanded to seven different blockchains, including Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, and now Solana, with Wormhole providing the cross-chain bridge. Solana’s high throughput and low transaction costs were cited as the reasons for this expansion.
