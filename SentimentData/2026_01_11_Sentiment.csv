That’s what leading Chinese AI researchers said Saturday. Two big Chinese AI startups, MiniMax and Zhipu AI, had strong debuts on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week. Investors seem confident in the sector as Beijing fast-tracks AI and chip listings to build homegrown alternatives to advanced US tech . Chipmaking equipment shortage holds back progress Yao Shunyu used to work as a senior researcher at OpenAI, the company that makes ChatGPT. Tencent named him their chief AI scientist last December. Ya o th inks there’s a good chance a Chinese firm could become the world’s top AI company in three to five years. But he says not having advanced chipmaking machines is the biggest technical problem. “Currently, we have a significant advantage in electricity and infrastructure. The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,” Yao told an AI conference in Beijing. China finished building a prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine last month, Reuters reported. It might eventually make semiconductor chips that rival what the West produces. But the machine hasn’t produced working chips yet. People familiar with the matter told Reuters it probably won’t until 2030. Yao and other Chinese industry leaders at Saturday’s Beijing conference admitted the US still has an edge in computing power. That’s because of heavy investments in infrastructure. Limited resources push firms to find creative solutions Lin Junyang is the technical lead for Alibaba’s flagship Qwen large language model. He explained the difference in scale. “The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours. But I see that whether it’s OpenAI or other platforms, they’re investing heavily in next-generation research,” Lin said. He spoke at a panel discussion during the AGI-Next Frontier Summit. The Beijing Key Laboratory of Foundational Models at Tsinghua University held the event. “We, on the other hand, are relatively strapped for cash; delivery alone likely consumes the majority of our computer infrastructure,” Lin added. Lin says China’s tight budget has actually pushed researchers to get creative. They’ve focused on algorithm-hardware co-design, which lets AI firms run large models on smaller, cheaper hardware. Tang Jie founded Zhipu AI , which raised HK$4.35 billion in its IPO. He pointed to something new happening with younger Chinese AI entrepreneurs. They’re willing to take on high-risk projects now. That’s usually been a Silicon Valley thing, and Tang sees it as good news. “I think if we can improve this environment, allowing more time for these risk-taking, intelligent individuals to engage in innovative endeavors … this is something our government and the country can help improve,” Tang said.

Market momentum is returning, capital is rotating beyond Bitcoin, and altcoin season is back on the agenda. As the risk appetite grows, attention is shifting toward high-upside plays with the power to dominate this cycle. And right as the market turns bullish, XYZVerse, a multi-title esports platform, steps into the spotlight, preparing for its Token Generation Event (TGE) and $XYZ token listing at the end of January 2026, fully geared up to take advantage of open-market momentum. Over the past months, the project delivered a standout presale, raising over $15 million, rallying a fast-growing community across X, Telegram, and CoinMarketCap, and pushing far beyond theory into live product development. On top of all that, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. And now, as altcoins begin to run, XYZVerse is entering the arena fully prepared. XYZVerse: Built to Dominate the 2026 Altcoin Run With Bitcoin setting the pace and liquidity rotating aggressively, 2026 is shaping up as the year altcoins take over. What many expected to peak in 2025 has been delayed — stretching the cycle and creating the conditions for a longer, stronger, and more explosive altcoin expansion. As capital pours in, the market enters full acceleration mode: Capital rotation intensifies, moving from majors into high-beta altcoins Utility-driven projects outperform, as users and investors seek real engagement Narratives scale faster, fueled by social momentum and renewed market optimism Price discovery becomes aggressive, especially for tokens entering public markets XYZVerse is entering public markets as 2026 altcoin momentum ignites, not after the crowd has already piled in. With its TGE and listing scheduled for January 2026, the platform is perfectly positioned where attention, liquidity, and participation begin to explode. Unlike many projects scrambling to launch during altseason, XYZVerse enters 2026 with: Live esports infrastructure already in motion On-chain engagement mechanics fully active A battle-tested community built before the bull market returned Deflationary tokenomics and sustainability initiative This setup allows XYZVerse to convert raw altcoin momentum into immediate platform usage, reinforcing demand for the $XYZ token as the cycle accelerates. A Massive Exposure Play: Crypto Meets Counter-Strike 2 Adding fuel to the fire, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. By entering the CS2 ecosystem, XYZVerse instantly taps into one of the largest and most passionate gaming communities in the world, dramatically increasing product visibility and putting the XYZVerse brand in front of millions of players, fans, streamers, and esports viewers. Every match, vote, prediction, and reward is powered on-chain, turning pure esports hype into real engagement and measurable demand. This move connects the project to a global audience far beyond crypto, amplifying awareness, adoption, and momentum exactly as the market turns bullish. The league features are: a 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 $XYZ prize pool 10 teams competing in 5v5 MR12 matches teams made up of KOLs, project founders, and community players (selected via Access Pass lotteries) fan-driven mechanics like map voting, predictions, and digital collectibles full on-chain transparency across results and rewards Participation is enabled via 100 USDT Access Passes, giving fans voting rights, prediction access, exclusive content, and collectibles tied to match outcomes. Rather than a one-off event, the CS2 League is designed as a repeatable engagement engine, showing how XYZVerse turns esports into an interactive, on-chain experience. As altcoin season heats up and esports attention explodes, the CS2 league becomes a powerful catalyst, supercharging XYZVerse exposure right at the start of the 2026 altcoin run. Grab an Access Pass and join the league before $XYZ hits exchanges. From Meme Origins to a Utility-First Esports Platform XYZVerse did not start as a traditional esports company. It began its journey in the meme-coin space built around the idea of fusing all-sports fandom and crypto lovers. The project tapped into the same attention-driven dynamics that have powered some of crypto’s largest communities. Rather than remaining a purely speculative token, the project evolved into a utility-first esports platform, combining the virality and cultural reach of meme coins and the engagement mechanics of sports and fan tokens. The result is a platform where attention is converted into participation — and participation into measurable on-chain activity. XYZVerse eSports Platform: Where the Utility Lives At the core of XYZVerse is a simple principle: engagement should create real demand. XYZVerse connects a single on-chain system designed to reward participation and scale with usage. Utility That Drives Demand The $XYZ token is embedded directly into platform activity. It is used to join competitions, support teams and players, and unlock items, cosmetics, and fan perks. As users engage, their actions generate on-chain transactions routed through XYZVerse’s infrastructure, meaning demand for $XYZ is driven by gameplay and participation rather than speculative holding. Engagement That Shapes Esports XYZVerse turns fans into active participants. Users can vote on maps and formats, influence seasonal structures, and support teams with verifiable on-chain impact. This shifts esports from a passive viewing model to a transparent, community-influenced experience where engagement has measurable outcomes. Revenue Router and the Closed-Loop Model All product activity flows through XYZVerse’s Revenue Router, which automatically allocates a portion of platform revenue toward $XYZ buybacks, token burns, and prize pools. This creates a closed-loop system: increased usage drives token demand, buybacks and burns reduce circulating supply, and rewards reinforce engagement. Designed as a multi-title esports platform, XYZVerse enables players to compete, fans to participate and collect, and brands to measure performance — all within a scalable, on-chain economic loop. 7,000% Presale Growth Lights the Fuse for January Listing Momentum is already on the scoreboard, and the main event hasn’t even started yet. As the January TGE and exchange listing approach, $XYZ is entering public markets off the back of one of the most explosive presale performances in the space. The token price surged from $0.0001 to $0.00715 during the presale, locking in a gain of over 7,000% (71×) before open-market trading begins. This wasn’t a one-stage spike. Demand built consistently across multiple presale rounds, signaling sustained appetite and strong positioning ahead of listing. The expected starting price at listing is $0.10. Once $XYZ goes live on exchanges, presale caps disappear and valuation is driven by real-time market demand, the phase where volatility, visibility, and momentum tend to accelerate. For many projects, this is where the story begins. For XYZVerse, it’s simply the next gear. Unlike hype-only launches, XYZVerse enters its listing phase with multiple engines already running: Live esports utility, led by the CS2 League, converting gameplay into on-chain demand Continuous participation mechanics, including leagues, predictions, and digital collectibles Mass-market visibility from esports audiences far beyond crypto-native circles Transparent buyback and burn mechanisms, directly linking platform revenue to token supply Together, these drivers are designed to sustain momentum after listing, not just during the countdown. The presale growth is already on record. The listing is next – Grab $XYZ before it goes public Sustainability Initiative: Built-In Support After Listing Following the TGE and exchange listings, XYZVerse plans to activate its Sustainability Initiative, a post-listing mechanism designed to support the $XYZ token as it enters open-market trading. Through this model, 10% of net profits generated by partner projects are periodically allocated to buying back $XYZ directly from the market. All buybacks are executed via a public, on-chain wallet, allowing full transparency and independent verification. For $XYZ holders, this structure introduces several long-term benefits: Ongoing buy pressure, created by recurring market purchases rather than speculative demand Gradual supply reduction, as tokens acquired through buybacks may be removed from circulation Direct alignment with platform growth, where higher ecosystem revenue translates into stronger token support By embedding these mechanics into its revenue flow, XYZVerse ties token performance to real platform activity, positioning $XYZ as a value-driven asset rather than one dependent on short-term hype. Roadmap: What Comes Next XYZVerse’s roadmap is built around progressive infrastructure rollout and ecosystem expansion, with each phase designed to strengthen platform utility, deepen engagement, and reduce reliance on one-off events. Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 Revenue Router contracts & public dashboard Challenge Hub with dispute windows Prediction and fantasy side pools Marketplace v1 for Moments and cosmetics Q1 – Q2 2026 Forging and crafting mechanics Liquidity staking programs Mobile companion app Regional paid cups and cross-title ladders Q3 – Q4 2026 Advanced micro-markets Brand marketplace launch Creator Collectives Cross-chain expansion Seasonal Router governance Taken together, the roadmap outlines a measured, step-by-step expansion strategy, prioritizing infrastructure first, engagement second, and decentralization last — a structure that suggests long-term planning rather than short-term momentum chasing. Final Takeaway XYZVerse is approaching its TGE and token listing at the end of January 2026 as a full-fledged multi-title eSports platform with live mechanics, a clear economic model, and an expanding roadmap. By combining meme-driven visibility with sports-style engagement and on-chain transparency, XYZVerse is attempting to build what many meme projects lack: a reason to stay after listing. $XYZ is nearing its public market debut. Get involved while the presale is still open and stay alert for official announcements on the TGE and exchange listings. 🌐 Website: https://xyzverse.io 🎮 CS2 League: https://cs.xyzverse.io 🐦 X (Twitter): @xyz_verse💬 Telegram: https://t.me/xyzverse Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Beiko clarified that he would remain at the foundation but shift to an advisory role within the Protocol team while stepping back from his responsibilities coordinating the All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) calls, which serve as the primary forum for coordinating changes to Ethereum’s execution layer. He simply noted his transition to exploring “frontier use cases” for the blockchain platform. Beiko did not exit the Ethereum Foundation “The protocol is approaching its endgame, yet we’ve only just begun scratching the surface of what a permissionless, scalable, cryptoeconomically secure, and cheaply verifiable world computer can do,” Beiko wrote , outlining his interest in exploring applications that could only exist on Ethereum. His departure from day-to-day protocol coordination reflects confidence in Ethereum’s existing governance structures. Ansgar Dietrichs, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation who joined core research in 2019, has agreed to extend his interim stint as ACDE chair while Beiko supports what he described as establishing a “stable long-term configuration” for the developer calls. Dietrichs, who holds a background in mathematics, economics, and computer science, has contributed to research on account abstraction, state expiry, and EIP-4844, the proposal that introduced “blobs” to reduce transaction costs for layer-2 networks. According to call minutes from September, he assumed the interim role when Beiko took leave earlier in the year. Beiko’s transition is happening as Ethereum developers come up on the two major network updates they have lined up in 2026. The “ Glamsterdam ” upgrade, which is expected in the first half of the year, will focus on gas optimizations and enshrined proposer-builder separation, while “Hegota,” slated for late 2026, will address state bloat and storage inefficiencies. Ethereum is trying something new Beiko’s new focus on frontier use cases suggests a strategic recognition that while core protocol work continues, the network’s value proposition increasingly depends on applications that leverage its unique properties. Beiko said that the following questions have been on his mind for a while: “What are things that can *only* exist on Ethereum? That fully leverage its unique properties?” He framed the question as identifying what makes Ethereum “not only unreasonably sufficient, but reasonably necessary for the world.” Beiko stated that “it feels like the right time to thoroughly explore them!” Looking back on his tenure coordinating protocol development, Beiko expressed gratitude for what he called “such a transformative period” and confidence in the individuals stewarding Ethereum’s future. “A big part of why I feel comfortable stepping away now is my confidence in the individuals and processes involved in the protocol’s stewardship,” he wrote. Beiko concluded by stating, “a pivotal year for Ethereum, at all layers of the stack,” signaling his continued involvement in the network’s development despite the shift in focus.

This article spotlights key cryptocurrencies outside the top 10 that show promise. Discover which digital assets are on the rise and potentially ready to soar, capturing the attention of savvy investors. Find out which tokens are set to make waves. Injective (INJ) Poised for Potential Upsurge Amidst Volatile Trends Source: tradingview Injective (INJ) is currently priced between mid-four to mid-five dollars, marking a steady climb of over 8% in the past week. This upward trend comes after a decline of more than half over the past six months. Despite its recent volatility, the cryptocurrency shows potential for growth, particularly if it can break through the nearest resistance level of just under six dollars. If successful, it might aim for the next target above seven dollars, which would represent about a 27% increase from its highest recent price. With positive indicators like a high RSI and Stochastic values, INJ might be ready for an upward surge soon. Immutable (IMX) Bounces Back: Can It Surpass 40 Cents? Source: tradingview Immutable (IMX) is showing signs of life with its price moving between 23 and 30 cents recently. The coin is hovering around the 27-cent mark, close to its short-term moving average. With a rising RSI nearing 63, there's a chance for growth if momentum continues. If IMX breaks past the 33-cent resistance level, it could aim for the 40-cent mark, which would be a strong uptrend of around 33%. Still, it has fallen nearly half of its value over the past six months, making any upward movement feel significant. IMX's journey remains uncertain, but optimism is bubbling among its supporters. Sei (SEI) Experiences Volatility but Eyes Potential Gains Source: tradingview Sei is showing a bit of a roller coaster ride in the crypto world. It is trading between slightly above ten to thirteen cents. Despite recent dips, it has the potential to grow if it breaks past its main barrier at over thirteen cents. If Sei climbs, it might aim for around about fifteen cents, which is nearly a jump of fifteen percent from its current top. The coin's ups and downs are reflected by its one-week and one-month changes, displaying small and steep declines. Sei sits below the ten-day and one-hundred-day trend averages, hinting it could rise with the right momentum and a bit of market luck. Celestia Edges Up, Eyes on Breaking Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Celestia (TIA) is finding its footing between $0.48 and $0.63, experiencing a slight upward tick of just over six percent in the last week. Traders are keeping an eye on the $0.68 resistance level. If it breaks through, there’s potential for TIA to aim for the next level at $0.83. This would represent an impressive jump from its current range. Despite a downward trend over the past six months, the recent movement is garnering attention, especially with an RSI close to 60, suggesting momentum is building. As market sentiment improves, there’s room for optimism and possible growth if key levels are surpassed. Stacks (STX) on the Rise: Potential for Gains Source: tradingview Stacks (STX) is on a promising upward trend, with its price currently fluctuating between 27 and 40 cents. This shows a significant boost of around 40% in just a week. It's nearing its resistance level at 45 cents, suggesting there could be room for more growth. If it breaks this barrier, it might head toward the next level at 59 cents. There's an optimistic monthly growth of about 27%, yet it's still recovering from a dip over the last six months. Key indicators like RSI and Stochastic point toward further bullish movement, hinting at continued potential for short-term gains. Stacks seems to be in a strong position to continue its path upward. Conclusion INJ, IMX, SEI, TIA, and STX show promising potential for investors looking beyond the top 10. Each has unique features and solid use cases. These assets demonstrate resilience and growth opportunities in the current market. Keeping an eye on their development and performance may benefit those interested in diversification. These movers offer a mix of established projects and emerging contenders, adding dynamic options to any portfolio. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Only half of SpaceX’s proposed 30,000 satellites were approved for deployment by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). SpaceX must deploy half of the satellites authorized by the Federal Communications Commission by December 2028. Full deployment is expected by December 2031. Will Elon Musk keep growing his Starlink constellation? The FCC’s Chairman, Brendan Carr, said the approval is “a game-changer for enabling next-generation services.” SpaceX also received approval to upgrade its satellites and operate across five different frequencies. The newly authorized satellites will provide direct-to-cell connectivity outside the United States and supplemental coverage within American borders. Next-generation mobile services will be available to deliver internet speeds reaching up to 1 gigabit per second, similar to high-speed fiber-optic connections. The FCC stated that these upgrades will help ensure no community is left without connectivity options. However, SpaceX must launch 50% of the maximum authorized second-generation satellites, place them in their assigned orbits, and have them operational by December 1, 2028. The remaining satellites must be launched by December 2031. The company also faces a November 2027 deadline to complete deployment of its 7,500 first-generation satellites. Why did the FCC approve half of SpaceX’s request? SpaceX initially asked for approval to deploy nearly 30,000 satellites, but the FCC refused to approve the deployment of the remaining 14,988, including those planned for operations above 600 kilometers altitude. The FCC explained that its cautious approach is because “the Gen2 Starlink Upgrade satellites remain untested on orbit.” The commission believes that authorizing half of the proposed number of satellites serves the public interest while also allowing them time to evaluate the performance of the upgraded satellite design. Jessica Rosenworcel, the predecessor to current FCC chief Carr, wanted more companies to compete with SpaceX’s satellite constellation in 2024. Starlink already controlled nearly two-thirds of all active satellites at that time. Its overwhelming number of active satellites has raised concerns about space safety and market dominance in the satellite internet sector. Amazon is attempting to challenge that dominance with its rebranded Project Kuiper satellite internet service, now referred to as Amazon Leo, starting in November 2025. Amazon began a preview of its services that same month and allowed select business customers to test the network using production hardware and software. The company plans to roll out the service more widely in 2026. The FCC granted Amazon permission to deploy 3,236 satellites, with requirements to launch and operate half the constellation by July 30, 2026, and the remainder by July 30, 2029. Last week, Starlink announced plans to increase space safety by lowering all satellites currently orbiting at approximately 550 kilometers to 480 kilometers throughout 2026. Satellites operating at lower altitudes will naturally deorbit more quickly if they fail. The focus on safety is due to a December incident in which one Starlink satellite experienced an anomaly in space, creating a small amount of debris and losing communications at an altitude of 418 kilometers.

Speculation is thick in the air: is Shiba Inu positioned for a new price climb or is the timing premature? This article delves into the factors that might signal a bullish trend and the coins ripe for potential growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes Recovery with Bullish Signs Source: tradingview Shiba Inu is trading between $0.0000074 and $0.0000100, showing signs of trying to bounce back. In the past week, SHIB's price saw a bit of a rise with a 7% increase. The next challenge is breaking past $0.000011, which is the nearest resistance. If it manages to overcome this, it could aim for around $0.0000136, potentially marking a growth of roughly a third. However, it recently faced a longer-term decline of nearly 35%. Yet, with its RSI near 53 and a high stochastic value, it might still have room to climb further. Keep an eye on market conditions as they shift. Conclusion SHIB has shown signs of renewed interest. Recent trends and market activities suggest growing momentum. However, patience may be required to see significant price movement. The market's response will determine if this anticipation translates to actual gains. For now, close observation is essential to gauge SHIB's next steps.

This decisive action by Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Informatics represents a critical turning point in how nations address the escalating crisis of non-consensual AI imagery, particularly content depicting women and minors in sexually explicit or abusive scenarios generated through simple user prompts on the X social platform. Indonesia’s Groundbreaking Grok Blockade Indonesian Communications and Digital Minister Meutya Hafid delivered a forceful statement to international media outlets including The Guardian, articulating the government’s position with unprecedented clarity. “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space,” Hafid declared. This philosophical framing elevates the issue beyond mere content moderation into the realm of fundamental rights protection. The Indonesian ministry has simultaneously summoned X officials for urgent discussions about the platform’s content governance mechanisms. This dual approach—combining immediate technical restrictions with diplomatic pressure—demonstrates a sophisticated regulatory strategy. Indonesia’s move follows months of escalating complaints from digital rights organizations documenting Grok’s capacity to generate harmful content despite existing safeguards. The Technical and Ethical Breakdown Investigations reveal that Grok’s image generation capabilities, when prompted by users on X, have produced thousands of non-consensual sexualized depictions. These AI creations frequently feature recognizable public figures, private citizens, and alarmingly, minors. The technology’s accessibility—requiring only text prompts without technical expertise—has accelerated the proliferation of this harmful content. Digital forensics experts examining the phenomenon note several critical failures in xAI’s content moderation pipeline: Insufficient filtering algorithms for identifying requests targeting real individuals Inadequate age verification systems for generated content Delayed response mechanisms for removing violating material Weak user accountability measures for those requesting harmful content Global Regulatory Responses Intensify Indonesia’s action has catalyzed simultaneous regulatory movements across multiple jurisdictions, creating an unprecedented coordinated response to AI content governance. Within the same week, India’s IT Ministry issued a formal directive to xAI demanding “immediate and effective measures to prevent Grok from generating obscene content.” This represents India’s first major intervention in AI content moderation since implementing its Digital Personal Data Protection Act. Meanwhile, the European Commission has taken preliminary investigative steps by ordering xAI to preserve all documents related to Grok’s development, training data, and content moderation systems. Legal analysts interpret this preservation order as groundwork for potential formal proceedings under the Digital Services Act and AI Act frameworks. Global Regulatory Responses to Grok Content Issues Country/Region Action Taken Legal Basis Timeline Indonesia Temporary platform block Electronic Information and Transactions Law Immediate India Formal compliance directive IT Act 2000 7-day response window European Union Document preservation order Digital Services Act Preliminary investigation phase United Kingdom Regulatory assessment initiated Online Safety Act 2023 Assessment underway United Kingdom’s Measured Approach Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, has announced it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation” under the recently implemented Online Safety Act. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly endorsed this approach, stating in a recent interview that Ofcom has his “full support to take action where necessary.” This regulatory posture reflects the UK’s emerging framework for platform accountability, which emphasizes evidence-based interventions rather than immediate punitive measures. Digital policy experts note that the UK’s approach balances consumer protection with innovation considerations, though critics argue it may allow harmful content to proliferate during assessment periods. United States Political Divisions Emerge The American response reveals significant political fractures regarding AI regulation. While the current administration has maintained official silence on the Grok controversy, Democratic senators have independently called upon Apple and Google to remove X from their respective app stores. This legislative pressure highlights growing concerns about platform accountability across party lines. The political dynamics are particularly complex given xAI CEO Elon Musk’s substantial financial support for political campaigns and his previous role in the administration. This entanglement between technology leadership and political influence has complicated straightforward regulatory responses, creating what policy analysts describe as “unprecedented governance challenges at the intersection of technology and politics.” xAI’s Evolving Response Strategy Following Indonesia’s blockade, xAI initially issued what appeared to be a first-person apology through the official Grok account, acknowledging that certain generated content “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” concerning child sexual abuse material. The company subsequently restricted AI image generation features to paying X Premium subscribers, though technical analysis suggests this restriction applied primarily to web interfaces rather than the standalone Grok application. Musk’s personal commentary on the situation has added further complexity. Responding to questions about regulatory disparities between Grok and other AI image tools, Musk asserted that “they want any excuse for censorship.” This framing positions the controversy within broader debates about free expression versus content moderation, a tension that has characterized platform governance discussions for nearly a decade. The Technical Architecture of Harm Forensic examination of Grok’s capabilities reveals specific technical vulnerabilities that enable harmful content generation. Unlike traditional content moderation challenges involving user-uploaded material, Grok’s architecture creates entirely new imagery based on textual prompts. This generative approach bypasses many conventional detection systems designed for existing media. Security researchers have identified several critical failure points in Grok’s current implementation: Prompt interpretation systems that insufficiently flag requests for non-consensual content Training data contamination with problematic associations between names and sexual content Output filtering mechanisms that fail to recognize novel generated violations Cross-platform integration issues between X’s moderation and Grok’s generation systems Comparative Analysis with Other AI Platforms Industry observers note that Grok’s content moderation challenges differ significantly from those faced by other major AI platforms. While systems like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion have implemented increasingly sophisticated content filters over several years, Grok’s rapid deployment and integration with X’s social platform created unique vulnerabilities. The table below illustrates key differences in content moderation approaches: AI Platform Content Moderation Comparison Platform Primary Moderation Method Response Time to Violations Transparency Reporting Grok/xAI Post-generation filtering Hours to days Limited public disclosure DALL-E 3 Pre-generation prompt screening Minutes to hours Regular transparency reports Midjourney Hybrid human-AI review Real-time to hours Community guidelines published Stable Diffusion Open-source community moderation Variable by implementation Varies by deployment Legal Precedents and Future Implications Indonesia’s action establishes significant legal precedents for international technology regulation. By framing non-consensual AI-generated sexual content as a human rights violation rather than merely a terms-of-service breach, the Indonesian government has elevated the legal stakes for platform operators. This approach aligns with emerging international norms articulated in United Nations discussions about digital rights. Legal experts anticipate several potential developments following this regulatory escalation: Cross-border enforcement mechanisms for AI content violations Standardized reporting requirements for generative AI systems International cooperation frameworks for AI content moderation Enhanced liability structures for platform operators The Path to Resolution Industry analysts suggest that resolving the current crisis will require multi-stakeholder engagement beyond simple technical fixes. Effective solutions must address: First, technical improvements to Grok’s content generation and filtering systems, potentially including real-time human review for sensitive queries. Second, policy enhancements to X’s community standards specifically addressing AI-generated content. Third, transparency mechanisms that allow external verification of moderation effectiveness. Fourth, user education initiatives about appropriate AI use and reporting procedures. Conclusion Indonesia’s decisive move to block Grok over non-consensual sexualized deepfakes represents a watershed moment in AI governance, demonstrating how national regulators can respond rapidly to emerging technological threats. This action has triggered a cascade of international regulatory responses that collectively signal growing impatience with self-regulatory approaches to AI content moderation. The Grok controversy ultimately highlights fundamental tensions between innovation velocity and responsible deployment, between free expression and harm prevention, and between national sovereignty and global platform operations. As governments worldwide develop more sophisticated regulatory frameworks for generative AI, the Indonesian model of immediate protective action combined with diplomatic engagement may establish new norms for international technology governance in an increasingly AI-integrated world. FAQs Q1: What specific content triggered Indonesia’s block of Grok? Indonesian authorities identified thousands of AI-generated sexualized images depicting real individuals without consent, including public figures, private citizens, and minors. The content frequently showed explicit sexual scenarios and sometimes depicted assault or abuse, all generated through simple text prompts on the X platform. Q2: How does Indonesia’s approach differ from other countries’ responses? Indonesia implemented immediate technical blocking combined with human rights framing, while other nations have pursued investigative, directive, or assessment-based approaches. The Indonesian method prioritizes immediate citizen protection, whereas other responses emphasize procedural compliance and evidence gathering. Q3: What technical measures has xAI implemented since the controversy began? xAI initially restricted image generation to paying X Premium subscribers and enhanced content filtering systems. However, technical analysis suggests these measures primarily affected web interfaces rather than the standalone Grok application, and experts question their effectiveness against sophisticated prompt engineering. Q4: How might this situation affect other AI image generation platforms? The regulatory scrutiny on Grok has increased pressure on all AI platforms to demonstrate robust content moderation systems. Industry observers anticipate more stringent compliance requirements, enhanced transparency expectations, and potentially standardized reporting frameworks across the generative AI sector. Q5: What are the long-term implications for AI development and regulation? This situation accelerates the development of international AI governance frameworks, increases emphasis on ethical AI design principles, and may lead to more proactive regulatory interventions. The controversy also highlights the need for technical solutions that balance innovation with fundamental rights protection across different cultural and legal contexts.

The police are working to trace the ownership of the machines confiscated in Teluk Intan and identify the people running the operations. Authorities warn the public that illegal crypto mining is a criminal offense that poses safety risks and can cause property damage. Is cryptocurrency mining legal in Malaysia? Police in Hilir Perak confiscated 41 machines suspected of being used for illegal cryptocurrency mining after a series of coordinated raids in Teluk Intan. Hilir Perak police chief Bakri Zainal Abidin confirmed that the first raid conducted on the night of January 9 resulted in the seizure of 24 machines. Two additional raids carried out earl y Ja nuary 10 led to the seizure of the remaining 17 machines. Despite this, no arrests have been made. The operations targeted three separate locations within the Teluk Intan area. All the suspects in the operations are being investigated for property damage and misuse of electricity supply, both of which are criminal offenses under Malaysian law. Cryptocurrency mining itself is not illegal in Malaysia, but it is illegal to steal electricity or damage property to run cryptocurrency mining operations. The machines seized in Teluk Intan are suspected of being connected to illegal electricity supplies and stealing from the national power grid. Unauthorized crypto mining operations often bypass electricity meters or tap directly into power lines to avoid paying for the massive amounts of electricity required to run mining rigs. Over the years, Malaysian authorities have conducted raids across various states. Some of those operations led to the destruction of thousands of mining machines. The police previously publicly destroyed confiscated equipment using steamrollers as a deterrent to would-be illegal miners. Malaysia advises against illegal crypto mining There have been instances in Malaysia and other countries where illegal mining operations have caused electrical fires and building damage. Illegal mining can cause safety risks and property damage because the equipment used for it generates substantial heat and requires proper cooling systems and electrical infrastructure to operate safely. Illegal setups usually lack these safety measures. Overloaded electrical systems can lead to fires, putting both the operators and surrounding properties at risk. Buildings where the illegal mining operations are carried out may suffer structural damage from the weight of equipment and the constant heat generation. Power theft also contributes to higher electricity costs for legal users and can cause voltage fluctuations or power disruptions in certain areas. The extra load on the electrical infrastructure can lead to transformer failures and other equipment damage that requires costly repairs. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Russian and Kazakh authorities have rolled out periodic restrictions on mining activities, especially during high-demand periods such as winter and holiday seasons. Hilir Perak police have urged the public not to engage in illegal cryptocurrency mining activities. Citizens with information on suspected illegal mining operations are urged to contact the authorities and help identify and shut down these operations before they cause harm.

Amongst the old popular cryptocurrencies which have still not managed to live up to their grand promises is Ripple (XRP). On the flip side, amongst new popular cryptos is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This new crypto has managed to achieve immense popularity by collecting over $19.7 million in its presale. XRP Price Analysis XRP is within the re-accumulation stage, thanks to the market rally created by whales and the consistent accumulation within the ETF. It is quite positive that the current price is holding above the essential support levels, which is a strong indicator of a strong market structure. The essential level at $2.20 has been created as a new anchor level. The resistance level at $2.20 presents numerous opportunities for a move to $3.20. XRP is a major market participant. But the growth rate is lower compared to those within the development stage, such as MUTM. MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance has already seen the participation of over 18,770 investors and has generated $19.7 million. After considering the diverse costs in phases 7 and 8 of $0.04 and $0.045, it is clear that coupled with public listing at $0.06, it would be very profitable to join in early. According to projections, it is expected that within a couple of months’ time, the price per token of the crypto could be as much as $0.40, thereby rendering a gain of up to 10x for those who join now. Phase 8 would give a marginal gain of 8x, while for those who wait until it is listed in the market for $0.06, a gain of merely 6x is to be achieved. DeFi Functionality Triggers Demand Mutuum Finance features a DeFi platform that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. P2C lenders deposit assets in lending pools that generate up to 10% APY. A 7000 USDT for example would yield $700 in interest at the end of the year. Peer-to-Peer lending provides higher yields, wherein interest rates can be established by transacting parties on a volatile asset such as Dogecoin. P2P lending may outdo the interest rates for P2C lending to go as high as 20%, thus underpinning its usefulness and intention in the creation of income with volatile cryptocurrencies. The system developed by MUTM has a reward system for fees generated based on activities performed on the platform, which are used to buy MUTM tokens in the market and share them amongst the stakers of mtTokens. mtTokens are the yield-generating assets which are earned for a deposit made in the MUTM lending system on a 1:1 ratio. For example, for a deposit of 10,000 USDT in the lending market, a user gets 10,000 mtUSDT. Apart from earning from the lending, the user gets staking dividends. Security and Testnet Achievements Security is another one of the key considerations for MUTM. It has been able to pass the Halborn Security test, where all feedback has been incorporated for securing the protocol. Functionality wise, the launch of the V1 protocol will be carried out on Sepolia Testnet, where it plans to enable engagement with the liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens for loans, as well as the automatic liquidator for under-collateralized accounts. Why MUTM Must Be in Your Smart Portfolio Where XRP provides stability, Mutuum Finance provides initial project exposure, presale development, DeFi integration, and several ways to reward token investors. Additionally, its target ROI of 10x for Phase 7 investors makes MUTM one of the best low-cost cryptos available for a well-diversified portfolio.

While BTC’s most recent retracement raises suspicions of resistance lying at the $94,000 price, the latest on-chain evaluation hypothesizes the presence of a more relevant resistance just beneath $100,000. New Whales’ Cost Basis Sits Around $99k On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr recently took to the social media platform X to share an interesting hypothesis on the Bitcoin price trajectory. His on-chain observation was based on the Realized Price New Whale STH Vs Old Whale LTH indicator. For context, this metric compares the acquisition cost, on average, of recently accumulated whale holdings (short-term holders) with that of Bitcoin’s long-term whale holdings. Related Reading: Why Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF Is The ‘Most Bullish Thing Ever’: Jeff Park Axel Adler Jr shared in his post that new whales have an average entry price near the $99,000 level. Currently, Bitcoin holds a valuation near $90,000, meaning its new whales are holding through unrealized losses. Hence, if the premier cryptocurrency ascends towards these whales’ average acquisition price of $99,000, the crypto pundit explained that these investors might become incentivized to sell their holdings. This means that these large BTC holders exit the market at break-even prices, or while incurring minimal losses. When the largest Bitcoin investors sell their holdings, the effect often translates to price through reduced buying momentum and a simultaneous increase in downside pressure. As a result, the entry price of these investors — in this case, $99,000 — becomes major resistance, both psychologically and technically. Long-Term Whales’ Average Cost At $39K In a separate post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Arab Chain revealed the average cost basis across varying cohorts of Bitcoin’s investors. As the new whales hold through their unrealized losses, the Binance user deposit addresses metric tells a fascinating story. According to the analyst, the average holding cost on Binance is approximately $52,691, indicating that a good portion of Bitcoin’s traders are doing so while enjoying their profit. Interestingly, the Miner Whales are not left out of this comfort zone. This group of holders, who have more than 1,000 BTC stowed away, has an average holding cost of $58,681. Considering that price is well above their cost basis, it suggests that Bitcoin miners are also in deep profit. As a result, there will be expectedly minimal selling pressure from this faction of the market. For Bitcoin’s Long-term Holder whales, the story is more rosy. These investors are holding their coins with an average acquisition cost of $39,681. As is intuitively obvious, this group of BTC holders is also operating within clear bounds of profit. Ultimately, it is clear that Bitcoin has a structurally bullish outlook, with unshaking investor support. If downside momentum were to enter the market, it would likely be short-term, as its oldest traders appear to be under no pressure to shave off their holdings. If retracements sponsored by these investors occur, it would likely be as a result of light profit-taking, rather than capitulation events. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $90,624, with no significant movement since the past day.

While the market leader has made a solid start to 2026 , concerns are still swirling around about BTC’s prospects over the coming months, especially in relation to the four-year cycle theory. Why $65,000 Could Be Crucial In This Cycle In a recent post on the X platform, Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, weighed in on the current structure of the Bitcoin price. The market expert said that the premier cryptocurrency has taken a breather in the past few months and lagged compared to other assets, like gold, in 2025. Timmer revealed that Bitcoin is drifting away from the historically steep power law trajectory and instead following the internet S-curve. This structure shift also opened the door to the ongoing conversation about Bitcoin’s typical cyclical behavior. According to several pundits, the traditional Bitcoin four-year halving-driven cycle is now dead, and a new structural upward wave seems to be taking root in the market. Proponents of “ Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead ” often state institutional adoption and spot exchange-traded funds as evidence of the new bullish market structure. While Timmer agrees that the relevance of the BTC halving event is decreasing, the Fidelity Director of Global Macro rejected the idea that the premier cryptocurrency would no longer see bear markets. “I’m skeptical, not about the waning power of the halving cycle (with which I agree), but the idea that bear markets are no longer going to happen,” Timmer said. Speaking from a technical point of view, Timmer identified $65,000 — around the previous cycle high — as a crucial level for the price of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the next most important level lies around $45,000, the power law trendline. For context, the power law is a mathematical model that suggests that Bitcoin’s growth follows a predictable and consistent trajectory. This metric, often used to identify key levels in price analysis, shows the correlation between the value of BTC and time. Timmer noted that while the power law trendline is far from the current price of BTC, it could move to $65,000 if the flagship cryptocurrency enters a prolonged consolidation phase for the next year. This could make the $65,000 level an even more important zone for the Bitcoin price.

Top Analyst Says Epic Rally Starts Now,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ready-to-explode-top-analyst-says-epic-rally-starts-now/,"The crypto market has entered a defining phase where volatility no longer signals weakness but opportunity. Rapid price swings, shifting macroeconomic data, and accelerating regulatory developments continue to reshape investor expectations. As capital rotates across the market, a small group of assets has begun to stand out, drawing attention from traders and institutions searching for the next sustained breakout. Insights shared by Bullrunners place XRP firmly within this emerging narrative. Their recent in-depth market analysis frames XRP’s latest move as part of a broader structural shift rather than a short-lived rally, suggesting that conditions now favor a more aggressive upside phase. Broader Market Conditions Set the Stage Overall crypto market health remains constructive despite short-term pullbacks. Total market capitalization recently stood near $3.11 trillion, reflecting mild cooling after recent gains, while daily trading volume remained robust. #XRP Ready to Explode? Top Analyst Says Epic Rally Starts Now? pic.twitter.com/FcTRiLVyHg — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) January 9, 2026 Market sentiment stayed neutral, indicating restrained optimism rather than speculative excess. Bitcoin dominance hovered around 58.5%, showing that capital still favors large-cap assets even as select altcoins begin to outperform. Macroeconomic data reinforced this cautious balance. Softer manufacturing inflation, weaker job openings, and improved unemployment claims reduced pressure on risk assets. At the same time, rising services inflation and anticipation around non-farm payroll data kept markets alert to sudden shifts. Traditional equities reflected similar dynamics, with the Nasdaq 100 maintaining a bullish long-term structure but lacking short-term momentum. XRP’s Price Action Signals Strength Against this backdrop, XRP delivered one of the strongest performances among major digital assets. The token surged roughly 25% in early January 2026, briefly reaching the $2.40 region. A wave of liquidations later pushed the price back toward $2.12 on January 9, yet the broader structure remained intact. XRP continued to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum on a relative basis, reinforcing the view that the move carried deeper significance. Bullrunners highlights that technical charts show XRP holding key support levels despite volatility. This resilience suggests that buyers remain active and that recent selling reflected market mechanics rather than a shift in sentiment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Changes the Narrative One of the most important drivers behind XRP’s renewed momentum lies in regulatory resolution. XRP now trades without the legal uncertainty that constrained institutional participation for years. This clarity has reshaped investor perception and reopened channels previously closed to regulated capital. Analysts cited by Bullrunners point to growing institutional exposure through XRP-related exchange-traded products. Cumulative inflows into these vehicles have reportedly exceeded $1 billion, signaling rising confidence from professional investors who typically avoid unresolved regulatory risk. Infrastructure, Adoption, and Institutional Interest Beyond price and regulation, ecosystem development continues to strengthen XRP’s outlook. Activity on the XRP Ledger remains stable, while speculation around enterprise integrations has intensified. Recent report have highlighted potential collaboration between Ripple and Amazon Web Services, particularly involving Amazon Bedrock AI for XRPL analytics. While no official confirmation exists, the narrative reflects growing interest in enterprise-grade use cases. At the policy level, momentum around the US market structure bill adds another supportive layer. The legislation now advances toward committee markups, with a possible path to presidential approval by the end of Q1 2026. This progress signals accelerating regulatory clarity across the digital asset sector. Outlook: Momentum With Measured Expectations Bullrunners concludes that XRP now sits at the intersection of technical strength, regulatory clarity, and institutional access. Some analysts project long-term targets above $30, framing XRP as a potential leader in the next expansion phase. While such forecasts remain speculative, current conditions give the bullish case more credibility than at any point in recent years. As markets await the next macro catalyst, XRP’s positioning suggests it will remain one of the most closely watched assets in the months ahead.

Market momentum is returning, capital is rotating beyond Bitcoin, and altcoin season is back on the agenda. As the risk appetite grows, attention is shifting toward high-upside plays with the power to dominate this cycle. And right as the market turns bullish, XYZVerse, a multi-title esports platform, steps into the spotlight, preparing for its Token Generation Event (TGE) and $XYZ token listing at the end of January 2026, fully geared up to take advantage of open-market momentum. Over the past months, the project delivered a standout presale, raising over $15 million, rallying a fast-growing community across X, Telegram, and CoinMarketCap, and pushing far beyond theory into live product development. On top of all that, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. And now, as altcoins begin to run, XYZVerse is entering the arena fully prepared. XYZVerse: Built to Dominate the 2026 Altcoin Run With Bitcoin setting the pace and liquidity rotating aggressively, 2026 is shaping up as the year altcoins take over. What many expected to peak in 2025 has been delayed — stretching the cycle and creating the conditions for a longer, stronger, and more explosive altcoin expansion. As capital pours in, the market enters full acceleration mode: Capital rotation intensifies, moving from majors into high-beta altcoins Utility-driven projects outperform, as users and investors seek real engagement Narratives scale faster, fueled by social momentum and renewed market optimism Price discovery becomes aggressive, especially for tokens entering public markets XYZVerse is entering public markets as 2026 altcoin momentum ignites, not after the crowd has already piled in. With its TGE and listing scheduled for January 2026, the platform is perfectly positioned where attention, liquidity, and participation begin to explode. Unlike many projects scrambling to launch during altseason, XYZVerse enters 2026 with: Live esports infrastructure already in motion On-chain engagement mechanics fully active A battle-tested community built before the bull market returned Deflationary tokenomics and sustainability initiative This setup allows XYZVerse to convert raw altcoin momentum into immediate platform usage, reinforcing demand for the $XYZ token as the cycle accelerates. A Massive Exposure Play: Crypto Meets Counter-Strike 2 Adding fuel to the fire, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. By entering the CS2 ecosystem, XYZVerse instantly taps into one of the largest and most passionate gaming communities in the world, dramatically increasing product visibility and putting the XYZVerse brand in front of millions of players, fans, streamers, and esports viewers. Every match, vote, prediction, and reward is powered on-chain, turning pure esports hype into real engagement and measurable demand. This move connects the project to a global audience far beyond crypto, amplifying awareness, adoption, and momentum exactly as the market turns bullish. The league features are: a 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 $XYZ prize pool 10 teams competing in 5v5 MR12 matches teams made up of KOLs, project founders, and community players (selected via Access Pass lotteries) fan-driven mechanics like map voting, predictions, and digital collectibles full on-chain transparency across results and rewards Participation is enabled via 100 USDT Access Passes, giving fans voting rights, prediction access, exclusive content, and collectibles tied to match outcomes. Rather than a one-off event, the CS2 League is designed as a repeatable engagement engine, showing how XYZVerse turns esports into an interactive, on-chain experience. As altcoin season heats up and esports attention explodes, the CS2 league becomes a powerful catalyst, supercharging XYZVerse exposure right at the start of the 2026 altcoin run. Grab an Access Pass and join the league before $XYZ hits exchanges. From Meme Origins to a Utility-First Esports Platform XYZVerse did not start as a traditional esports company. It began its journey in the meme-coin space built around the idea of fusing all-sports fandom and crypto lovers. The project tapped into the same attention-driven dynamics that have powered some of crypto’s largest communities. Rather than remaining a purely speculative token, the project evolved into a utility-first esports platform, combining the virality and cultural reach of meme coins and the engagement mechanics of sports and fan tokens. The result is a platform where attention is converted into participation — and participation into measurable on-chain activity. XYZVerse eSports Platform: Where the Utility Lives At the core of XYZVerse is a simple principle: engagement should create real demand. XYZVerse connects a single on-chain system designed to reward participation and scale with usage. Utility That Drives Demand The $XYZ token is embedded directly into platform activity. It is used to join competitions, support teams and players, and unlock items, cosmetics, and fan perks. As users engage, their actions generate on-chain transactions routed through XYZVerse’s infrastructure, meaning demand for $XYZ is driven by gameplay and participation rather than speculative holding. Engagement That Shapes Esports XYZVerse turns fans into active participants. Users can vote on maps and formats, influence seasonal structures, and support teams with verifiable on-chain impact. This shifts esports from a passive viewing model to a transparent, community-influenced experience where engagement has measurable outcomes. Revenue Router and the Closed-Loop Model All product activity flows through XYZVerse’s Revenue Router, which automatically allocates a portion of platform revenue toward $XYZ buybacks, token burns, and prize pools. This creates a closed-loop system: increased usage drives token demand, buybacks and burns reduce circulating supply, and rewards reinforce engagement. Designed as a multi-title esports platform, XYZVerse enables players to compete, fans to participate and collect, and brands to measure performance — all within a scalable, on-chain economic loop. 7,000% Presale Growth Lights the Fuse for January Listing Momentum is already on the scoreboard, and the main event hasn’t even started yet. As the January TGE and exchange listing approach, $XYZ is entering public markets off the back of one of the most explosive presale performances in the space. The token price surged from $0.0001 to $0.00715 during the presale, locking in a gain of over 7,000% (71×) before open-market trading begins. This wasn’t a one-stage spike. Demand built consistently across multiple presale rounds, signaling sustained appetite and strong positioning ahead of listing. The expected starting price at listing is $0.10. Once $XYZ goes live on exchanges, presale caps disappear and valuation is driven by real-time market demand, the phase where volatility, visibility, and momentum tend to accelerate. For many projects, this is where the story begins. For XYZVerse, it’s simply the next gear. Unlike hype-only launches, XYZVerse enters its listing phase with multiple engines already running: Live esports utility, led by the CS2 League, converting gameplay into on-chain demand Continuous participation mechanics, including leagues, predictions, and digital collectibles Mass-market visibility from esports audiences far beyond crypto-native circles Transparent buyback and burn mechanisms, directly linking platform revenue to token supply Together, these drivers are designed to sustain momentum after listing, not just during the countdown. The presale growth is already on record. The listing is next – Grab $XYZ before it goes public Sustainability Initiative: Built-In Support After Listing Following the TGE and exchange listings, XYZVerse plans to activate its Sustainability Initiative, a post-listing mechanism designed to support the $XYZ token as it enters open-market trading. Through this model, 10% of net profits generated by partner projects are periodically allocated to buying back $XYZ directly from the market. All buybacks are executed via a public, on-chain wallet, allowing full transparency and independent verification. For $XYZ holders, this structure introduces several long-term benefits: Ongoing buy pressure, created by recurring market purchases rather than speculative demand Gradual supply reduction, as tokens acquired through buybacks may be removed from circulation Direct alignment with platform growth, where higher ecosystem revenue translates into stronger token support By embedding these mechanics into its revenue flow, XYZVerse ties token performance to real platform activity, positioning $XYZ as a value-driven asset rather than one dependent on short-term hype. Roadmap: What Comes Next XYZVerse’s roadmap is built around progressive infrastructure rollout and ecosystem expansion, with each phase designed to strengthen platform utility, deepen engagement, and reduce reliance on one-off events. Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 Revenue Router contracts & public dashboard Challenge Hub with dispute windows Prediction and fantasy side pools Marketplace v1 for Moments and cosmetics Q1 – Q2 2026 Forging and crafting mechanics Liquidity staking programs Mobile companion app Regional paid cups and cross-title ladders Q3 – Q4 2026 Advanced micro-markets Brand marketplace launch Creator Collectives Cross-chain expansion Seasonal Router governance Taken together, the roadmap outlines a measured, step-by-step expansion strategy, prioritizing infrastructure first, engagement second, and decentralization last — a structure that suggests long-term planning rather than short-term momentum chasing. Final Takeaway XYZVerse is approaching its TGE and token listing at the end of January 2026 as a full-fledged multi-title eSports platform with live mechanics, a clear economic model, and an expanding roadmap. By combining meme-driven visibility with sports-style engagement and on-chain transparency, XYZVerse is attempting to build what many meme projects lack: a reason to stay after listing. $XYZ is nearing its public market debut. Get involved while the presale is still open and stay alert for official announcements on the TGE and exchange listings. 🌐 Website: https://xyzverse.io 🎮 CS2 League: https://cs.xyzverse.io 🐦 X (Twitter): @xyz_verse💬 Telegram: https://t.me/xyzverse Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

57049009,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892696,1768075830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57049009.jpeg,Vitalik Buterin claims corposlop is a growing pandemic that needs to end,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/buterin-warns-crypto-against-corposlop/,"Vitalik Buterin recently called out the dangers of what he has tagged “corposlop” in the crypto and digital space. He described it as a toxic mix that leads to the creation of products that at first glance seem user-oriented, but in truth are created to disempower people. Buterin’s post was a direct response to a tweet from a pseudonymous X user who made several predictions about what would happen to human society between 2026 and the year 2030. There were quite a number of predictions, including about how “the internet officially splinters” and how “after a year of AI-slop, the low-fi aesthetic wins.” Buterin claimed to agree with 60% of the predictions, but one bit he felt he needed to highlight is the “explicit separation between what the poster called ‘the open web’ (really, the corposlop web), and ‘the sovereign web.’” He called it a distinction he had not realized until recently, acknowledging that BTC maxis were far ahead because it turns out that their resistance to ICOs, disinterest in tokens besides Bitcoin, and arbitrary apps has actually been about keeping Bitcoin “sovereign” and not “corposlop.” “The big error that many of them made was trying to achieve this goal with either government crackdowns or user disempowerment (keeping bitcoin script limited, and rejecting many categories of applications entirely),” Buterin wrote. “But their fear was real.” What is corposlop according to Buterin? As far as the Ethereum co-founder is concerned, corposlop is made up of three components, including “corporate optimisation power, an aura of respectableness of being a company with sleek polished branding, and behavior that is the exact opposite of respectable, because that’s what’s needed to maximize profit.” He gave examples that he believes confirm how soulless corposlop, tagging them both lame and evil as they disempower the average user while making it seem like they’re serving them. Apple came up in the discussion, with Buterin acknowledging he has qualms with the company but admitting that the firm has many “non-corposlop traits.” “They serve users not by constantly asking ‘what do users want this quarter’, but by having an opinionated long-term vision,” he wrote. “They have a strong emphasis on privacy. They resist and create trends rather than following them. I just wish they could take the brave step of ending their monopolistic practices and switching to an open-source-first strategy. It may damage their market cap, but man must live for something higher than market caps.” How do you resist corposlop? According to Vitalik Buterin, in the year 2000, sovereignty was largely focused on avoiding the “iron fist of government.” However, today, that has expanded also to cover securing your digital privacy through cryptography, as well as protecting your mind from corporate mind warfare focused on extracting attention and dollars. “It also means doing things because you believe in them, and declaring independence from the homogenizing and soul-sucking concept of ‘the meta,’” Buterin wrote, claiming builders needed to focus more on creating tools that helped achieve or encourage that. As reported by Cryptopolitan yesterday, a16z crypto executives advised crypto projects to resist falling victim to the mind virus that has gripped the meta, where everyone is building trading apps. They warned against the upcoming “homogeneous competition” that the proliferation of trading platforms will inevitably lead to. Buterin mentioned some tools he believes will help and become highly sought after in the future, including: privacy-preserving local-first applications that minimize dependence on and data leaks to third parties social media platforms, and tools that let the user control what content they see and appeal to people’s long-term goals financial tools that help users grow their wealth, without encouraging 50x leverage, sports betting or taking out a loan AI tools that are maximally open, private and that maximize productivity from merging the power of human and bot applications, companies and physical environments with opinionated views on the kind of world they want to see DAOs that can support organizations and communities that steadfastly pursue a unique objective, as long as they are not all captured by the same groups “Be sovereign,” he concluded . “Reject corposlop.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to an average price of $6.55, with a possible maximum trading value of $7.11 in 2028. In 2032, the target price for XRP is between $13.47 and $14.59, with an average price of $14.03. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ripple Token XRP Price $2.09 (-1.57%) Market cap $127.03B Trading volume (24-hour) $1.68B Circulating supply 60.69B XRP All-time high $3.65 on July 18, 2025 All-time low $0.002686 on May 22, 2014 24-hour high $2.13 24-hour low $2.08 XRP price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 6.35% 50-day SMA $2.03 200-day SMA $2.57 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) XRP price analysis: XRP holds above $2 TL;DR Breakdown XRP price analysis confirms a downward trend at $2.09. The token lost 1.57% in value. XRP has support at $2.02. On January 10, 2026, XRP is showing a mild correction as the trend remains bearish for the day. The coin is trading near $2.09 following a 1.57% decrease over the past 24 hours. While XRP experienced a series of strong corrections over the past four trading sessions, selling pressure still persists, causing the coin to continue its correction. Sellers are striving to gain momentum, and conditions now warrant caution for bullish traders, as the price could plunge below the psychological mark of $2. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP confirmed a downward market trend. XRP/USD value decreased to a $2.09 low in the past 24 hours. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify rising selling momentum. XRP/USD 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening as volatility is increasing. Moreover, the upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the broken resistance, is at $2.29. The lower Bollinger band, indicating support, is at $1.67. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral area. The indicator is currently at 54 and moving downwards. The selling activities have led to a decrease. This descent is reflected by a downward curve on the RSI graph. If the bearish momentum continues to rise, the market can enter a period of instability. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of XRP confirmed a bullish market trend for the cryptocurrency. Its value increased to $2.09 in the past four hours. The decreased volatility signals less signs of reversal in the coming hours. The Bollinger bands are moving closer as volatility levels are decreasing. This decrease in volatility signals a higher market predictability. Moreover, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $2.18, indicating the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band is at a low of $2.05, securing the support. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral zone as it moves slightly upwards. Its value has increased to index 43 in the past few hours. The curve on the RSI graph confirms a positive trend as the indicator’s score increases. The recent upturn refers to a relatively balanced trading environment for investors.

The daily price analysis for the XRP/USD pair presents a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency, as the selling pressure continues. In the past 24 hours, the bears continued their lead, thereby creating unfavorable circumstances for the investors. As a result, the coin value has corrected to $2.09 because of the decreasing momentum today. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum picked up over the past week, driving the coin’s price to $2.13. However, the coin has corrected to $2.09 today. How much will XRP cost in 2026? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $2.81 by the end of 2026. Will XRP reach $5? If demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent, the coin could approach $5 by 2027. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 but not before 2032. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is expected to reach a maximum price of $14.59 by 2032, making it a valuable asset, particularly with the continued efforts of Ripple Labs. However, some regulatory uncertainties still exist for XRP. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that XRP trading was twice as volatile as BTC trading in 2025. On-chain data revealed that XRP recorded 80% realized volatility during the past year, highlighting a need for deeper liquidity to achieve stability. To maintain liquidity flow, Ripple released 1 billion XRP tokens in three tranches on January 1, 2026. 🚨 XRP ESCROW MOVE 🚨 1 BILLION $XRP unlocked from escrow in minutes, catching the market’s attention fast.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October through November, XRP traded around $1.83 to $3.10. At the start of December, XRP is trading around $1.99 to $2.18.

Still, he noted that the refunds wouldn’t be returned all at once, but instead would be rolled out over time, possibly over weeks or even a year. Currently, the U.S. Treasury has nearly $774 billion in cash on hand. Bessent, however, does not expect the court to overturn the tariffs. He argued that if the court reverses the tariffs, businesses that transferred the costs to customers would only benefit immensely. He commented, “It won’t be a problem if we have to do it, but ‍I can tell you that if it happens, which I don’t think it’s going to – it’s just a corporate boondoggle. Costco, which is suing the U.S. government, is going to give the money back to their clients?” Bessent says most businesses did not pass on the tariff costs to consumers Bessent also warned that if the court issues a mixed ruling, rather than a clear yes or no decision, it could make it more difficult to determine who is eligible for a refund and by how much they should be repaid. Previously, Morgan Stanley analysts had also projected that the court’s ruling could be far from clear-cut. The Treasury Secretary also told reporters that most businesses absorbed the tariffs themselves, and hence, consumers saw little to no price increase. Moreover, he pushed back on claims that Trump’s tariffs drove inflation, affirming that goods inflation stayed lower than overall inflation. Businesses and lawyers were expecting a Supreme Court decision on Friday, but the justices ruled on another case instead. The court has yet to say when it will issue a ruling on the dispute over Trump’s trade measures . However, Bessent believes that longer deliberations increase the likelihood that the court will support the president. Nonetheless, he insisted that the Treasury can still make repayments if the court rules otherwise. The government is projected to reduce its deficit in 2025 by about $300 to $400 billion, which would increase its financial capacity, Bessent said. For the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2025, the U.S. ran a $1.775 trillion deficit. Meanwhile, importers believe that collecting repayments on tariffs would be difficult if the Supreme Court were to rule against Trump’s IEEPA-based tariffs. Customs data showed that $133.5 billion has been collected through December 14, an estimate that is likely to reach $150 billion altogether. However, Bessent challenged the estimate, claiming it did not accurately reflect the number of tariffs that might qualify for refunds. He stated that tariffs collected under other laws also exist, although he did not provide a figure for those under IEEPA. Torres cautioned that reversing tariffs under the emergency act could push rates higher Some economists were deeply concerned about the possibility of repealing the tariffs. Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, for example, explained that eliminating the tariffs would have serious consequences. He stated, “If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds. President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.” Thus, he argued that cutting off tariffs would hurt onshoring and fiscal conditions, and push rates up. Still, it would boost corporate profits by lowering input costs and easing trade. The prediction market Kalshi currently assigns only a 30% chance that the court will uphold the tariffs as implemented. Earlier, Bessent had also shared his concern that refunding tariffs could burden the administration and hinder efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit.

Her comments come as Republicans push toward a January 15 markup, even as Democratic support remains uncertain. The Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2026 is expected to shape how digital assets are regulated in the United States. Lawmakers are now racing to finalize draft language while negotiations continue behind closed doors. Senator Lummis Outlines Goals of the 2026 Crypto Bill Senator Cynthia Lummis said the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2026 aims to bring long-needed clarity to the digital asset market. In a recent post, she said the bill draws a clear line between digital asset securities and commodities. She added that the bill also adds consumer protections and gives both companies and regulators a unified framework to work within. If passed, U.S. banks would be permitted to stake crypto assets and earn yield, and more capital could remain onshore instead of flowing to offshore markets. Supporters, including Senator Cynthia Lummis, say these changes could position the United States as a leader in the next phase of blockchain innovation, creating a safer environment for users and more certainty for financial institutions. As Coinpaper previously reported , Lummis has long argued that unclear regulation has pushed crypto activity offshore. She believes defined rules can encourage responsible growth while keeping oversight intact. Senate Committees Prepare for January 15 Markup The Senate Banking Committee confirmed it will hold a markup hearing on January 15. Chairman Tim Scott said the committee has engaged in months of bipartisan talks and is ready to proceed. An official notice stated that the markup will consider the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025. The manager’s amendment is expected on January 12, while member amendments are due by January 13. The Senate Agriculture Committee is also expected to act on its related crypto bill. That legislation focuses on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s authority over digital asset commodities, as Coinpaper outlined earlier. However, despite ongoing talks, Democratic support is not guaranteed. Senator Cory Booker, a key negotiator on the Agriculture Committee, has raised concerns that could delay progress. Senator Ruben Gallego has also warned that limits on senior officials profiting from crypto are a requirement for his support. He described this issue as a red line during recent discussions. Advocates say seven Democratic votes are needed for final Senate passage. Without those votes, the bill could stall despite strong Republican backing.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-10 20:31:12

The operations targeted locations suspected of stealing electricity to power mining equipment. Hilir Perak police chief Bakri Zainal Abidin reported that officers seized 24 machines during the initial raid on the night of January 9. Two subsequent raids conducted early on January 10 led to the confiscation of the remaining 17 machines across three separate locations in the Teluk Intan area. No arrests have been made at this stage. Investigators continue working to identify the individuals or syndicates behind the operations. Authorities are examining evidence related to property damage and misuse of electricity supply, both of which are criminal offenses under Malaysian law. Cryptocurrency Mining Remains Legal Under Proper Conditions Mining cryptocurrency is not illegal in Malaysia when conducted through legitimate means. The issue arises when operators steal electricity or damage property to run their mining rigs. The machines seized in these raids are believed to have been connected to illegal electricity supplies. Unauthorized operations typically bypass electricity meters or tap directly into power lines. This allows operators to avoid paying for the substantial electricity required to run mining equipment. Such practices constitute theft from the national power grid and violate Malaysian law. Malaysian authorities have conducted numerous raids on illegal mining operations across various states in recent years. Some operations resulted in the seizure and destruction of thousands of machines. Police have previously used steamrollers to publicly destroy confiscated equipment as a deterrent to potential illegal miners. Safety Hazards and Infrastructure Damage Illegal cryptocurrency mining poses significant safety risks beyond the legal violations. The equipment generates substantial heat and requires proper cooling systems and electrical infrastructure to operate safely. Illegal setups typically lack these essential safety measures. Overloaded electrical systems can trigger fires that endanger both operators and surrounding properties. The constant heat generation and equipment weight can cause structural damage to buildings housing these operations. Several incidents in Malaysia and internationally have resulted in electrical fires linked to unauthorized mining activities.",News|Legal|Crypto,EN,0,0,MINING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-10 20:52:30

This divergence between surface-level price action and underlying structure suggests that the BTC long-term thesis remains intact even as the forces shaping its next phase become more complex and more mature. Why Bitcoin Trend Strength Persists Despite Cooling Momentum Bitcoin remains firmly aligned with its long-term uptrend, but the more important signal is not showing up in price. CryptoELITES revealed on X that liquidity has been quietly tightening, and one of the clearest signals is TOTAL/BTC, which continues to bleed while BTC holds its structural levels . This kind of setup does not leave the market in panic; it just needs patience. If liquidity conditions begin to ease while the BTC trend continues to hold, the response won’t be instant. However, it will emerge gradually through rotations first, but not headlines. “How are you reading this phase right now?” CryptoELITES ask. The recent dip in Bitcoin doesn’t change the broader setup unfolding across the market . While BTC has chopped lower over the past few days, meme coins across the board have been quietly forming some of the cleanest corrective structures seen in this cycle. Crypto analyst 0xBossman highlighted that these meme coins have been reacting strongly to even modest BTC bounces and holding their structure during flash dips. In combination with the tight corrective structures, overwhelming bearish sentiment across major assets has swung bearish again. At the same time, meme coins continue to act as the leading edge of this broader rally , which will lead to an explosion soon. From 0xBossman’s perspective, this setup suggests that 2026 is where many of these meme coins will fully express their upside. The signals are already visible for anyone paying attention. From Downtrend Pressure To Structural Relief According to Ardi, one of the more constructive developments for Bitcoin over the past week has been the reclaim and hold of the 200 Simple Moving Average (200-SMA) on the 4-hour chart, a level that has acted as a reliable trend filter throughout this cycle. When this move slopes downward, price action will struggle to maintain local higher highs, and downside flushes will continue to appear. However, when the price regains the level and begins to turn up, the market will transition into a phase of sustained momentum. What stands out is that this is the first reclaim and hold of the BTC 4-hour 200-SMA since the October crash . This doesn’t automatically signal that the bull run is back, but it would give BTC a better chance to continue pushing through the $94,500 level.",Bitcoin News|0xBossman|200 SMA|Ardi|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoELITES|Simple Moving Average|SMA,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-10 21:30:00

While price action remains subdued for now, key resistance levels near $94,100–$107,500 will likely dictate the market’s next major move. Whether BTC resumes its upward trajectory or tests deeper support, the coming week could provide the confirmation the market has been waiting for. Expect Slower Bitcoin Market Moves According to Kamile Uray, the market has entered the weekend, a period typically characterized by slow and subdued price action. The key support region between $90,588 and $88,280 has not yet formed a clear bottom, but it continues to prevent a sharper decline. Related Reading: Three Key Levels For Bitcoin: Top Analysts Caution Against Potential Drop Below $70,000 On the upside, a daily close above the $94,130 resistance would signal that bullish momentum is resuming. If this level is cleared, the next key resistance to watch is in the $98,200–$107,500 range. The $107,500 mark is particularly significant, as a daily close above it would represent the first higher high relative to the last downward wave on the daily chart, potentially opening the door for further upward continuation. Should the market face deeper declines, there are multiple support zones to monitor: $86,398, $83,822, and $82,477. As long as BTC holds above $82,477, any pullbacks are likely to be considered retests of previous breakouts, keeping the broader bullish scenario intact. If BTC closes below $82,477, it could trigger a continuation of the downtrend, possibly testing the $74,496–$71,237 zone, which represents a strong support area. Once a clear reversal is confirmed from this region, an upward move targeting the downtrend line could follow, offering a potential opportunity for traders to re-enter the market. Weekend Choppiness Expected As Volume Remains Light In a more recent update by Lennaert Snyder on X, Bitcoin has entered its weekend liquidity phase. As usual, trading activity is expected to be muted due to weak weekend volume. Looking ahead to next week, Snyder noted that the best-case scenario would be a break above the monthly open in the next weekly candle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Absorbs The Flush: Quantum Structure Signals Wave (3) Toward $104,000 Snyder is monitoring key triggers for quality trades. Historically, Sunday “scam-pumps” have provided opportunities to execute short trades near liquidity zones. Currently, the $87,600 monthly open is viewed as the main target for potential downside. A diagonal line drawn on the chart highlights buy-side liquidity from shorts, which could be swept before a market structure break (MSB) forms, allowing shorts to be executed. If Bitcoin climbs above the current weekly high near $94,700, Snyder notes that the setup would simply wait for the next MSB to enter shorts again. Another key resistance to watch next week is around $96,500. A clean break above this level would invalidate the bearish thesis targeting the monthly open, signaling that upward momentum could dominate.

According to a January 10, 2026 report from Wired, this initiative forms part of a broader strategy among AI companies seeking high-quality training data to enhance their models’ capabilities. The approach raises immediate questions about intellectual property protection, data sourcing ethics, and the future trajectory of white-collar automation. OpenAI’s Contractor Data Collection Initiative OpenAI, in collaboration with training data company Handshake AI, has reportedly implemented a system requesting third-party contractors to provide concrete examples of their professional work. Company presentations specifically ask contractors to describe tasks performed in other roles and upload samples of “real, on-the-job work” they have “actually done.” These submissions can include various file formats such as Word documents, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, images, and repository files. The company provides guidelines for removing proprietary and personally identifiable information before uploading, even directing contractors to a specialized ChatGPT “Superstar Scrubbing” tool for this purpose. This data collection method represents a significant departure from traditional approaches to AI training data acquisition. Historically, companies have relied on publicly available information, licensed datasets, or synthetic data generation. The shift toward authentic professional work samples suggests AI labs are pursuing more nuanced, domain-specific training materials. Consequently, this strategy could potentially accelerate the development of AI systems capable of performing complex white-collar tasks with greater precision and contextual understanding. Intellectual Property and Legal Concerns Intellectual property lawyer Evan Brown expressed serious reservations about this approach in the Wired report. Brown emphasized that any AI laboratory adopting this methodology is “putting itself at great risk” by relying heavily on contractor discretion regarding confidentiality. The process inherently requires “a lot of trust in its contractors to decide what is and isn’t confidential,” creating potential vulnerabilities for both the AI companies and the contractors themselves. This concern becomes particularly acute when considering that contractors might inadvertently include proprietary information from previous employers, potentially violating non-disclosure agreements and employment contracts. The legal landscape surrounding AI training data remains complex and evolving. Current intellectual property frameworks were not designed with artificial intelligence data sourcing in mind, creating gray areas regarding fair use, derivative works, and commercial exploitation. Furthermore, different jurisdictions maintain varying standards for data protection and intellectual property rights, complicating compliance for global AI companies. OpenAI’s reported approach highlights the tension between rapid AI advancement and established legal protections for creative and professional work. Industry-Wide Implications and Ethical Considerations The reported initiative reflects a broader industry trend where AI companies increasingly seek specialized, high-quality training data. As AI models advance beyond general capabilities toward domain-specific expertise, the demand for authentic professional materials grows correspondingly. This trend raises ethical questions about consent, compensation, and transparency in data collection practices. Contractors providing work samples might not fully understand how their contributions will train future AI systems that could potentially automate aspects of their own professions. Additionally, the quality and diversity of training data significantly influence AI system performance and potential biases. By sourcing materials primarily from contractors, AI companies might inadvertently narrow the range of perspectives and approaches represented in their training datasets. This limitation could affect the models’ ability to generalize across different organizational cultures, industries, and geographic regions. The ethical imperative for diverse, representative data collection becomes increasingly important as AI systems assume more significant roles in professional decision-making processes. The Competitive Landscape of AI Training Data OpenAI’s reported strategy emerges within a highly competitive environment where access to quality training data represents a critical advantage. Other major AI developers, including Google, Anthropic, and various specialized firms, are simultaneously exploring innovative approaches to data acquisition. The race to develop more capable AI systems has intensified focus on data quality, with companies seeking materials that demonstrate professional reasoning, nuanced judgment, and domain-specific expertise. AI Training Data Acquisition Methods Comparison Method Advantages Disadvantages Public Web Scraping Large volume, diverse sources Quality variability, copyright issues Licensed Datasets Clear rights, consistent quality High cost, limited customization Synthetic Generation Complete control, privacy protection Potential artificiality, limited realism Contractor Work Samples High quality, professional context IP risks, ethical concerns, limited scale The contractor-based approach offers distinct advantages in terms of data quality and professional relevance. Real work samples provide authentic examples of professional decision-making, communication styles, and problem-solving approaches that synthetic data might not capture accurately. However, this method faces significant scalability challenges compared to web scraping or synthetic generation. Each contractor can provide only limited samples, and the vetting process for confidentiality adds administrative overhead. Balancing these trade-offs represents a central challenge for AI companies pursuing this data acquisition strategy. Technological and Practical Implementation The reported initiative involves specific technological components designed to facilitate data collection while addressing privacy concerns. The mentioned “Superstar Scrubbing” tool suggests OpenAI has developed specialized software to help contractors identify and remove sensitive information from their work samples. This technological approach attempts to balance data utility with privacy protection, though its effectiveness remains untested publicly. The tool likely employs natural language processing and pattern recognition to flag potential confidential information, proprietary terminology, and personal identifiers. From a practical perspective, contractors participating in this program must navigate several considerations: Employment Agreement Review: Contractors must carefully examine previous employment contracts for confidentiality clauses Data Sanitization: Proper removal of proprietary information requires significant attention to detail Context Preservation: Maintaining the educational value of work samples while removing sensitive elements Compensation Structure: Understanding how their contributions translate to payment and potential future benefits These practical considerations highlight the complexity of implementing such data collection initiatives responsibly. Contractors serve as intermediaries between their previous employers’ intellectual property and AI companies’ training needs, creating potential conflicts of interest and legal exposure. The success of this approach depends heavily on clear guidelines, effective tools, and transparent communication between all parties involved. Future Implications for White-Collar Professions The reported data collection strategy directly supports AI companies’ ambitions to automate increasingly sophisticated white-collar work. By training models on authentic professional materials, developers aim to create AI systems capable of performing tasks traditionally requiring human judgment, creativity, and domain expertise. This development trajectory has profound implications for various professions, including content creation, data analysis, administrative support, and even aspects of legal and financial services. However, the relationship between AI automation and professional work remains complex rather than purely substitutional. In many cases, AI systems trained on professional work samples might augment rather than replace human professionals, handling routine aspects while humans focus on higher-level strategy, creativity, and interpersonal elements. The quality and nature of training data significantly influence whether resulting AI systems serve as collaborative tools or competitive replacements. This distinction makes the current debate about data sourcing methodologies particularly consequential for the future of professional work. Regulatory and Industry Response The reported initiative occurs within an evolving regulatory landscape where governments worldwide are developing frameworks for AI governance. Recent legislative efforts in the European Union, United States, and other jurisdictions increasingly address data sourcing practices, transparency requirements, and accountability mechanisms for AI systems. OpenAI’s approach might attract regulatory scrutiny regarding data provenance, consent mechanisms, and intellectual property compliance. Industry associations and professional organizations are also likely to develop guidelines or position statements regarding the use of professional work for AI training purposes. Several key considerations will shape the regulatory and industry response: Transparency Requirements: Whether AI companies must disclose their data sources and collection methods Consent Standards: What constitutes valid consent for using professional work in AI training Compensation Frameworks: How contractors and original content creators should be compensated Audit Mechanisms: Procedures for verifying that training data complies with legal and ethical standards These considerations reflect growing recognition that data sourcing practices fundamentally influence AI system behavior, fairness, and societal impact. As AI becomes more integrated into professional domains, the methods used to train these systems warrant correspondingly greater attention from regulators, industry bodies, and the public. Conclusion OpenAI’s reported initiative asking contractors to upload real work from past jobs represents a significant development in AI training data acquisition with far-reaching implications. This approach highlights the industry’s pursuit of higher-quality, domain-specific training materials while raising substantial questions about intellectual property protection, ethical data sourcing, and the future relationship between AI and professional work. As artificial intelligence systems advance toward greater capabilities in white-collar domains, the methods used to train these systems will increasingly shape their impact on professions, organizations, and society. The current debate surrounding OpenAI’s contractor data collection initiative underscores the need for balanced approaches that foster AI innovation while respecting legal protections and ethical considerations. FAQs Q1: What exactly is OpenAI asking contractors to upload? OpenAI reportedly requests contractors to provide authentic work samples from previous and current employment, including documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and other professional materials they have actually created in their roles. Q2: Why would OpenAI want real work samples for AI training? Authentic professional work provides high-quality training data that demonstrates real-world problem-solving, communication styles, and domain expertise, potentially helping AI systems learn to perform complex white-collar tasks more effectively. Q3: What are the main intellectual property concerns with this approach? Contractors might inadvertently include proprietary information from previous employers, potentially violating confidentiality agreements. The approach relies heavily on contractors correctly identifying what constitutes confidential information. Q4: How does OpenAI address privacy and confidentiality concerns? The company reportedly provides guidelines for removing sensitive information and directs contractors to a specialized “Superstar Scrubbing” tool to help identify and remove proprietary and personally identifiable information. Q5: Is this approach unique to OpenAI or common in the AI industry?

The holders and investors wait for some gains. However, it seems that this steady growth is not in line with the good performance and massive gains displayed by some relatively new cryptocurrencies that have a real value and application for users. In order to get massive benefits, it is usually necessary to look out for some prospects that exist outside the major movers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quite an alluring investment opportunity available at a presale price of $0.04 due to its innovative approach that is set to provide profits to its investors. Presale Designed for Early Advantage Mutuum Finance presale is the best method for initial investors, giving the highest returns. Phase 7 is currently open with tokens costing $0.04, but it won’t last since the availability of tokens is limited for this stage. Phase 8 will offer tokens costing $0.045, an increase of almost 20%. More price increases will follow until launch at $0.06. This gives the biggest returns to investors who act first, while those who wait are required to pay more for the same tokens. An investment of $500 may see an ROI of $1375 to become $1875 when Mutuum Finance hits $0.15 like predicted. This translates to 3.75x growth from the current price. Over-Collateralized Loans The utility of Mutuum is vast and includes leveraging borrowed funds while retaining control over assets. For example, MUTM allows an investor to lock away $15,000 in ETH and subsequently borrows $10,000 in stable currencies, which is an important aspect for those looking for the best crypto to invest in. The utility offered allows stakeholders to access more funds for investments without selling ETH, in case it appreciates in price in the subsequent market periods. Assuming the $10,000 is put in a yield-farming pool with an annual yield of 10%, an individual is able to make an annual profit of $1,000, hence justifying MUTM as a utility-rich cryptocurrency with potential as an ideal long-term investment opportunity. The Buy-and-Distribute Dividend Model This model ensures that it generates utility for its stakeholders in an organized approach in which it churns out tokens for stakeholders’ acquisition through the structured system in which it operates. A fraction of all fee revenues generated is used in acquiring MUTM tokens, which are rewarded to stakeholders who stake in mtTokens. Assuming the platform generates revenues of $1 million in fee revenues. 20% of that could go to buying back tokens which are distributed to stakeholders for free. This could offer several hundreds of dollars in earnings for those who stake as little as $1000. Positioning in an Expanding Project Although there are stability patterns for Bitcoin within a range, Mutuum Finance clearly has steady developments. The project has finished its security audit by Halborn Security and is soon to unveil the test network on Sepolia, which signifies a heavy focus on security measures. This ensures that risks are well mitigated for investors to contribute to the growth of the token price. In a region of investors who are highly selective regarding sound tokens to invest in, Mutuum Finance offers an exceptional opportunity. Anyone interested in investing in an authentic cryptocurrency that has passed all required approvals should invest in MUTM.

Burn Metric Explodes Overnight,https://coinpaper.com/13666/shiba-inu-price-breakout-imminent-burn-metric-explodes-overnight,"Shiba Inu has recorded a dramatic spike in its token burn rate, marking a potential turning point for the meme cryptocurrency. Data from Shibburn reveals that more than 7.2 million SHIB tokens were removed from circulation within 24 hours on January 10, 2026. The burn rate jumped by 38,043% compared to the previous day. This massive increase breaks a prolonged streak of minimal burn activity that had kept the metric in negative territory for several consecutive days. Supply Reduction Shows Long-Term Strategy The total SHIB supply now stands at 589,245,806,058,242 tokens. This figure reflects ongoing efforts to reduce the original quadrillion-token supply through systematic burning. Sustained burn activity often correlates with broader network health. The recent spike suggests renewed engagement from the SHIB community. Previous periods of elevated burns have coincided with price rallies, though past performance does not guarantee future results. The Shiba Inu development team has implemented various burn mechanisms since the token's launch. These include transaction-based burns and community-driven initiatives. The latest data indicates these programs may be gaining traction again after a quiet period. Price Movement Mirrors Burn Activity SHIB's price increased by 0.81% over the last 24 hours. The token traded at $0.00000871 at the time of reporting. This modest gain marks a shift from recent red territory into positive momentum.

New data shows retail traders growing more optimistic as ETF headlines and macro narratives increasingly influence crypto price movements. According to the latest social and sentiment data compiled by Santiment, there has been a renewed optimism among retail traders, even as recent price action has begun to flatten and Bitcoin (BTC) tests key psychological levels. Recovery has not been limited to large-cap cryptocurrencies. In fact, several altcoins and meme coins also posted strong gains. Fresh Retail FOMO Social media discussion across platforms such as X, Reddit, and Telegram has shifted noticeably and reflected a more positive tone after months of bearish sentiment following Bitcoin’s October 2025 all-time high. Bitcoin remains at the center of the narrative. Its recent moves have been heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors and traditional financial market dynamics. ETF flow headlines played a significant role, particularly after US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a sizable one-day net outflow led by major issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity. The pullback coincided with traders de-risking ahead of crucial US economic data and expectations around interest rate cuts, which validates the view that Bitcoin is increasingly trading like a macro-sensitive asset. Ethereum has seen a more mixed sentiment profile. According to Santiment, discussion around the world’s largest altcoin by market cap has focused less on price action and more on staking-related developments, including staking rewards tied to regulated investment products. While interest in staking has increased, sentiment has remained scattered. This essentially reflects a lack of a clear directional catalyst for ETH in early 2026. This is true for several major outperformers, as retail sentiment remains uneven and highly reactive to short-term catalysts. For instance, Ripple (XRP) stood out with a nearly 14% weekly gain. This coincided with an increased attention around XRP’s January escrow unlock, which released 1 billion tokens, with a large portion reportedly re-locked. The scheduled supply event, combined with strong early-year momentum, drove a surge in retail participation. However, optimism rose sharply as traders attempted to buy perceived dips, followed by renewed caution as prices corrected from recent highs. Solana (SOL) also saw a significant jump in sentiment and price, which was swayed largely by institutional headlines, including a Reuters report that Morgan Stanley filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Solana. Meme Coins Rebound Meme coins have also re-entered the spotlight. The OG, Dogecoin (DOGE), saw double-digit gains over the week, supported in part by strong performance from the 21Shares 2x Long Dogecoin ETF, which posted gains of roughly 38-39% in the first days of 2026. The ETF’s performance has contributed to fresh interest across the meme coin sector. Several meme coins have also witnessed synchronized whale buying and social hype this year.

The pullback has so far been controlled, with price holding above former resistance that has now turned into short-term support. A technical analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Bird proposed that conditions are now right for a familiar macro setup that has preceded XRP’s largest historical rallies. The focus of this outlook is on XRP’s reaction with the US dollar index and what its next move could mean for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator How DXY Weakness Has Always Unlocked XRP Rallies Bird’s analysis is based on the US Dollar Index, or DXY, and its inverse relationship with XRP during important phases. The chart accompanying his post pointed to three previous periods, around 2017, 2021, and 2024, where sustained weakness in the dollar coincided with aggressive upside moves in XRP. In each of those cycles, red candles on the DXY chart led to a loss of dollar strength, while XRP responded with strong upward expansion shortly after. This recurring pattern means that XRP’s largest moves tend to follow macro shifts, not just even events related to XRP. When dollar dominance fades, capital always rotates into crypto assets, and XRP has been one of the primary beneficiaries of that transition. Interestingly, the current setup shows that DXY has returned to a similar structural zone seen before past rollovers. As shown in the chart below, the DXY is now trending downwards. US Dollar Index, XRPUSD. Source: @Bird_XRPL On X XRP To New All-Time Highs? The first highlighted phase captures the late-2017 to early-2018 cycle, when a weakening dollar backdrop lined up with XRP’s rally run into the cycle peak in the mid-$3 range. A similar relationship appeared around the 2020-2021 window, where dollar softness was followed by XRP surging to $1.90 at its cycle top. The latest was in H1 2025, which culminated in XRP reaching its current all-time high of $3.65 in July. The important context is why the current moment is a decision point. At the time of writing, the DXY is sitting around 99, and from here it can either turn lower and start printing red candles again or catch a bid and print green. If DXY starts printing red candles again and rolls over, the pattern Bird is pointing to suggests the macro backdrop becomes supportive for another strong XRP leg higher, which is why a new all-time high above $3.65 could come into view within the next few months. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator If DXY prints green and strengthens, that would be the opposite signal: it can tighten liquidity conditions and keep XRP’s price action capped in consolidation around $2 before any breakout attempt. Either way, the dollar’s next move will signal what comes next.

The release targets both staked and unstaked validators, including test nodes, and signals the network’s continued focus on operational resilience. According to Solana Status, validators should apply the patch immediately to reduce exposure to potential disruptions. Consequently, the update reinforces Solana’s approach of deploying preventative fixes before issues affect users or applications. Validator Update Reinforces Network Reliability The v3.0.14 release continues a pattern of rapid maintenance updates across Solana’s v3 validator client series. Besides addressing potential vulnerabilities, these patches aim to strengthen long-term performance and stability. Developers often push such updates quietly, ensuring validators install them before any network impact becomes visible. Hence, the absence of a detailed changelog aligns with Solana’s emphasis on proactive defense. Additionally, rising on-chain activity has increased the importance of validator reliability. The recent launch of the SKR token highlights growing demand across DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets. Stable validator layer supports higher throughput and smoother user experiences. Consequently, the network continues prioritizing infrastructure hardening alongside ecosystem growth. Major Upgrades Shape Solana’s Roadmap Moreover, Solana’s broader roadmap includes structural upgrades designed to address congestion and decentralization concerns. The Alpenglow upgrade, introduced in September 2025, replaced legacy consensus components with Votor and Rotor. These changes target faster finality and parallel execution, improving scalability. The network plans mainnet deployment this year, expanding capacity for complex applications. Significantly, the Firedancer validator client also plays a central role. Released in Q1 2025 by Jump Crypto, Firedancer runs alongside the Agave client. Its modular design enables parallel processing and targets extremely high throughput. The Agave 3.0.6 release, recommended in October, further supported validator efficiency. Together, these upgrades aim to future-proof Solana’s infrastructure. SOL Price Structure Reflects Compression and Accumulation Source: CoinCodex However, SOL price action shows near-term caution despite structural optimism. Solana traded near $135.31, posting a mild daily decline while maintaining a weekly gain above 2%. Market capitalization hovered near $76.3 billion, supported by steady circulation levels. According to moonbag, SOL’s long-term chart structure supports a breakout toward higher psychological levels, with $400 emerging as a potential upside target. Weekly price compression within a symmetrical triangle suggests prolonged accumulation. Resistance near $260 remains critical, while sustained strength above $180 could unlock higher targets. Source: X Eljaboom highlighted improving short-term structure after SOL reclaimed the $135–$138 demand zone. Additionally, higher lows continue forming, which limits downside risk. Analysts see $145 as a near-term pivot, with $187 emerging as a key resistance level ahead of February.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-10 23:31:01

The incident is the latest breach to affect a DeFi protocol on the Arbitrum network in 2026, with only ten days into the year. The news first broke when Phalcon, BlockSec’s threat detection platform disclosed on X that it had detected suspicious transactions targeting Futureswap’s contract. The security firm said it had attempted to contact the team but had received no response at the time of publication. For context, the project’s X account last posted in 2022. According to Phalcon, “The attacker appears to have drained funds through multiple changePosition operations, eventually withdrawing a large amount of USDC.” It also added, “Since the contract is not open-sourced, the exact root cause still requires further investigation.” ALERT! Our system detected a suspicious transaction targeting @futureswapx ’s contract on #Arbitrum a few hours ago, resulting in an estimated loss of ~$395K. We have attempted to contact the team, but have not received a response so far. The attacker appears to have drained… pic.twitter.com/SD5CUCfA8h — BlockSec Phalcon (@Phalcon_xyz) January 10, 2026 How did Futureswap get hacked? BlockSec analyzed the on-chain behavior and stated that it suspects “the incident may be related to unexpected stableBalance accounting changes during earlier position updates, which later allowed USDC to be released when removing collateral.” A few days earlier, on January 5, Cryptopolitan reported that two Arbitrum projects lost $1.5 million in smart contract access attacks. USD Gambit and TLP, both launched by the same deployer, suffered unauthorized withdrawals after an attacker gained admin access and replaced smart contracts with malicious versions. According to blockchain security firm Cyvers Alert, preliminary analysis shows that the single deployer may have lost access to their account. “The attacker then deployed a new contract and updated the ProxyAdmin privileges to gain control,” Cyvers Alert stated. The stolen funds were later bridged to the Ethereum network and deposited into Tornado Cash. Are hackers targeting Arbitrum? Arbitrum’s name has come up a lot in the 2026 DeFi hacks reported so far. In early January, TMX Tribe suffered a $1.4 million exploit, while the IPOR Fusion USDC vault lost $336,000 through a legacy contract vulnerability, though the DAO pledged full user reimbursement. Security researchers have noted that recent attacks follow a similar pattern that has been linked to North Korean state-sponsored hackers, who predominantly use Tornado Cash to launder funds. The attackers have learned to move quickly to swap and mix stolen funds almost immediately to avoid address blacklisting. These breaches typically target high-liquidity ecosystems because that way, the exploiters maximize their chances of major hauls. According to Defillama, Arbitrum holds over $3 billion across DeFi protocols on the platform, and it has never been far from the number one spot among Ethereum L2s in terms of TVL since it launched in 2021. Another common theme among recent hacks has been that they typically go for older smart contracts still holding liquidity. In July 2025, Cryptopolitan reported that the Arbitrum Foundation rolled out a $14 million war chest via the Arbitrum Audit Program to support native projects by subsidizing their smart contract audits. Exploit loot is quickly rerouted through mixers The fourth quarter of 2025 saw a spike in Tornado Cash deposits, with the mixer now holding a record value locked from both new hacks and older exploits. The platform contains more than 338,000 ETH, which is more than its 2021 peak. Mixers like Railgun have also experienced an uptick in activity at the end of 2025. The attacks have primarily targeted relatively obscure projects based on what analysts have observed. USD Gambit, for instance, points to a singular exchange being phased out in the coming weeks. Despite launching in 2023, the project did not benefit from the recovery of DeFi and perpetual futures trading, making it an easier target with less security oversight.

According to CoinsKid, a technical analyst known for his market commentary, XRP may experience further downside before the next phase of bullish momentum begins. XRP entered 2026 with strong gains , rallying above $2 in early January and reaching a peak of $2.41 on January 6. Following this advance, the token encountered resistance, resulting in several intraday declines. At the time of reporting, XRP is trading around $2.08 , testing the $2 support level. While many market observers anticipate a short-term rebound, CoinsKid suggests that the current pullback may not represent the final low for the year. Historical Bottoms Provide Context In a recent video commentary, CoinsKid referenced historical lows to contextualize his 2026 prediction. He noted that XRP’s bottom in 2020 was $0.21, rising to $0.55 during the 2021 bull market. In 2022, the bear market triggered by events like the Terra and FTX collapses pushed XRP down to $0.29. The following year, 2023, saw limited upward momentum, leaving the bottom at $0.30. By 2024, the low had improved to $0.388, though the cryptocurrency was still underperforming relative to expectations. XRP’s performance improved markedly in late 2024 and throughout 2025, surpassing the $1 and $2 thresholds. During the correction in April 2025, the bottom for that year was identified at $1.64, which CoinsKid had previously highlighted despite some pushback from the community when prices were above $3 at the time. Technical Basis for 2026 Bottom For 2026, CoinsKid projects a lower support level of $1.14. In his commentary, he presented a technical analysis showing that XRP broke above a seven-year symmetrical triangle during the November 2024 uptrend, initiating the first wave of an Elliott Wave structure that peaked at $3.4 in January 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to CoinsKid, the subsequent decline represents Wave 2, an ABC corrective pattern that could push XRP toward the $1.14 level before resuming upward momentum. He also highlighted the importance of the 1.414 Fibonacci extension in identifying potential corrective lows. If XRP loses its current structure and drops below $1.9, the analyst expects the correction to reach this level, consistent with historical patterns observed in 2015 and 2021. Potential Upside After Correction Following the completion of the correction, CoinsKid anticipates that XRP could enter a strong recovery phase. Under this scenario, the cryptocurrency might ultimately reach $27 , representing a potential increase of nearly 1,200% from current prices. He emphasized, however, that this projection is hypothetical and contingent on the correction concluding as expected. CoinsKid acknowledged that both the predicted bottom and the potential peak carry significant uncertainty and are not guaranteed outcomes. This analysis underscores the importance of patience for investors, as technical setups suggest that XRP could experience additional short-term weakness before positioning itself for a potential long-term rally in 2026.

Meme coins are waking up, charts are moving, and people are chasing the next big breakout like kids chasing an ice cream truck. If you’re looking for the top crypto to buy now you’re in the right place, because timing is everything in crypto. In this article, we’re comparing three meme-powered contenders: APEMARS ($APRZ), Floki (FLOKI), and SNEK (SNEK). Floki continues to ride strong community energy while staying active in the meme coin spotlight. SNEK keeps holding its place as one of Cardano’s favorite meme tokens with loyal supporters. But APEMARS ($APRZ)? It’s still in presale, which means the “early advantage” is still alive and kicking. APEMARS ($APRZ) Presale Stage 3: Why It Feels Like Getting a Golden Ticket Early Imagine a candy shop where the candy is still cheap… but soon it becomes expensive.

Here are the correct Stage 3 presale stats for APEMARS ($APRZ): Presale is Live Current Stage: 3 Stage 2 Price: $0.00002448 Listing Price: $0.0055 ROI From Stage 3: 22,300% Holder Count: 268 Amount Raised: $60k+ Tokens Sold: 2.90B The gap between the presale price and the listing price is what makes APEMARS ($APRZ) so exciting. It’s not just about the meme, it’s the math that creates the FOMO. Unique Utilities That Make APEMARS ($APRZ) More Than Just a Meme APEMARS isn’t trying to be “just another meme.” It’s built like a fun mission from Earth to Mars, almost like a story you can join. People love stories and adventures, and they love feeling like they’re part of something exciting. That’s why a strong theme makes it easy for the community to share it online, talk about it everywhere, and grow the hype naturally. APEMARS also has a presale structure that rewards early moves. It’s staged like levels in a game, and each stage gets more expensive, meaning early buyers get more tokens for the same money. While many meme coins rely only on hype, APEMARS adds real momentum through structured progress, rising stages, and early-entry rewards, which is why presales often create the biggest FOMO. How to Buy APEMARS ($APRZ) in Stage 3 Buying APEMARS is simple, even if you’re new: Go to the official APEMARS presale website Connect your crypto wallet (MetaMask is common) Select how much you want to buy Pay using the supported crypto method (like ETH/USDT depending on the presale setup) Confirm your purchase Track your tokens after purchase No complicated steps. Just simple click-and-buy. The $1,000 APEMARS ($APRZ) Scenario: The “I’m Early” Move That Could Become Legendary Let’s make this fun and real. If you invest $1,000 into APEMARS ($APRZ) right now at the Stage 3 price of $0.00002448, you’d get around 48,402,711 APRZ tokens. Now imagine APEMARS reaches its listing price of $0.0055, that same bag could be worth about $233,215. Of course, crypto isn’t magic and nothing is guaranteed, but this is exactly why presales get people excited: the upside gap is massive, the early advantage is still alive, and you’re getting in before the crowd. Now think about what $266K could mean for someone in the U.S., a down payment on a house, paying off student loans, starting a dream business, buying a car with zero debt, helping your family, or finally leaving a job you hate. That’s the kind of “life upgrade” dream people chase in crypto, and APEMARS ($APRZ) is offering that dream while it’s still early. Floki Today: Strong Brand, Strong Community, Still a Meme Powerhouse Floki has already proven it can survive meme cycles, and that’s impressive. It has a loyal fanbase, big branding, and continues to stay relevant in the meme coin space. Floki is often viewed as a strong “community-first” token, and it’s still supported by traders who believe meme projects with identity can keep thriving. Floki’s momentum comes from recognition, many people already know it, trust it, and follow it. But here’s the key difference: Floki is no longer in early presale pricing. It’s already in the market, and many investors are already inside. That’s why APEMARS ($APRZ) stands out, it’s offering a “start before the crowd” advantage that Floki can’t offer anymore. SNEK Today: Cardano Meme Strength + Community Loyalty SNEK is one of Cardano’s most recognized meme coins and has held strong attention because it’s deeply connected to its ecosystem. People who love Cardano often love SNEK because it feels like “their meme coin.” SNEK’s power is loyalty. It has strong community support and continues to stay active in the Cardano meme narrative. For investors who believe Cardano will grow more in 2026 and beyond, SNEK becomes a natural meme choice. Still, SNEK is already trading publicly, and that means you’re not getting presale pricing anymore. This is where APEMARS ($APRZ) becomes different, it gives people the chance to enter early, grab more tokens, and potentially enjoy the benefit of listing momentum. Conclusion: Top Crypto to Buy Now, Don’t Let This Become One of Those “I Wish I Bought” Moments Floki is powerful and established, and SNEK is strong with deep ecosystem love, both have proven communities and real momentum. But APEMARS is the early-stage opportunity that feels different, because it’s still in Stage 3, where the entry price is tiny and the upside potential looks massive for anyone who wants to move before the crowd arrives. If you’re seriously hunting for the top crypto to buy now, APEMARS offers something rare: a live presale, a Stage 3 price of $0.00002448, a listing target of $0.0055, 22,300% ROI potential, and 268 holders already building momentum. Don’t wait until everyone is shouting about it, the worst crypto regret always sounds like, “I almost bought it… But I didn’t.” Join the APEMARS ($APRZ) presale today before the next stages make it more expensive.

57054725,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892275,1768093200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57054725.jpeg,Solana (SOL) Whales Pivot to $0.04 Token Dubbed the Next Big Cryptocurrency,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-whales-pivot-to-0-04-token-dubbed-the-next-big-cryptocurrency/,"A massive transformation taking place within the crypto market is Solana whales showing massive attraction to a newer token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With SOL showing rather unpitching price actions on its charts, these investors have begun searching for something with more concrete and rapid developments in growth and usage. Hence, many of these large investors have now begun allocations to MUTM, which is a decentralized finance token that is only worth $0.04 and is in its presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase The presale mechanism adopted in Mutuum Finance allows early investors to buy with fair and transparent prices. It has reached Phase 7 with tokens priced at $0.04, a 300% increase from the opening presale value. The current stage is selling out rapidly, and subsequently, Phase 8 will offer a hike to $0.045 before reaching the launch price of $0.06. In this regard, Phase 7 buyers get a natural advantage right from the onset, and this is why many financial analysts find MUTM to be the most tempting cheap cryptocurrency to purchase currently. For those who may still be wondering what sort of cryptocurrency is ideal for their investment, a clear-cut pricing system makes this a non-issue with MUTM. MUTM Lending Users can earn an immediate return on their investment from Mutuum Finance’s peer-to-peer lending option. Accordingly, there are no strict guidelines in connection with the mechanism, and users are free to implement their own terms and regulations. The lender may negotiate an 18% APY to earn passive returns of $900 from a $5,000 deposit in a niche asset. Risk Management is also another critical component of Mutuum Finance design, as indicated by the presence of the reserve factor in the protocol, where a percentage of all the interest rates in the reserve fund is set aside. If the annual interest on the platform is $1 million with a reserve factor of 10% for risk management, such reserves amounting to $100,000 are set aside. Given that the investor has placed a $20,000 investment with an expected APY of 12%, the arrangement ensures that the net APY of $2,400 is achieved regardless of the fluctuations in the marketplace, thus instilling confidence among investors and putting Mutuum Finance among the best cryptocurrencies in the marketplace. Liquidity Mining Another advantage of Mutuum Finance is the reward program for long-term investors, which uses liquidity mining, where the investor will be rewarded in the form of tokens, apart from the interest earned. An investor staking $10,000 in the ETH-USDC pool will earn a lucrative APY, apart from having a chance to earn more rewards in the form of MUTM tokens. The team has allocated 10% of the total tokens, 400 million MUTM, for this program. This model offers the sense of ownership to the participants within the protocol. The earning system overall is considered to be one of the key points that have led MUTM to become a top investment choice for investors. Why Whales Are Switching Smart money players always stay at least one step ahead of the trend, and their transition from slower-performing assets such as Solana to Mutuum Finance shows that they find the new asset appealing. MUTM provides the capability of earnings generation, growth plans, and attractive pricing to address the question of which cryptocurrency to invest in at the moment. Most importantly, with the steady rise in demand and fundamentals being sound, MUTM is soon to be the next big crypto of the year.

Although XRP has experienced short-term pullbacks following its early 2026 recovery, one market observer argues that the broader setup resembles a prior cycle that preceded a substantial price expansion. This observation has renewed discussion around how high XRP could move if the structure develops similarly. XRP’s Early 2026 Recovery and Pullback XRP entered 2026 with a sharp rebound after a difficult final quarter in 2025. In the first days of January, the asset climbed from approximately $1.83 to a local high near $2.41, representing a gain of more than 30% in less than one week. This advance reversed a large portion of the losses recorded during the fourth quarter of 2025, when XRP fell roughly 35%. However, the upward momentum slowed as the price encountered resistance near the $2.41 area. Since reaching that level, XRP has retraced part of its gains, declining by over 13% and settling closer to the $2.10 region. While some market participants interpreted the pullback as a sign of weakness, analyst CryptoWZRD has suggested that the movement fits within a broader technical structure rather than signaling a breakdown. SIMILAR FORMATION? For over a year $XRP has been trading sideways.. The last major explosive rally in XRP came from an identical setup, can history repeat? Patience Pays. pic.twitter.com/vJpcBWjgfz — CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) January 9, 2026 The Role of Prolonged Consolidation According to CryptoWZRD, XRP’s current behavior mirrors a longer-term consolidation pattern that previously appeared before a major rally. Extended consolidation phases are marked by price trading within defined boundaries for several months, as buying and selling pressure gradually balance out. During these periods, volatility tends to remain constrained, and directional momentum is limited. In 2024, XRP spent much of the year trading well below $1, fluctuating between a lower boundary near $0.40 and an upper limit around $0.75. Repeated attempts to move beyond resistance failed, while declines were consistently supported near the lower end of the range. This environment persisted for most of the year, preventing a sustained trend from forming. As that consolidation matured, XRP transitioned into a narrowing price structure following a decline from roughly $0.66 in September 2024. This development signaled that the market was approaching the end of its consolidation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In early November 2024, XRP broke out of this structure, coinciding with a sharp increase in trading activity. The breakout was followed by a rapid advance that carried XRP to approximately $3.40 by January 2025, representing a multi-hundred-percent increase from the consolidation lows. Similar Conditions Emerging Again CryptoWZRD argues that XRP may now be undergoing a comparable process. Since early 2025, the asset has largely remained within a broad trading range, fluctuating between roughly $1.60 and $3.60. After peaking near $2.70 in late October 2025, XRP entered another period of downward pressure, which culminated in the steep decline seen during the fourth quarter. During this phase, XRP once again formed a tightening price structure similar to the one observed in the prior cycle. The analyst notes that, in the past, the appearance of such a structure marked the latter stages of consolidation rather than the beginning of a prolonged bearish trend. From this perspective, the strong rebound recorded at the start of 2026 may indicate that the corrective phase is nearing completion. At the time of analysis, XRP is trading at $2.08 and attempting to maintain stability above the $2 level. CryptoWZRD has raised the possibility that, if the asset were to replicate the magnitude of its previous breakout, the resulting upside could be substantial. Applying a similar percentage increase to current prices would place XRP well above its recent highs. While this scenario depends on broader market conditions and sustained demand, the analysis underscores why some traders are closely monitoring XRP’s technical structure. Rather than focusing solely on short-term fluctuations, attention remains on whether the broader consolidation resolves in a way that aligns with XRP’s historical price behavior.

Rumors Swell With No Confirmation,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-and-amazon-happening-soon/,"There is ongoing speculation in the crypto community that Ripple, the crypto payments company, and Amazon, the global tech giant , may soon enter into a partnership. While some claims indicate that an alliance has already been formed, others suggest it may be in the works. Whatever the case, no confirmation has yet been issued to verify the rumor’s validity. Rumors Swirl About A Potential Ripple And Amazon Deal Rumors about a possible connection between Ripple and Amazon are quickly gaining attention in the crypto community. Prominent analysts and influential XRP supporters are speculating that the crypto payments company and the tech giant may be heading into a possible partnership. While there has been no concrete evidence to support such claims, advocates like Stellar Rippler, who has over 24,000 followers on X, alleged that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had hinted years ago that Amazon might use XRP for payments and settlement. The supporter argued that previous nondisclosure agreements were not just speculation, but part of a broader plan. Moreover, he believes that recent developments are increasingly aligning with those earlier hints as new details surface. Abdullah Nassif, host of the Good Evening Crypto show, also weighed in on the widespread speculation. He said Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Ripple are looking at using Amazon Bedrock AI with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to speed up system log analysis from days to just minutes. Crypto expert John Squire added that AWS had previously shown interest in XRP for payments. He claimed the company even assigned a team member to explore XRP’s use cases , which has now grown into talks about combining Amazon Bedrock with XRPL. Despite the growing rumors about the company, Amazon, and XRP, neither the crypto company nor the tech giant has officially confirmed any partnership or future collaboration. Amazon Web Services Adds The Firm To Partner Profile Page It could be argued that one of the major reasons rumors of a potential Ripple and Amazon partnership are growing is the crypto payments company’s recent appearance on the AWS Partner Profile page. On its official site, Amazon Web Services highlights the firm’s evolving role in the financial sector, positioning it as a key infrastructure provider for global payments. It showcased the company’s core features and products, including real-time payments, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) , and the ability to send international payments through a single integration. AWS also described RippleNet as a decentralized network of banks and payment providers that enables real-time messaging , clearing, and settlement of financial transactions. According to the cloud computing platform, the payment firm connects banks, digital asset exchanges, and corporations through RippleNet to facilitate global money transfers . AWS also disclosed several RippleNet use cases, including e-invoicing, real-time cash pooling, global currency accounts, international P2P payments, real-time remittances, and more. The cloud computing network has revealed that Ripple has collaborated with more than 100 financial institutions. Many of these organizations are based in different regions outside the US.",Ripple|Abdullah Nassif|amazon|Amazon Bedrock AI|Amazon Web Services|AWS|Brad Garlinghouse|Good Evening Crypto|John Squire|ODL|On-Demand Liquidity|P2P Payments|ripple|RippleNet|Stellar Rippler|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-11 01:00:35

This adjustment was observed after this sector announced a slight ease of mining difficulty to a record of 146.4 trillion on Thursday, January 8. Notably, mining difficulty illustrated the extent of hardship miners needed to expect when introducing a new block to the decentralized blockchain. During this incident, CoinWarz , a long-standing crypto platform (since 2013) offering essential tools for miners, shared its prediction, urging miners to expect the next adjustment to take place on January 22, 2026, at 04:08:12 AM UTC. However, different from the recent adjustment, this forecasted one is anticipated to raise Bitcoin mining difficulty from a record of 146.47 trillion to 148.20 trillion. In attempts to explain this increase, analysts conducted research and discovered that the average block times were recorded at 9.88 minutes, slightly below the set target of 10 minutes. With this finding, they asserted that the next adjustment could lead to a surge in difficulty, aligning more closely with the target time. Miners publicly note down the Bitcoin mining difficulty in the sector Reports in 2025 highlighted that the Bitcoin mining difficulty skyrocketed to new all-time highs , with a slight increase experienced in the last adjustment of that year. Interestingly, even after this increase was recognized, sources claimed that the difficulty record remained below November’s peak of 155.9 trillion. To break down the meaning of surging Bitcoin mining difficulty, reports suggest that such a situation indicates miners should expect stiff competition in this sector, which is anticipated to arise when they launch new blocks to the network. As a result, the situation worsens in the industry, consequently affecting economic and regulatory status across 2025. At this particular moment, analysts have admitted that Bitcoin miners face significant hardship in generating profits, as margins have greatly shrunk due to the halving event that occurred in April 2024. If block rewards were reduced by half, several key economic factors would be affected. Later, miners and mining firms reported facing increased pressure from the crypto market decline that began in November. This stress arose when miner hash price drastically decreased below the expected level essential to break even. This price illustrated the anticipated yields for each computing power unit utilized to mine blocks effectively. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the miner hash price is the expected daily revenue generated per unit of computational power (hashrate), usually measured in dollars per terahash per second per day ($/TH/s/day). Bitcoin’s price drastically drops amid significant challenges in the Bitcoin mining industry Considering the increased uncertainties in the Bitcoin mining sector, miners have been encouraged to choose whether to continue with their operations or halt them when the price reaches a record of $40 per petahash-second per day. This price marks an increase from a low point of $35 recorded in November. Another factor that has significantly contributed to the recent pressure in the mining industry is US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, which have sparked concerns about the potential for a supply chain shortage in the sector. Notably, October’s flash crash marked the beginning of declines in the crypto market, which led to a drop in the price of BTC by over 30% in November , with a low of just above $80,000. Nonetheless, even with this decline, the crypto industry became hopeful once more after the price of the cryptocurrency started rising, maintaining a level lower than October’s peak of more than $125,000.

On-chain analysts have noticed more whales selling off their holdings in waves since late 2024. In 2025, whale holdings dropped to 3 million BTC raising concerns about the sales destabilizing the market. Why are Bitcoin holders selling now? A Bitcoin miner who earned rewards back in 2010 has moved 2,000 BTC to Coinbase Exchange after keeping the coins untouched for 15 years. At current prices near $100,000 per Bitcoin, this transfer is worth close to $200 million. The miner stored these coins in 40 separate Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses, the original way Bitcoin addresses worked in 2010 before newer and better formats were introduced. CryptoQuant reported that after BTC crossed $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, there were three major periods of selling in late 2024, July 2025, and November 2025. In July of 2025 a whale moved 80,000 BTC that sat dormant for 14 years. Galaxy Digital helped with the transaction, which was worth about $9 billion at the time Bitcoin traded near $108,000. The company’s CEO Mike Novogratz confirmed that companies like Strategy and other corporate Bitcoin buyers quickly purchased the coins without crashing the market. Strategy already acquired 673,783 BTC as of early 2025. Will BTC’s price drop due to whale sales? Bitcoin was valued above $126,000 in early October 2025 before falling 30% to around $86,000 by mid-December. During the first two waves of whales selling their holdings, Bitcoin ETF demand was strong enough to outpace the supply from sellers. ETF inflows kept prices rising even as old holders cashed out. When ETF buying cooled down and another wave of whale activity arrived in November, prices finally started dropping. After the BTC halving event cut mining rewards in half, mining companies needed to sell more of their Bitcoin to cover electricity and operating costs. Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin mining company reported selling 1,818 BTC during December, generating net proceeds of $161.6 million at an average price of $88,870 per coin. The sales reported in filings was a serious escalation from November when the company sold just 38 BTC. Back in January 2025, another dormant whale caused a stir when they sent 500 BTC worth $47 million to Coinbase Prime after six years of inactivity. That wallet originally received those coins when Bitcoin was trading around $7,000, meaning the holder gained 13x on their investment. Market observers have been debating whether or not Bitcoin will follow its traditional four-year cycle that usually includes a bear market after price peaks. CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju believes that the market has changed because ETFs and corporate treasuries create new demand that didn’t exist in previous cycles. He believes further gains could come in 2026 if institutional buying continues. According to Cryptopolitan reports, investment firms such as Berstein, Bitwise, Standard Chartered and Grayscale agree with the CryptoQuant executive in dismissing the importance of the four-year cycle as more relevant macro factors have come into the picture with the crypto market’s maturity and regulatory status.

In particular, analysts and commentators have explored what XRP’s valuation might look like if it were to process a small share of transaction flows associated with SWIFT, the dominant international financial messaging network. While such projections are theoretical, they provide a framework for understanding why XRP’s long-term role in cross-border payments continues to attract attention. XRP’s Proposed Role in Global Payments Ripple’s leadership has consistently emphasized that XRP was created to enhance international settlements rather than eliminate existing financial infrastructure. According to statements from Ripple executives, traditional systems remain functional but often involve delays, multiple intermediaries, and high operational costs. Blockchain-based settlement, by contrast, allows transactions to finalize more quickly and with fewer steps, potentially freeing up capital that would otherwise remain locked in transit. From this perspective, XRP is often discussed as a settlement asset that could operate alongside established networks. Under such an arrangement, SWIFT would continue to serve as a messaging layer, while XRP and the XRP Ledger could be used to move value more efficiently between institutions. The Scale of SWIFT’s Transaction Network To assess XRP’s hypothetical price impact, it is important to understand the magnitude of SWIFT’s daily activity. The network processes tens of millions of messages every day, with reported averages exceeding 40 million messages daily in recent years. Although SWIFT does not publish exact figures for the total value transferred, historical estimates suggest that daily transaction values reached approximately $5 trillion as early as the mid-2000s. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Given the growth of global finance since then, current volumes are widely assumed to be higher. However, using the conservative $5 trillion figure provides a reasonable baseline for illustrative calculations. Modeling a 5% Share Scenario If XRP were to facilitate just 5% of a $5 trillion daily transaction flow, that would equate to $250 billion moving through the asset each day. At present, XRP trades near $2.09 and typically records daily trading volumes of roughly $3 billion. An increase from $3 billion to $250 billion in daily activity would represent a significant expansion in usage. Applying a simplified proportional framework that compares current trading activity with this hypothetical level, XRP’s price could rise substantially under such conditions. Using this approach, some estimates place XRP’s potential price near $170 per token, assuming the market adjusts upward in line with increased volume. At that level, XRP’s total market capitalization would reach several trillion dollars, positioning it among the largest financial assets globally. However, asset prices do not scale directly with transaction volume, particularly in markets dominated by institutional liquidity, net settlements, and high-frequency activity. Much of the increased volume could reflect operational usage rather than sustained buying pressure. Nonetheless, this analysis helps explain why XRP’s potential integration into large-scale payment flows remains a subject of interest. Even limited participation in systems associated with global settlement activity could have meaningful implications for XRP’s long-term valuation, depending on adoption, regulation, and market structure.

Bitcoin is holding near $90,000, while big altcoins are stuck in choppy ranges that punish hesitation and weak conviction. Cardano sits right in that storm. ADA is trading around $0.39 to $0.40 today, but the market still cannot agree on a clean Cardano price prediction for the months ahead. When that uncertainty drags on, money rotates toward clearer catalysts, and one name keeps coming up as traders hunt for the next big altcoin in 2025 style momentum, just delayed into 2026: Remittix (RTX). Cardano price prediction stays tense as traders watch key levels Cardano is not collapsing, but it is also not convincing the market. The current Cardano price prediction debate is focused on whether ADA can build above the $0.42 area, which many see as a near term ceiling. When price cannot reclaim a level like that and hold it, rallies start to look like short lived bounces instead of real trend shifts. Derivatives positioning has also jumped, which can make volatility sharper in both directions. From a chart view, some analysts point to a falling wedge breakout attempt, but they warn the move needs strong follow-through volume to matter. If that volume does not show up, the Cardano price prediction talk turns into the same range trade again: traders sell strength, buy dips, and wait for a narrative that actually changes. Traders shift focus to utility plays like Remittix for 2026 This is where Remittix enters the conversation, not as another “maybe,” but as a deadline-driven story that traders can actually trade around. The project is pushing a crypto-to-fiat payments angle, and it has put a hard date on its platform rollout: February 9, 2026 . When Cardano price prediction threads feel stuck in technical noise, a fixed launch date feels like oxygen. Remittix has also pushed two urgency triggers that hit the market’s FOMO nerve fast. One is a limited 200% token bonus that is capped at 5 million tokens, with the team saying a large chunk of that cap moved in the last 24 hours. The other is product distribution momentum, with the Remittix wallet now live on the Apple App Store and Google Play, described as next in line. If you are trying to land a Cardano price prediction for 2026, the hardest part is identifying what changes the story. With Remittix , the story change is already scheduled, and the market tends to front-run scheduled catalysts. RTX is priced at $0.119, with 695 million tokens sold and over $28.7 million raised so far. The project also points to over 30,000 investors acquiring RTX in recent months, which adds social proof at the exact time supply pressure is increasing. Then there is credibility. Remittix has leaned hard into security and trust signals, with the team fully verified by CertiK and positioned as the top-ranked token on CertiK’s pre-launch listings. That matters because serious buyers do not just chase hype; they chase projects that can survive scrutiny. Here is the simplest truth: waiting is a strategy, but in early-stage crypto investment, waiting often becomes regret when the price resets higher. Why buyers are moving now instead of later: Remittix is built as a DeFi project with a real payments mission that aims to move value from crypto into everyday spending routes. The February 9, 2026 rollout date gives traders a clear catalyst calendar instead of open ended promises. The CertiK verification and top ranking status raise the trust floor for new buyers who demand proof before they deploy capital. The exchange roadmap and third CEX preparation increase the odds of faster liquidity expansion when attention turns into volume. What to watch next Cardano price prediction debates will stay noisy until ADA proves it can push through resistance and hold it. If ADA fails to reclaim key levels with conviction, traders will keep hunting for clearer catalysts elsewhere, because uncertainty is expensive in a fast market. Remittix is giving traders a schedule, a product rollout, and a tightening supply story that punishes late entries. If you keep seeing the same name on 2026 watchlists, it is usually because the market is already positioning, not because it is brainstorming.

A realistic Cardano price prediction depends on whether ADA can reclaim and hold key resistance zones like $0.42 with strong follow-through. If ADA stays stuck near $0.39 to $0.40, the Cardano price prediction outlook remains range-bound and driven by short-term sentiment. 2) How can beginners buy RTX tokens if they want early exposure? If you want to buy RTX tokens, start by using the official Remittix site and only follow verified project announcements. Many buyers treat this as an early-stage crypto investment because access conditions can change quickly as milestones are hit. 3) Why do some traders call Remittix the best crypto to buy now among upcoming crypto projects? Some traders view Remittix as the best crypto to buy now because it has a fixed rollout date on February 9, 2026, visible product distribution with the wallet on the Apple App Store, and a clear path toward centralized exchanges. Those signals can matter more than endless Cardano price prediction debates when the market wants a cleaner catalyst.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-11 03:29:57

With LINK trading around $13 and fresh Chainlink Price Prediction reports now mapping paths toward $50 over the next cycle, interest has picked up among both retail and institutional traders. At the same time, some investors do not want to wait years for a move from $13 to $50. They are starting to compare the slower upside on LINK with Remittix, a payment-focused DeFi project that links crypto to bank accounts and combines real utility with aggressive incentives. Chainlink Tries To Confirm A New Uptrend Chainlink trades around $13.24, with a live market capitalisation of $9.3 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $385 million. Recent Chainlink price predictions from outlets that track technical data suggest a move toward $15.50 in the coming weeks, provided support near $12 continues to hold, and current momentum readings remain positive. That is why many Chainlink Price Prediction notes treat talk of a new $50 high as a longer-term scenario that would need a stronger crypto market and sustained demand for oracles. Fundamentals remain one of the main reasons analysts stay positive on LINK. Chainlink continues to lead the oracle sector and has extended CCIP to more networks, while Coinbase has selected Chainlink CCIP as exclusive bridge infrastructure for its wrapped asset growth program, which deepens links with major institutions. Overall, the near term tone leans cautiously bullish, with a grinding move higher seen as more likely than a straight run to any $50 target. Remittix Builds A Higher Upside Payments Narrative Where Chainlink already carries a large cap valuation, Remittix sits earlier in its journey and targets a different problem. The project is building a PayFi stack that joins crypto wallets, fiat rails, and bank payouts so users and businesses can move money across borders in a direct way. For investors who study every Chainlink Price Prediction but want much higher upside, RTX offers a smaller starting base and a roadmap built around payment activity rather than only price action. The delivery record behind Remittix is a key part of that case. The team reports that more than 697 million RTX tokens have already been sold at $0.119, with over $28.7 million raised and progress toward a $30 million milestone that will unlock a major new exchange reveal. BitMart listed RTX after the raise crossed $20 million, and LBANK followed after $22 million, while a third top-tier listing is now in preparation. Security and trust are reinforced by a f ull CertiK audit , a number one ranking for pre-launch tokens on CertiK Skynet with a Grade A score of 80.09, and a fully KYC-verified team. On the product side, the Remittix Wallet is live on the Apple App Store, Google Play is in progress, and the main Remittix Platform will launch on 9 February 2026 to switch on global crypto to fiat payouts. The current sale phase also includes a 200% bonus offer that is selling out fast, activated using the RTX2026 code and a 15% USDT referral reward that pays every 24 hours through the dashboard, adding a clear layer of crypto with passive income potential for early supporters For investors, several Remittix features stand out, including: Solving a real-world $19 trillion cross-border payments problem Utility first token model built around real transaction volume Deflationary tokenomics with growth potential Global payout rails are expanding, with a focus on key remittance corridors Built for adoption rather than short-term speculation Why Remittix Deserves A Place Beside Chainlink Chainlink is likely to remain a key building block for DeFi and tokenized assets, and a price boost would support the bullish side of any medium term Chainlink Price Prediction. Yet the same market now rewards projects that bring fresh utility and stronger upside from a lower starting point. Remittix fits that description, with a confirmed 9 February 2026 platform launch, a wallet already in the Apple App Store, and multiple CEX listings that anchor liquidity plans. When that is combined with the 200% bonus window and the 15% USDT referral program, Remittix looks like a payment token that can sit beside LINK in a portfolio while offering much more aggressive growth potential.

Most recent analysis sees LINK grinding to maintain price action, helped by firm support and growing network usage. Higher targets near $50 usually depend on a much stronger crypto market phase and sustained demand for Chainlink services. Why Is Remittix Viewed As A Higher Upside Alternative To LINK Right Now? Remittix starts from a much smaller valuation and is entering its main product launch phase. That combination gives it more room to move compared to a large cap like Chainlink, where growth is usually steadier. Why Are Some Investors Pairing Chainlink With Remittix Instead Of Choosing One? Chainlink offers steady, infrastructure-driven growth, while Remittix targets faster upside through payments and adoption. Holding both allows investors to balance long-term utility with higher reward potential.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-11 04:00:00

As a result, several analysts predicted that the core consumer price index would soar by 2.7% in December compared to 2024. Regarding the analyst’s prediction , sources claimed that this forecast was slightly above the 2.6% annual surge recorded in November. Nonetheless, reports declared that this record demonstrated the slightest rise since early 2021. The Upcoming December report sparks hope among individuals Earlier, analysts had anticipated that overall and core prices would increase by 0.3% monthly. Unfortunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a statement informing individuals that it was unable to publish the month-to-month amendments to the last Consumer Price Index report due to the recent government shutdown . Following this announcement, analysts noted that the November report showed a decline in the inflation rate. Additionally, due to the struggles the agency encountered while gathering price data in October, this report anticipated that key rent indexes would remain stable in that month. Consequently, this situation challenged figures recorded in November. However, even with this scenario, optimism was sparked once again in the ecosystem after sources pointed out that the December report could shift this trend to a more positive outlook. Notably, this report is scheduled to be made public on Tuesday, 13 January. At this point, the reason why the Federal Reserve officials looked forward to maintaining interest rates unchanged for the time being was clear. These reasons included insufficiently clear inflation readings and signs of stabilization in the US job market after reports about weak wages were leaked, according to an analysis conducted by analysts. “We believe the CPI report will create some misleading stories. We anticipate that the December data will be high, largely due to the correction of some of the downward trends seen in November’s data. Some analysts might interpret this high reading as a sign that inflation is coming back, but we think that’s not correct,” they said. They also acknowledged that the November report exaggerated the downturn in inflation, possibly by about 20 basis points, but still expressed the belief that several retailers have been reducing prices and that tariff effects have reached their peak, with several products already at their highest levels. Analysts describe this week as a busy, economically related week As the situation surrounding inflation intensified, reports highlighted that Monday would initiate an eventful week for John Williams, the President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who would address matters concerning US central bankers who are expected to make public appearances. Other prominent leaders appointed to speak on economic matters this week include Michelle Bowman, Philip Jefferson, Alberto Musalem, and Anna Paulson. Meanwhile, sources confirmed that consumer spending in the fourth quarter demonstrated impressive performance. These sources also noted that government data, anticipated to be published on Wednesday, January 14, will disclose another significant rise in retail sales. Following this assertion, analysts forecast a 0.4% surge in November, similar to the rise encountered in October. This percentage was calculated after they excluded auto dealers. Other reports set to be released this week are expected to address issues concerning October’s new-home sales, the November producer price index, and December’s industrial production and home resales.
