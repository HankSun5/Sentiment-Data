That’s what leading Chinese AI researchers said Saturday. Two big Chinese AI startups, MiniMax and Zhipu AI, had strong debuts on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week. Investors seem confident in the sector as Beijing fast-tracks AI and chip listings to build homegrown alternatives to advanced US tech . Chipmaking equipment shortage holds back progress Yao Shunyu used to work as a senior researcher at OpenAI, the company that makes ChatGPT. Tencent named him their chief AI scientist last December. Ya o th inks there’s a good chance a Chinese firm could become the world’s top AI company in three to five years. But he says not having advanced chipmaking machines is the biggest technical problem. “Currently, we have a significant advantage in electricity and infrastructure. The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,” Yao told an AI conference in Beijing. China finished building a prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine last month, Reuters reported. It might eventually make semiconductor chips that rival what the West produces. But the machine hasn’t produced working chips yet. People familiar with the matter told Reuters it probably won’t until 2030. Yao and other Chinese industry leaders at Saturday’s Beijing conference admitted the US still has an edge in computing power. That’s because of heavy investments in infrastructure. Limited resources push firms to find creative solutions Lin Junyang is the technical lead for Alibaba’s flagship Qwen large language model. He explained the difference in scale. “The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours. But I see that whether it’s OpenAI or other platforms, they’re investing heavily in next-generation research,” Lin said. He spoke at a panel discussion during the AGI-Next Frontier Summit. The Beijing Key Laboratory of Foundational Models at Tsinghua University held the event. “We, on the other hand, are relatively strapped for cash; delivery alone likely consumes the majority of our computer infrastructure,” Lin added. Lin says China’s tight budget has actually pushed researchers to get creative. They’ve focused on algorithm-hardware co-design, which lets AI firms run large models on smaller, cheaper hardware. Tang Jie founded Zhipu AI , which raised HK$4.35 billion in its IPO. He pointed to something new happening with younger Chinese AI entrepreneurs. They’re willing to take on high-risk projects now. That’s usually been a Silicon Valley thing, and Tang sees it as good news. “I think if we can improve this environment, allowing more time for these risk-taking, intelligent individuals to engage in innovative endeavors … this is something our government and the country can help improve,” Tang said.

Market momentum is returning, capital is rotating beyond Bitcoin, and altcoin season is back on the agenda. As the risk appetite grows, attention is shifting toward high-upside plays with the power to dominate this cycle. And right as the market turns bullish, XYZVerse, a multi-title esports platform, steps into the spotlight, preparing for its Token Generation Event (TGE) and $XYZ token listing at the end of January 2026, fully geared up to take advantage of open-market momentum. Over the past months, the project delivered a standout presale, raising over $15 million, rallying a fast-growing community across X, Telegram, and CoinMarketCap, and pushing far beyond theory into live product development. On top of all that, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. And now, as altcoins begin to run, XYZVerse is entering the arena fully prepared. XYZVerse: Built to Dominate the 2026 Altcoin Run With Bitcoin setting the pace and liquidity rotating aggressively, 2026 is shaping up as the year altcoins take over. What many expected to peak in 2025 has been delayed — stretching the cycle and creating the conditions for a longer, stronger, and more explosive altcoin expansion. As capital pours in, the market enters full acceleration mode: Capital rotation intensifies, moving from majors into high-beta altcoins Utility-driven projects outperform, as users and investors seek real engagement Narratives scale faster, fueled by social momentum and renewed market optimism Price discovery becomes aggressive, especially for tokens entering public markets XYZVerse is entering public markets as 2026 altcoin momentum ignites, not after the crowd has already piled in. With its TGE and listing scheduled for January 2026, the platform is perfectly positioned where attention, liquidity, and participation begin to explode. Unlike many projects scrambling to launch during altseason, XYZVerse enters 2026 with: Live esports infrastructure already in motion On-chain engagement mechanics fully active A battle-tested community built before the bull market returned Deflationary tokenomics and sustainability initiative This setup allows XYZVerse to convert raw altcoin momentum into immediate platform usage, reinforcing demand for the $XYZ token as the cycle accelerates. A Massive Exposure Play: Crypto Meets Counter-Strike 2 Adding fuel to the fire, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. By entering the CS2 ecosystem, XYZVerse instantly taps into one of the largest and most passionate gaming communities in the world, dramatically increasing product visibility and putting the XYZVerse brand in front of millions of players, fans, streamers, and esports viewers. Every match, vote, prediction, and reward is powered on-chain, turning pure esports hype into real engagement and measurable demand. This move connects the project to a global audience far beyond crypto, amplifying awareness, adoption, and momentum exactly as the market turns bullish. The league features are: a 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 $XYZ prize pool 10 teams competing in 5v5 MR12 matches teams made up of KOLs, project founders, and community players (selected via Access Pass lotteries) fan-driven mechanics like map voting, predictions, and digital collectibles full on-chain transparency across results and rewards Participation is enabled via 100 USDT Access Passes, giving fans voting rights, prediction access, exclusive content, and collectibles tied to match outcomes. Rather than a one-off event, the CS2 League is designed as a repeatable engagement engine, showing how XYZVerse turns esports into an interactive, on-chain experience. As altcoin season heats up and esports attention explodes, the CS2 league becomes a powerful catalyst, supercharging XYZVerse exposure right at the start of the 2026 altcoin run. Grab an Access Pass and join the league before $XYZ hits exchanges. From Meme Origins to a Utility-First Esports Platform XYZVerse did not start as a traditional esports company. It began its journey in the meme-coin space built around the idea of fusing all-sports fandom and crypto lovers. The project tapped into the same attention-driven dynamics that have powered some of crypto’s largest communities. Rather than remaining a purely speculative token, the project evolved into a utility-first esports platform, combining the virality and cultural reach of meme coins and the engagement mechanics of sports and fan tokens. The result is a platform where attention is converted into participation — and participation into measurable on-chain activity. XYZVerse eSports Platform: Where the Utility Lives At the core of XYZVerse is a simple principle: engagement should create real demand. XYZVerse connects a single on-chain system designed to reward participation and scale with usage. Utility That Drives Demand The $XYZ token is embedded directly into platform activity. It is used to join competitions, support teams and players, and unlock items, cosmetics, and fan perks. As users engage, their actions generate on-chain transactions routed through XYZVerse’s infrastructure, meaning demand for $XYZ is driven by gameplay and participation rather than speculative holding. Engagement That Shapes Esports XYZVerse turns fans into active participants. Users can vote on maps and formats, influence seasonal structures, and support teams with verifiable on-chain impact. This shifts esports from a passive viewing model to a transparent, community-influenced experience where engagement has measurable outcomes. Revenue Router and the Closed-Loop Model All product activity flows through XYZVerse’s Revenue Router, which automatically allocates a portion of platform revenue toward $XYZ buybacks, token burns, and prize pools. This creates a closed-loop system: increased usage drives token demand, buybacks and burns reduce circulating supply, and rewards reinforce engagement. Designed as a multi-title esports platform, XYZVerse enables players to compete, fans to participate and collect, and brands to measure performance — all within a scalable, on-chain economic loop. 7,000% Presale Growth Lights the Fuse for January Listing Momentum is already on the scoreboard, and the main event hasn’t even started yet. As the January TGE and exchange listing approach, $XYZ is entering public markets off the back of one of the most explosive presale performances in the space. The token price surged from $0.0001 to $0.00715 during the presale, locking in a gain of over 7,000% (71×) before open-market trading begins. This wasn’t a one-stage spike. Demand built consistently across multiple presale rounds, signaling sustained appetite and strong positioning ahead of listing. The expected starting price at listing is $0.10. Once $XYZ goes live on exchanges, presale caps disappear and valuation is driven by real-time market demand, the phase where volatility, visibility, and momentum tend to accelerate. For many projects, this is where the story begins. For XYZVerse, it’s simply the next gear. Unlike hype-only launches, XYZVerse enters its listing phase with multiple engines already running: Live esports utility, led by the CS2 League, converting gameplay into on-chain demand Continuous participation mechanics, including leagues, predictions, and digital collectibles Mass-market visibility from esports audiences far beyond crypto-native circles Transparent buyback and burn mechanisms, directly linking platform revenue to token supply Together, these drivers are designed to sustain momentum after listing, not just during the countdown. The presale growth is already on record. The listing is next – Grab $XYZ before it goes public Sustainability Initiative: Built-In Support After Listing Following the TGE and exchange listings, XYZVerse plans to activate its Sustainability Initiative, a post-listing mechanism designed to support the $XYZ token as it enters open-market trading. Through this model, 10% of net profits generated by partner projects are periodically allocated to buying back $XYZ directly from the market. All buybacks are executed via a public, on-chain wallet, allowing full transparency and independent verification. For $XYZ holders, this structure introduces several long-term benefits: Ongoing buy pressure, created by recurring market purchases rather than speculative demand Gradual supply reduction, as tokens acquired through buybacks may be removed from circulation Direct alignment with platform growth, where higher ecosystem revenue translates into stronger token support By embedding these mechanics into its revenue flow, XYZVerse ties token performance to real platform activity, positioning $XYZ as a value-driven asset rather than one dependent on short-term hype. Roadmap: What Comes Next XYZVerse’s roadmap is built around progressive infrastructure rollout and ecosystem expansion, with each phase designed to strengthen platform utility, deepen engagement, and reduce reliance on one-off events. Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 Revenue Router contracts & public dashboard Challenge Hub with dispute windows Prediction and fantasy side pools Marketplace v1 for Moments and cosmetics Q1 – Q2 2026 Forging and crafting mechanics Liquidity staking programs Mobile companion app Regional paid cups and cross-title ladders Q3 – Q4 2026 Advanced micro-markets Brand marketplace launch Creator Collectives Cross-chain expansion Seasonal Router governance Taken together, the roadmap outlines a measured, step-by-step expansion strategy, prioritizing infrastructure first, engagement second, and decentralization last — a structure that suggests long-term planning rather than short-term momentum chasing. Final Takeaway XYZVerse is approaching its TGE and token listing at the end of January 2026 as a full-fledged multi-title eSports platform with live mechanics, a clear economic model, and an expanding roadmap. By combining meme-driven visibility with sports-style engagement and on-chain transparency, XYZVerse is attempting to build what many meme projects lack: a reason to stay after listing. $XYZ is nearing its public market debut. Get involved while the presale is still open and stay alert for official announcements on the TGE and exchange listings. 🌐 Website: https://xyzverse.io 🎮 CS2 League: https://cs.xyzverse.io 🐦 X (Twitter): @xyz_verse💬 Telegram: https://t.me/xyzverse Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Beiko clarified that he would remain at the foundation but shift to an advisory role within the Protocol team while stepping back from his responsibilities coordinating the All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) calls, which serve as the primary forum for coordinating changes to Ethereum’s execution layer. He simply noted his transition to exploring “frontier use cases” for the blockchain platform. Beiko did not exit the Ethereum Foundation “The protocol is approaching its endgame, yet we’ve only just begun scratching the surface of what a permissionless, scalable, cryptoeconomically secure, and cheaply verifiable world computer can do,” Beiko wrote , outlining his interest in exploring applications that could only exist on Ethereum. His departure from day-to-day protocol coordination reflects confidence in Ethereum’s existing governance structures. Ansgar Dietrichs, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation who joined core research in 2019, has agreed to extend his interim stint as ACDE chair while Beiko supports what he described as establishing a “stable long-term configuration” for the developer calls. Dietrichs, who holds a background in mathematics, economics, and computer science, has contributed to research on account abstraction, state expiry, and EIP-4844, the proposal that introduced “blobs” to reduce transaction costs for layer-2 networks. According to call minutes from September, he assumed the interim role when Beiko took leave earlier in the year. Beiko’s transition is happening as Ethereum developers come up on the two major network updates they have lined up in 2026. The “ Glamsterdam ” upgrade, which is expected in the first half of the year, will focus on gas optimizations and enshrined proposer-builder separation, while “Hegota,” slated for late 2026, will address state bloat and storage inefficiencies. Ethereum is trying something new Beiko’s new focus on frontier use cases suggests a strategic recognition that while core protocol work continues, the network’s value proposition increasingly depends on applications that leverage its unique properties. Beiko said that the following questions have been on his mind for a while: “What are things that can *only* exist on Ethereum? That fully leverage its unique properties?” He framed the question as identifying what makes Ethereum “not only unreasonably sufficient, but reasonably necessary for the world.” Beiko stated that “it feels like the right time to thoroughly explore them!” Looking back on his tenure coordinating protocol development, Beiko expressed gratitude for what he called “such a transformative period” and confidence in the individuals stewarding Ethereum’s future. “A big part of why I feel comfortable stepping away now is my confidence in the individuals and processes involved in the protocol’s stewardship,” he wrote. Beiko concluded by stating, “a pivotal year for Ethereum, at all layers of the stack,” signaling his continued involvement in the network’s development despite the shift in focus.

This article spotlights key cryptocurrencies outside the top 10 that show promise. Discover which digital assets are on the rise and potentially ready to soar, capturing the attention of savvy investors. Find out which tokens are set to make waves. Injective (INJ) Poised for Potential Upsurge Amidst Volatile Trends Source: tradingview Injective (INJ) is currently priced between mid-four to mid-five dollars, marking a steady climb of over 8% in the past week. This upward trend comes after a decline of more than half over the past six months. Despite its recent volatility, the cryptocurrency shows potential for growth, particularly if it can break through the nearest resistance level of just under six dollars. If successful, it might aim for the next target above seven dollars, which would represent about a 27% increase from its highest recent price. With positive indicators like a high RSI and Stochastic values, INJ might be ready for an upward surge soon. Immutable (IMX) Bounces Back: Can It Surpass 40 Cents? Source: tradingview Immutable (IMX) is showing signs of life with its price moving between 23 and 30 cents recently. The coin is hovering around the 27-cent mark, close to its short-term moving average. With a rising RSI nearing 63, there's a chance for growth if momentum continues. If IMX breaks past the 33-cent resistance level, it could aim for the 40-cent mark, which would be a strong uptrend of around 33%. Still, it has fallen nearly half of its value over the past six months, making any upward movement feel significant. IMX's journey remains uncertain, but optimism is bubbling among its supporters. Sei (SEI) Experiences Volatility but Eyes Potential Gains Source: tradingview Sei is showing a bit of a roller coaster ride in the crypto world. It is trading between slightly above ten to thirteen cents. Despite recent dips, it has the potential to grow if it breaks past its main barrier at over thirteen cents. If Sei climbs, it might aim for around about fifteen cents, which is nearly a jump of fifteen percent from its current top. The coin's ups and downs are reflected by its one-week and one-month changes, displaying small and steep declines. Sei sits below the ten-day and one-hundred-day trend averages, hinting it could rise with the right momentum and a bit of market luck. Celestia Edges Up, Eyes on Breaking Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Celestia (TIA) is finding its footing between $0.48 and $0.63, experiencing a slight upward tick of just over six percent in the last week. Traders are keeping an eye on the $0.68 resistance level. If it breaks through, there’s potential for TIA to aim for the next level at $0.83. This would represent an impressive jump from its current range. Despite a downward trend over the past six months, the recent movement is garnering attention, especially with an RSI close to 60, suggesting momentum is building. As market sentiment improves, there’s room for optimism and possible growth if key levels are surpassed. Stacks (STX) on the Rise: Potential for Gains Source: tradingview Stacks (STX) is on a promising upward trend, with its price currently fluctuating between 27 and 40 cents. This shows a significant boost of around 40% in just a week. It's nearing its resistance level at 45 cents, suggesting there could be room for more growth. If it breaks this barrier, it might head toward the next level at 59 cents. There's an optimistic monthly growth of about 27%, yet it's still recovering from a dip over the last six months. Key indicators like RSI and Stochastic point toward further bullish movement, hinting at continued potential for short-term gains. Stacks seems to be in a strong position to continue its path upward. Conclusion INJ, IMX, SEI, TIA, and STX show promising potential for investors looking beyond the top 10. Each has unique features and solid use cases. These assets demonstrate resilience and growth opportunities in the current market. Keeping an eye on their development and performance may benefit those interested in diversification. These movers offer a mix of established projects and emerging contenders, adding dynamic options to any portfolio. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Only half of SpaceX’s proposed 30,000 satellites were approved for deployment by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). SpaceX must deploy half of the satellites authorized by the Federal Communications Commission by December 2028. Full deployment is expected by December 2031. Will Elon Musk keep growing his Starlink constellation? The FCC’s Chairman, Brendan Carr, said the approval is “a game-changer for enabling next-generation services.” SpaceX also received approval to upgrade its satellites and operate across five different frequencies. The newly authorized satellites will provide direct-to-cell connectivity outside the United States and supplemental coverage within American borders. Next-generation mobile services will be available to deliver internet speeds reaching up to 1 gigabit per second, similar to high-speed fiber-optic connections. The FCC stated that these upgrades will help ensure no community is left without connectivity options. However, SpaceX must launch 50% of the maximum authorized second-generation satellites, place them in their assigned orbits, and have them operational by December 1, 2028. The remaining satellites must be launched by December 2031. The company also faces a November 2027 deadline to complete deployment of its 7,500 first-generation satellites. Why did the FCC approve half of SpaceX’s request? SpaceX initially asked for approval to deploy nearly 30,000 satellites, but the FCC refused to approve the deployment of the remaining 14,988, including those planned for operations above 600 kilometers altitude. The FCC explained that its cautious approach is because “the Gen2 Starlink Upgrade satellites remain untested on orbit.” The commission believes that authorizing half of the proposed number of satellites serves the public interest while also allowing them time to evaluate the performance of the upgraded satellite design. Jessica Rosenworcel, the predecessor to current FCC chief Carr, wanted more companies to compete with SpaceX’s satellite constellation in 2024. Starlink already controlled nearly two-thirds of all active satellites at that time. Its overwhelming number of active satellites has raised concerns about space safety and market dominance in the satellite internet sector. Amazon is attempting to challenge that dominance with its rebranded Project Kuiper satellite internet service, now referred to as Amazon Leo, starting in November 2025. Amazon began a preview of its services that same month and allowed select business customers to test the network using production hardware and software. The company plans to roll out the service more widely in 2026. The FCC granted Amazon permission to deploy 3,236 satellites, with requirements to launch and operate half the constellation by July 30, 2026, and the remainder by July 30, 2029. Last week, Starlink announced plans to increase space safety by lowering all satellites currently orbiting at approximately 550 kilometers to 480 kilometers throughout 2026. Satellites operating at lower altitudes will naturally deorbit more quickly if they fail. The focus on safety is due to a December incident in which one Starlink satellite experienced an anomaly in space, creating a small amount of debris and losing communications at an altitude of 418 kilometers.

Speculation is thick in the air: is Shiba Inu positioned for a new price climb or is the timing premature? This article delves into the factors that might signal a bullish trend and the coins ripe for potential growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes Recovery with Bullish Signs Source: tradingview Shiba Inu is trading between $0.0000074 and $0.0000100, showing signs of trying to bounce back. In the past week, SHIB's price saw a bit of a rise with a 7% increase. The next challenge is breaking past $0.000011, which is the nearest resistance. If it manages to overcome this, it could aim for around $0.0000136, potentially marking a growth of roughly a third. However, it recently faced a longer-term decline of nearly 35%. Yet, with its RSI near 53 and a high stochastic value, it might still have room to climb further. Keep an eye on market conditions as they shift. Conclusion SHIB has shown signs of renewed interest. Recent trends and market activities suggest growing momentum. However, patience may be required to see significant price movement. The market's response will determine if this anticipation translates to actual gains. For now, close observation is essential to gauge SHIB's next steps.

This decisive action by Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Informatics represents a critical turning point in how nations address the escalating crisis of non-consensual AI imagery, particularly content depicting women and minors in sexually explicit or abusive scenarios generated through simple user prompts on the X social platform. Indonesia’s Groundbreaking Grok Blockade Indonesian Communications and Digital Minister Meutya Hafid delivered a forceful statement to international media outlets including The Guardian, articulating the government’s position with unprecedented clarity. “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space,” Hafid declared. This philosophical framing elevates the issue beyond mere content moderation into the realm of fundamental rights protection. The Indonesian ministry has simultaneously summoned X officials for urgent discussions about the platform’s content governance mechanisms. This dual approach—combining immediate technical restrictions with diplomatic pressure—demonstrates a sophisticated regulatory strategy. Indonesia’s move follows months of escalating complaints from digital rights organizations documenting Grok’s capacity to generate harmful content despite existing safeguards. The Technical and Ethical Breakdown Investigations reveal that Grok’s image generation capabilities, when prompted by users on X, have produced thousands of non-consensual sexualized depictions. These AI creations frequently feature recognizable public figures, private citizens, and alarmingly, minors. The technology’s accessibility—requiring only text prompts without technical expertise—has accelerated the proliferation of this harmful content. Digital forensics experts examining the phenomenon note several critical failures in xAI’s content moderation pipeline: Insufficient filtering algorithms for identifying requests targeting real individuals Inadequate age verification systems for generated content Delayed response mechanisms for removing violating material Weak user accountability measures for those requesting harmful content Global Regulatory Responses Intensify Indonesia’s action has catalyzed simultaneous regulatory movements across multiple jurisdictions, creating an unprecedented coordinated response to AI content governance. Within the same week, India’s IT Ministry issued a formal directive to xAI demanding “immediate and effective measures to prevent Grok from generating obscene content.” This represents India’s first major intervention in AI content moderation since implementing its Digital Personal Data Protection Act. Meanwhile, the European Commission has taken preliminary investigative steps by ordering xAI to preserve all documents related to Grok’s development, training data, and content moderation systems. Legal analysts interpret this preservation order as groundwork for potential formal proceedings under the Digital Services Act and AI Act frameworks. Global Regulatory Responses to Grok Content Issues Country/Region Action Taken Legal Basis Timeline Indonesia Temporary platform block Electronic Information and Transactions Law Immediate India Formal compliance directive IT Act 2000 7-day response window European Union Document preservation order Digital Services Act Preliminary investigation phase United Kingdom Regulatory assessment initiated Online Safety Act 2023 Assessment underway United Kingdom’s Measured Approach Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, has announced it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation” under the recently implemented Online Safety Act. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly endorsed this approach, stating in a recent interview that Ofcom has his “full support to take action where necessary.” This regulatory posture reflects the UK’s emerging framework for platform accountability, which emphasizes evidence-based interventions rather than immediate punitive measures. Digital policy experts note that the UK’s approach balances consumer protection with innovation considerations, though critics argue it may allow harmful content to proliferate during assessment periods. United States Political Divisions Emerge The American response reveals significant political fractures regarding AI regulation. While the current administration has maintained official silence on the Grok controversy, Democratic senators have independently called upon Apple and Google to remove X from their respective app stores. This legislative pressure highlights growing concerns about platform accountability across party lines. The political dynamics are particularly complex given xAI CEO Elon Musk’s substantial financial support for political campaigns and his previous role in the administration. This entanglement between technology leadership and political influence has complicated straightforward regulatory responses, creating what policy analysts describe as “unprecedented governance challenges at the intersection of technology and politics.” xAI’s Evolving Response Strategy Following Indonesia’s blockade, xAI initially issued what appeared to be a first-person apology through the official Grok account, acknowledging that certain generated content “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” concerning child sexual abuse material. The company subsequently restricted AI image generation features to paying X Premium subscribers, though technical analysis suggests this restriction applied primarily to web interfaces rather than the standalone Grok application. Musk’s personal commentary on the situation has added further complexity. Responding to questions about regulatory disparities between Grok and other AI image tools, Musk asserted that “they want any excuse for censorship.” This framing positions the controversy within broader debates about free expression versus content moderation, a tension that has characterized platform governance discussions for nearly a decade. The Technical Architecture of Harm Forensic examination of Grok’s capabilities reveals specific technical vulnerabilities that enable harmful content generation. Unlike traditional content moderation challenges involving user-uploaded material, Grok’s architecture creates entirely new imagery based on textual prompts. This generative approach bypasses many conventional detection systems designed for existing media. Security researchers have identified several critical failure points in Grok’s current implementation: Prompt interpretation systems that insufficiently flag requests for non-consensual content Training data contamination with problematic associations between names and sexual content Output filtering mechanisms that fail to recognize novel generated violations Cross-platform integration issues between X’s moderation and Grok’s generation systems Comparative Analysis with Other AI Platforms Industry observers note that Grok’s content moderation challenges differ significantly from those faced by other major AI platforms. While systems like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion have implemented increasingly sophisticated content filters over several years, Grok’s rapid deployment and integration with X’s social platform created unique vulnerabilities. The table below illustrates key differences in content moderation approaches: AI Platform Content Moderation Comparison Platform Primary Moderation Method Response Time to Violations Transparency Reporting Grok/xAI Post-generation filtering Hours to days Limited public disclosure DALL-E 3 Pre-generation prompt screening Minutes to hours Regular transparency reports Midjourney Hybrid human-AI review Real-time to hours Community guidelines published Stable Diffusion Open-source community moderation Variable by implementation Varies by deployment Legal Precedents and Future Implications Indonesia’s action establishes significant legal precedents for international technology regulation. By framing non-consensual AI-generated sexual content as a human rights violation rather than merely a terms-of-service breach, the Indonesian government has elevated the legal stakes for platform operators. This approach aligns with emerging international norms articulated in United Nations discussions about digital rights. Legal experts anticipate several potential developments following this regulatory escalation: Cross-border enforcement mechanisms for AI content violations Standardized reporting requirements for generative AI systems International cooperation frameworks for AI content moderation Enhanced liability structures for platform operators The Path to Resolution Industry analysts suggest that resolving the current crisis will require multi-stakeholder engagement beyond simple technical fixes. Effective solutions must address: First, technical improvements to Grok’s content generation and filtering systems, potentially including real-time human review for sensitive queries. Second, policy enhancements to X’s community standards specifically addressing AI-generated content. Third, transparency mechanisms that allow external verification of moderation effectiveness. Fourth, user education initiatives about appropriate AI use and reporting procedures. Conclusion Indonesia’s decisive move to block Grok over non-consensual sexualized deepfakes represents a watershed moment in AI governance, demonstrating how national regulators can respond rapidly to emerging technological threats. This action has triggered a cascade of international regulatory responses that collectively signal growing impatience with self-regulatory approaches to AI content moderation. The Grok controversy ultimately highlights fundamental tensions between innovation velocity and responsible deployment, between free expression and harm prevention, and between national sovereignty and global platform operations. As governments worldwide develop more sophisticated regulatory frameworks for generative AI, the Indonesian model of immediate protective action combined with diplomatic engagement may establish new norms for international technology governance in an increasingly AI-integrated world. FAQs Q1: What specific content triggered Indonesia’s block of Grok? Indonesian authorities identified thousands of AI-generated sexualized images depicting real individuals without consent, including public figures, private citizens, and minors. The content frequently showed explicit sexual scenarios and sometimes depicted assault or abuse, all generated through simple text prompts on the X platform. Q2: How does Indonesia’s approach differ from other countries’ responses? Indonesia implemented immediate technical blocking combined with human rights framing, while other nations have pursued investigative, directive, or assessment-based approaches. The Indonesian method prioritizes immediate citizen protection, whereas other responses emphasize procedural compliance and evidence gathering. Q3: What technical measures has xAI implemented since the controversy began? xAI initially restricted image generation to paying X Premium subscribers and enhanced content filtering systems. However, technical analysis suggests these measures primarily affected web interfaces rather than the standalone Grok application, and experts question their effectiveness against sophisticated prompt engineering. Q4: How might this situation affect other AI image generation platforms? The regulatory scrutiny on Grok has increased pressure on all AI platforms to demonstrate robust content moderation systems. Industry observers anticipate more stringent compliance requirements, enhanced transparency expectations, and potentially standardized reporting frameworks across the generative AI sector. Q5: What are the long-term implications for AI development and regulation? This situation accelerates the development of international AI governance frameworks, increases emphasis on ethical AI design principles, and may lead to more proactive regulatory interventions. The controversy also highlights the need for technical solutions that balance innovation with fundamental rights protection across different cultural and legal contexts.

The police are working to trace the ownership of the machines confiscated in Teluk Intan and identify the people running the operations. Authorities warn the public that illegal crypto mining is a criminal offense that poses safety risks and can cause property damage. Is cryptocurrency mining legal in Malaysia? Police in Hilir Perak confiscated 41 machines suspected of being used for illegal cryptocurrency mining after a series of coordinated raids in Teluk Intan. Hilir Perak police chief Bakri Zainal Abidin confirmed that the first raid conducted on the night of January 9 resulted in the seizure of 24 machines. Two additional raids carried out earl y Ja nuary 10 led to the seizure of the remaining 17 machines. Despite this, no arrests have been made. The operations targeted three separate locations within the Teluk Intan area. All the suspects in the operations are being investigated for property damage and misuse of electricity supply, both of which are criminal offenses under Malaysian law. Cryptocurrency mining itself is not illegal in Malaysia, but it is illegal to steal electricity or damage property to run cryptocurrency mining operations. The machines seized in Teluk Intan are suspected of being connected to illegal electricity supplies and stealing from the national power grid. Unauthorized crypto mining operations often bypass electricity meters or tap directly into power lines to avoid paying for the massive amounts of electricity required to run mining rigs. Over the years, Malaysian authorities have conducted raids across various states. Some of those operations led to the destruction of thousands of mining machines. The police previously publicly destroyed confiscated equipment using steamrollers as a deterrent to would-be illegal miners. Malaysia advises against illegal crypto mining There have been instances in Malaysia and other countries where illegal mining operations have caused electrical fires and building damage. Illegal mining can cause safety risks and property damage because the equipment used for it generates substantial heat and requires proper cooling systems and electrical infrastructure to operate safely. Illegal setups usually lack these safety measures. Overloaded electrical systems can lead to fires, putting both the operators and surrounding properties at risk. Buildings where the illegal mining operations are carried out may suffer structural damage from the weight of equipment and the constant heat generation. Power theft also contributes to higher electricity costs for legal users and can cause voltage fluctuations or power disruptions in certain areas. The extra load on the electrical infrastructure can lead to transformer failures and other equipment damage that requires costly repairs. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Russian and Kazakh authorities have rolled out periodic restrictions on mining activities, especially during high-demand periods such as winter and holiday seasons. Hilir Perak police have urged the public not to engage in illegal cryptocurrency mining activities. Citizens with information on suspected illegal mining operations are urged to contact the authorities and help identify and shut down these operations before they cause harm.

Amongst the old popular cryptocurrencies which have still not managed to live up to their grand promises is Ripple (XRP). On the flip side, amongst new popular cryptos is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This new crypto has managed to achieve immense popularity by collecting over $19.7 million in its presale. XRP Price Analysis XRP is within the re-accumulation stage, thanks to the market rally created by whales and the consistent accumulation within the ETF. It is quite positive that the current price is holding above the essential support levels, which is a strong indicator of a strong market structure. The essential level at $2.20 has been created as a new anchor level. The resistance level at $2.20 presents numerous opportunities for a move to $3.20. XRP is a major market participant. But the growth rate is lower compared to those within the development stage, such as MUTM. MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance has already seen the participation of over 18,770 investors and has generated $19.7 million. After considering the diverse costs in phases 7 and 8 of $0.04 and $0.045, it is clear that coupled with public listing at $0.06, it would be very profitable to join in early. According to projections, it is expected that within a couple of months’ time, the price per token of the crypto could be as much as $0.40, thereby rendering a gain of up to 10x for those who join now. Phase 8 would give a marginal gain of 8x, while for those who wait until it is listed in the market for $0.06, a gain of merely 6x is to be achieved. DeFi Functionality Triggers Demand Mutuum Finance features a DeFi platform that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. P2C lenders deposit assets in lending pools that generate up to 10% APY. A 7000 USDT for example would yield $700 in interest at the end of the year. Peer-to-Peer lending provides higher yields, wherein interest rates can be established by transacting parties on a volatile asset such as Dogecoin. P2P lending may outdo the interest rates for P2C lending to go as high as 20%, thus underpinning its usefulness and intention in the creation of income with volatile cryptocurrencies. The system developed by MUTM has a reward system for fees generated based on activities performed on the platform, which are used to buy MUTM tokens in the market and share them amongst the stakers of mtTokens. mtTokens are the yield-generating assets which are earned for a deposit made in the MUTM lending system on a 1:1 ratio. For example, for a deposit of 10,000 USDT in the lending market, a user gets 10,000 mtUSDT. Apart from earning from the lending, the user gets staking dividends. Security and Testnet Achievements Security is another one of the key considerations for MUTM. It has been able to pass the Halborn Security test, where all feedback has been incorporated for securing the protocol. Functionality wise, the launch of the V1 protocol will be carried out on Sepolia Testnet, where it plans to enable engagement with the liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens for loans, as well as the automatic liquidator for under-collateralized accounts. Why MUTM Must Be in Your Smart Portfolio Where XRP provides stability, Mutuum Finance provides initial project exposure, presale development, DeFi integration, and several ways to reward token investors. Additionally, its target ROI of 10x for Phase 7 investors makes MUTM one of the best low-cost cryptos available for a well-diversified portfolio.

While BTC’s most recent retracement raises suspicions of resistance lying at the $94,000 price, the latest on-chain evaluation hypothesizes the presence of a more relevant resistance just beneath $100,000. New Whales’ Cost Basis Sits Around $99k On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr recently took to the social media platform X to share an interesting hypothesis on the Bitcoin price trajectory. His on-chain observation was based on the Realized Price New Whale STH Vs Old Whale LTH indicator. For context, this metric compares the acquisition cost, on average, of recently accumulated whale holdings (short-term holders) with that of Bitcoin’s long-term whale holdings. Related Reading: Why Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF Is The ‘Most Bullish Thing Ever’: Jeff Park Axel Adler Jr shared in his post that new whales have an average entry price near the $99,000 level. Currently, Bitcoin holds a valuation near $90,000, meaning its new whales are holding through unrealized losses. Hence, if the premier cryptocurrency ascends towards these whales’ average acquisition price of $99,000, the crypto pundit explained that these investors might become incentivized to sell their holdings. This means that these large BTC holders exit the market at break-even prices, or while incurring minimal losses. When the largest Bitcoin investors sell their holdings, the effect often translates to price through reduced buying momentum and a simultaneous increase in downside pressure. As a result, the entry price of these investors — in this case, $99,000 — becomes major resistance, both psychologically and technically. Long-Term Whales’ Average Cost At $39K In a separate post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Arab Chain revealed the average cost basis across varying cohorts of Bitcoin’s investors. As the new whales hold through their unrealized losses, the Binance user deposit addresses metric tells a fascinating story. According to the analyst, the average holding cost on Binance is approximately $52,691, indicating that a good portion of Bitcoin’s traders are doing so while enjoying their profit. Interestingly, the Miner Whales are not left out of this comfort zone. This group of holders, who have more than 1,000 BTC stowed away, has an average holding cost of $58,681. Considering that price is well above their cost basis, it suggests that Bitcoin miners are also in deep profit. As a result, there will be expectedly minimal selling pressure from this faction of the market. For Bitcoin’s Long-term Holder whales, the story is more rosy. These investors are holding their coins with an average acquisition cost of $39,681. As is intuitively obvious, this group of BTC holders is also operating within clear bounds of profit. Ultimately, it is clear that Bitcoin has a structurally bullish outlook, with unshaking investor support. If downside momentum were to enter the market, it would likely be short-term, as its oldest traders appear to be under no pressure to shave off their holdings. If retracements sponsored by these investors occur, it would likely be as a result of light profit-taking, rather than capitulation events. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $90,624, with no significant movement since the past day.

While the market leader has made a solid start to 2026 , concerns are still swirling around about BTC’s prospects over the coming months, especially in relation to the four-year cycle theory. Why $65,000 Could Be Crucial In This Cycle In a recent post on the X platform, Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, weighed in on the current structure of the Bitcoin price. The market expert said that the premier cryptocurrency has taken a breather in the past few months and lagged compared to other assets, like gold, in 2025. Timmer revealed that Bitcoin is drifting away from the historically steep power law trajectory and instead following the internet S-curve. This structure shift also opened the door to the ongoing conversation about Bitcoin’s typical cyclical behavior. According to several pundits, the traditional Bitcoin four-year halving-driven cycle is now dead, and a new structural upward wave seems to be taking root in the market. Proponents of “ Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead ” often state institutional adoption and spot exchange-traded funds as evidence of the new bullish market structure. While Timmer agrees that the relevance of the BTC halving event is decreasing, the Fidelity Director of Global Macro rejected the idea that the premier cryptocurrency would no longer see bear markets. “I’m skeptical, not about the waning power of the halving cycle (with which I agree), but the idea that bear markets are no longer going to happen,” Timmer said. Speaking from a technical point of view, Timmer identified $65,000 — around the previous cycle high — as a crucial level for the price of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the next most important level lies around $45,000, the power law trendline. For context, the power law is a mathematical model that suggests that Bitcoin’s growth follows a predictable and consistent trajectory. This metric, often used to identify key levels in price analysis, shows the correlation between the value of BTC and time. Timmer noted that while the power law trendline is far from the current price of BTC, it could move to $65,000 if the flagship cryptocurrency enters a prolonged consolidation phase for the next year. This could make the $65,000 level an even more important zone for the Bitcoin price.

Top Analyst Says Epic Rally Starts Now,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ready-to-explode-top-analyst-says-epic-rally-starts-now/,"The crypto market has entered a defining phase where volatility no longer signals weakness but opportunity. Rapid price swings, shifting macroeconomic data, and accelerating regulatory developments continue to reshape investor expectations. As capital rotates across the market, a small group of assets has begun to stand out, drawing attention from traders and institutions searching for the next sustained breakout. Insights shared by Bullrunners place XRP firmly within this emerging narrative. Their recent in-depth market analysis frames XRP’s latest move as part of a broader structural shift rather than a short-lived rally, suggesting that conditions now favor a more aggressive upside phase. Broader Market Conditions Set the Stage Overall crypto market health remains constructive despite short-term pullbacks. Total market capitalization recently stood near $3.11 trillion, reflecting mild cooling after recent gains, while daily trading volume remained robust. #XRP Ready to Explode? Top Analyst Says Epic Rally Starts Now? pic.twitter.com/FcTRiLVyHg — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) January 9, 2026 Market sentiment stayed neutral, indicating restrained optimism rather than speculative excess. Bitcoin dominance hovered around 58.5%, showing that capital still favors large-cap assets even as select altcoins begin to outperform. Macroeconomic data reinforced this cautious balance. Softer manufacturing inflation, weaker job openings, and improved unemployment claims reduced pressure on risk assets. At the same time, rising services inflation and anticipation around non-farm payroll data kept markets alert to sudden shifts. Traditional equities reflected similar dynamics, with the Nasdaq 100 maintaining a bullish long-term structure but lacking short-term momentum. XRP’s Price Action Signals Strength Against this backdrop, XRP delivered one of the strongest performances among major digital assets. The token surged roughly 25% in early January 2026, briefly reaching the $2.40 region. A wave of liquidations later pushed the price back toward $2.12 on January 9, yet the broader structure remained intact. XRP continued to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum on a relative basis, reinforcing the view that the move carried deeper significance. Bullrunners highlights that technical charts show XRP holding key support levels despite volatility. This resilience suggests that buyers remain active and that recent selling reflected market mechanics rather than a shift in sentiment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Changes the Narrative One of the most important drivers behind XRP’s renewed momentum lies in regulatory resolution. XRP now trades without the legal uncertainty that constrained institutional participation for years. This clarity has reshaped investor perception and reopened channels previously closed to regulated capital. Analysts cited by Bullrunners point to growing institutional exposure through XRP-related exchange-traded products. Cumulative inflows into these vehicles have reportedly exceeded $1 billion, signaling rising confidence from professional investors who typically avoid unresolved regulatory risk. Infrastructure, Adoption, and Institutional Interest Beyond price and regulation, ecosystem development continues to strengthen XRP’s outlook. Activity on the XRP Ledger remains stable, while speculation around enterprise integrations has intensified. Recent report have highlighted potential collaboration between Ripple and Amazon Web Services, particularly involving Amazon Bedrock AI for XRPL analytics. While no official confirmation exists, the narrative reflects growing interest in enterprise-grade use cases. At the policy level, momentum around the US market structure bill adds another supportive layer. The legislation now advances toward committee markups, with a possible path to presidential approval by the end of Q1 2026. This progress signals accelerating regulatory clarity across the digital asset sector. Outlook: Momentum With Measured Expectations Bullrunners concludes that XRP now sits at the intersection of technical strength, regulatory clarity, and institutional access. Some analysts project long-term targets above $30, framing XRP as a potential leader in the next expansion phase. While such forecasts remain speculative, current conditions give the bullish case more credibility than at any point in recent years. As markets await the next macro catalyst, XRP’s positioning suggests it will remain one of the most closely watched assets in the months ahead.

Market momentum is returning, capital is rotating beyond Bitcoin, and altcoin season is back on the agenda. As the risk appetite grows, attention is shifting toward high-upside plays with the power to dominate this cycle. And right as the market turns bullish, XYZVerse, a multi-title esports platform, steps into the spotlight, preparing for its Token Generation Event (TGE) and $XYZ token listing at the end of January 2026, fully geared up to take advantage of open-market momentum. Over the past months, the project delivered a standout presale, raising over $15 million, rallying a fast-growing community across X, Telegram, and CoinMarketCap, and pushing far beyond theory into live product development. On top of all that, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. And now, as altcoins begin to run, XYZVerse is entering the arena fully prepared. XYZVerse: Built to Dominate the 2026 Altcoin Run With Bitcoin setting the pace and liquidity rotating aggressively, 2026 is shaping up as the year altcoins take over. What many expected to peak in 2025 has been delayed — stretching the cycle and creating the conditions for a longer, stronger, and more explosive altcoin expansion. As capital pours in, the market enters full acceleration mode: Capital rotation intensifies, moving from majors into high-beta altcoins Utility-driven projects outperform, as users and investors seek real engagement Narratives scale faster, fueled by social momentum and renewed market optimism Price discovery becomes aggressive, especially for tokens entering public markets XYZVerse is entering public markets as 2026 altcoin momentum ignites, not after the crowd has already piled in. With its TGE and listing scheduled for January 2026, the platform is perfectly positioned where attention, liquidity, and participation begin to explode. Unlike many projects scrambling to launch during altseason, XYZVerse enters 2026 with: Live esports infrastructure already in motion On-chain engagement mechanics fully active A battle-tested community built before the bull market returned Deflationary tokenomics and sustainability initiative This setup allows XYZVerse to convert raw altcoin momentum into immediate platform usage, reinforcing demand for the $XYZ token as the cycle accelerates. A Massive Exposure Play: Crypto Meets Counter-Strike 2 Adding fuel to the fire, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. By entering the CS2 ecosystem, XYZVerse instantly taps into one of the largest and most passionate gaming communities in the world, dramatically increasing product visibility and putting the XYZVerse brand in front of millions of players, fans, streamers, and esports viewers. Every match, vote, prediction, and reward is powered on-chain, turning pure esports hype into real engagement and measurable demand. This move connects the project to a global audience far beyond crypto, amplifying awareness, adoption, and momentum exactly as the market turns bullish. The league features are: a 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 $XYZ prize pool 10 teams competing in 5v5 MR12 matches teams made up of KOLs, project founders, and community players (selected via Access Pass lotteries) fan-driven mechanics like map voting, predictions, and digital collectibles full on-chain transparency across results and rewards Participation is enabled via 100 USDT Access Passes, giving fans voting rights, prediction access, exclusive content, and collectibles tied to match outcomes. Rather than a one-off event, the CS2 League is designed as a repeatable engagement engine, showing how XYZVerse turns esports into an interactive, on-chain experience. As altcoin season heats up and esports attention explodes, the CS2 league becomes a powerful catalyst, supercharging XYZVerse exposure right at the start of the 2026 altcoin run. Grab an Access Pass and join the league before $XYZ hits exchanges. From Meme Origins to a Utility-First Esports Platform XYZVerse did not start as a traditional esports company. It began its journey in the meme-coin space built around the idea of fusing all-sports fandom and crypto lovers. The project tapped into the same attention-driven dynamics that have powered some of crypto’s largest communities. Rather than remaining a purely speculative token, the project evolved into a utility-first esports platform, combining the virality and cultural reach of meme coins and the engagement mechanics of sports and fan tokens. The result is a platform where attention is converted into participation — and participation into measurable on-chain activity. XYZVerse eSports Platform: Where the Utility Lives At the core of XYZVerse is a simple principle: engagement should create real demand. XYZVerse connects a single on-chain system designed to reward participation and scale with usage. Utility That Drives Demand The $XYZ token is embedded directly into platform activity. It is used to join competitions, support teams and players, and unlock items, cosmetics, and fan perks. As users engage, their actions generate on-chain transactions routed through XYZVerse’s infrastructure, meaning demand for $XYZ is driven by gameplay and participation rather than speculative holding. Engagement That Shapes Esports XYZVerse turns fans into active participants. Users can vote on maps and formats, influence seasonal structures, and support teams with verifiable on-chain impact. This shifts esports from a passive viewing model to a transparent, community-influenced experience where engagement has measurable outcomes. Revenue Router and the Closed-Loop Model All product activity flows through XYZVerse’s Revenue Router, which automatically allocates a portion of platform revenue toward $XYZ buybacks, token burns, and prize pools. This creates a closed-loop system: increased usage drives token demand, buybacks and burns reduce circulating supply, and rewards reinforce engagement. Designed as a multi-title esports platform, XYZVerse enables players to compete, fans to participate and collect, and brands to measure performance — all within a scalable, on-chain economic loop. 7,000% Presale Growth Lights the Fuse for January Listing Momentum is already on the scoreboard, and the main event hasn’t even started yet. As the January TGE and exchange listing approach, $XYZ is entering public markets off the back of one of the most explosive presale performances in the space. The token price surged from $0.0001 to $0.00715 during the presale, locking in a gain of over 7,000% (71×) before open-market trading begins. This wasn’t a one-stage spike. Demand built consistently across multiple presale rounds, signaling sustained appetite and strong positioning ahead of listing. The expected starting price at listing is $0.10. Once $XYZ goes live on exchanges, presale caps disappear and valuation is driven by real-time market demand, the phase where volatility, visibility, and momentum tend to accelerate. For many projects, this is where the story begins. For XYZVerse, it’s simply the next gear. Unlike hype-only launches, XYZVerse enters its listing phase with multiple engines already running: Live esports utility, led by the CS2 League, converting gameplay into on-chain demand Continuous participation mechanics, including leagues, predictions, and digital collectibles Mass-market visibility from esports audiences far beyond crypto-native circles Transparent buyback and burn mechanisms, directly linking platform revenue to token supply Together, these drivers are designed to sustain momentum after listing, not just during the countdown. The presale growth is already on record. The listing is next – Grab $XYZ before it goes public Sustainability Initiative: Built-In Support After Listing Following the TGE and exchange listings, XYZVerse plans to activate its Sustainability Initiative, a post-listing mechanism designed to support the $XYZ token as it enters open-market trading. Through this model, 10% of net profits generated by partner projects are periodically allocated to buying back $XYZ directly from the market. All buybacks are executed via a public, on-chain wallet, allowing full transparency and independent verification. For $XYZ holders, this structure introduces several long-term benefits: Ongoing buy pressure, created by recurring market purchases rather than speculative demand Gradual supply reduction, as tokens acquired through buybacks may be removed from circulation Direct alignment with platform growth, where higher ecosystem revenue translates into stronger token support By embedding these mechanics into its revenue flow, XYZVerse ties token performance to real platform activity, positioning $XYZ as a value-driven asset rather than one dependent on short-term hype. Roadmap: What Comes Next XYZVerse’s roadmap is built around progressive infrastructure rollout and ecosystem expansion, with each phase designed to strengthen platform utility, deepen engagement, and reduce reliance on one-off events. Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 Revenue Router contracts & public dashboard Challenge Hub with dispute windows Prediction and fantasy side pools Marketplace v1 for Moments and cosmetics Q1 – Q2 2026 Forging and crafting mechanics Liquidity staking programs Mobile companion app Regional paid cups and cross-title ladders Q3 – Q4 2026 Advanced micro-markets Brand marketplace launch Creator Collectives Cross-chain expansion Seasonal Router governance Taken together, the roadmap outlines a measured, step-by-step expansion strategy, prioritizing infrastructure first, engagement second, and decentralization last — a structure that suggests long-term planning rather than short-term momentum chasing. Final Takeaway XYZVerse is approaching its TGE and token listing at the end of January 2026 as a full-fledged multi-title eSports platform with live mechanics, a clear economic model, and an expanding roadmap. By combining meme-driven visibility with sports-style engagement and on-chain transparency, XYZVerse is attempting to build what many meme projects lack: a reason to stay after listing. $XYZ is nearing its public market debut. Get involved while the presale is still open and stay alert for official announcements on the TGE and exchange listings. 🌐 Website: https://xyzverse.io 🎮 CS2 League: https://cs.xyzverse.io 🐦 X (Twitter): @xyz_verse💬 Telegram: https://t.me/xyzverse Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

57049009,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892696,1768075830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57049009.jpeg,Vitalik Buterin claims corposlop is a growing pandemic that needs to end,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/buterin-warns-crypto-against-corposlop/,"Vitalik Buterin recently called out the dangers of what he has tagged “corposlop” in the crypto and digital space. He described it as a toxic mix that leads to the creation of products that at first glance seem user-oriented, but in truth are created to disempower people. Buterin’s post was a direct response to a tweet from a pseudonymous X user who made several predictions about what would happen to human society between 2026 and the year 2030. There were quite a number of predictions, including about how “the internet officially splinters” and how “after a year of AI-slop, the low-fi aesthetic wins.” Buterin claimed to agree with 60% of the predictions, but one bit he felt he needed to highlight is the “explicit separation between what the poster called ‘the open web’ (really, the corposlop web), and ‘the sovereign web.’” He called it a distinction he had not realized until recently, acknowledging that BTC maxis were far ahead because it turns out that their resistance to ICOs, disinterest in tokens besides Bitcoin, and arbitrary apps has actually been about keeping Bitcoin “sovereign” and not “corposlop.” “The big error that many of them made was trying to achieve this goal with either government crackdowns or user disempowerment (keeping bitcoin script limited, and rejecting many categories of applications entirely),” Buterin wrote. “But their fear was real.” What is corposlop according to Buterin? As far as the Ethereum co-founder is concerned, corposlop is made up of three components, including “corporate optimisation power, an aura of respectableness of being a company with sleek polished branding, and behavior that is the exact opposite of respectable, because that’s what’s needed to maximize profit.” He gave examples that he believes confirm how soulless corposlop, tagging them both lame and evil as they disempower the average user while making it seem like they’re serving them. Apple came up in the discussion, with Buterin acknowledging he has qualms with the company but admitting that the firm has many “non-corposlop traits.” “They serve users not by constantly asking ‘what do users want this quarter’, but by having an opinionated long-term vision,” he wrote. “They have a strong emphasis on privacy. They resist and create trends rather than following them. I just wish they could take the brave step of ending their monopolistic practices and switching to an open-source-first strategy. It may damage their market cap, but man must live for something higher than market caps.” How do you resist corposlop? According to Vitalik Buterin, in the year 2000, sovereignty was largely focused on avoiding the “iron fist of government.” However, today, that has expanded also to cover securing your digital privacy through cryptography, as well as protecting your mind from corporate mind warfare focused on extracting attention and dollars. “It also means doing things because you believe in them, and declaring independence from the homogenizing and soul-sucking concept of ‘the meta,’” Buterin wrote, claiming builders needed to focus more on creating tools that helped achieve or encourage that. As reported by Cryptopolitan yesterday, a16z crypto executives advised crypto projects to resist falling victim to the mind virus that has gripped the meta, where everyone is building trading apps. They warned against the upcoming “homogeneous competition” that the proliferation of trading platforms will inevitably lead to. Buterin mentioned some tools he believes will help and become highly sought after in the future, including: privacy-preserving local-first applications that minimize dependence on and data leaks to third parties social media platforms, and tools that let the user control what content they see and appeal to people’s long-term goals financial tools that help users grow their wealth, without encouraging 50x leverage, sports betting or taking out a loan AI tools that are maximally open, private and that maximize productivity from merging the power of human and bot applications, companies and physical environments with opinionated views on the kind of world they want to see DAOs that can support organizations and communities that steadfastly pursue a unique objective, as long as they are not all captured by the same groups “Be sovereign,” he concluded . “Reject corposlop.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to an average price of $6.55, with a possible maximum trading value of $7.11 in 2028. In 2032, the target price for XRP is between $13.47 and $14.59, with an average price of $14.03. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ripple Token XRP Price $2.09 (-1.57%) Market cap $127.03B Trading volume (24-hour) $1.68B Circulating supply 60.69B XRP All-time high $3.65 on July 18, 2025 All-time low $0.002686 on May 22, 2014 24-hour high $2.13 24-hour low $2.08 XRP price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 6.35% 50-day SMA $2.03 200-day SMA $2.57 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) XRP price analysis: XRP holds above $2 TL;DR Breakdown XRP price analysis confirms a downward trend at $2.09. The token lost 1.57% in value. XRP has support at $2.02. On January 10, 2026, XRP is showing a mild correction as the trend remains bearish for the day. The coin is trading near $2.09 following a 1.57% decrease over the past 24 hours. While XRP experienced a series of strong corrections over the past four trading sessions, selling pressure still persists, causing the coin to continue its correction. Sellers are striving to gain momentum, and conditions now warrant caution for bullish traders, as the price could plunge below the psychological mark of $2. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP confirmed a downward market trend. XRP/USD value decreased to a $2.09 low in the past 24 hours. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify rising selling momentum. XRP/USD 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening as volatility is increasing. Moreover, the upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the broken resistance, is at $2.29. The lower Bollinger band, indicating support, is at $1.67. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral area. The indicator is currently at 54 and moving downwards. The selling activities have led to a decrease. This descent is reflected by a downward curve on the RSI graph. If the bearish momentum continues to rise, the market can enter a period of instability. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of XRP confirmed a bullish market trend for the cryptocurrency. Its value increased to $2.09 in the past four hours. The decreased volatility signals less signs of reversal in the coming hours. The Bollinger bands are moving closer as volatility levels are decreasing. This decrease in volatility signals a higher market predictability. Moreover, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $2.18, indicating the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band is at a low of $2.05, securing the support. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral zone as it moves slightly upwards. Its value has increased to index 43 in the past few hours. The curve on the RSI graph confirms a positive trend as the indicator’s score increases. The recent upturn refers to a relatively balanced trading environment for investors.

The daily price analysis for the XRP/USD pair presents a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency, as the selling pressure continues. In the past 24 hours, the bears continued their lead, thereby creating unfavorable circumstances for the investors. As a result, the coin value has corrected to $2.09 because of the decreasing momentum today. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum picked up over the past week, driving the coin’s price to $2.13. However, the coin has corrected to $2.09 today. How much will XRP cost in 2026? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $2.81 by the end of 2026. Will XRP reach $5? If demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent, the coin could approach $5 by 2027. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 but not before 2032. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is expected to reach a maximum price of $14.59 by 2032, making it a valuable asset, particularly with the continued efforts of Ripple Labs. However, some regulatory uncertainties still exist for XRP. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that XRP trading was twice as volatile as BTC trading in 2025. On-chain data revealed that XRP recorded 80% realized volatility during the past year, highlighting a need for deeper liquidity to achieve stability. To maintain liquidity flow, Ripple released 1 billion XRP tokens in three tranches on January 1, 2026. 🚨 XRP ESCROW MOVE 🚨 1 BILLION $XRP unlocked from escrow in minutes, catching the market’s attention fast.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October through November, XRP traded around $1.83 to $3.10. At the start of December, XRP is trading around $1.99 to $2.18.

Still, he noted that the refunds wouldn’t be returned all at once, but instead would be rolled out over time, possibly over weeks or even a year. Currently, the U.S. Treasury has nearly $774 billion in cash on hand. Bessent, however, does not expect the court to overturn the tariffs. He argued that if the court reverses the tariffs, businesses that transferred the costs to customers would only benefit immensely. He commented, “It won’t be a problem if we have to do it, but ‍I can tell you that if it happens, which I don’t think it’s going to – it’s just a corporate boondoggle. Costco, which is suing the U.S. government, is going to give the money back to their clients?” Bessent says most businesses did not pass on the tariff costs to consumers Bessent also warned that if the court issues a mixed ruling, rather than a clear yes or no decision, it could make it more difficult to determine who is eligible for a refund and by how much they should be repaid. Previously, Morgan Stanley analysts had also projected that the court’s ruling could be far from clear-cut. The Treasury Secretary also told reporters that most businesses absorbed the tariffs themselves, and hence, consumers saw little to no price increase. Moreover, he pushed back on claims that Trump’s tariffs drove inflation, affirming that goods inflation stayed lower than overall inflation. Businesses and lawyers were expecting a Supreme Court decision on Friday, but the justices ruled on another case instead. The court has yet to say when it will issue a ruling on the dispute over Trump’s trade measures . However, Bessent believes that longer deliberations increase the likelihood that the court will support the president. Nonetheless, he insisted that the Treasury can still make repayments if the court rules otherwise. The government is projected to reduce its deficit in 2025 by about $300 to $400 billion, which would increase its financial capacity, Bessent said. For the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2025, the U.S. ran a $1.775 trillion deficit. Meanwhile, importers believe that collecting repayments on tariffs would be difficult if the Supreme Court were to rule against Trump’s IEEPA-based tariffs. Customs data showed that $133.5 billion has been collected through December 14, an estimate that is likely to reach $150 billion altogether. However, Bessent challenged the estimate, claiming it did not accurately reflect the number of tariffs that might qualify for refunds. He stated that tariffs collected under other laws also exist, although he did not provide a figure for those under IEEPA. Torres cautioned that reversing tariffs under the emergency act could push rates higher Some economists were deeply concerned about the possibility of repealing the tariffs. Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, for example, explained that eliminating the tariffs would have serious consequences. He stated, “If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds. President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.” Thus, he argued that cutting off tariffs would hurt onshoring and fiscal conditions, and push rates up. Still, it would boost corporate profits by lowering input costs and easing trade. The prediction market Kalshi currently assigns only a 30% chance that the court will uphold the tariffs as implemented. Earlier, Bessent had also shared his concern that refunding tariffs could burden the administration and hinder efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit.

Her comments come as Republicans push toward a January 15 markup, even as Democratic support remains uncertain. The Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2026 is expected to shape how digital assets are regulated in the United States. Lawmakers are now racing to finalize draft language while negotiations continue behind closed doors. Senator Lummis Outlines Goals of the 2026 Crypto Bill Senator Cynthia Lummis said the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2026 aims to bring long-needed clarity to the digital asset market. In a recent post, she said the bill draws a clear line between digital asset securities and commodities. She added that the bill also adds consumer protections and gives both companies and regulators a unified framework to work within. If passed, U.S. banks would be permitted to stake crypto assets and earn yield, and more capital could remain onshore instead of flowing to offshore markets. Supporters, including Senator Cynthia Lummis, say these changes could position the United States as a leader in the next phase of blockchain innovation, creating a safer environment for users and more certainty for financial institutions. As Coinpaper previously reported , Lummis has long argued that unclear regulation has pushed crypto activity offshore. She believes defined rules can encourage responsible growth while keeping oversight intact. Senate Committees Prepare for January 15 Markup The Senate Banking Committee confirmed it will hold a markup hearing on January 15. Chairman Tim Scott said the committee has engaged in months of bipartisan talks and is ready to proceed. An official notice stated that the markup will consider the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025. The manager’s amendment is expected on January 12, while member amendments are due by January 13. The Senate Agriculture Committee is also expected to act on its related crypto bill. That legislation focuses on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s authority over digital asset commodities, as Coinpaper outlined earlier. However, despite ongoing talks, Democratic support is not guaranteed. Senator Cory Booker, a key negotiator on the Agriculture Committee, has raised concerns that could delay progress. Senator Ruben Gallego has also warned that limits on senior officials profiting from crypto are a requirement for his support. He described this issue as a red line during recent discussions. Advocates say seven Democratic votes are needed for final Senate passage. Without those votes, the bill could stall despite strong Republican backing.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-10 20:31:12

The operations targeted locations suspected of stealing electricity to power mining equipment. Hilir Perak police chief Bakri Zainal Abidin reported that officers seized 24 machines during the initial raid on the night of January 9. Two subsequent raids conducted early on January 10 led to the confiscation of the remaining 17 machines across three separate locations in the Teluk Intan area. No arrests have been made at this stage. Investigators continue working to identify the individuals or syndicates behind the operations. Authorities are examining evidence related to property damage and misuse of electricity supply, both of which are criminal offenses under Malaysian law. Cryptocurrency Mining Remains Legal Under Proper Conditions Mining cryptocurrency is not illegal in Malaysia when conducted through legitimate means. The issue arises when operators steal electricity or damage property to run their mining rigs. The machines seized in these raids are believed to have been connected to illegal electricity supplies. Unauthorized operations typically bypass electricity meters or tap directly into power lines. This allows operators to avoid paying for the substantial electricity required to run mining equipment. Such practices constitute theft from the national power grid and violate Malaysian law. Malaysian authorities have conducted numerous raids on illegal mining operations across various states in recent years. Some operations resulted in the seizure and destruction of thousands of machines. Police have previously used steamrollers to publicly destroy confiscated equipment as a deterrent to potential illegal miners. Safety Hazards and Infrastructure Damage Illegal cryptocurrency mining poses significant safety risks beyond the legal violations. The equipment generates substantial heat and requires proper cooling systems and electrical infrastructure to operate safely. Illegal setups typically lack these essential safety measures. Overloaded electrical systems can trigger fires that endanger both operators and surrounding properties. The constant heat generation and equipment weight can cause structural damage to buildings housing these operations. Several incidents in Malaysia and internationally have resulted in electrical fires linked to unauthorized mining activities.",News|Legal|Crypto,EN,0,0,MINING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-10 20:52:30

This divergence between surface-level price action and underlying structure suggests that the BTC long-term thesis remains intact even as the forces shaping its next phase become more complex and more mature. Why Bitcoin Trend Strength Persists Despite Cooling Momentum Bitcoin remains firmly aligned with its long-term uptrend, but the more important signal is not showing up in price. CryptoELITES revealed on X that liquidity has been quietly tightening, and one of the clearest signals is TOTAL/BTC, which continues to bleed while BTC holds its structural levels . This kind of setup does not leave the market in panic; it just needs patience. If liquidity conditions begin to ease while the BTC trend continues to hold, the response won’t be instant. However, it will emerge gradually through rotations first, but not headlines. “How are you reading this phase right now?” CryptoELITES ask. The recent dip in Bitcoin doesn’t change the broader setup unfolding across the market . While BTC has chopped lower over the past few days, meme coins across the board have been quietly forming some of the cleanest corrective structures seen in this cycle. Crypto analyst 0xBossman highlighted that these meme coins have been reacting strongly to even modest BTC bounces and holding their structure during flash dips. In combination with the tight corrective structures, overwhelming bearish sentiment across major assets has swung bearish again. At the same time, meme coins continue to act as the leading edge of this broader rally , which will lead to an explosion soon. From 0xBossman’s perspective, this setup suggests that 2026 is where many of these meme coins will fully express their upside. The signals are already visible for anyone paying attention. From Downtrend Pressure To Structural Relief According to Ardi, one of the more constructive developments for Bitcoin over the past week has been the reclaim and hold of the 200 Simple Moving Average (200-SMA) on the 4-hour chart, a level that has acted as a reliable trend filter throughout this cycle. When this move slopes downward, price action will struggle to maintain local higher highs, and downside flushes will continue to appear. However, when the price regains the level and begins to turn up, the market will transition into a phase of sustained momentum. What stands out is that this is the first reclaim and hold of the BTC 4-hour 200-SMA since the October crash . This doesn’t automatically signal that the bull run is back, but it would give BTC a better chance to continue pushing through the $94,500 level.",Bitcoin News|0xBossman|200 SMA|Ardi|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoELITES|Simple Moving Average|SMA,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-10 21:30:00

While price action remains subdued for now, key resistance levels near $94,100–$107,500 will likely dictate the market’s next major move. Whether BTC resumes its upward trajectory or tests deeper support, the coming week could provide the confirmation the market has been waiting for. Expect Slower Bitcoin Market Moves According to Kamile Uray, the market has entered the weekend, a period typically characterized by slow and subdued price action. The key support region between $90,588 and $88,280 has not yet formed a clear bottom, but it continues to prevent a sharper decline. Related Reading: Three Key Levels For Bitcoin: Top Analysts Caution Against Potential Drop Below $70,000 On the upside, a daily close above the $94,130 resistance would signal that bullish momentum is resuming. If this level is cleared, the next key resistance to watch is in the $98,200–$107,500 range. The $107,500 mark is particularly significant, as a daily close above it would represent the first higher high relative to the last downward wave on the daily chart, potentially opening the door for further upward continuation. Should the market face deeper declines, there are multiple support zones to monitor: $86,398, $83,822, and $82,477. As long as BTC holds above $82,477, any pullbacks are likely to be considered retests of previous breakouts, keeping the broader bullish scenario intact. If BTC closes below $82,477, it could trigger a continuation of the downtrend, possibly testing the $74,496–$71,237 zone, which represents a strong support area. Once a clear reversal is confirmed from this region, an upward move targeting the downtrend line could follow, offering a potential opportunity for traders to re-enter the market. Weekend Choppiness Expected As Volume Remains Light In a more recent update by Lennaert Snyder on X, Bitcoin has entered its weekend liquidity phase. As usual, trading activity is expected to be muted due to weak weekend volume. Looking ahead to next week, Snyder noted that the best-case scenario would be a break above the monthly open in the next weekly candle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Absorbs The Flush: Quantum Structure Signals Wave (3) Toward $104,000 Snyder is monitoring key triggers for quality trades. Historically, Sunday “scam-pumps” have provided opportunities to execute short trades near liquidity zones. Currently, the $87,600 monthly open is viewed as the main target for potential downside. A diagonal line drawn on the chart highlights buy-side liquidity from shorts, which could be swept before a market structure break (MSB) forms, allowing shorts to be executed. If Bitcoin climbs above the current weekly high near $94,700, Snyder notes that the setup would simply wait for the next MSB to enter shorts again. Another key resistance to watch next week is around $96,500. A clean break above this level would invalidate the bearish thesis targeting the monthly open, signaling that upward momentum could dominate.

According to a January 10, 2026 report from Wired, this initiative forms part of a broader strategy among AI companies seeking high-quality training data to enhance their models’ capabilities. The approach raises immediate questions about intellectual property protection, data sourcing ethics, and the future trajectory of white-collar automation. OpenAI’s Contractor Data Collection Initiative OpenAI, in collaboration with training data company Handshake AI, has reportedly implemented a system requesting third-party contractors to provide concrete examples of their professional work. Company presentations specifically ask contractors to describe tasks performed in other roles and upload samples of “real, on-the-job work” they have “actually done.” These submissions can include various file formats such as Word documents, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, images, and repository files. The company provides guidelines for removing proprietary and personally identifiable information before uploading, even directing contractors to a specialized ChatGPT “Superstar Scrubbing” tool for this purpose. This data collection method represents a significant departure from traditional approaches to AI training data acquisition. Historically, companies have relied on publicly available information, licensed datasets, or synthetic data generation. The shift toward authentic professional work samples suggests AI labs are pursuing more nuanced, domain-specific training materials. Consequently, this strategy could potentially accelerate the development of AI systems capable of performing complex white-collar tasks with greater precision and contextual understanding. Intellectual Property and Legal Concerns Intellectual property lawyer Evan Brown expressed serious reservations about this approach in the Wired report. Brown emphasized that any AI laboratory adopting this methodology is “putting itself at great risk” by relying heavily on contractor discretion regarding confidentiality. The process inherently requires “a lot of trust in its contractors to decide what is and isn’t confidential,” creating potential vulnerabilities for both the AI companies and the contractors themselves. This concern becomes particularly acute when considering that contractors might inadvertently include proprietary information from previous employers, potentially violating non-disclosure agreements and employment contracts. The legal landscape surrounding AI training data remains complex and evolving. Current intellectual property frameworks were not designed with artificial intelligence data sourcing in mind, creating gray areas regarding fair use, derivative works, and commercial exploitation. Furthermore, different jurisdictions maintain varying standards for data protection and intellectual property rights, complicating compliance for global AI companies. OpenAI’s reported approach highlights the tension between rapid AI advancement and established legal protections for creative and professional work. Industry-Wide Implications and Ethical Considerations The reported initiative reflects a broader industry trend where AI companies increasingly seek specialized, high-quality training data. As AI models advance beyond general capabilities toward domain-specific expertise, the demand for authentic professional materials grows correspondingly. This trend raises ethical questions about consent, compensation, and transparency in data collection practices. Contractors providing work samples might not fully understand how their contributions will train future AI systems that could potentially automate aspects of their own professions. Additionally, the quality and diversity of training data significantly influence AI system performance and potential biases. By sourcing materials primarily from contractors, AI companies might inadvertently narrow the range of perspectives and approaches represented in their training datasets. This limitation could affect the models’ ability to generalize across different organizational cultures, industries, and geographic regions. The ethical imperative for diverse, representative data collection becomes increasingly important as AI systems assume more significant roles in professional decision-making processes. The Competitive Landscape of AI Training Data OpenAI’s reported strategy emerges within a highly competitive environment where access to quality training data represents a critical advantage. Other major AI developers, including Google, Anthropic, and various specialized firms, are simultaneously exploring innovative approaches to data acquisition. The race to develop more capable AI systems has intensified focus on data quality, with companies seeking materials that demonstrate professional reasoning, nuanced judgment, and domain-specific expertise. AI Training Data Acquisition Methods Comparison Method Advantages Disadvantages Public Web Scraping Large volume, diverse sources Quality variability, copyright issues Licensed Datasets Clear rights, consistent quality High cost, limited customization Synthetic Generation Complete control, privacy protection Potential artificiality, limited realism Contractor Work Samples High quality, professional context IP risks, ethical concerns, limited scale The contractor-based approach offers distinct advantages in terms of data quality and professional relevance. Real work samples provide authentic examples of professional decision-making, communication styles, and problem-solving approaches that synthetic data might not capture accurately. However, this method faces significant scalability challenges compared to web scraping or synthetic generation. Each contractor can provide only limited samples, and the vetting process for confidentiality adds administrative overhead. Balancing these trade-offs represents a central challenge for AI companies pursuing this data acquisition strategy. Technological and Practical Implementation The reported initiative involves specific technological components designed to facilitate data collection while addressing privacy concerns. The mentioned “Superstar Scrubbing” tool suggests OpenAI has developed specialized software to help contractors identify and remove sensitive information from their work samples. This technological approach attempts to balance data utility with privacy protection, though its effectiveness remains untested publicly. The tool likely employs natural language processing and pattern recognition to flag potential confidential information, proprietary terminology, and personal identifiers. From a practical perspective, contractors participating in this program must navigate several considerations: Employment Agreement Review: Contractors must carefully examine previous employment contracts for confidentiality clauses Data Sanitization: Proper removal of proprietary information requires significant attention to detail Context Preservation: Maintaining the educational value of work samples while removing sensitive elements Compensation Structure: Understanding how their contributions translate to payment and potential future benefits These practical considerations highlight the complexity of implementing such data collection initiatives responsibly. Contractors serve as intermediaries between their previous employers’ intellectual property and AI companies’ training needs, creating potential conflicts of interest and legal exposure. The success of this approach depends heavily on clear guidelines, effective tools, and transparent communication between all parties involved. Future Implications for White-Collar Professions The reported data collection strategy directly supports AI companies’ ambitions to automate increasingly sophisticated white-collar work. By training models on authentic professional materials, developers aim to create AI systems capable of performing tasks traditionally requiring human judgment, creativity, and domain expertise. This development trajectory has profound implications for various professions, including content creation, data analysis, administrative support, and even aspects of legal and financial services. However, the relationship between AI automation and professional work remains complex rather than purely substitutional. In many cases, AI systems trained on professional work samples might augment rather than replace human professionals, handling routine aspects while humans focus on higher-level strategy, creativity, and interpersonal elements. The quality and nature of training data significantly influence whether resulting AI systems serve as collaborative tools or competitive replacements. This distinction makes the current debate about data sourcing methodologies particularly consequential for the future of professional work. Regulatory and Industry Response The reported initiative occurs within an evolving regulatory landscape where governments worldwide are developing frameworks for AI governance. Recent legislative efforts in the European Union, United States, and other jurisdictions increasingly address data sourcing practices, transparency requirements, and accountability mechanisms for AI systems. OpenAI’s approach might attract regulatory scrutiny regarding data provenance, consent mechanisms, and intellectual property compliance. Industry associations and professional organizations are also likely to develop guidelines or position statements regarding the use of professional work for AI training purposes. Several key considerations will shape the regulatory and industry response: Transparency Requirements: Whether AI companies must disclose their data sources and collection methods Consent Standards: What constitutes valid consent for using professional work in AI training Compensation Frameworks: How contractors and original content creators should be compensated Audit Mechanisms: Procedures for verifying that training data complies with legal and ethical standards These considerations reflect growing recognition that data sourcing practices fundamentally influence AI system behavior, fairness, and societal impact. As AI becomes more integrated into professional domains, the methods used to train these systems warrant correspondingly greater attention from regulators, industry bodies, and the public. Conclusion OpenAI’s reported initiative asking contractors to upload real work from past jobs represents a significant development in AI training data acquisition with far-reaching implications. This approach highlights the industry’s pursuit of higher-quality, domain-specific training materials while raising substantial questions about intellectual property protection, ethical data sourcing, and the future relationship between AI and professional work. As artificial intelligence systems advance toward greater capabilities in white-collar domains, the methods used to train these systems will increasingly shape their impact on professions, organizations, and society. The current debate surrounding OpenAI’s contractor data collection initiative underscores the need for balanced approaches that foster AI innovation while respecting legal protections and ethical considerations. FAQs Q1: What exactly is OpenAI asking contractors to upload? OpenAI reportedly requests contractors to provide authentic work samples from previous and current employment, including documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and other professional materials they have actually created in their roles. Q2: Why would OpenAI want real work samples for AI training? Authentic professional work provides high-quality training data that demonstrates real-world problem-solving, communication styles, and domain expertise, potentially helping AI systems learn to perform complex white-collar tasks more effectively. Q3: What are the main intellectual property concerns with this approach? Contractors might inadvertently include proprietary information from previous employers, potentially violating confidentiality agreements. The approach relies heavily on contractors correctly identifying what constitutes confidential information. Q4: How does OpenAI address privacy and confidentiality concerns? The company reportedly provides guidelines for removing sensitive information and directs contractors to a specialized “Superstar Scrubbing” tool to help identify and remove proprietary and personally identifiable information. Q5: Is this approach unique to OpenAI or common in the AI industry?

The holders and investors wait for some gains. However, it seems that this steady growth is not in line with the good performance and massive gains displayed by some relatively new cryptocurrencies that have a real value and application for users. In order to get massive benefits, it is usually necessary to look out for some prospects that exist outside the major movers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quite an alluring investment opportunity available at a presale price of $0.04 due to its innovative approach that is set to provide profits to its investors. Presale Designed for Early Advantage Mutuum Finance presale is the best method for initial investors, giving the highest returns. Phase 7 is currently open with tokens costing $0.04, but it won’t last since the availability of tokens is limited for this stage. Phase 8 will offer tokens costing $0.045, an increase of almost 20%. More price increases will follow until launch at $0.06. This gives the biggest returns to investors who act first, while those who wait are required to pay more for the same tokens. An investment of $500 may see an ROI of $1375 to become $1875 when Mutuum Finance hits $0.15 like predicted. This translates to 3.75x growth from the current price. Over-Collateralized Loans The utility of Mutuum is vast and includes leveraging borrowed funds while retaining control over assets. For example, MUTM allows an investor to lock away $15,000 in ETH and subsequently borrows $10,000 in stable currencies, which is an important aspect for those looking for the best crypto to invest in. The utility offered allows stakeholders to access more funds for investments without selling ETH, in case it appreciates in price in the subsequent market periods. Assuming the $10,000 is put in a yield-farming pool with an annual yield of 10%, an individual is able to make an annual profit of $1,000, hence justifying MUTM as a utility-rich cryptocurrency with potential as an ideal long-term investment opportunity. The Buy-and-Distribute Dividend Model This model ensures that it generates utility for its stakeholders in an organized approach in which it churns out tokens for stakeholders’ acquisition through the structured system in which it operates. A fraction of all fee revenues generated is used in acquiring MUTM tokens, which are rewarded to stakeholders who stake in mtTokens. Assuming the platform generates revenues of $1 million in fee revenues. 20% of that could go to buying back tokens which are distributed to stakeholders for free. This could offer several hundreds of dollars in earnings for those who stake as little as $1000. Positioning in an Expanding Project Although there are stability patterns for Bitcoin within a range, Mutuum Finance clearly has steady developments. The project has finished its security audit by Halborn Security and is soon to unveil the test network on Sepolia, which signifies a heavy focus on security measures. This ensures that risks are well mitigated for investors to contribute to the growth of the token price. In a region of investors who are highly selective regarding sound tokens to invest in, Mutuum Finance offers an exceptional opportunity. Anyone interested in investing in an authentic cryptocurrency that has passed all required approvals should invest in MUTM.

Burn Metric Explodes Overnight,https://coinpaper.com/13666/shiba-inu-price-breakout-imminent-burn-metric-explodes-overnight,"Shiba Inu has recorded a dramatic spike in its token burn rate, marking a potential turning point for the meme cryptocurrency. Data from Shibburn reveals that more than 7.2 million SHIB tokens were removed from circulation within 24 hours on January 10, 2026. The burn rate jumped by 38,043% compared to the previous day. This massive increase breaks a prolonged streak of minimal burn activity that had kept the metric in negative territory for several consecutive days. Supply Reduction Shows Long-Term Strategy The total SHIB supply now stands at 589,245,806,058,242 tokens. This figure reflects ongoing efforts to reduce the original quadrillion-token supply through systematic burning. Sustained burn activity often correlates with broader network health. The recent spike suggests renewed engagement from the SHIB community. Previous periods of elevated burns have coincided with price rallies, though past performance does not guarantee future results. The Shiba Inu development team has implemented various burn mechanisms since the token's launch. These include transaction-based burns and community-driven initiatives. The latest data indicates these programs may be gaining traction again after a quiet period. Price Movement Mirrors Burn Activity SHIB's price increased by 0.81% over the last 24 hours. The token traded at $0.00000871 at the time of reporting. This modest gain marks a shift from recent red territory into positive momentum.

New data shows retail traders growing more optimistic as ETF headlines and macro narratives increasingly influence crypto price movements. According to the latest social and sentiment data compiled by Santiment, there has been a renewed optimism among retail traders, even as recent price action has begun to flatten and Bitcoin (BTC) tests key psychological levels. Recovery has not been limited to large-cap cryptocurrencies. In fact, several altcoins and meme coins also posted strong gains. Fresh Retail FOMO Social media discussion across platforms such as X, Reddit, and Telegram has shifted noticeably and reflected a more positive tone after months of bearish sentiment following Bitcoin’s October 2025 all-time high. Bitcoin remains at the center of the narrative. Its recent moves have been heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors and traditional financial market dynamics. ETF flow headlines played a significant role, particularly after US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a sizable one-day net outflow led by major issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity. The pullback coincided with traders de-risking ahead of crucial US economic data and expectations around interest rate cuts, which validates the view that Bitcoin is increasingly trading like a macro-sensitive asset. Ethereum has seen a more mixed sentiment profile. According to Santiment, discussion around the world’s largest altcoin by market cap has focused less on price action and more on staking-related developments, including staking rewards tied to regulated investment products. While interest in staking has increased, sentiment has remained scattered. This essentially reflects a lack of a clear directional catalyst for ETH in early 2026. This is true for several major outperformers, as retail sentiment remains uneven and highly reactive to short-term catalysts. For instance, Ripple (XRP) stood out with a nearly 14% weekly gain. This coincided with an increased attention around XRP’s January escrow unlock, which released 1 billion tokens, with a large portion reportedly re-locked. The scheduled supply event, combined with strong early-year momentum, drove a surge in retail participation. However, optimism rose sharply as traders attempted to buy perceived dips, followed by renewed caution as prices corrected from recent highs. Solana (SOL) also saw a significant jump in sentiment and price, which was swayed largely by institutional headlines, including a Reuters report that Morgan Stanley filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Solana. Meme Coins Rebound Meme coins have also re-entered the spotlight. The OG, Dogecoin (DOGE), saw double-digit gains over the week, supported in part by strong performance from the 21Shares 2x Long Dogecoin ETF, which posted gains of roughly 38-39% in the first days of 2026. The ETF’s performance has contributed to fresh interest across the meme coin sector. Several meme coins have also witnessed synchronized whale buying and social hype this year.

The pullback has so far been controlled, with price holding above former resistance that has now turned into short-term support. A technical analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Bird proposed that conditions are now right for a familiar macro setup that has preceded XRP’s largest historical rallies. The focus of this outlook is on XRP’s reaction with the US dollar index and what its next move could mean for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator How DXY Weakness Has Always Unlocked XRP Rallies Bird’s analysis is based on the US Dollar Index, or DXY, and its inverse relationship with XRP during important phases. The chart accompanying his post pointed to three previous periods, around 2017, 2021, and 2024, where sustained weakness in the dollar coincided with aggressive upside moves in XRP. In each of those cycles, red candles on the DXY chart led to a loss of dollar strength, while XRP responded with strong upward expansion shortly after. This recurring pattern means that XRP’s largest moves tend to follow macro shifts, not just even events related to XRP. When dollar dominance fades, capital always rotates into crypto assets, and XRP has been one of the primary beneficiaries of that transition. Interestingly, the current setup shows that DXY has returned to a similar structural zone seen before past rollovers. As shown in the chart below, the DXY is now trending downwards. US Dollar Index, XRPUSD. Source: @Bird_XRPL On X XRP To New All-Time Highs? The first highlighted phase captures the late-2017 to early-2018 cycle, when a weakening dollar backdrop lined up with XRP’s rally run into the cycle peak in the mid-$3 range. A similar relationship appeared around the 2020-2021 window, where dollar softness was followed by XRP surging to $1.90 at its cycle top. The latest was in H1 2025, which culminated in XRP reaching its current all-time high of $3.65 in July. The important context is why the current moment is a decision point. At the time of writing, the DXY is sitting around 99, and from here it can either turn lower and start printing red candles again or catch a bid and print green. If DXY starts printing red candles again and rolls over, the pattern Bird is pointing to suggests the macro backdrop becomes supportive for another strong XRP leg higher, which is why a new all-time high above $3.65 could come into view within the next few months. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator If DXY prints green and strengthens, that would be the opposite signal: it can tighten liquidity conditions and keep XRP’s price action capped in consolidation around $2 before any breakout attempt. Either way, the dollar’s next move will signal what comes next.

The release targets both staked and unstaked validators, including test nodes, and signals the network’s continued focus on operational resilience. According to Solana Status, validators should apply the patch immediately to reduce exposure to potential disruptions. Consequently, the update reinforces Solana’s approach of deploying preventative fixes before issues affect users or applications. Validator Update Reinforces Network Reliability The v3.0.14 release continues a pattern of rapid maintenance updates across Solana’s v3 validator client series. Besides addressing potential vulnerabilities, these patches aim to strengthen long-term performance and stability. Developers often push such updates quietly, ensuring validators install them before any network impact becomes visible. Hence, the absence of a detailed changelog aligns with Solana’s emphasis on proactive defense. Additionally, rising on-chain activity has increased the importance of validator reliability. The recent launch of the SKR token highlights growing demand across DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets. Stable validator layer supports higher throughput and smoother user experiences. Consequently, the network continues prioritizing infrastructure hardening alongside ecosystem growth. Major Upgrades Shape Solana’s Roadmap Moreover, Solana’s broader roadmap includes structural upgrades designed to address congestion and decentralization concerns. The Alpenglow upgrade, introduced in September 2025, replaced legacy consensus components with Votor and Rotor. These changes target faster finality and parallel execution, improving scalability. The network plans mainnet deployment this year, expanding capacity for complex applications. Significantly, the Firedancer validator client also plays a central role. Released in Q1 2025 by Jump Crypto, Firedancer runs alongside the Agave client. Its modular design enables parallel processing and targets extremely high throughput. The Agave 3.0.6 release, recommended in October, further supported validator efficiency. Together, these upgrades aim to future-proof Solana’s infrastructure. SOL Price Structure Reflects Compression and Accumulation Source: CoinCodex However, SOL price action shows near-term caution despite structural optimism. Solana traded near $135.31, posting a mild daily decline while maintaining a weekly gain above 2%. Market capitalization hovered near $76.3 billion, supported by steady circulation levels. According to moonbag, SOL’s long-term chart structure supports a breakout toward higher psychological levels, with $400 emerging as a potential upside target. Weekly price compression within a symmetrical triangle suggests prolonged accumulation. Resistance near $260 remains critical, while sustained strength above $180 could unlock higher targets. Source: X Eljaboom highlighted improving short-term structure after SOL reclaimed the $135–$138 demand zone. Additionally, higher lows continue forming, which limits downside risk. Analysts see $145 as a near-term pivot, with $187 emerging as a key resistance level ahead of February.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-10 23:31:01

The incident is the latest breach to affect a DeFi protocol on the Arbitrum network in 2026, with only ten days into the year. The news first broke when Phalcon, BlockSec’s threat detection platform disclosed on X that it had detected suspicious transactions targeting Futureswap’s contract. The security firm said it had attempted to contact the team but had received no response at the time of publication. For context, the project’s X account last posted in 2022. According to Phalcon, “The attacker appears to have drained funds through multiple changePosition operations, eventually withdrawing a large amount of USDC.” It also added, “Since the contract is not open-sourced, the exact root cause still requires further investigation.” ALERT! Our system detected a suspicious transaction targeting @futureswapx ’s contract on #Arbitrum a few hours ago, resulting in an estimated loss of ~$395K. We have attempted to contact the team, but have not received a response so far. The attacker appears to have drained… pic.twitter.com/SD5CUCfA8h — BlockSec Phalcon (@Phalcon_xyz) January 10, 2026 How did Futureswap get hacked? BlockSec analyzed the on-chain behavior and stated that it suspects “the incident may be related to unexpected stableBalance accounting changes during earlier position updates, which later allowed USDC to be released when removing collateral.” A few days earlier, on January 5, Cryptopolitan reported that two Arbitrum projects lost $1.5 million in smart contract access attacks. USD Gambit and TLP, both launched by the same deployer, suffered unauthorized withdrawals after an attacker gained admin access and replaced smart contracts with malicious versions. According to blockchain security firm Cyvers Alert, preliminary analysis shows that the single deployer may have lost access to their account. “The attacker then deployed a new contract and updated the ProxyAdmin privileges to gain control,” Cyvers Alert stated. The stolen funds were later bridged to the Ethereum network and deposited into Tornado Cash. Are hackers targeting Arbitrum? Arbitrum’s name has come up a lot in the 2026 DeFi hacks reported so far. In early January, TMX Tribe suffered a $1.4 million exploit, while the IPOR Fusion USDC vault lost $336,000 through a legacy contract vulnerability, though the DAO pledged full user reimbursement. Security researchers have noted that recent attacks follow a similar pattern that has been linked to North Korean state-sponsored hackers, who predominantly use Tornado Cash to launder funds. The attackers have learned to move quickly to swap and mix stolen funds almost immediately to avoid address blacklisting. These breaches typically target high-liquidity ecosystems because that way, the exploiters maximize their chances of major hauls. According to Defillama, Arbitrum holds over $3 billion across DeFi protocols on the platform, and it has never been far from the number one spot among Ethereum L2s in terms of TVL since it launched in 2021. Another common theme among recent hacks has been that they typically go for older smart contracts still holding liquidity. In July 2025, Cryptopolitan reported that the Arbitrum Foundation rolled out a $14 million war chest via the Arbitrum Audit Program to support native projects by subsidizing their smart contract audits. Exploit loot is quickly rerouted through mixers The fourth quarter of 2025 saw a spike in Tornado Cash deposits, with the mixer now holding a record value locked from both new hacks and older exploits. The platform contains more than 338,000 ETH, which is more than its 2021 peak. Mixers like Railgun have also experienced an uptick in activity at the end of 2025. The attacks have primarily targeted relatively obscure projects based on what analysts have observed. USD Gambit, for instance, points to a singular exchange being phased out in the coming weeks. Despite launching in 2023, the project did not benefit from the recovery of DeFi and perpetual futures trading, making it an easier target with less security oversight.

According to CoinsKid, a technical analyst known for his market commentary, XRP may experience further downside before the next phase of bullish momentum begins. XRP entered 2026 with strong gains , rallying above $2 in early January and reaching a peak of $2.41 on January 6. Following this advance, the token encountered resistance, resulting in several intraday declines. At the time of reporting, XRP is trading around $2.08 , testing the $2 support level. While many market observers anticipate a short-term rebound, CoinsKid suggests that the current pullback may not represent the final low for the year. Historical Bottoms Provide Context In a recent video commentary, CoinsKid referenced historical lows to contextualize his 2026 prediction. He noted that XRP’s bottom in 2020 was $0.21, rising to $0.55 during the 2021 bull market. In 2022, the bear market triggered by events like the Terra and FTX collapses pushed XRP down to $0.29. The following year, 2023, saw limited upward momentum, leaving the bottom at $0.30. By 2024, the low had improved to $0.388, though the cryptocurrency was still underperforming relative to expectations. XRP’s performance improved markedly in late 2024 and throughout 2025, surpassing the $1 and $2 thresholds. During the correction in April 2025, the bottom for that year was identified at $1.64, which CoinsKid had previously highlighted despite some pushback from the community when prices were above $3 at the time. Technical Basis for 2026 Bottom For 2026, CoinsKid projects a lower support level of $1.14. In his commentary, he presented a technical analysis showing that XRP broke above a seven-year symmetrical triangle during the November 2024 uptrend, initiating the first wave of an Elliott Wave structure that peaked at $3.4 in January 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to CoinsKid, the subsequent decline represents Wave 2, an ABC corrective pattern that could push XRP toward the $1.14 level before resuming upward momentum. He also highlighted the importance of the 1.414 Fibonacci extension in identifying potential corrective lows. If XRP loses its current structure and drops below $1.9, the analyst expects the correction to reach this level, consistent with historical patterns observed in 2015 and 2021. Potential Upside After Correction Following the completion of the correction, CoinsKid anticipates that XRP could enter a strong recovery phase. Under this scenario, the cryptocurrency might ultimately reach $27 , representing a potential increase of nearly 1,200% from current prices. He emphasized, however, that this projection is hypothetical and contingent on the correction concluding as expected. CoinsKid acknowledged that both the predicted bottom and the potential peak carry significant uncertainty and are not guaranteed outcomes. This analysis underscores the importance of patience for investors, as technical setups suggest that XRP could experience additional short-term weakness before positioning itself for a potential long-term rally in 2026.

Meme coins are waking up, charts are moving, and people are chasing the next big breakout like kids chasing an ice cream truck. If you’re looking for the top crypto to buy now you’re in the right place, because timing is everything in crypto. In this article, we’re comparing three meme-powered contenders: APEMARS ($APRZ), Floki (FLOKI), and SNEK (SNEK). Floki continues to ride strong community energy while staying active in the meme coin spotlight. SNEK keeps holding its place as one of Cardano’s favorite meme tokens with loyal supporters. But APEMARS ($APRZ)? It’s still in presale, which means the “early advantage” is still alive and kicking. APEMARS ($APRZ) Presale Stage 3: Why It Feels Like Getting a Golden Ticket Early Imagine a candy shop where the candy is still cheap… but soon it becomes expensive. That’s what APEMARS feels like right now, a presale project where you can still buy at tiny pricing before it lists publicly. Here are the correct Stage 3 presale stats for APEMARS ($APRZ): Presale is Live Current Stage: 3 Stage 2 Price: $0.00002448 Listing Price: $0.0055 ROI From Stage 3: 22,300% Holder Count: 268 Amount Raised: $60k+ Tokens Sold: 2.90B The gap between the presale price and the listing price is what makes APEMARS ($APRZ) so exciting. It’s not just about the meme, it’s the math that creates the FOMO. Unique Utilities That Make APEMARS ($APRZ) More Than Just a Meme APEMARS isn’t trying to be “just another meme.” It’s built like a fun mission from Earth to Mars, almost like a story you can join. People love stories and adventures, and they love feeling like they’re part of something exciting. That’s why a strong theme makes it easy for the community to share it online, talk about it everywhere, and grow the hype naturally. APEMARS also has a presale structure that rewards early moves. It’s staged like levels in a game, and each stage gets more expensive, meaning early buyers get more tokens for the same money. While many meme coins rely only on hype, APEMARS adds real momentum through structured progress, rising stages, and early-entry rewards, which is why presales often create the biggest FOMO. How to Buy APEMARS ($APRZ) in Stage 3 Buying APEMARS is simple, even if you’re new: Go to the official APEMARS presale website Connect your crypto wallet (MetaMask is common) Select how much you want to buy Pay using the supported crypto method (like ETH/USDT depending on the presale setup) Confirm your purchase Track your tokens after purchase No complicated steps. Just simple click-and-buy. The $1,000 APEMARS ($APRZ) Scenario: The “I’m Early” Move That Could Become Legendary Let’s make this fun and real. If you invest $1,000 into APEMARS ($APRZ) right now at the Stage 3 price of $0.00002448, you’d get around 48,402,711 APRZ tokens. Now imagine APEMARS reaches its listing price of $0.0055, that same bag could be worth about $233,215. Of course, crypto isn’t magic and nothing is guaranteed, but this is exactly why presales get people excited: the upside gap is massive, the early advantage is still alive, and you’re getting in before the crowd. Now think about what $266K could mean for someone in the U.S., a down payment on a house, paying off student loans, starting a dream business, buying a car with zero debt, helping your family, or finally leaving a job you hate. That’s the kind of “life upgrade” dream people chase in crypto, and APEMARS ($APRZ) is offering that dream while it’s still early. Floki Today: Strong Brand, Strong Community, Still a Meme Powerhouse Floki has already proven it can survive meme cycles, and that’s impressive. It has a loyal fanbase, big branding, and continues to stay relevant in the meme coin space. Floki is often viewed as a strong “community-first” token, and it’s still supported by traders who believe meme projects with identity can keep thriving. Floki’s momentum comes from recognition, many people already know it, trust it, and follow it. But here’s the key difference: Floki is no longer in early presale pricing. It’s already in the market, and many investors are already inside. That’s why APEMARS ($APRZ) stands out, it’s offering a “start before the crowd” advantage that Floki can’t offer anymore. SNEK Today: Cardano Meme Strength + Community Loyalty SNEK is one of Cardano’s most recognized meme coins and has held strong attention because it’s deeply connected to its ecosystem. People who love Cardano often love SNEK because it feels like “their meme coin.” SNEK’s power is loyalty. It has strong community support and continues to stay active in the Cardano meme narrative. For investors who believe Cardano will grow more in 2026 and beyond, SNEK becomes a natural meme choice. Still, SNEK is already trading publicly, and that means you’re not getting presale pricing anymore. This is where APEMARS ($APRZ) becomes different, it gives people the chance to enter early, grab more tokens, and potentially enjoy the benefit of listing momentum. Conclusion: Top Crypto to Buy Now, Don’t Let This Become One of Those “I Wish I Bought” Moments Floki is powerful and established, and SNEK is strong with deep ecosystem love, both have proven communities and real momentum. But APEMARS is the early-stage opportunity that feels different, because it’s still in Stage 3, where the entry price is tiny and the upside potential looks massive for anyone who wants to move before the crowd arrives. If you’re seriously hunting for the top crypto to buy now, APEMARS offers something rare: a live presale, a Stage 3 price of $0.00002448, a listing target of $0.0055, 22,300% ROI potential, and 268 holders already building momentum. Don’t wait until everyone is shouting about it, the worst crypto regret always sounds like, “I almost bought it… But I didn’t.” Join the APEMARS ($APRZ) presale today before the next stages make it more expensive.

57054725,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892275,1768093200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57054725.jpeg,Solana (SOL) Whales Pivot to $0.04 Token Dubbed the Next Big Cryptocurrency,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-whales-pivot-to-0-04-token-dubbed-the-next-big-cryptocurrency/,"A massive transformation taking place within the crypto market is Solana whales showing massive attraction to a newer token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With SOL showing rather unpitching price actions on its charts, these investors have begun searching for something with more concrete and rapid developments in growth and usage. Hence, many of these large investors have now begun allocations to MUTM, which is a decentralized finance token that is only worth $0.04 and is in its presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase The presale mechanism adopted in Mutuum Finance allows early investors to buy with fair and transparent prices. It has reached Phase 7 with tokens priced at $0.04, a 300% increase from the opening presale value. The current stage is selling out rapidly, and subsequently, Phase 8 will offer a hike to $0.045 before reaching the launch price of $0.06. In this regard, Phase 7 buyers get a natural advantage right from the onset, and this is why many financial analysts find MUTM to be the most tempting cheap cryptocurrency to purchase currently. For those who may still be wondering what sort of cryptocurrency is ideal for their investment, a clear-cut pricing system makes this a non-issue with MUTM. MUTM Lending Users can earn an immediate return on their investment from Mutuum Finance’s peer-to-peer lending option. Accordingly, there are no strict guidelines in connection with the mechanism, and users are free to implement their own terms and regulations. The lender may negotiate an 18% APY to earn passive returns of $900 from a $5,000 deposit in a niche asset. Risk Management is also another critical component of Mutuum Finance design, as indicated by the presence of the reserve factor in the protocol, where a percentage of all the interest rates in the reserve fund is set aside. If the annual interest on the platform is $1 million with a reserve factor of 10% for risk management, such reserves amounting to $100,000 are set aside. Given that the investor has placed a $20,000 investment with an expected APY of 12%, the arrangement ensures that the net APY of $2,400 is achieved regardless of the fluctuations in the marketplace, thus instilling confidence among investors and putting Mutuum Finance among the best cryptocurrencies in the marketplace. Liquidity Mining Another advantage of Mutuum Finance is the reward program for long-term investors, which uses liquidity mining, where the investor will be rewarded in the form of tokens, apart from the interest earned. An investor staking $10,000 in the ETH-USDC pool will earn a lucrative APY, apart from having a chance to earn more rewards in the form of MUTM tokens. The team has allocated 10% of the total tokens, 400 million MUTM, for this program. This model offers the sense of ownership to the participants within the protocol. The earning system overall is considered to be one of the key points that have led MUTM to become a top investment choice for investors. Why Whales Are Switching Smart money players always stay at least one step ahead of the trend, and their transition from slower-performing assets such as Solana to Mutuum Finance shows that they find the new asset appealing. MUTM provides the capability of earnings generation, growth plans, and attractive pricing to address the question of which cryptocurrency to invest in at the moment. Most importantly, with the steady rise in demand and fundamentals being sound, MUTM is soon to be the next big crypto of the year.

Although XRP has experienced short-term pullbacks following its early 2026 recovery, one market observer argues that the broader setup resembles a prior cycle that preceded a substantial price expansion. This observation has renewed discussion around how high XRP could move if the structure develops similarly. XRP’s Early 2026 Recovery and Pullback XRP entered 2026 with a sharp rebound after a difficult final quarter in 2025. In the first days of January, the asset climbed from approximately $1.83 to a local high near $2.41, representing a gain of more than 30% in less than one week. This advance reversed a large portion of the losses recorded during the fourth quarter of 2025, when XRP fell roughly 35%. However, the upward momentum slowed as the price encountered resistance near the $2.41 area. Since reaching that level, XRP has retraced part of its gains, declining by over 13% and settling closer to the $2.10 region. While some market participants interpreted the pullback as a sign of weakness, analyst CryptoWZRD has suggested that the movement fits within a broader technical structure rather than signaling a breakdown. SIMILAR FORMATION? For over a year $XRP has been trading sideways.. The last major explosive rally in XRP came from an identical setup, can history repeat? Patience Pays. pic.twitter.com/vJpcBWjgfz — CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) January 9, 2026 The Role of Prolonged Consolidation According to CryptoWZRD, XRP’s current behavior mirrors a longer-term consolidation pattern that previously appeared before a major rally. Extended consolidation phases are marked by price trading within defined boundaries for several months, as buying and selling pressure gradually balance out. During these periods, volatility tends to remain constrained, and directional momentum is limited. In 2024, XRP spent much of the year trading well below $1, fluctuating between a lower boundary near $0.40 and an upper limit around $0.75. Repeated attempts to move beyond resistance failed, while declines were consistently supported near the lower end of the range. This environment persisted for most of the year, preventing a sustained trend from forming. As that consolidation matured, XRP transitioned into a narrowing price structure following a decline from roughly $0.66 in September 2024. This development signaled that the market was approaching the end of its consolidation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In early November 2024, XRP broke out of this structure, coinciding with a sharp increase in trading activity. The breakout was followed by a rapid advance that carried XRP to approximately $3.40 by January 2025, representing a multi-hundred-percent increase from the consolidation lows. Similar Conditions Emerging Again CryptoWZRD argues that XRP may now be undergoing a comparable process. Since early 2025, the asset has largely remained within a broad trading range, fluctuating between roughly $1.60 and $3.60. After peaking near $2.70 in late October 2025, XRP entered another period of downward pressure, which culminated in the steep decline seen during the fourth quarter. During this phase, XRP once again formed a tightening price structure similar to the one observed in the prior cycle. The analyst notes that, in the past, the appearance of such a structure marked the latter stages of consolidation rather than the beginning of a prolonged bearish trend. From this perspective, the strong rebound recorded at the start of 2026 may indicate that the corrective phase is nearing completion. At the time of analysis, XRP is trading at $2.08 and attempting to maintain stability above the $2 level. CryptoWZRD has raised the possibility that, if the asset were to replicate the magnitude of its previous breakout, the resulting upside could be substantial. Applying a similar percentage increase to current prices would place XRP well above its recent highs. While this scenario depends on broader market conditions and sustained demand, the analysis underscores why some traders are closely monitoring XRP’s technical structure. Rather than focusing solely on short-term fluctuations, attention remains on whether the broader consolidation resolves in a way that aligns with XRP’s historical price behavior.

Rumors Swell With No Confirmation,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-and-amazon-happening-soon/,"There is ongoing speculation in the crypto community that Ripple, the crypto payments company, and Amazon, the global tech giant , may soon enter into a partnership. While some claims indicate that an alliance has already been formed, others suggest it may be in the works. Whatever the case, no confirmation has yet been issued to verify the rumor’s validity. Rumors Swirl About A Potential Ripple And Amazon Deal Rumors about a possible connection between Ripple and Amazon are quickly gaining attention in the crypto community. Prominent analysts and influential XRP supporters are speculating that the crypto payments company and the tech giant may be heading into a possible partnership. While there has been no concrete evidence to support such claims, advocates like Stellar Rippler, who has over 24,000 followers on X, alleged that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had hinted years ago that Amazon might use XRP for payments and settlement. The supporter argued that previous nondisclosure agreements were not just speculation, but part of a broader plan. Moreover, he believes that recent developments are increasingly aligning with those earlier hints as new details surface. Abdullah Nassif, host of the Good Evening Crypto show, also weighed in on the widespread speculation. He said Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Ripple are looking at using Amazon Bedrock AI with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to speed up system log analysis from days to just minutes. Crypto expert John Squire added that AWS had previously shown interest in XRP for payments. He claimed the company even assigned a team member to explore XRP’s use cases , which has now grown into talks about combining Amazon Bedrock with XRPL. Despite the growing rumors about the company, Amazon, and XRP, neither the crypto company nor the tech giant has officially confirmed any partnership or future collaboration. Amazon Web Services Adds The Firm To Partner Profile Page It could be argued that one of the major reasons rumors of a potential Ripple and Amazon partnership are growing is the crypto payments company’s recent appearance on the AWS Partner Profile page. On its official site, Amazon Web Services highlights the firm’s evolving role in the financial sector, positioning it as a key infrastructure provider for global payments. It showcased the company’s core features and products, including real-time payments, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) , and the ability to send international payments through a single integration. AWS also described RippleNet as a decentralized network of banks and payment providers that enables real-time messaging , clearing, and settlement of financial transactions. According to the cloud computing platform, the payment firm connects banks, digital asset exchanges, and corporations through RippleNet to facilitate global money transfers . AWS also disclosed several RippleNet use cases, including e-invoicing, real-time cash pooling, global currency accounts, international P2P payments, real-time remittances, and more. The cloud computing network has revealed that Ripple has collaborated with more than 100 financial institutions. Many of these organizations are based in different regions outside the US.",Ripple|Abdullah Nassif|amazon|Amazon Bedrock AI|Amazon Web Services|AWS|Brad Garlinghouse|Good Evening Crypto|John Squire|ODL|On-Demand Liquidity|P2P Payments|ripple|RippleNet|Stellar Rippler|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-11 01:00:35

This adjustment was observed after this sector announced a slight ease of mining difficulty to a record of 146.4 trillion on Thursday, January 8. Notably, mining difficulty illustrated the extent of hardship miners needed to expect when introducing a new block to the decentralized blockchain. During this incident, CoinWarz , a long-standing crypto platform (since 2013) offering essential tools for miners, shared its prediction, urging miners to expect the next adjustment to take place on January 22, 2026, at 04:08:12 AM UTC. However, different from the recent adjustment, this forecasted one is anticipated to raise Bitcoin mining difficulty from a record of 146.47 trillion to 148.20 trillion. In attempts to explain this increase, analysts conducted research and discovered that the average block times were recorded at 9.88 minutes, slightly below the set target of 10 minutes. With this finding, they asserted that the next adjustment could lead to a surge in difficulty, aligning more closely with the target time. Miners publicly note down the Bitcoin mining difficulty in the sector Reports in 2025 highlighted that the Bitcoin mining difficulty skyrocketed to new all-time highs , with a slight increase experienced in the last adjustment of that year. Interestingly, even after this increase was recognized, sources claimed that the difficulty record remained below November’s peak of 155.9 trillion. To break down the meaning of surging Bitcoin mining difficulty, reports suggest that such a situation indicates miners should expect stiff competition in this sector, which is anticipated to arise when they launch new blocks to the network. As a result, the situation worsens in the industry, consequently affecting economic and regulatory status across 2025. At this particular moment, analysts have admitted that Bitcoin miners face significant hardship in generating profits, as margins have greatly shrunk due to the halving event that occurred in April 2024. If block rewards were reduced by half, several key economic factors would be affected. Later, miners and mining firms reported facing increased pressure from the crypto market decline that began in November. This stress arose when miner hash price drastically decreased below the expected level essential to break even. This price illustrated the anticipated yields for each computing power unit utilized to mine blocks effectively. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the miner hash price is the expected daily revenue generated per unit of computational power (hashrate), usually measured in dollars per terahash per second per day ($/TH/s/day). Bitcoin’s price drastically drops amid significant challenges in the Bitcoin mining industry Considering the increased uncertainties in the Bitcoin mining sector, miners have been encouraged to choose whether to continue with their operations or halt them when the price reaches a record of $40 per petahash-second per day. This price marks an increase from a low point of $35 recorded in November. Another factor that has significantly contributed to the recent pressure in the mining industry is US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, which have sparked concerns about the potential for a supply chain shortage in the sector. Notably, October’s flash crash marked the beginning of declines in the crypto market, which led to a drop in the price of BTC by over 30% in November , with a low of just above $80,000. Nonetheless, even with this decline, the crypto industry became hopeful once more after the price of the cryptocurrency started rising, maintaining a level lower than October’s peak of more than $125,000.

On-chain analysts have noticed more whales selling off their holdings in waves since late 2024. In 2025, whale holdings dropped to 3 million BTC raising concerns about the sales destabilizing the market. Why are Bitcoin holders selling now? A Bitcoin miner who earned rewards back in 2010 has moved 2,000 BTC to Coinbase Exchange after keeping the coins untouched for 15 years. At current prices near $100,000 per Bitcoin, this transfer is worth close to $200 million. The miner stored these coins in 40 separate Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses, the original way Bitcoin addresses worked in 2010 before newer and better formats were introduced. CryptoQuant reported that after BTC crossed $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, there were three major periods of selling in late 2024, July 2025, and November 2025. In July of 2025 a whale moved 80,000 BTC that sat dormant for 14 years. Galaxy Digital helped with the transaction, which was worth about $9 billion at the time Bitcoin traded near $108,000. The company’s CEO Mike Novogratz confirmed that companies like Strategy and other corporate Bitcoin buyers quickly purchased the coins without crashing the market. Strategy already acquired 673,783 BTC as of early 2025. Will BTC’s price drop due to whale sales? Bitcoin was valued above $126,000 in early October 2025 before falling 30% to around $86,000 by mid-December. During the first two waves of whales selling their holdings, Bitcoin ETF demand was strong enough to outpace the supply from sellers. ETF inflows kept prices rising even as old holders cashed out. When ETF buying cooled down and another wave of whale activity arrived in November, prices finally started dropping. After the BTC halving event cut mining rewards in half, mining companies needed to sell more of their Bitcoin to cover electricity and operating costs. Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin mining company reported selling 1,818 BTC during December, generating net proceeds of $161.6 million at an average price of $88,870 per coin. The sales reported in filings was a serious escalation from November when the company sold just 38 BTC. Back in January 2025, another dormant whale caused a stir when they sent 500 BTC worth $47 million to Coinbase Prime after six years of inactivity. That wallet originally received those coins when Bitcoin was trading around $7,000, meaning the holder gained 13x on their investment. Market observers have been debating whether or not Bitcoin will follow its traditional four-year cycle that usually includes a bear market after price peaks. CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju believes that the market has changed because ETFs and corporate treasuries create new demand that didn’t exist in previous cycles. He believes further gains could come in 2026 if institutional buying continues. According to Cryptopolitan reports, investment firms such as Berstein, Bitwise, Standard Chartered and Grayscale agree with the CryptoQuant executive in dismissing the importance of the four-year cycle as more relevant macro factors have come into the picture with the crypto market’s maturity and regulatory status.

In particular, analysts and commentators have explored what XRP’s valuation might look like if it were to process a small share of transaction flows associated with SWIFT, the dominant international financial messaging network. While such projections are theoretical, they provide a framework for understanding why XRP’s long-term role in cross-border payments continues to attract attention. XRP’s Proposed Role in Global Payments Ripple’s leadership has consistently emphasized that XRP was created to enhance international settlements rather than eliminate existing financial infrastructure. According to statements from Ripple executives, traditional systems remain functional but often involve delays, multiple intermediaries, and high operational costs. Blockchain-based settlement, by contrast, allows transactions to finalize more quickly and with fewer steps, potentially freeing up capital that would otherwise remain locked in transit. From this perspective, XRP is often discussed as a settlement asset that could operate alongside established networks. Under such an arrangement, SWIFT would continue to serve as a messaging layer, while XRP and the XRP Ledger could be used to move value more efficiently between institutions. The Scale of SWIFT’s Transaction Network To assess XRP’s hypothetical price impact, it is important to understand the magnitude of SWIFT’s daily activity. The network processes tens of millions of messages every day, with reported averages exceeding 40 million messages daily in recent years. Although SWIFT does not publish exact figures for the total value transferred, historical estimates suggest that daily transaction values reached approximately $5 trillion as early as the mid-2000s. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Given the growth of global finance since then, current volumes are widely assumed to be higher. However, using the conservative $5 trillion figure provides a reasonable baseline for illustrative calculations. Modeling a 5% Share Scenario If XRP were to facilitate just 5% of a $5 trillion daily transaction flow, that would equate to $250 billion moving through the asset each day. At present, XRP trades near $2.09 and typically records daily trading volumes of roughly $3 billion. An increase from $3 billion to $250 billion in daily activity would represent a significant expansion in usage. Applying a simplified proportional framework that compares current trading activity with this hypothetical level, XRP’s price could rise substantially under such conditions. Using this approach, some estimates place XRP’s potential price near $170 per token, assuming the market adjusts upward in line with increased volume. At that level, XRP’s total market capitalization would reach several trillion dollars, positioning it among the largest financial assets globally. However, asset prices do not scale directly with transaction volume, particularly in markets dominated by institutional liquidity, net settlements, and high-frequency activity. Much of the increased volume could reflect operational usage rather than sustained buying pressure. Nonetheless, this analysis helps explain why XRP’s potential integration into large-scale payment flows remains a subject of interest. Even limited participation in systems associated with global settlement activity could have meaningful implications for XRP’s long-term valuation, depending on adoption, regulation, and market structure.

Bitcoin is holding near $90,000, while big altcoins are stuck in choppy ranges that punish hesitation and weak conviction. Cardano sits right in that storm. ADA is trading around $0.39 to $0.40 today, but the market still cannot agree on a clean Cardano price prediction for the months ahead. When that uncertainty drags on, money rotates toward clearer catalysts, and one name keeps coming up as traders hunt for the next big altcoin in 2025 style momentum, just delayed into 2026: Remittix (RTX). Cardano price prediction stays tense as traders watch key levels Cardano is not collapsing, but it is also not convincing the market. The current Cardano price prediction debate is focused on whether ADA can build above the $0.42 area, which many see as a near term ceiling. When price cannot reclaim a level like that and hold it, rallies start to look like short lived bounces instead of real trend shifts. Derivatives positioning has also jumped, which can make volatility sharper in both directions. From a chart view, some analysts point to a falling wedge breakout attempt, but they warn the move needs strong follow-through volume to matter. If that volume does not show up, the Cardano price prediction talk turns into the same range trade again: traders sell strength, buy dips, and wait for a narrative that actually changes. Traders shift focus to utility plays like Remittix for 2026 This is where Remittix enters the conversation, not as another “maybe,” but as a deadline-driven story that traders can actually trade around. The project is pushing a crypto-to-fiat payments angle, and it has put a hard date on its platform rollout: February 9, 2026 . When Cardano price prediction threads feel stuck in technical noise, a fixed launch date feels like oxygen. Remittix has also pushed two urgency triggers that hit the market’s FOMO nerve fast. One is a limited 200% token bonus that is capped at 5 million tokens, with the team saying a large chunk of that cap moved in the last 24 hours. The other is product distribution momentum, with the Remittix wallet now live on the Apple App Store and Google Play, described as next in line. If you are trying to land a Cardano price prediction for 2026, the hardest part is identifying what changes the story. With Remittix , the story change is already scheduled, and the market tends to front-run scheduled catalysts. RTX is priced at $0.119, with 695 million tokens sold and over $28.7 million raised so far. The project also points to over 30,000 investors acquiring RTX in recent months, which adds social proof at the exact time supply pressure is increasing. Then there is credibility. Remittix has leaned hard into security and trust signals, with the team fully verified by CertiK and positioned as the top-ranked token on CertiK’s pre-launch listings. That matters because serious buyers do not just chase hype; they chase projects that can survive scrutiny. Here is the simplest truth: waiting is a strategy, but in early-stage crypto investment, waiting often becomes regret when the price resets higher. Why buyers are moving now instead of later: Remittix is built as a DeFi project with a real payments mission that aims to move value from crypto into everyday spending routes. The February 9, 2026 rollout date gives traders a clear catalyst calendar instead of open ended promises. The CertiK verification and top ranking status raise the trust floor for new buyers who demand proof before they deploy capital. The exchange roadmap and third CEX preparation increase the odds of faster liquidity expansion when attention turns into volume. What to watch next Cardano price prediction debates will stay noisy until ADA proves it can push through resistance and hold it. If ADA fails to reclaim key levels with conviction, traders will keep hunting for clearer catalysts elsewhere, because uncertainty is expensive in a fast market. Remittix is giving traders a schedule, a product rollout, and a tightening supply story that punishes late entries. If you keep seeing the same name on 2026 watchlists, it is usually because the market is already positioning, not because it is brainstorming.

A realistic Cardano price prediction depends on whether ADA can reclaim and hold key resistance zones like $0.42 with strong follow-through. If ADA stays stuck near $0.39 to $0.40, the Cardano price prediction outlook remains range-bound and driven by short-term sentiment. 2) How can beginners buy RTX tokens if they want early exposure? If you want to buy RTX tokens, start by using the official Remittix site and only follow verified project announcements. Many buyers treat this as an early-stage crypto investment because access conditions can change quickly as milestones are hit. 3) Why do some traders call Remittix the best crypto to buy now among upcoming crypto projects? Some traders view Remittix as the best crypto to buy now because it has a fixed rollout date on February 9, 2026, visible product distribution with the wallet on the Apple App Store, and a clear path toward centralized exchanges. Those signals can matter more than endless Cardano price prediction debates when the market wants a cleaner catalyst.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-11 03:29:57

With LINK trading around $13 and fresh Chainlink Price Prediction reports now mapping paths toward $50 over the next cycle, interest has picked up among both retail and institutional traders. At the same time, some investors do not want to wait years for a move from $13 to $50. They are starting to compare the slower upside on LINK with Remittix, a payment-focused DeFi project that links crypto to bank accounts and combines real utility with aggressive incentives. Chainlink Tries To Confirm A New Uptrend Chainlink trades around $13.24, with a live market capitalisation of $9.3 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $385 million. Recent Chainlink price predictions from outlets that track technical data suggest a move toward $15.50 in the coming weeks, provided support near $12 continues to hold, and current momentum readings remain positive. That is why many Chainlink Price Prediction notes treat talk of a new $50 high as a longer-term scenario that would need a stronger crypto market and sustained demand for oracles. Fundamentals remain one of the main reasons analysts stay positive on LINK. Chainlink continues to lead the oracle sector and has extended CCIP to more networks, while Coinbase has selected Chainlink CCIP as exclusive bridge infrastructure for its wrapped asset growth program, which deepens links with major institutions. Overall, the near term tone leans cautiously bullish, with a grinding move higher seen as more likely than a straight run to any $50 target. Remittix Builds A Higher Upside Payments Narrative Where Chainlink already carries a large cap valuation, Remittix sits earlier in its journey and targets a different problem. The project is building a PayFi stack that joins crypto wallets, fiat rails, and bank payouts so users and businesses can move money across borders in a direct way. For investors who study every Chainlink Price Prediction but want much higher upside, RTX offers a smaller starting base and a roadmap built around payment activity rather than only price action. The delivery record behind Remittix is a key part of that case. The team reports that more than 697 million RTX tokens have already been sold at $0.119, with over $28.7 million raised and progress toward a $30 million milestone that will unlock a major new exchange reveal. BitMart listed RTX after the raise crossed $20 million, and LBANK followed after $22 million, while a third top-tier listing is now in preparation. Security and trust are reinforced by a f ull CertiK audit , a number one ranking for pre-launch tokens on CertiK Skynet with a Grade A score of 80.09, and a fully KYC-verified team. On the product side, the Remittix Wallet is live on the Apple App Store, Google Play is in progress, and the main Remittix Platform will launch on 9 February 2026 to switch on global crypto to fiat payouts. The current sale phase also includes a 200% bonus offer that is selling out fast, activated using the RTX2026 code and a 15% USDT referral reward that pays every 24 hours through the dashboard, adding a clear layer of crypto with passive income potential for early supporters For investors, several Remittix features stand out, including: Solving a real-world $19 trillion cross-border payments problem Utility first token model built around real transaction volume Deflationary tokenomics with growth potential Global payout rails are expanding, with a focus on key remittance corridors Built for adoption rather than short-term speculation Why Remittix Deserves A Place Beside Chainlink Chainlink is likely to remain a key building block for DeFi and tokenized assets, and a price boost would support the bullish side of any medium term Chainlink Price Prediction. Yet the same market now rewards projects that bring fresh utility and stronger upside from a lower starting point. Remittix fits that description, with a confirmed 9 February 2026 platform launch, a wallet already in the Apple App Store, and multiple CEX listings that anchor liquidity plans. When that is combined with the 200% bonus window and the 15% USDT referral program, Remittix looks like a payment token that can sit beside LINK in a portfolio while offering much more aggressive growth potential.

Most recent analysis sees LINK grinding to maintain price action, helped by firm support and growing network usage. Higher targets near $50 usually depend on a much stronger crypto market phase and sustained demand for Chainlink services. Why Is Remittix Viewed As A Higher Upside Alternative To LINK Right Now? Remittix starts from a much smaller valuation and is entering its main product launch phase. That combination gives it more room to move compared to a large cap like Chainlink, where growth is usually steadier. Why Are Some Investors Pairing Chainlink With Remittix Instead Of Choosing One? Chainlink offers steady, infrastructure-driven growth, while Remittix targets faster upside through payments and adoption. Holding both allows investors to balance long-term utility with higher reward potential.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-11 04:00:00

As a result, several analysts predicted that the core consumer price index would soar by 2.7% in December compared to 2024. Regarding the analyst’s prediction , sources claimed that this forecast was slightly above the 2.6% annual surge recorded in November. Nonetheless, reports declared that this record demonstrated the slightest rise since early 2021. The Upcoming December report sparks hope among individuals Earlier, analysts had anticipated that overall and core prices would increase by 0.3% monthly. Unfortunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a statement informing individuals that it was unable to publish the month-to-month amendments to the last Consumer Price Index report due to the recent government shutdown . Following this announcement, analysts noted that the November report showed a decline in the inflation rate. Additionally, due to the struggles the agency encountered while gathering price data in October, this report anticipated that key rent indexes would remain stable in that month. Consequently, this situation challenged figures recorded in November. However, even with this scenario, optimism was sparked once again in the ecosystem after sources pointed out that the December report could shift this trend to a more positive outlook. Notably, this report is scheduled to be made public on Tuesday, 13 January. At this point, the reason why the Federal Reserve officials looked forward to maintaining interest rates unchanged for the time being was clear. These reasons included insufficiently clear inflation readings and signs of stabilization in the US job market after reports about weak wages were leaked, according to an analysis conducted by analysts. “We believe the CPI report will create some misleading stories. We anticipate that the December data will be high, largely due to the correction of some of the downward trends seen in November’s data. Some analysts might interpret this high reading as a sign that inflation is coming back, but we think that’s not correct,” they said. They also acknowledged that the November report exaggerated the downturn in inflation, possibly by about 20 basis points, but still expressed the belief that several retailers have been reducing prices and that tariff effects have reached their peak, with several products already at their highest levels. Analysts describe this week as a busy, economically related week As the situation surrounding inflation intensified, reports highlighted that Monday would initiate an eventful week for John Williams, the President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who would address matters concerning US central bankers who are expected to make public appearances. Other prominent leaders appointed to speak on economic matters this week include Michelle Bowman, Philip Jefferson, Alberto Musalem, and Anna Paulson. Meanwhile, sources confirmed that consumer spending in the fourth quarter demonstrated impressive performance. These sources also noted that government data, anticipated to be published on Wednesday, January 14, will disclose another significant rise in retail sales. Following this assertion, analysts forecast a 0.4% surge in November, similar to the rise encountered in October. This percentage was calculated after they excluded auto dealers. Other reports set to be released this week are expected to address issues concerning October’s new-home sales, the November producer price index, and December’s industrial production and home resales.

The group behind the campaign identifies itself as “Investors For Transparency.” Ad Campaign Targets Lawmakers With Hotlines And Numbers According to reports , the ads warn of broad risks if DeFi is folded into federal law. They cite a figure — $6.6 trillion — that has been used in public discussion about how much in bank deposits might be affected if stablecoins gain wide acceptance with interest-like features. The ads urge people to call Senate offices and push senators to strip DeFi provisions from the CLARITY Act ahead of a scheduled markup on January 15, 2026.

Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott has said he expects the committee to move on crypto legislation, and senators are weighing how to balance investor protections with innovation. Outside groups and industry players have ramped up outreach. Some hope the bill moves quickly, while others see the political heat as likely to slow progress. Crypto: Industry Response And Questions About Funding Crypto firms and DeFi supporters have pushed back. Hayden Adams, CEO of Uniswap Labs, publicly criticized the group’s name as misleading and questioned who is funding the ads. Based on public filings and media reporting, no clear single donor has been identified that explains the scale of the TV buy. Industry leaders say that a campaign attacking DeFi while claiming to speak for investors should disclose its backers. The ads’ emphasis on bank-deposit risk has been called overstated by some market watchers, who argue that the figures are speculative and depend on many assumptions. What The Campaign Wants And What It Means Reports say that the ads want senators to approve a version of the CLARITY Act without language covering decentralized finance platforms or new stablecoin rules that could allow interest-like yields. Supporters of that view say the rules would protect the traditional banking system from a sudden outflow of deposits. Opponents say excluding DeFi would lock in regulatory uncertainty and hurt US competitiveness in an area where developers and users already operate globally.

A bullish bias remains as long as the price holds above $0.30. A break above $0.325–$0.33 opens $0.34–$0.35 next. Optimism 1-day price chart On the 1D chart for January 11, OP is trading around $0.32 after a sharp impulsive move from the $0.26–$0.27 region, confirming a short-term trend shift. The price is holding above the 20-day basis of the Bollinger Bands, near $0.295, which now acts as the first dynamic support. Meanwhile, the upper band, around $0.345, defines the immediate upside ceiling. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The recent small-bodied candles signal digestion rather than rejection, and as long as daily closes remain above $0.30, the structure stays bullish. A daily expansion back toward $0.34–$0.35 would indicate momentum continuation, while a loss of $0.295 would expose a deeper pullback toward $0.27 without fully breaking the trend. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the price is compressing just above the Alligator averages, clustered between $0.317 and $0.319, indicating equilibrium rather than weakness. The CMF holding around 0.19 confirms sustained capital inflow, and the Accumulation/Distribution line continues to slope upward, suggesting dips are being absorbed. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has cooled, which fits a consolidation phase after expansion, not distribution. A clean 4-hour close above $0.325 would likely trigger a push toward $0.34, while acceptance below $0.315 would risk a range reset toward $0.30. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3211 SELL SMA 5 $0.3175 BUY SMA 10 $0.3029 BUY SMA 21 $0.2852 BUY SMA 50 $0.3031 BUY SMA 100 $0.3910 SELL SMA 200 $0.5422 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3207 SELL EMA 5 $0.3159 BUY EMA 10 $0.3048 BUY EMA 21 $0.2972 BUY EMA 50 $0.3212 SELL EMA 100 $0.3944 SELL EMA 200 $0.5368 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is in a pause within an emerging bullish structure, favoring continuation as long as $0.30–$0.295 holds. Upside expansion requires volume re-entry, but downside risk remains controlled unless structure support breaks decisively. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

57059899,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892821,1768108904,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57059899.jpeg,Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says tokenized stocks will be a huge.,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tokenized-stocks-will-transform-trading/,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes tokenized stocks will redefine global trading. He commented, “Tokenized stocks will be huge. So many opportunities.” The Coinbase executive noted that tokenized stocks will expand their international access and continue to offer fractional stock purchases and round-the-clock trading. He added they’ll provide perpetual futures, real-time settlement, and novel governance innovations. X users agree that tokenization offers real benefits, some sharing Armstrong’s optimism for growth In response to Armstrong’s post , X user Andreas Kohl supported the executive’s argument that tokenized shares will blow up. However, he excluded the derivatives of CSD-held shares on Base in his success projection, adding , “What’s going to be huge is on-chain DRS with disintermediated trading for native BTC.” Another X commenter, Jack Holdorrson, shared his optimism that capital markets will be tokenized in the years to come. Another X user also pointed out that while tokenized stocks come with real upsides, including continuous trading and fractional ownership, the government is hijacking them. He explained that Washington is dressing up old Wall Street politics in blockchain language instead of letting real innovation happen. He slammed the U.S. law, which sets up a $55 million government program run by 11 insider-heavy advisory committees. He likened it to the 2008 bailout, saying it feels more like a handout to powerful players than real innovation. These comments come as tokenized stocks are gaining ground as a means for ordinary people to access investment opportunities that have long been reserved for high-net-worth individuals and other accredited investors. However, while retail traders’ interest in the emerging asset class is accelerating, some experts are cautioning them to slow down. This is because tokenized stocks are less regulated, and they can pose more legal and financial risks to inexperienced traders, some experts say. “With a token, it is an instrument not issued by the company,” said James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University. “It’s a side bet on the future prospects of the company.” Additionally, the German Foundation Coin stated , Tokenization is powerful. But only if legal rights, settlement finality, and accountability are enforced on-chain, not just promised off-chain. Access and liquidity scale fast. Trust and enforceability don’t – unless they’re designed into the system.” Armstrong stated that Coinbase will establish an “everything app.” Earlier, Armstrong revealed that Coinbase is building an all-in-one exchange for everything from crypto to stocks and commodities in 2026. The plan positions Coinbase to challenge major brokerage firms and expand into new types of digital trading. The platform has also recently partnered with prediction market Kalshi . Last November, some images surfaced showing Coinbase testing a prediction market that allows users to trade with USDC or USD on topics such as politics, sports, and the economy. According to reports, Coinbase Financial Markets manages the offering, creating event contracts that are simple binary bets under Kalshi’s rules. Coinbase is also moving to produce tokenized shares internally, departing from rivals who depend on external partners. Robinhood and Kraken continue to utilize external partners for stock tokens in select jurisdictions, although U.S. users are currently unable to access them. So far, tokenized equity transfers have increased by nearly 76% over the last month, reaching around $2.46 billion, according to RWA.xyz. In December, Coinbase also announced plans to acquire The Clearing Company to strengthen its event-based trading offerings. Its agreement with the prediction platform will formally close this month. Following the acquisition, the Clearing Company’s staff will support Coinbase in expanding its prediction markets, with nearly all its 10 employees joining the exchange. The exchange has yet to confirm deal value, although it noted it will pay for the acquisition in both cash and Coinbase stock. The Clearing company’s executive, Gemayel, at the time told reporters that joining Coinbase gives them the chance to bring their knowledge to a bigger audience, emphasizing that prediction markets thrive on strong structure and broad distribution. Beyond the Clearing Company deal, Coinbase also revealed its deals with Roam, Spindl, Iron Fish, Deribit, Opyn Markets, Liquifi, Sensible, Echo, and Vector.fun, last year.

Spiegel’s statements place tokenization and digital assets at the center of the next phase of institutional finance, emphasizing that the industry is moving beyond experimentation and toward operational deployment. According to his remarks, clients are no longer satisfied with real-time access to data alone and are increasingly demanding the ability for assets and value to move instantly, a capability that traditional systems have yet to fully deliver. Spiegel noted that demand for always-on financial services is accelerating, particularly in emerging and fast-growing markets. He describes tokenization as a practical response to this shift, arguing that it introduces reliability and innovation that financial institutions can extend directly to their clients. In his words, digital finance is approaching a tipping point, with tokenized assets and digital instruments transitioning from pilot programs into mainstream use. $XRP : Standard Chartered's Michael Spiegel; head of transactions banking speaking at SIBOS 2025, key partners of Ripple and SWIFT ""The landscape of digital finance is at a tipping point, tokenization and digital assets are about to move from pilot into mainstream"" Ripple… https://t.co/NF8iMhds66 pic.twitter.com/R7WUI5d1Y6 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 9, 2026 Standard Chartered and Ripple’s Strategic Alignment The tweet further outlines the longstanding strategic relationship between Standard Chartered and Ripple , which dates back to 2016. This relationship has included direct investment and the use of Ripple’s technology to support cross-border payment solutions. Beyond operational use cases, Standard Chartered’s ventures arm has also been involved in several broader tokenization initiatives aligned with Ripple’s strategy. One cited example is participation by both institutions in Singapore’s Monetary Authority Project Guardian, a regulatory-led initiative focused on tokenized assets and market infrastructure. This involvement extends to tokenized deposit experiments for major clients, including Ant International, under programs targeting large Asian treasury operations. These initiatives reflect a coordinated approach to applying distributed ledger technology within regulated frameworks, rather than isolated proofs of concept. APAC as a Center for Tokenization Development According to the analysis shared in the tweet, the Asia-Pacific region is emerging as a primary environment for advancing tokenization . Regulatory conditions in several APAC jurisdictions are described as clearer and more supportive than in parts of the Western world, enabling faster progression from design to deployment. This regulatory clarity is viewed as a key factor allowing banks and infrastructure providers to test and scale tokenized financial products with institutional clients. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Effect on XRP and the Distributed Ledger Infrastructure The general objective described involves using distributed ledger technology to enable faster and more cost-efficient movement of value across borders . This includes exploration across multiple infrastructures, such as the XRP Ledger and SWIFT’s evolving consensus-based systems, either independently or in complementary roles. Within this context, assets such as XRP are increasingly discussed in relation to real-world asset tokenization and global settlement efficiency, rather than purely speculative use cases. Taken together, Spiegel’s remarks and the institutional partnerships highlighted suggest a coordinated push by major financial players to integrate tokenization into mainstream banking operations, with distributed ledger technology positioned as a foundational component of that transition.

According to the report, PlayStation Network may integrate XRP payments in the second quarter of 2026. While the information is explicitly framed as a rumor and has not been confirmed by Sony or PlayStation, it aligns with certain developments suggesting that major technology firms are increasingly exploring blockchain-based payment systems. The claim does not reference internal documents or official statements, but it indicates a potential shift in how PlayStation Network could handle digital transactions in the future. If accurate, such a move would represent one of the most prominent consumer-facing payment integrations involving XRP to date. RUMOR: PSN will integrate $XRP payments in Q2, 2026! pic.twitter.com/9nDUgKTWBC — Coinvo (@Coinvo) January 8, 2026 Context Within Sony’s Broader Blockchain Strategy The rumor emerges at a time when Sony has already signaled interest in blockchain infrastructure and digital payments. The company has acknowledged plans related to blockchain technology, including experimentation with digital assets and reports surrounding a possible Sony-backed stablecoin targeted for use across its ecosystem. While those initiatives have focused on stable, fiat-pegged assets rather than volatile cryptocurrencies, they indicate that Sony is actively evaluating alternatives to traditional payment rails. Coinvo’s report suggests that XRP, known for its fast settlement times and low transaction costs, could theoretically fit into a large-scale digital marketplace like PlayStation Network. However, no confirmation exists that XRP has been selected or formally evaluated by Sony for this purpose. Potential Implications for XRP Adoption If PlayStation Network were to support XRP payments, the implications for the asset’s visibility and usage could be significant. PlayStation Network serves a global user base numbering in the hundreds of millions, and even limited optional support for XRP could introduce the asset to a mainstream consumer audience. This would mark a shift from XRP’s current perception as primarily an institutional or cross-border settlement tool toward a broader consumer-facing utility. Such integration could also demonstrate XRP’s capacity to handle high transaction volumes efficiently, particularly for digital goods such as games, subscriptions, and downloadable content. Increased real-world usage, if sustained, could strengthen the narrative around XRP’s practicality as a payment-focused digital asset.

Sony and PlayStation have not issued any statements confirming plans to integrate XRP , nor have they acknowledged Coinvo’s claim. Regulatory considerations, price volatility, and user experience challenges would all need to be addressed before any such integration could realistically occur. Until official confirmation is provided, the rumor should be viewed as an indicator of market interest rather than a guaranteed development. Still, the claim underscores how expectations surrounding crypto payments continue to grow, particularly as major consumer platforms evaluate alternatives to legacy financial systems.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin mining difficulty dipped slightly in the first adjustment of 2026. Faster block times point to a difficulty increase later this month. Mining profitability remains under pressure despite the brief relief. The adjustment, completed Thursday, lowered difficulty to 146.4 trillion, reflecting modest changes in network conditions as the year begins. Bitcoin Difficulty Set to Rise After Blocks Run Faster Than Target Mining difficulty measures how hard it is to add a new block to Bitcoin’s blockchain and is recalibrated roughly every two weeks to keep block production close to the 10-minute target. At the time of the adjustment, average block times were running at about 9.88 minutes, slightly faster than the protocol’s goal. As a result, the next recalibration is expected to reverse course. Data from CoinWarz estimates the next adjustment on Jan. 22, which would lift difficulty to around 148.2 trillion. Despite the latest dip, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty remains historically elevated. The metric climbed steadily throughout 2025, reaching record levels before easing late in the year. Even after the most recent changes, difficulty remains below the all-time high of roughly 155.9 trillion set in November, but competition among miners remains intense. The elevated difficulty underscores the strain facing the mining sector following a difficult 2025. Miners endured what many described as the harshest margin environment on record, driven by the April 2024 halving that cut block rewards in half and by worsening macroeconomic conditions. A nonce is a changing value miners adjust within a block header to generate a hash below the difficulty threshold required by proof-of-work. Miners iterate billions of nonces per second while searching for a valid block hash. pic.twitter.com/n8p2vQjUT6 — American Bitcoin (@ABTC) January 11, 2026 Those pressures intensified during the crypto market downturn that began late last year. Profitability metrics reflected the squeeze. Miner hash price, which tracks expected revenue per unit of computing power, slipped below breakeven levels in November. Industry data shows the figure fell under $35 per petahash per second per day, well below the roughly $40 level many operators view as the threshold for sustainable operations. External factors compounded the challenge. New US tariffs introduced during President Donald Trump’s term raised concerns over mining equipment supply chains, while a sharp market sell-off in October triggered a broader crypto decline. Bitcoin prices dropped more than 30% in November, briefly falling to just above $80,000. Study Challenges Bitcoin Mining Energy Criticism Bitcoin mining can strengthen electrical grids and lower consumer electricity costs rather than strain power systems, according to a detailed analysis by independent researcher Daniel Batten. His research challenges common claims that mining destabilizes grids or drives up energy prices, drawing on peer-reviewed studies and operational data to argue that the industry’s flexible power usage can provide measurable system benefits. Meanwhile, Bitmain is cutting prices aggressively across multiple generations of Bitcoin mining hardware as pressure builds across the mining sector, according to recent promotional campaigns and internal price lists circulated to customers. One promotion dated Dec. 23 offered a package of four S19 XP+ Hydro units paired with an ANTRACK V2 container, implying an effective price of roughly $4 per terahash for the 19 J/TH machines.

Ripple’s native token was among the prime examples, as it skyrocketed by about 30% in less than a week from under $1.90 to a multi-month peak of $2.41. This came amid growing ETF inflows and declining token holdings on exchanges. However, this rally was halted, and the asset has slumped by 13% since then to $2.10 as of press time. According to Ali Martinez, there could be more pain on the horizon for the XRP bulls. He noted that the cross-border token could be printing a gravestone doji candle, warning that it’s “not a great look.” This setup is typically regarded as a bearish reversal candlestick pattern that looks like an upside-down “T.” It signals that the bulls’ push was rejected and could lead to a prolonged downtrend, especially if it follows an instant uptick, as it happened with XRP last week. $XRP appears to be printing a gravestone doji. Not a great look! pic.twitter.com/e5m4hf0lie — Ali Charts (@alicharts) January 10, 2026 The other warning sign for XRP’s price is related to the declining whale activity. CryptoPotato reported earlier this week, right after the token’s impressive price surge, that whale-sized XRP transfers had skyrocketed by double digits to their highest levels since October. Santiment warned that this could indicate the price movement at the time was most likely erratic and unsustainable, given the sudden rise in such transactions. More recent data shared by Martinez again shows a massive decline in this metric, which could spell further trouble for the underlying token. Whale activity on $XRP spiked to 433 transactions on January 6, but has since fallen to just 33. pic.twitter.com/6iuo55v7qk — Ali Charts (@alicharts) January 9, 2026 The post Ripple Price Warning: 2 Signals Suggest XRP’s Early 2026 Rally Is Running Out of Steam appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-01-11 07:27:30

Analysts Track This $0.05 Altcoin for 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-cheap-crypto-to-15x-analysts-track-this-0-05-altcoin-for-2026/,"Traders are in search of the next altcoin with substantial returns in the next market cycle as it remains undervalued. It is anticipated that the next 15x candidate might not be recruited by the big caps, but by an inexpensive asset in its infancy. There is already a whale interest in one of the new cryptos that cost less than $0.5, with an initial presale interest and rising media attention. It is currently in the low valuation range, and it is only anticipating its primary mainnet release; hence, some investors are already positioning. This has led to a growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto protocol that is going to make its debut in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance proposes a dual lending framework that is based on a Peer to Contract and on a Peer to Peer markets. It is aimed at decentralizing credit markets and offering new means of access to yield and borrowing to users. The Peer to Contract market allows the user to lend and borrow via shared liquidity pools. Assets are deposited by the lenders in the pool and they are issued with mtTokens. Such mtTokens display the deposit size and yield with time. The interest rate varies depending on the use of a pool. The more borrowers borrow out the greater the APY to the lenders. As an illustration, a person providing 1,000 USDC is issued with the mtUSDC. In case borrowing demand increases, the yield of those mtUSDC increases. This model renders lending inactive and quick in cases where the borrower does not have to be directly matched with another user. The Peer to Peer also facilitates lending and borrowing; however, it pairs the lenders and borrowers together. Between them, terms like interest rate, collateral type and repayment schedule can be made. Loans are kept collateral and the loan to value regulations are put in place to make the system secure. In case the value of collateral falls below the necessary levels, there is a liquidation event. Some of the debt is repaid and discounted collaterals are given to liquidators. The process is beneficial in safeguarding the solvency and keeping the lenders covered even in the face of unstable price movements. Presale Information and Token Distribution Early investors have been highly attracted by the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. The fund has been increasing as each new stage has been launched, and now it stands at $19.7M. Over 18,800 participants have participated and the token has gone through various pricing rounds. Phase 1 MUTM was listed at $0.01, and currently trades at approximately 0.04 in Phase 7, which is approximately 300% higher than it traded at the time it was listed. There are 4 billion MUTM fixed supply tokens of Mutuum Finance. presale is allotted 45.5% of the supply. This equals 1.82 billion tokens. The presale is allocated in phases that have increasing prices. There is a special 24 hour leaderboard of new inflows and large buyers. The demand has remained high over several weeks and analysts reckon this is because of the launch utility and revenue of future protocol. The token price has been doing well in increasing the level of phase 1 to the present stage price. The token will list at a higher fixed price at launch which is already fixed in the documentation. This provides the instant valuation boost to the levels of the entry presale holders. Halborn Security Review and V1 Launch The Mutuum Finance gets ready to launch its V1 protocol. The launch of the V1 is a critical one as it brings in actual borrowing and lending flows into the system. This protocol starts to issue APY to the depositors of the mtToken and opens the access to the P2P borrowing. This first live version, according to analysts, is the main driver of valuation expansion. It provides the token operational utility and demand and not just presale speculation. Analyst projections have seen a 15x case within a reach in 2026 in case of continued adoption. They note that the token is not expensive compared to protocols that have similar designs and on-chain lending products. The lending markets depend on security because of collateral handling and liquidation mechanisms. Mutuum Finance has undergone a Halborn Security audit . Halborn is a reputable blockchain security company and the audit provides authority to the protocol prior to mainnet launch. According to analysts, this allows early users to reduce their smart contract concerns as well as heighten the confidence of institutional capital. Security validation in crypto markets can affect the inflow of liquidity and eventual adoption. Audited protocols are usually popular among investors prior to the deposit of funds or collateral.

I challenge Buffett's GOAT status, arguing his strategies thrived in a bygone era where value outperformed growth and technology was less dominant. BRK.B's performance has lagged the S&P 500 over the past 17 years, with a 445.77% total return versus the S&P's 554.84%. Buffett's inability to adapt to new market realities and innovation undermines his reputation for consistent outperformance. Common sense might suggest if you follow the advice of someone who was successful in the past, it will help you succeed too. But that's actually not always the case; sometimes you should try to do things differently than those who have achieved success in an outdated world, as adaptation to the modern world is essential. Recently retired Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A ) ( BRK.B ) CEO Warren Buffett is often called the "" GOAT "" (Greatest Of All Time) in investing, business, and capitalism by many financial commentators, pundits, CEOs, and investors, recognizing his unparalleled long-term success and influence in the financial world, as seen in headlines from several media sources, including CNBC, Yahoo Finance, Simply Wall Street, and others, along with numerous social media posts. Reasons he is called the GOAT: Long-Term Success: Warren Buffett's consistent, monumental, decades-long success in value investing and building Berkshire Hathaway and historical outperformance of the S&P 500 from 1965 to 2025. Wisdom & Guidance: He's seen as a source of immense financial wisdom, influencing many past, current, and upcoming generations of investors. Capitalism Icon: Figures like the Brooks Running CEO call him the ""GOAT of capitalism"" for his principles and accomplishments. Legacy: His impact is so remarkable that terms like ""Oracle of Omaha"" or ""Sage of Omaha"" also highlight his legendary status, but ""GOAT"" has become a very popular modern descriptor for his achievements. Berkshire Hathaway produced a 5 million percent return during Warren Buffett's 60-year reign as CEO. Let's Start by Admitting He's Actually Not the ""GOAT"" I would argue that this reputation, as the ""GOAT,"" is undeserved, unwarranted, overrated, and certainly no help to the modern-day investor looking to become as successful as him or replicate him in some way. Sure, Warren Buffett did some amazing things in his youth that led to Berkshire Hathaway's massive growth in early years, during a period where value outperformed growth, a period where conditions were just right for Warren's strategies to thrive... He may have been the ""greatest"" of his time, in the early days of Berkshire Hathaway, but all time? He has failed at adapting to new realities as growth, technology, innovation, social media, cryptocurrencies, and artificial intelligence have become major themes in today's world. His investing methods seem like they are stuck in the past, afraid of new ideas, change, technology, growth, and innovation. His approach has become, in my opinion, so narrow-minded that he's incapable of thinking outside the box and entertaining nontraditional ideas. However, we can certainly learn from Warren's mistakes, study what he did wrong, and become more prepared to invest in the future, using methods that Warren Buffett would never touch and developing a deeper imagination and thought process of what achievements are possible going forward. Berkshire Hathaway Versus the S&P 500: A Changing Dynamic Berkshire Hathaway had outperformed the S&P 500 over every 5-year period for many years, until 2008-2013 came along, where it underperformed for the first time. In Berkshire's 2013 annual shareholder letter , he wrote, ""Over the stock market cycle between year-ends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S&P. Through full cycles in future years, we expect to do that again. If we fail to do so, we will not have earned our pay."" So he was stretching the goalpost from 5 years to 6 to define (or redefine) what constitutes a 'full market cycle.' But his prediction/expectation that Berkshire would (perhaps consistently) outperform the S&P 500 over full-market cycles didn't really pan out the way he suggested in that letter. Over the past 17 years (2008-2025), the S&P 500 outperformed Berkshire Hathaway by a margin of 554.84% to 445.77% (when accounting for reinvested dividends). Granted, in his 2015 annual shareholder letter, Warren Buffett did clarify that, due to Berkshire Hathaway's immense size, ""I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won't be great,""... So he admitted there wouldn't be significant outperformance (like in Berkshire Hathaway's early years) but still seemed to imply there would be mild outperformance. I don't think that mild outperformance really ever came to fruition, although it depends on which time period you're looking at, as Berkshire Hathaway did outperform the S&P 500 over the past five years, but not the past three, ten, or seventeen. What we learned about Berkshire Hathaway's expected future performance going forward: We can say that this mild outperformance over the S&P 500 may happen over some periods but is no longer happening consistently and reliably, as it did before 2013. And periods of underperformance may last a long time, such as ten to seventeen years, or even longer, especially in a growth environment. The ""Greatest (Investor) of All Time"" Told Us to ""Stay Away"" From the Greatest Investment of All Time A $1 investment in Bitcoin ( BTC ), ( IBIT ), or ( FBTC ) in 2010 would have grown to over $1.62 million in 2025. While exact estimates vary, sources indicate that Bitcoin's return since its inception in 2009 to the present day represents millions of percentage gains, with some sources citing over 9 million percent or even 162 million percent returns from its earliest days. (Bitcoin generated a higher return than Berkshire Hathaway's 5 million percent gain (which took 60 years) in about one-fourth of the time or less). The fact is, Bitcoin has outperformed every asset or stock in history, including Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Amazon, Google, and Berkshire Hathaway, since its inception in 2009. It's a numerical fact. Bitcoin first delivered a 100x return within a few months in 2011. (before it was very well-known). After gaining widespread media attention for the first time around 2013 at $100/coin, it delivered another 100x return within four years, to $10,000/coin in 2017. So this took about four years (2013-2017). By contrast, it took Berkshire Hathaway somewhere around two decades (after Buffett took over in 1965) to deliver its first 100x return, from $19 to $1900. Warren Buffett made his first of many anti-Bitcoin comments in an interview on CNBC in March 2014, when it was trading around $600 at the time, telling investors to ""stay away"" from Bitcoin, calling it a ""mirage."" (After this interview, Bitcoin did go down to the $200 range for a little while in 2015, but this correction proved to be quite temporary, as it came back stronger and soared to new heights in 2017). In 2018, Warren Buffett said , ""In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending."" While Bitcoin did have a lot of volatility along the way, I don't think such a ""bad ending"" really ever materialized, considering that Bitcoin is trading much higher today than when Warren Buffett made this statement and has gained a lot of mainstream acceptance (such as the creation of spot ETFs and the U.S. creating a Strategic Bitcoin reserve). I believe Warren's failure to identify this opportunity and telling investors to ""stay away"" from it is a big stain on his legacy and reflects an old mind stuck in the past, unwilling and unable to think outside the box and adapt to a new reality. The numbers speak for themselves; Bitcoin's 16-year return exceeded Berkshire Hathaway's 60-year return. The lesson here: When you see a new, untested idea, you should try to imagine and entertain the possibilities for it, even if such a reality might seem crazy, silly, and far-fetched at first glance. Bitcoin is not a ""mirage,"" and it's not something to ""stay away from."" It's a fast-growing and increasingly mainstream part of our modern world's economy, widely seen as a digital version of gold , with characteristics like scarcity, decentralization, durability, fungibility, divisibility, portability, a store of value, and maybe, to some extent, a currency. (Although I'm not big on using the term 'currency,' as its ability to grow isn't totally dependent on being accepted as payment with mainstream retailers.) It's also widely seen as "" The People's Money, "" or money that is resistant to government control. Bitcoin deserves a place in every diversified portfolio. A Presidential Bet While I don't normally write about politics on this platform, I would like to discuss a time when Warren Buffett spoke about a big political event and demonstrated that he refuses to entertain nontraditional ideas. Warren Buffett never made public predictions about political election outcomes before...until that changed one day: In October 2014, Warren Buffett was a featured guest speaker at Fortune's Most Powerful Women summit, and he said he would ""bet money"" on Hillary Clinton winning the 2016 presidential election (before she even announced her candidacy). He added, ""I will bet money, and I don't do that easily."" He repeated this prediction a few times throughout the election campaign season (at one point hedging a little, saying she will win as long as she stays healthy), and he turned out to be wrong. She was healthy, she was not under criminal indictment, she was on the ballot as expected, and she lost the electoral college by a vote of the people. While it's unknown if Warren Buffett really did bet any money on this, he may have influenced his fans and followers to do so. These ' prediction markets ' do trade like a stock. Hillary Clinton was the establishment candidate, and Donald Trump was certainly a nontraditional candidate. The fact that Warren Buffett was unable to entertain the possibility of a nontraditional candidate winning, in my opinion, shows that Buffett's philosophy was very narrow-minded, unable to think outside the box and imagine a different reality...similar to how Warren has been known to avoid investing in disruptive and revolutionary technology among his stock picks within Berkshire Hathaway. The Lesson: From this presidential bet, we should learn to imagine the possibilities of strange things coming true. We should not be stuck in the mindset that the traditional and 'normal' events will transpire the way we expect. Instead, we should be prepared for nontraditional, exotic, crazy, strange, and chaotic events to become reality and react accordingly. We should expect a 'truth is stranger than fiction' kind of world, because strange things have already happened that may not have previously seemed possible. That goes for stocks, politics, technological developments, and personal goals in daily life. Although we should still balance this type of thinking with realistic expectations, I believe that the level of what should be considered 'realistic' has expanded into a broader universe. Late to the Party on World-Changing Technology Granted, I will give Buffett credit for investing in Apple ( AAPL ) in 2016 and Google/Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) in 2025, but his followers and investors should be very disappointed that he waited so long to do so. Apple did go up about 10x since 2016, but if he bought around 2006 or 2007, he could've been looking at a 100x return. In 2012, Buffett flat-out said he wouldn't buy Apple or Google. He was more interested in IBM ( IBM ), his first major technology investment, which he bought in 2011, which didn't perform very well around that time and lost a lot of value from 2012 to 2015 before he eventually sold it in 2017 and 2018. Buffett actually did learn something from his IBM mistake. He bought it because he thought it would be difficult for large corporations to switch from IBM for their critical IT needs, creating a possible moat around their business. However, he learned to focus less on 'stable but stagnant' enterprise tech and more on disruptive, consumer-centric technology with powerful branding. He finally realized that enduring moats in tech come from an ecosystem lock-in and brand loyalty rather than just enterprise necessity. It was his mistake at IBM that may have contributed to him investing in Apple later on in 2016. While it's nice to see he finally came around to buying Apple and (later on) Google, this falls under the category of 'better late than never.' Especially considering that in 2015, Google morphed into Alphabet , a conglomerate of sorts, taking a page out of Berkshire Hathaway's playbook, structured to maximize good allocation and reinvestment of capital and foster transparency of income streams and operational costs, not too dissimilar from Berkshire Hathaway's structure. You'd think Warren Buffett could've appreciated that and taken a hint from it. Utilizing a conglomerate structure is what contributed to Berkshire Hathaway's success, as it created benefits such as diversification, decentralized management, and a powerful system for appropriate capital allocation in financing. Not many companies have replicated Berkshire Hathaway's success using this model, although Google's decision to use this model and apply it to a very different type of company should've definitely caught Warren's attention. Around 2017, Warren Buffett even admitted that he made a mistake by missing out on Google and Amazon ( AMZN ), and similar comments were echoed by Berkshire's Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, in 2019 (more so focused on Google than Amazon). Yet even after admitting that, they still waited until 2025 to buy stock in Google/Alphabet. That seems very slow and sluggish on their part. From the date Warren Buffett first admitted he made a mistake missing out on Google (May 8, 2017) to the date Berkshire finally bought Alphabet stock in Q3 2025, Alphabet returned about 300% to the S&P 500's 200%. The Lesson: Have some appreciation for new technology and its capabilities, even if you don't fully understand them at first glance. Realize that the power of an ecosystem with strong brand loyalty is very mighty, a true moat, and it's not enough of a moat just for your technology to be 'necessary' or hard to switch away from. It's also important to pay attention to fast-changing events and capitalize on them by acting early. And when a company transforms into a conglomerate, study the benefits of why such a structure would be good for that company. And when you admit you made a mistake by missing out, act quickly to correct that mistake rather than waiting. Resistant to innovation and missing out on modern trends Berkshire Hathaway also missed out on some of the other, most revolutionary technology companies that changed our world and reflect new trends, such as NVIDIA ( NVDA ), Facebook/Meta ( META ), Netflix ( NFLX ), and Tesla ( TSLA ). It's as if Berkshire is afraid to go near innovative companies that change the way we do things, challenge tradition, break mainstream norms, and reflect new trends in human behavior. Lesson: Have some appreciation for new and different kinds of innovative, scalable companies that may represent a significant part of a modern, dynamic economy. Don't be afraid to get educated and learn more about a new or strange idea, and keep up with modern trends and changes in daily human lives. Underperforming Blue Chips Warren Buffett's investments (through Berkshire Hathaway) have usually focused around large, mega-cap blue chips that were very mature companies but lacked the growth and momentum necessary to outperform the S&P 500. Wells Fargo ( WFC ) was once Berkshire's #1 holding in its stock portfolio, surpassing Coca-Cola ( KO ) for the spot in Q4 2012. Both Wells Fargo and Coca-Cola significantly underperformed the S&P 500 for many years while being a large part of Berkshire's stock investments. In 2013, Warren Buffett purchased stock in Exxon Mobil ( XOM ), only to sell it in Q4 2014 after a period of underperformance. Warren also invested in Kraft Heinz ( KHC ), which has been underperforming over the past decade. Warren made his first major technology investment in 2011 when he bought IBM, but this was the wrong kind of technology. IBM underperformed because it failed to adapt to the rapid shift in cloud computing, unable to keep up with competitors, leading to a decline in revenues and stalled earnings. Lesson: Avoid companies that fail to change and adapt quickly and have a slowing rate of growth. It's okay to invest in 'mature' companies if they know how to adapt, build strong ecosystems with impressive brand loyalty, and are showing strong revenue growth. It's time to realize we're no longer living in a value-oriented world. Great returns are achieved through growth and technology stocks. Airline Fumble - Twice Warren Buffett decided to invest in the airlines twice. In 1989 and 2016. Neither time went well. After losing so much money on his 1989 investment in USAir, he sold in 1994 and confessed in his shareholder letter that he made a mistake in buying the airlines. You'd think he would not fall for this same trap again, but he did in 2016. His changing view around 2016 was likely a result of the airline industry consolidating, with less competition. This consolidation actually began around 2013 , as CNBC host Jim Cramer famously turned bullish on the airlines for the first time in over a decade due to the unprecedented situation. In 2013, Warren Buffett didn't flinch at first; he still called the airlines a "" death trap ."" However, in 2016, Warren Buffett changed his views on this and invested in the four major airlines: American Airlines ( AAL ), Delta Air Lines ( DAL ), Southwest Airlines ( LUV ), and United Airlines (UAL). The airline stocks actually performed well in 2013 as Cramer started recommending them in the early innings of the industry transformation...but this momentum didn't last into the following years. In 2020, the airlines crashed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Warren Buffett then sold his stake in the airlines at a huge loss and admitted that the airlines have all the ingredients of a bad business. It wasn't just the legacy airlines that lost tremendous value, but smaller, more disruptive airlines as well, such as Spirit Airlines ( SAVEQ ), JetBlue ( JBLU ), and Alaska Air Group ( ALK ). None of the airlines were spared. Warren Buffett's long-time friend , Microsoft ( MSFT ) Founder and former Chairman, Bill Gates, famously gave a ' Ted Talk ' in 2015, warning that a global pandemic could happen some day. Warren should've understood the risks of that when investing in the airlines. I would think that the ""greatest of all time"" should've had a better handle on this: being able to learn from past mistakes, not investing in the wrong kind of business, being able to listen to Bill Gates' perspective on this, and being able to better identify the dangers of what might happen in a changing traveling economy. He should've understood that airlines really do make a lousy business because they have high fixed and variable costs and vulnerability to exogenous events. There's also a perception that the airlines have poor service, cramped seating, and inconvenient schedules, which makes it difficult for airlines to raise prices to a level that would be necessary to return to profitability. Warren should've been aware of this. Making the same mistake with the airlines not once, but twice, was certainly not very diligent. Learning and adapting from past mistakes is essential to a solid investing plan and philosophy. The Lesson: Pay attention to how flawed a certain business like the airlines can be, gather a better understanding of the risks of something you invest in, and pay attention to possible catastrophe scenarios (like a pandemic) that could change the fundamentals of a business very quickly. If something goes wrong the first time, don't repeat the same mistakes again. And for heaven's sake, never invest in the airlines, regardless of how few competitors there are in the space. An oligopoly cannot fix a flawed business or a flawed industry. A True and Genuine ""GOAT"" Wouldn't Have Made These Errors I do not believe Warren Buffett earned his reputation as ""the greatest of all time."" I know many of you are likely to respond, ""He's not perfect."" Well, I'm not asking for perfection, but I still think he let us down in ways that were beneath the honor and reputation of the ""GOAT"" title and unbecoming of that title, given the nature of these mistakes and how these mistakes demonstrated a tendency to think inside a closed box rather than thinking outside the box. I know these aren't the only mistakes he made, and I could probably write a much longer article covering more of them, but I'm not trying to write a laundry list of errors. Rather, I am documenting the mistakes I believe to be the most significant, unreasonable, and perhaps mistakes we can learn valuable lessons from in teachable moments. A True and Genuine ""GOAT"" Should Help You Do More Than Just Keep Up With the Averages Granted, I appreciate that Warren sometimes gives decent basic advice to average investors, like investing in a Vanguard S&P 500 index fund ( VOO ). (and that actually is good advice)... But the ""greatest of all time,"" if that title is legit, should be able to provide investors with advice that will help them outperform the S&P 500 and beat the averages. We Can Change What It Means to Be the ""GOAT"" While I am disappointed in the ways Mr. Buffett has let us down, and the investing community's unbelievable willingness to forgive, look past, and continue calling him the ""GOAT"" after all the fumbles and mistakes he made, I do think we can learn something from Warren Buffett's life and career: that we should not follow his lead and instead be open-minded to innovation, technology, and nontraditional ideas. Think outside the box and imagine new possibilities. I agree with Warren Buffett that VOO should be a part of every diversified portfolio. I also believe Bitcoin should be included in every diversified portfolio; that's something Warren will never advise you to do. But it's time to quit listening to Mr. Buffett and use some more modern and innovative logic in our investing decisions to reflect changing trends today. Summary A sensible investor should never follow any ""guru"" into any position. Blindly copying or coat-tailing others will make you vulnerable to making errors. Within reason, expand your ability and willingness to take absurd, wild, and ridiculous ideas and memes seriously, and don't laugh them off. Crazy ideas start off as jokes...until they aren't. People laugh at them until they don't. Many investors failed to take Bitcoin seriously. Many pundits failed to take a Trump victory seriously. A 'truth is stranger than fiction' scenario occurred, and now these 'jokes' aren't so funny anymore. Granted, expanding your ability to take wild ideas seriously does come with significant risk; you could lose up to 100% of your investment. I wouldn't advise risking a large portion of your portfolio on something 'silly,' but keep in mind that, if an investment grows 1000x, as Bitcoin did from 2012 to 2017, it would only take about a $1,000 investment to grow into $1 million. So in that context, perhaps it's possible to make an enormous amount of profit while only risking a small portion of your portfolio. Warren Buffett once said , ""Never invest in something you don't understand,"" leading him to miss out on many disruptive, revolutionary, and innovative technology investments. But the lesson here is if you don't understand something, you should make a stronger effort to educate yourself about it and have a broader imagination of what's possible to achieve. Historically, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by an average of 4.4% annually since 1927. It's easy to say we should follow history, but history reflects a time when technology was a much smaller part of our economy. Today, technology and artificial intelligence are much bigger contributors. It's time to have a growth-oriented and tech-oriented strategy to deliver outperformance. When a business as fundamentally flawed as the airlines may change in a way where it becomes less competitive in nature, don't fall for it. Some flawed industries are destined to remain flawed forever, and an oligopoly or monopoly-type situation can only do so much to change that. If you have developed a successful track record, and you have a large following of fans who trust your words and listen to your wisdom, you don't have to opine on everything. If you are asked about a topic you're unsure about, sometimes staying quiet or neutral, not opining on such a topic, is the best and most appropriate course of action. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to study and learn about the topic to gain a better understanding of it.",AAPL|GOOG|GOOGL|VOO|IBIT|DAL|LUV|UAL|FBTC|AAL|BRK.A|BRK.B|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-11 07:50:55

The post centers on Birla’s view that XRP was designed primarily for real-time, regulated payments rather than for speculative investment narratives or congestion-prone smart contract ecosystems. According to the account, Birla emphasized a clear distinction between assets built to support institutional-grade financial infrastructure and those oriented toward store-of-value themes or experimental application layers. The remarks were delivered during an appearance on Paul Barron’s show, where Birla discussed his familiarity with XRP and its role in earlier products he helped develop. He presented XRP as a foundational component in systems designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments, describing it as technology created with practical financial use cases in mind from the outset. Evernorth CEO Asheesh Birla: #XRP is built for real-time regulated payments, not just investment narratives like BTC, and not congestion-heavy smart contract ecosystems like ETH. pic.twitter.com/SUvTqMsPr1 — Skipper | XRPL (@skipper_xrp) January 8, 2026 Early Design Choices and Institutional Utility Birla explained that XRP’s original architecture reflected a payments-first mindset. He referenced its transaction speed and its suitability for settlement use, noting that these characteristics were not later additions but core design goals. He also pointed to the early inclusion of a built-in decentralized exchange mechanism, describing it as a liquidity engine that anticipated real-world financial requirements well before similar features became common elsewhere in the digital asset sector. In his view, these design decisions, dating back more than a decade, positioned XRP to support institutional-grade products rather than experimental or consumer-focused applications. He suggested that many newer projects now attempt to replicate elements that were already present in XRP’s early development, particularly those related to liquidity and efficient value transfer. Regulation and the Global Payments Market A central theme highlighted in Skipper’s post was Birla’s emphasis on regulation. He argued that succeeding in global foreign exchange and payments markets requires more than a standalone digital asset. Instead, it demands infrastructure that can operate within existing regulatory frameworks while delivering speed and reliability at scale. Birla indicated that regulatory clarity surrounding XRP played a significant role in his assessment of its suitability for enterprise use, presenting it as a practical choice rather than a speculative one. According to his comments, this regulatory alignment reduces uncertainty for institutions seeking to integrate blockchain-based solutions into compliant financial products. He framed this clarity as a decisive factor when evaluating which technologies can realistically support global payment flows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Deliberate Focus on Financial Transformation Birla also contrasted his priorities with other areas of the digital asset market. While acknowledging the broad range of use cases across the sector, from highly speculative tokens to entertainment-driven applications, he made it clear that his interest lies in initiatives aimed at improving the financial system itself. His stated focus remains on building tools that address real inefficiencies in payments and foreign exchange rather than engaging with short-term trading trends. Overall, the post portrays Birla’s perspective as one grounded in long-term infrastructure development. By emphasizing XRP’s original design goals, institutional orientation, and regulatory positioning, the commentary reinforces the view that its primary role is tied to real-world financial utility rather than investment-driven narratives.

The exchange predicted that 2026 will be a significant year in the crypto industry, with expansion in stablecoins, altcoins, and Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Mercado Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency exchange platform in Latin America, has published a report outlining potential growth trends in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The report highlighted six major trends that are expected to shape the cryptocurrency market this year. Mercado Bitcoin projects significant growth in the crypto industry this year The São Paulo-based cryptocurrency exchange highlighted that significant developments in the crypto industry will occur in stablecoins, ETFs, Altcoins, AI-powered trading activities, and tokenization. According to the report, the exchange anticipates substantial growth for Bitcoin in 2026. It highlighted that BTC’s market capitalization will more than double by the end of 2026, to meet 14% of gold’s total market capitalization. The prediction was derived from a valuation methodology developed in collaboration with researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The report noted that the valuation model capitalizes on the Total Addressable Market (TAM) approach, among other methods, to estimate Bitcoin’s theoretical value, using gold as the primary benchmark instead of relying on traditional cash flow models. According to the report , Bitcoin is primarily viewed as a store of value, similar to gold. However, the digital asset has more advantages compared to gold, which faces logistical challenges and storage hurdles. The report identified a growing trend among institutions that now view Bitcoin as a better store of value compared to gold, due to its characteristics as a borderless and self-custodial asset. Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. alone have $116.86 billion in net assets under management, equivalent to 6.48% of the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization. The report also outlined significant growth in the stablecoin infrastructure. The exchange predicted that the market capitalization of this sector will reach $500 billion by the end of the year. According to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, stablecoins have a combined market capitalization of $311.674 billion as of the time of this publication. The Brazilian exchange emphasized that stablecoins play a crucial role as a source of liquidity for the sector, evolving from trading tools into payment instruments across countries and sectors. The exchange cited the stablecoin growth in 2025, which increased nearly 50% year-over-year. The report attributed the growth to regulatory developments that have provided clarity to stablecoin issuance and usage. Cryptopolitan reported in June last year that the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act, which became the first-ever U.S. law to regulate stablecoin issuers. XRP and Solana ETFs will account for 80% of inflows in Altcoin ETFs MB projected that Altcoin ETFs will stand out in 2026. The exchange flagged altcoin funds tied to XRP, Chainlink, and Solana as top ETF altcoins that have been attracting institutional capital since their debut. Data from SosoValue, an ETF tracking website, shows that XRP ETFs now have $1.47 billion in net assets under management, which is equivalent to 1.16% of the total XRP market cap. The data also shows that these funds have witnessed consistent inflows since November 14 and have only witnessed negative flows on January 7. Solana ETFs also crossed the $1 billion mark in net assets under management and now hold 1.43% of SOL’s total market cap. The exchange’s report estimates that altcoin ETFs will grow to $10 billion by the end of the year and projects that Solana and XRP will account for 80% of the total inflows. The exchange’s report identified tokenization of real-world assets as a significant sector and estimated its growth will surpass $54 billion, increasing by 200%. MB researchers believe the sector has attracted institutional interest, with major firms such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton launching their own tokenized funds. In the report, MB also projected that the prediction market will expand by more than 25X, with platforms such as Kalshi and Polymarket leading the pack. The forecast indicates that capital influx in these markets may reach $20 billion by year-end. MB also expects blockchain-powered AI agents to make significant contributions to the development of crypto ecosystems. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

Key Takeaways: Tennessee ordered Kalshi, Polymarket and Crypto.com to halt sports-related contracts and issue refunds by Jan. 31, 2026. Regulators allege the platforms are offering unlicensed sports wagering in violation of state law. Failure to comply could result in steep fines and potential criminal referrals. In cease-and-desist letters filed on January 9 , the Tennessee Sports Wagering Council (SWC) directed the three companies to immediately halt sports event contracts offered to Tennessee customers, void all existing contracts entered into by state residents, and refund all customer funds by January 31, 2026. Tennessee Regulator Accuses Prediction Markets of Unlicensed Sports Wagering The regulator accused the platforms of operating unlicensed sports wagering products in violation of the Tennessee Sports Gaming Act. In a letter addressed to Polymarket, SWC Executive Director Mary Beth Thomas wrote that the company’s sports event contracts fail to meet state consumer protection standards and pose “an immediate and significant threat to the public interest of Tennessee.” Nearly identical language appeared in the letters sent to Kalshi and Crypto.com’s North American Derivatives Exchange. All three platforms are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as designated contract markets, allowing them to list event-based derivatives nationwide. The companies have argued that federal oversight preempts state gambling laws, though courts have issued mixed rulings on where federal authority ends and state jurisdiction begins. C&D to Polymarket: pic.twitter.com/OuinQf8AD4 — Daniel Wallach (@WALLACHLEGAL) January 9, 2026 The enforcement action comes as activity on prediction markets continues to expand. Polymarket re-entered the US market last year following its $112 million acquisition of derivatives exchange and clearinghouse QCX and began opening its US app to waitlisted users in December. The Tennessee action appears to be the first publicly disclosed state-level cease-and-desist order specifically targeting Polymarket, which currently offers only sports-related contracts to US users. Tennessee’s letters outline escalating penalties for noncompliance, including civil fines of up to $25,000 per violation. More significantly, the regulator warned that continued violations could trigger criminal referrals. Under Tennessee law, gambling promotion can carry misdemeanor or felony charges, depending on severity. State Opposition to Prediction Markets Builds Over Consumer, Tax Concerns State opposition to prediction markets has been building for months. In 2025, the SWC urged the CFTC to prohibit sports event contracts, arguing that such products bypass state safeguards such as age verification, responsible gaming rules and anti-money laundering requirements. Tennessee officials have also warned that prediction markets threaten tax revenue generated by licensed sportsbooks. The letters were copied to Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, who has backed other states in legal challenges against Kalshi. As reported, a new legislation to limit the interactions between government officials and the prediction markets is being supported by more than 30 Democrats in the US House of Representatives, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The lure behind new restrictions is a controversial Polymarket bet, which started as a bet of $32,000 but eventually became more than $400,000 shortly before the unexpected detention of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The bill proposed by the New York Representative Ritchie Torres is the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026.

The North American Derivatives Exchange of Crypto.com, Polymarket, and Kalshi received letters dated January 9 from the Tennessee Sports Wagering Council. The letters demanded that the companies, which operate under federal CFTC supervision, must cease operations in Tennessee, nullify open contracts, and return user deposits by January 31st. The Tennessee letters demanded that failure to comply may result in criminal referrals for aggravated gambling promotion, a felony under state law, as well as civil penalties of up to $25,000 per infraction. Tennessee threatened a variety of sanctions for failure to comply. The Tennessee Sports Gaming Act allows the SWC to sanction anybody who offers wagers without a state license $10,000 for the first crime, $15,000 for the second, and $25,000 for successive infractions. Additionally, the regulator threatened to file a request in state court for injunctive action. Tennessee challenges CFTC-regulated platforms over unlicensed sports contracts If it's Friday, it must be Tennessee issing cease-and-desist orders against @Kalshi , @Polymarket and @cryptocom https://t.co/rmUzOhoTE8 — Bill Speros (@billsperos) January 10, 2026 The Tennessee Sports Wagering Council (SWC) accused all three companies of unlawfully selling sports wagering goods under the pretense of event contracts. The companies are currently registered as designated contract markets with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), allowing consumers to purchase contracts based on the results of sporting events. However, any organization that takes bets on athletic events is required to have a state-issued license under Tennessee’s Sports Gaming Act. The SWC said none of the three firms has one. Accordingly, the letters declare that the contracts offered for sporting events constitute wagers under the Act and are being sold illegally in violation of Tennessee law and regulations. In the letter to Polymarket, SWC Executive Director Mary Beth Thomas stated, “The sports event contracts offered on Polymarket’s exchange are not compliant with these Tennessee state consumer protections and many others and are an immediate and significant threat to the public interest of Tennessee.” The language used in the letters to Crypto.com and Kalshi was almost identical. Market activity on Kalshi and Polymarket continues to rise, despite the persistence of legal disputes. Polymarket reentered the U.S. market after acquiring derivatives exchange and clearinghouse QCX for $112 million during the summer. In December, it started making its U.S. app available to waitlisted users, though the firm hasn’t made a public relaunch. States intensify crackdown on prediction markets despite federal oversight States have frequently pursued these platforms, even though they operate lawfully under federal derivatives legislation. In December of last year, Cryptopolitan reported that Connecticut issued three cease-and-desist orders against Crypto.com, Kalshi, and Robinhood. The Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli ordered the platforms to immediately cease advertising, marketing, offering, or otherwise making available contracts or any other type of unauthorized online gaming to Connecticut citizens. Cafferelli accused Kalshi, Crypto.com, and Robinhood of conducting unlicensed online gambling, more specifically, sports wagering. Cafferelli claimed that even if they were licensed, their contracts would violate several other state rules and regulations, including those that prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from gambling. “These platforms are operating outside of a regulatory environment, posing a serious risk to consumers who may not realize that wagers placed on these illegal platforms offer no protection for their money or information. A prediction market wager is not an investment.” – Kris Gilman , Gaming Director, DCP. In another Cryptopolitan report, Kalshi encountered similar enforcement actions in other states last year, including Arizona, Illinois, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio. On April 3, Illinois casino authorities ordered Kalshi to stop offering sports betting prediction markets. Kalshi’s contracts, according to Illinois casino officials, amount to unlawful sports betting under state law. Arizona’s gambling authority joined the state-by-state campaign against prediction markets on May 22 in response to the event contracts of Kalshi and others for sports and other markets.

Spokane Police Detective Tim Schwering has been dealing with this since 2023.“Cases started flowing my way where people were getting ripped off by cryptocurrency machines,” Tim said. The money was always gone in minutes, and would allegedly end up in China, Russia, Nigeria, or some other country where no one could get it back. “You couldn’t get to anyone or get the money back,” he said. He watched people’s entire savings disappear. Scams hit hard in local communities, seniors targeted first Tim said one man lost $900,000 using a crypto ATM down the street. At least two others lost everything and then ended their lives. Most of them were older, lonely, or scared. Scammers pretended to be lovers, government agents, or even IRS officers. They’d say someone was in trouble. Then they’d say the only way out was to deposit money ($40,000, maybe more) into a crypto ATM . That was it. When Tim saw how bad it was getting, he started visiting nursing homes and local community centers. He’d explain how these scams work and try to stop people from falling for them. “My job is to try to protect people, and it’s very frustrating,” he said. The scammers were always far away. “So, we could at least change policy,” he added. Spokane Councilman Paul Dillon picked it up from there. He tried for a state ban first. That didn’t go anywhere. “We wanted to see what levers we could pull locally,” Paul said. He pushed for a city-wide ban. “The compelling stories moved us into action,” he said. The council didn’t even argue. They passed it unanimously. The rule kicked in back in June, and shops were given a little time to get rid of the machines. Crypto ATM bans expand beyond Spokane as fraud spreads Spokane wasn’t the first. Stillwater, Minnesota had already passed a similar law. Paul said, “We’ve received no complaints about the removal.” Now he wants the state to try again next session, before the machines just start showing up in nearby towns. Tim says a federal ban would be better, but Paul doesn’t think that’ll happen anytime soon under President Trump’s current crypto policies. Spokane’s too close to Idaho anyway, just a 20-minute drive away. As long as states don’t act together, scammers can just move across borders. Meanwhile, other places like Arizona, Arkansas, Vermont, and St. Paul are looking at bans or tighter rules. And yes, a CNN report confirmed crypto ATMs are still popping up in Circle K stores across the U.S. Some crypto people aren’t happy. Alex Davis, who runs a blockchain company called Mavryk, says removing the machines won’t stop fraud. “Eliminating them may reduce certain fraud vectors, but it also removes one of the last public-access tools for financial privacy and cash-to-crypto conversion,” he said. Alex added that crypto ATMs still exist because regular banks don’t work for everyone. A lot of folks still use cash or have no bank access at all. Sure transaction fees are sky-high at 10 percent or more, but that’s the price they pay for fast, private access, said Alex. Jared Strasser, who helps run The Crypto Company, said these machines mostly serve a small group now. He said they used to be one of the only ways into crypto back in the day. That’s changed, but some people still need them. “That doesn’t eliminate the use case for others,” Jared said, “but it explains why these machines serve a narrower, more transactional audience.” They’re also perfect for scammers, because the money moves fast and can’t be undone. Lawyers say crypto ATMs in America a bigger banking problem Lev Breydo, a law professor at William & Mary, thinks the machines point to a deeper mess. “BTMs reflect the intersection of folks locked out of the mechanics of the financial system,” Lev said. He’s not wrong. People who don’t trust banks or can’t use them go to crypto. The U.S. is one of the few countries that let crypto ATMs thrive legally. 80 percent of all crypto ATMs on the planet are in America. That’s not because of innovation. That’s because the system’s broken. Lev said the U.S. let these machines plug into payday lenders, check-cashing shops, and money transmitters. They were never really integrated into banking, just bolted onto whatever was already there, which is why they’re everywhere. Jared said all bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. have to follow KYC and AML rules, checking who’s using them and report anything shady under the Bank Secrecy Act. But of course scammers still find ways in. Back in Spokane, Tim isn’t done. He still checks for crypto ATMs in local businesses. If he finds one, they get a citation. He said some victims still refuse to believe it’s a scam. One woman kept sending money to a man she thought loved her, even after her family begged her to stop. Tim traced it all to Nigeria. A year later, she had sent him $250,000. “Some people will continue throwing good money after bad,” he said. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The criminal, identified as Tianze Zhang, was arrested in Taiwan after attempting to flee the country by boat to the Philippines. According to authorities, the incident began on March 16, 2022, after a masked man broke into the home of Yuchen Shi while she was alone. The man was welding a knife, covering his face with a balaclava, ski goggles, and blue surgical gloves, threatening to harm her if she made a sound or alerted authorities. The criminal forced her to sit on a chair, zip-tied her to the chair, and issued more threats. He didn’t want cash or jewelry; instead, he wanted her to give up her digital assets . Taiwanese police arrest suspect linked to home invasion Throughout the ordeal, the masked man did not speak to his victim, but instead relied on an iPad, typing his demands in it and holding it up for Shi to read and comply. She eventually conceded to his request, logging into her wallet, and moving $3 million in digital assets into a wallet that belonged to the suspected criminal. After the transfer was complete, Shi mentioned that the man grabbed her phone and disappeared. The San Francisco police were alerted after the ordeal, with the department sending an inspector to the house. What started as a small home invasion soon ballooned into an international manhunt involving the SFPD’s burglary and CSI units as well as its federal liaison officers, private investigators, crypto analysts, the FBI, Interpol, and the Taiwanese authorities. It was the first high-profile “wrench attacks” in the country, and they wanted to see it to the end. Wrench attacks have been on the rise since the beginning of last year, with several incidents occurring across major cities around the world. It is a crime where attackers rely on physical intimidation or attacks to steal digital assets from their owners. In November 2025, San Francisco experienced another attack similar to the one that happened to Shi. A man posing as a delivery guy rang the doorbell, pulled a gun on the resident, and stole $11 million in digital assets. Police shed light on the incident In Shi’s case, newly obtained police documents shed light on the incident. The files detail how investigations chased the suspect halfway across the world in a pursuit that led to the arrest and repatriation of Tianze Zhang, her former personal assistant, in June 2022. A police report showed that a walk-through of the scene was done with Shi before the police recorded their interview with her. In addition, items used in the crime were also collected and swabbed for DNA. Officers were also able to obtain doorbell camera footage taken earlier that day of the suspect at Shi’s door. The perpetrator was seen wearing a balaclava and ski goggles, but investigators were unable to reveal who was behind the mask. Shi then resorted to telling friends about the robbery and sharing the image of the man at the door. One such person was Zhang, whom she considered her friend. Zhang told her that he was soon heading to Taiwan to work on a film. Shi eventually hired a private investigator, a move that eventually paid off. The investigator, Carlos Jackson, obtained video taken by the neighbor’s security camera, which appeared to have captured someone walking in the area around the time the incident had occurred. Days later, Shi told the police she had identified the man in her neighbor’s video as Zhang. She mentioned that she had met him in 2021 through a friend and paid him in crypto. Police then used cellphone data in the next step of their investigation, with the data placing Zhang near the scene of the crime when it occurred. Police documents showed that his phone pinged near Shi’s home before and on the day of the attack. Shi employed several blockchain security firms that traced how the funds moved from her wallet and ended up in Zhang’s wallet. In addition, Zhang boarded a plane to Taiwan a day after the robbery occurred. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Ethereum Sentiment Matches Pre-Rally Conditions,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/history-rhymes-ethereum-sentiment-matches-pre-rally-conditions/,"Ethereum’s social buzz has cooled to levels some analysts compare with the period before last year’s powerful rebound, but experts say that doesn’t automatically mean another big surge is imminent. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator Sentiment Mirrors Past Lows According to Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan, social media sentiment around Ethereum has slipped and now sits near the low range seen before the 2025 rally. Quinlivan suggested that the decline in chatter “argues against us falling too much further,” and he pointed out that price has often climbed after strong public doubt. On Aug. 23, Ether hit a fresh all-time high of around $4,900, a move that followed a recovery from a yearly low near $1,470 in April, based on CoinGecko data. That rally pushed the token back above its 2021 high. Since then, Ether has retreated about 36% from the peak and was trading at $3,089 at the time of the reports. Market Shock And Liquidity Events Reports have disclosed that a mass liquidation on Oct. 10 triggered close to $20 billion of losses across the crypto market, and that event is linked to the more recent pullback. The liquidation hit many positions and was followed by a broader risk-off mood. Crypto fear gauges have been low. One index posted a Fear score of 29 on Sunday, while the Altcoin Season Index shows a Bitcoin Season score of 34 out of 100 — a reading that points to money flowing into Bitcoin rather than into altcoins over the past 90 days. That mix of metrics is being watched closely by traders who size positions on sentiment shifts. Network Activity And Staking Interest Quinlivan also highlighted on-chain signals he finds positive. According to his view, activity on Ethereum’s network has been rising, and staking has drawn more attention from users. Increasing bandwidth is safer than reducing latency With PeerDAS and ZKPs, we know how to scale, and potentially we can scale thousands of times compared to the status quo. The numbers become far more favorable than before (eg. see analysis here, pre and post-sharding… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 8, 2026 Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin has joined the public conversation about technical upgrades. Buterin said in an extended X post that PeerDAS, which arrived with the Fusaka upgrade, along with zero-knowledge proofs and sharding, will push Ethereum toward much higher throughput. He added that layer-2 networks like Base, Polygon, and Optimism will still be needed because many use cases demand speeds that are even quicker than mainnet. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator Institutional Views And Market Positioning Based on reports, Coinbase Asset Management president Anthony Bassili said in November 2025 that investors tend to view Bitcoin first and Ethereum second when building a core portfolio. That stance reflects how many large investors now treat Ether as the default number-two market cap asset rather than as a fringe bet. With that status, downside expectations can be smaller than for riskier tokens. Still, sentiment can remain low for long stretches, and being ranked highly does not remove volatility.

The Rails Are Being Built,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-zoom-out-the-rails-are-being-built/,"A recent post by crypto commentator X Finance Bull has brought attention to a development that may carry long-term significance for the XRP Ledger. Rather than focusing on price movements or promotional announcements, the commentary highlights a reported collaboration between Evernorth and Doppler Finance that centers on institutional-grade infrastructure. The emphasis is placed on foundational systems rather than public-facing initiatives, suggesting that the activity underway is intended to support future large-scale financial use rather than immediate visibility. BOOM! Evernorth (backed by Ripple + SBI) teams up with Doppler to design institutional liquidity infra on $XRP Ledger This is not marketing.

The rails are being… pic.twitter.com/yU9NtNvB03 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 9, 2026 Details of the Evernorth–Doppler Collaboration According to the information shared, Evernorth, described as an XRP-focused digital asset treasury company backed by Ripple and SBI Holdings , has entered into a strategic relationship with Doppler Finance. Doppler is characterized as an infrastructure provider operating within the XRP Ledger ecosystem , with a focus on institutional use cases. The collaboration is reportedly aimed at designing and piloting liquidity and treasury frameworks suitable for institutional participants on the XRP Ledger. The attached image accompanying the post references a January 8, 2026 announcement outlining the intent to explore institutional liquidity and treasury operations directly on the XRP Ledger. The language used in that announcement emphasizes backend design and pilot programs, reinforcing the view that this effort is concentrated on system architecture rather than marketing initiatives. Focus on Backend Financial Infrastructure X Finance Bull’s commentary underscores that the development should be understood as technical and structural in nature. The assertion is that institutions do not typically publicize internal system transitions in advance. Instead, infrastructure is built, tested, and integrated quietly before any observable change occurs at the operational level. In this context, the Evernorth–Doppler effort is framed as part of preparatory work that could enable banks and other large financial entities to utilize XRP Ledger-based systems without public signaling. This perspective aligns with the notion that institutional adoption often depends on reliable liquidity management, treasury tooling, and on-chain infrastructure that meets operational and compliance standards. The collaboration is therefore directly presented as addressing these requirements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Implications for the XRP Ledger The post further suggests that XRP holders should view this development from a long-term standpoint. Rather than interpreting progress through short-term announcements or retail-focused narratives, the emphasis is placed on the gradual construction of financial rails. The integration of a major XRP treasury company with a core infrastructure provider is portrayed as evidence that institutional pathways are being established. While no timelines or specific institutional users are disclosed, the reported collaboration reinforces the idea that the XRP Ledger continues to be positioned for institutional-grade financial activity . If such infrastructure is successfully deployed, it could support a range of treasury and liquidity operations without requiring public fanfare. Overall, the information shared by X Finance Bull presents the Evernorth–Doppler relationship as a structural development that may only become visible once institutions begin using the systems already put in place.

The decline so far, however, mirrors the period leading up to its 2025 rally, which reclaimed its 2021 highs, according to Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan. Speaking in a video uploaded Saturday to YouTube, he stated, “Ethereum is actually way down, this would argue against us falling too much further. This is kind of reminiscent of what we saw before Ethereum went on its major run last year.” To make matters better, macro-level crypto market data are stabilizing too, with investor pessimism reaching a level historically associated with upward momentum. Social sentiment is said to be a contrarian signal, and similar trends have helped drive major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, to massive rallies in the past. Quinlivan says Ethereum is now recognized as the second top cryptocurrency In late August last year, Ether returned to its 2021 record high of $4,878, marking an almost 70% increase from its low of $1,472 on April 9, according to CoinMarketCap. Quinlivan noted that Ether’s price surged right when many traders were beginning to dismiss the token. Currently, Ether has retreated 36% from its August peak, trading at $3,089, after a $19 billion crypto sell-off on October 10 caused a market-wide downtrend. Despite the significant drop in just a few months, investors aren’t as doubtful about Ethereum’s upside as they were at the start of 2025. He remarked, “I wouldn’t say that is happening now. Ethereum is kind of back to being an expected number two market cap for a lot of people.” Similarly, Coinbase Asset Management president Anthony Bassili also previously told reporters he’s pleased to see Ethereum regain its proper ranking. He explained that there is now a broad consensus among investors that a first portfolio should start with Bitcoin, then include Ethereum. Traders believe Ethereum could surpass $5000 in 2026 Quinlivan remains hopeful, stating that the Ethereum network is expected to grow sharply in the coming months, particularly with an increase in staking demand. It seems he isn’t the only one who’s optimistic — on Kalshi, traders assign a 59% chance that Ethereum will exceed $4,250 in 2026, and 49% believe it could surpass $4,500. Additionally, crypto-focused platform Polymarket is also wagering on prices far above current levels, with over 40% of traders betting Ethereum will hit $5,000 in 2026 and 22% predicting it will exceed $6,000. While prices of $7,500, $8,000, and $10,000 are still considered long shots, traders are still placing bets on them. About 7% of traders are betting on a price over $10,000. The Ethereum Foundation also said at the end of the year that the Ethereum network cemented its role as the secure backbone of our digital civilization, consolidating its fundamentals for 2026. Crypto market sentiment is down to “Fear” levels Overall, the crypto market sentiment is on a downturn, oscillating between “Fear” and “Extreme Fear” since early November. On Sunday, the Index posted 29, indicating “Fear.” Investors nonetheless still prefer Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies, with the Altcoin Season Index scoring BTC sentiment at 34 out of 100. But judging from the 90-day action of the top 100 altcoins versus Bitcoin, the index flipped between “Bitcoin Season” and “Altcoin Season” measures. Early in the year, however, some analysts have already cautioned traders to expect a downturn for Bitcoin. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant , warned that the biggest crypto asset may remain in a consolidation phase through the first quarter of 2026. Investment in Bitcoin, he said, had slowed as investors turned their attention to equities and metals, such as gold and silver. Veteran trader Peter Brandt and Fidelity macro research director Jurrien Timmer also suggested Bitcoin could revisit the $60,000–$65,000 range this year. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin and Ether ETFs saw nearly $750 million in outflows during the first full week of 2026. Bitcoin funds led the decline despite a strong inflow at the start of the week. XRP and Solana ETFs bucked the trend, attracting fresh capital as investors rotated into altcoin funds. At the same time, newer funds tied to XRP and Solana moved in the opposite direction, drawing fresh capital and posting stronger trading activity.

Bitcoin funds accounted for the bulk of the decline, shedding $681 million after four straight days of redemptions. The slide came despite a strong start to the week , when Bitcoin ETFs attracted nearly $700 million in inflows on January 5, the only positive session during the period.

The 12 approved funds now hold roughly $116.9 billion in net assets, equivalent to about 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Since their launch in January 2024, cumulative net inflows still exceed $56 billion. Spot Ether ETFs followed a similar pattern, though on a smaller scale. The group ended the week with $68.6 million in net outflows after strong inflows earlier in the period were reversed by heavy selling over the final three trading days. BlackRock’s ETHA led outflows, followed by Grayscale’s ETHE. The nine Ether ETFs currently manage $18.7 billion in assets, representing just over 5% of Ether’s market value. XRP ETFs Buck Market Pullback With Record Volume and Fresh Inflows While investors trimmed exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies, appetite for altcoin-linked ETFs showed signs of growth. Spot XRP ETFs recorded $38.1 million in net inflows during the week and reached their highest weekly trading volume since launch at $219 million. The surge points to rising institutional engagement as the products gain traction following their debut in late 2025. Canary Capital’s XRPC remains the largest XRP fund by assets, followed closely by offerings from Bitwise and Franklin Templeton. Collectively, XRP ETFs have accumulated more than $1.2 billion in net inflows, with total assets approaching $1.5 billion. Solana ETFs also attracted fresh capital, taking in $41.1 million over the same period. Bitwise’s BSOL continues to dominate the category, holding a commanding lead over rival products as investors selectively rotate into alternative crypto exposures.

XRP Whales Accumulate Early,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-under-0-1-for-q1-2026-xrp-whales-accumulate-early/,"Investors who are looking at the best crypto below $0.1 by the first quarter of 2026 are beginning to forsake older large-cap coins. Most people are keeping an eye on earlier presale initiatives and new crypto protocols at lesser valuations and reduced entrance charges. This has already attracted attention of some XRP whales known to venture into cycles prior to the general market movement. The recent growth has led to their recent accumulation, raising the question whether a new undervalued crypto will soon lead to a similar early growth seen by Ripple (XRP). The project that receives a significant portion of this hype is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto lending protocol whose investor base is constantly increasing and its presale is actively sold. Ripple (XRP) Ripple (XRP) is a somewhat recognized cryptocurrency with its market guiding back and its broad community around the world. The XRP price is now trading at an approximate of $2.10 dollars and has a market capitalization of about $130 billion. The early move saw a great spike in XRP in the past cycles and rewarded numerous early adopters in its initial bull run. This formed the basis of the XRP whale community that is still in existence. There is, however, mixed feeling among analysts as regards to the next crypto cycle of XRP. Others predict a low upside because of legal certainty and growing institutional applications. Some are of the opinion that XRP might not be able to achieve substantial multiplier returns on its present value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new crypto developing decentralized finance lending protocol that is on the verge of its mainnet launch. It presents a dual lending facility which gives credence to Peer to Contract and to Peer to Peer markets. The Peer to Contract model uses shared liquidity pools where users lend to each other and earn APY as the borrowing demand rises, whilst the borrower takes a loan out of the pool of liquidity. Lending and borrowing are also facilitated by the Peer-to-Peer market except that there is no shared pool, lenders and borrowers pair up. Interest rate, type of collateral and terms of repayment are some of the loan terms that can be tailored between the two parties. In order to make the system secure, collateral assures the loan and loan to value regulations. In case of the decrease of the collateral value to levels of safety, there are liquidation events that safeguard lenders and maintain network solvency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its active presale, and it has already created serious demands among the early entrants. The sale is organized in different stages with increasing token prices so that the early purchasers can attain lower starting points prior to release and exchange listings. Tokens have kept selling out phase after phase and this demand has earned MUTM to rise by 300% ($0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.04 in Phase 7) as yet. The presale has already sold over 18,800 holders and raised over $19.7M, with 825M MUTM having been sold out of the presale total. This funding precedes the launch of the V1 protocol, which leaves Mutuum Finance with a large user base and treasury prior to launch. The Reason MUTM Might Take The Early XRP Track Analysts indicate a number of reasons why MUTM will experience a similar path to XRP in the initial stages. The first one is valuation. XRP began as a low valued asset experiencing a large quantity of supply and a defined story. MUTM comes in at a comparable price with a specified application. The second reason is utility. XRP presented an evident role in payments and transfers. MUTM brings the reality of utility in the practice of lending and extending credits. This utility generates protocol demand and not just speculative trading. Utility has been found to be a major determinant of long term performance of the altcoins. The third reason is timing. XRP experienced its initial boom prior to its entry into large exchanges. MUTM is still in the presale and is yet to be launched in open markets. Analysts say that this enables early buyers to position ahead of the price discovery in the launch. Phase 7 Selling Out Fast Recently, MUTM is in Phase 7 of the presale. The tokens in this stage have been selling at a fast rate with few of them left. The rise in demand has been explained by the impending release of the V1 protocol, and the growing awareness of whale wallets and retail investors. The 24 hour leaderboard attests to the new inflows and regular purchasing activity. The security audit by Halborn is another key reason that supports the use of confidence. Halborn is a reputable blockchain security company, which has audited major projects in the sector. In the case of a lending protocol, security is of great significance because of collateral management, liquidation code and pool insurance. The Halborn review indicates that the protocol has been externally verified prior to its launching. This, according to the analysts, is capable of supporting the inflows of liquidity once the protocol has been switched on and users have started embedding money or collateral. As the presale continues to gain momentum, and Phase 7 on its way to a sellout, numerous investors now consider MUTM one of the best cryptos below $0.1 by Q2 2026.

The billionaire revealed plans to introduce a new algorithm that will include the code governing which posts and ads users see, with the launch set for just seven days away. Musk added on X, “This will happen every four weeks, along with detailed developer notes to help you understand what has changed.” xAI set to implement several changes on X The executive’s sudden announcement sparked debates among individuals, prompting reports to reach out to Musk for clarity on this update. However, when asked why he chose to make the algorithm’s implementation open source, he declined to respond. Sources close to the situation, who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the matter, alleged that Musk and his firm have a record of engaging in numerous disagreements with regulators over which content should or should not be displayed to users. This disagreement arose when several X users began to raise complaints, claiming that the social media platform had deprioritized posts from the accounts they followed. Responding to these allegations, Musk noted in October that this issue was a result of a bug discovered in the “For You” algorithm. Afterwards, he declared that the firm would address the issue as soon as possible. Meanwhile, reports emphasized that, apart from xAI , the company behind the social media platform X, which seeks to introduce a new algorithm for X, also aims to integrate more advanced AI capabilities into its platform’s recommendation system. This integration is set to widely utilize Grok, a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by xAI. Notably, this is not the first time Musk has announced updates to X’s algorithms, vowing to make them public. Reports revealed that he had made such pledges earlier but failed to deliver on this implementation. For instance, Musk made a similar pledge in September, but the implementation had lacked consistency, sparking discussion among individuals. To address these debates, the owner of X claimed that they had decided to first focus on integrating the platform’s recommendation engine with advanced AI and would publicly provide access to the source code of its algorithm later. At this time, Musk pledged that they would do so about every two weeks. While users awaited the billionaire to fulfill his promise, Musk released an announcement in October informing them that the alterations they observed in their feeds did not result from the doings of specific individuals who attempted to change the normal operation on the platform, but resulted from the heightened popularity of Grok and other AI tools among people. Following this declaration, Musk noted that xAI intended to assign Grok the role of assessing all the posts shared on X daily. Based on his argument, this move is essential as it would enable Grok to display to users posts that are likely to draw their attention, thereby improving the quality of their feed. The owner of X also told users to expect the implementation of new features by November. However, global regulators disapproved of Grok’s ability to develop images due to the escalation of pictures generated by AI with sexual content on X. Several regulators raise concerns about Musk’s Grok Following global regulators’ accusations against Grok, it released a statement to users on Friday, January 9, demanding a paid subscription to grant full access to image generation and editing tools. Notably, these features were initially freely accessible to users, though they were subjected to daily restrictions. Meanwhile, after a thorough investigation, Indonesian regulators hindered their citizens’ access to Grok. These regulators confirmed the claims on Grok about sexual content to be true. Following this news, Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, released a statement this week urging Musk and his team to take note of this finding and fix the problem as soon as possible. Elizabeth Kendall, a British politician serving as Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, also commented on the situation. She cautioned that the government might decide to take Indonesia’s lead and ban its citizens from accessing Grok if Musk and his team fail to adhere to the UK rules.

The feat means the model is the only Korean presence in a ranking dominated by models developed by companies in the United States and China. In a statement, LG mentioned that its latest AI model delivered the strongest performance among five teams in a government-led AI foundational model competition. The model achieved remarkable feats, topping 10 of 13 benchmark tests with an average score of 72. Internationally, the AI model ranked seventh on the Intelligence Index compiled by Artificial Analysis, making it the only Korean model to enter the top 10. China led with six models , while the US boasted three models. Z.AI’s GLM-4.7 took the first position. LG’s foundational model ranks seventh in global rankings LG released its foundational model as an open-weight on Hugging Face and saw it climb to second place on the platform’s global model trend chart. This suggested a strong interest from international leaders. LG mentioned that it is ready to roll out free API access to K-Exaone through January 28. This will allow developers and firms to use the model without any cost during the initial rollout period. Epoch AI, a US-based nonprofit, also hailed the model. The platform added the model to its list of notable AI models. LG AI research now has five models on the list, making it the Korean company with the most. “We established the development plan according to the time and infrastructure we were given, and we developed the first-phase K-Exaone using about half the data we have,” said Lee Jin-sik, head of Exaone Lab at LG AI Research. According to LG, the model is the brainchild of five years of in-house research and signals Korea’s entry into the global race for frontier-class AI systems. The division of LG mentioned that instead of relying on only scale, it redesigned the architecture to boost performance while reducing training and operating costs. K-Exaone uses a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with 236 billion parameters, with about 23 billion parameters activated per inference. The K-Exaone model beats other models in several parameters The model uses its core technology, hybrid attention, to enhance its ability to focus on important information during data processing while reducing requirements and computational load by 70% compared to the previous models. The tokenizer was also upgraded by expanding its training vocabulary to 150,000 words. In addition, it often optimizes frequently used word combinations, improving the ability to process documents 1.3 times. In addition, the adoption of multi-token prediction boosted inference speed by 150%, improving overall efficiency. K-Exaone is designed to maximize efficiency while reducing costs, allowing it to run on A100-class GPUs rather than requiring the most expensive infrastructure,” an LG AI Research official said. “This makes frontier-level AI more accessible to companies with limited computing resources and helps broaden Korea’s AI ecosystem.” Aside from memorization, K-Exaone is trained to focus on improving its reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. LG explained that during its pre-training stage, the model was exposed to thinking trajectory data that shows how problems are solved and not just the final answer. Safety and compliance were also other priorities for the model. LG mentioned that it carried out data compliance reviews across training datasets, removing materials with potential copyright issues. The company runs an internal AI ethics committee that carries out risk assessment across four categories, including social safety, Korea-specific considerations, future risks, and universal human values. Under KGC-Safety, the benchmark developed by LG AI research for safety in Korea, K-Exaone scored an average of 97.38 across four categories. It outperformed OpenAI ’s GPT-OSS-120B model and Alibaba’s Qwen-3-235B model. Get seen where it counts.

But PayPal just kept crashing. On January 9, it dropped another 1%, closing at $57.66. And this wasn’t a one-day thing. It’s been stuck in the dirt for months. At the same time, insiders sold PYPL in Q4 2025 and none of them bought while short sellers made millions of dollars off PayPal, per data from InvestingPro. Downgrades pile up for PayPal’s stock while retail investors loses hope The hate online for PayPal has been nonstop. One trader on Reddit said they were down $20,000 and called it a “garbage stock,” just as Reddit sentiment score hit 12 out of 100, which frankly, that’s rock bottom. Another post blew up with 210 upvotes and 103 comments of people basically holding a support group for their losses. The most viral post came from someone with $100,000 in the stock who wrote, “I’m down 20k on this garbage stock. Should I just sell everything and buy SPY puts? This thing is never going back up.” That guy was using 326% leverage, and the title of the post reads:- “PayPal lose, going to yolo everything. The thing is, PayPal actually beat earnings eight out of the last nine quarters, but nobody cares since the stock keeps crashing, now down by 38% from $93.03, which was already far from its $231.38 high in 2021. The stock is now near its 52-week low of $55.72. Wall Street is tired too, as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan , Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America have all downgraded PYPL going into 2026. PayPal crashed 20% in the 2018 dip, 31% in the Covid crash, and then crashed over 83% when inflation hit. It’s been nothing but pain. And even now, it trades at 10 times forward earnings with 31% quarterly earnings growth, and the market still shrugs. Jefferies isn’t feeling it either. They kept a Hold rating and slapped on a $60 target. Right now, it trades around $58.42. That’s barely above the bottom. They also warned about Germany, where PayPal gets about 20% of its branded payment volume and 25% of transaction margin dollars. Sales there are slowing down. They’re now calling for just 2% TPV growth, down from 5% last quarter. Even with a P/E of 11.78 and a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, nobody’s buying the story. Price targets are all over the place, from $51 to $120, and earnings drop in 35 days. Other Wall Street analysts are divided on where PayPal goes next. Of the 44 analysts covering PayPal, 20 rate it Buy, 20 rate it Hold, and four rate it Sell, according to FactSet. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The focus is shifting away from hype-driven launches and toward projects that are building real systems before going live. In this environment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly being viewed as a serious crypto investment for those aiming to position themselves ahead of the next market expansion. Strong Presale Traction With a fixed total supply of just 4 billion tokens, the presale is already showing strong traction. Across all phases, the project has raised approximately $19.70 million so far, signaling growing investor confidence. The token is currently priced at $0.04, while more than 18,800 holders have already secured their positions through earlier rounds. Demand is clearly building in the current phase as well, with 5% of the 180 million tokens allocated to this stage already sold, indicating accelerating interest as supply continues to tighten. There has been a significant update for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), as MUTM tokens can now be purchased using a card with no purchase limits. This removes friction for new participants and allows broader market access, strengthening demand at a critical stage of the presale. It is important to highlight that the presale is all legitimate, as the team has been active since early 2025 and has consistently followed its roadmap while achieving key milestones on schedule. Timely delivery, an upcoming launch of a fully functional protocol, and steady organic community growth all reinforce the project’s credibility. These factors clearly distinguish it from the typical rug-pull schemes that are unfortunately common in today’s crypto arena, positioning the project as a serious, long-term venture rather than a speculative risk. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Building? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed around a dual lending structure that aims to serve different types of users within decentralized finance. Its Peer-to-Contract model allows users to lock stablecoins such as USDT into smart contract-backed liquidity pools. This system is built to deliver automated passive income in a secure and efficient way, without manual management. Alongside this, the Peer-to-Peer model enables direct lending agreements between individuals without intermediaries. This structure supports customized loan terms and enhanced privacy, which appeals to users who value control and confidentiality. Together, these two models create multiple yield pathways that attract diverse investors and strengthen platform activity from launch. Recent protocol updates have shown that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building well ahead of its launch timeline. As of November 24, 2025, front-end data testing has been fully completed, ensuring accurate balances, positions, and market statistics from day one. The ELK monitoring system is already live, giving the team real-time visibility into logs, performance, and system health. This level of infrastructure readiness is rarely seen during presale stages. The full staking workflow has also been implemented and tested, covering staking, unstaking, and reward tracking through automated deployment scripts designed for secure rollouts. Ongoing smart contract audit improvements, advanced admin dashboards, and extensive performance testing underline the project’s focus on reliability and long-term stability. At a time when many presales launch with unfinished products, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a utility-driven protocol that is actively being refined before going live. Roadmap Execution, Simultaneous Launch Strategy and MUTM Buybacks Roadmap execution further strengthens this outlook. Phase 1 of the roadmap is fully completed, and more than half of Phase 2 has already been achieved. The remaining objectives in Phase 2 include implementation of advanced features, risk parameters, and advanced analytics tools. The whitepaper has also been updated to reflect protocol progress and recent developments, reinforcing transparency and credibility. A major driver could be the expected simultaneous platform launch and token listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to introduce its lending and borrowing modules at the same time as the token becomes tradable. This synchronized rollout is expected to create immediate engagement, as users will be able to interact with live products from day one. Such readiness often aligns with Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchange listing requirements, increasing visibility and trading activity once listed. Another defining element is the dividend mechanism and buy-back pressure built into the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured to generate revenue from borrowing fees and platform activity. A portion of this revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, which will then be distributed to users staking their mtTokens. This design rewards long-term participation while introducing sustained demand through consistent buybacks. Finally, as the presale advances and remaining tokens become harder to secure, attention is expected to intensify. Those positions now align with a project that is building first and marketing later, a pattern that often defines standout performers in the next market cycle. For investors focused on entering before broader exposure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be a compelling choice before January 2026 arrives.

Instead of focusing on short-term price movements or speculative trading activity, the post centers on a direct comparison between XRP and Ethereum based strictly on market capitalization. XRP at Ethereum’s Market Cap The images attached to the post illustrate that if XRP were assigned the same market capitalization as Ethereum today, its price would exceed six dollars per token. The calculation places XRP near $6.17, representing a three times increase from its trading level at the time of the post. The visuals also show that XRP’s existing market capitalization is significantly lower than Ethereum’s. It sits at roughly one-third of Ethereum’s total valuation. XRP would be over $6 at today’s Ethereum market cap. This will happen very soon. pic.twitter.com/pjmvFEA8tC — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 10, 2026 This comparison is presented as a mathematical outcome rather than a speculative estimate. It assumes no change to XRP’s circulating supply and relies solely on Ethereum’s current market capitalization figures. From this standpoint, the projected price is not based on hypothetical token burns or structural changes, but on a direct alignment of total market value between the two assets. Community Responses Reflect Mixed Sentiment The post generated contrasting reactions from other market participants. One commenter suggested that if XRP were to surpass Ethereum in market capitalization, it could lead market participants to reassess long-held assumptions about the digital asset hierarchy, including discussions surrounding Bitcoin’s dominance. Another response was dismissive, arguing that XRP is unlikely to experience such appreciation and questioning the relevance of market cap comparisons altogether. These reactions highlight the divide between those who view relative valuation as a meaningful indicator and those who remain skeptical of XRP’s upside potential. Factors Supporting a Bullish XRP Outlook Supporters of the valuation comparison often point to several underlying developments. XRP’s design for fast and cost-efficient value transfer continues to position it as a settlement-focused digital asset rather than a general-purpose smart contract platform. Ongoing expansion of the XRP Ledger’s functionality, particularly in areas such as tokenization and institutional-grade infrastructure, is frequently cited as a potential demand driver. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory developments also remain central to the outlook, as increased clarity could encourage broader participation from financial institutions. In addition, growing interest in blockchain-based payment and liquidity solutions may favor assets optimized for high-volume transactions. Valuation Illustration Rather Than Certainty While the post states that XRP will soon reach Ethereum’s market capitalization, the underlying message remains tied to valuation comparison rather than a guaranteed outcome. The six-dollar price level serves to demonstrate how market capitalization differences translate directly into price disparities. Whether that gap narrows will depend on adoption trends, regulatory progress, and market conditions, but the comparison itself offers a clear view of where XRP currently stands relative to Ethereum.

According to sources close to the matter, after a few rounds of communications, the platform mentioned that more than 3,500 pieces of content have been blocked and over 600 accounts deleted. The action stemmed from a call from the Indian government on the platform to fix its chatbot Grok over its use to generate explicit and obscene content of women. In a previous report , Cryptopolitan mentioned that the country urged the platform to make immediate changes to its chatbot. The chatbot was used to create several AI-altered images of women, one of which has drawn criticism not only from India but from leaders around the world. X promises to work with Indian laws At the time, the Indian government gave the platform a 72-hour ultimatum to address the concerns raised. It also asked the platform to submit an action-taken report detailing the steps it has taken to prevent the hosting, generation, and dissemination of obscene content. The IT Ministry of India warned that failure to follow these directives could see the platform lose its “safe harbor” protections. All things now point to the blogging platform fulfilling these conditions, going by reports from India. The company mentioned that going forward, it will not allow users to generate obscene imagery, adding that it will work with Indian laws. “X has accepted its mistake and has said it will work as per Indian laws. The company has blocked around 3,500 pieces of content, and over 600 accounts were deleted. Going forward, X will not allow obscene imagery,” a senior official at the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) said. News had filtered into mainstream media on Friday that the Indian government was considering taking legal action against Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot of the platform, noting that the responses sent by the company were not satisfactory and therefore had to send another notice seeking further information. Sources mentioned that the company had listed their policies in the responses, instead of listing the steps they have taken, which the Indian government considered not good enough. MeitY asks X to provide additional insight On January 2, MeitY mentioned specifically that if X failed to put the activities of its platform under control, regulatory actions could follow. However, as part of its response to the country, the company asked for a two-day extension, which MeitY declined and allowed only 24 hours to respond. However, instead of highlighting what they were doing to combat the issue, X highlighted the kind of control they had concerning things like non-consensual nudity and synthetic content. X also outlined the processes that they follow in these cases, noting that they have taken some actions. However, the platform refused to explain how it happened and what actions they took. Therefore, the Indian government sent out another notice asking the platform to provide the needed information or risk a legal battle. The country has warned the platform that it could face legal actions under Section 79 of the IT Act. Meanwhile, India is not the only country trying to initiate legal actions against X due to the ongoing issues. According to a previous Cryptopolitan report , Australian PM Anthony Albanese has urged the platform to do something about the menace, noting that they have to make social media better for people. In addition, Indonesia has temporarily suspended Grok in the country due to the same issue, urging the platform to find a fix for the chatbot. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

According to a local report , citizens wanted to know whether pensions could be paid in digital assets and whether mining income would count toward social benefit calculations, prompting officials to clarify that all state payments remain exclusively in rubles, while crypto taxation falls under the Federal Tax Service’s jurisdiction. The unusual volume of crypto queries reflects Russia’s growing appetite for crypto, where mining now generates roughly 1 billion rubles daily, and regulatory frameworks continue to take shape ahead of mid-2026 implementation deadlines. According to Rossiyskaya Gazeta, Russia’s Social Fund said its unified contact center handled ~37 million inquiries in 2025, including frequent questions on whether pensions can be paid in cryptocurrency and whether mining income counts toward social benefits. The Fund clarified… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 11, 2026 Mining Income Recognition Gains Political Momentum Last month, senior Kremlin official Maxim Oreshkin pushed to classify crypto mining as export activity in Russia’s official trade accounts, arguing that mined digital assets effectively flow abroad even though they never cross physical borders. Speaking at the Russia Calling investment forum, Oreshkin called mining “ a new export item ” that Russia “ doesn’t value very well, ” citing how these transactions influence foreign-exchange markets and balance of payments outside formal statistics. Industry estimates support his case for recognition, with the Social Fund noting that “ many people are interested in whether it’s possible to receive a pension in cryptocurrency and whether mining income will be taken into account when calculating social benefits. “ Experts from the fund “ politely explained that all payments from the SFR are made exclusively in rubles, and that taxation of digital assets falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Tax Service. “ Russia’s mining operations account for over 16% of global hashrate last year, ranking second worldwide, while corporate operations now face 25% tax rates following the November 2024 legalization. Russia's Central Bank confirms crypto mining strengthens the ruble as Kremlin officials push for formal export classification amid persistent underground operations. #Russia #Crypto #Mining https://t.co/P0JGyFTYfp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 22, 2025 Shortly after Oreshkin, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina also acknowledged that mining contributes to the ruble’s strength but emphasized that quantifying its impact remains difficult, as significant portions of the industry operate in gray areas. Despite legalization requiring Federal Tax Service registration for legal entities and exempting household miners using less than 6,000 kWh monthly, illegal operations continue costing Russia billions annually through stolen electricity and unpaid taxes. Regulated Trading Infrastructure Takes Shape Late last month, Moscow Exchange and St. Petersburg Exchange confirmed readiness to launch crypto trading once Russia’s legislative framework takes effect by July 1, 2026, following the Bank of Russia’s December 23 regulatory concept release. St. Petersburg Exchange emphasized that it already has the necessary technological infrastructure for trading and settlements, while Moscow Exchange stated that it is actively working on solutions to serve the cryptocurrency market. The regulatory framework sharply divides market access between investor classes. Non-qualified investors face annual purchase caps of 300,000 rubles through single intermediaries, limited to liquid cryptocurrencies on defined lists after passing mandatory knowledge tests, while qualified investors encounter no volume restrictions but must show risk understanding and cannot purchase anonymous tokens that conceal transaction data. Russia recorded $376.3 billion in crypto transaction volume between July 2024 and June 2025, surpassing the UK’s $273.2 billion to become Europe’s largest crypto market by transaction volume. Source: Chainalysis Large-scale transfers exceeding $10 million grew 86% during this period, nearly double the 44% growth across Europe, while DeFi activity surged eightfold in early 2025 before stabilizing at three and a half times mid-2023 levels. Banking Sector Embraces Digital Assets In December as well, Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, announced it now offers regulated crypto-linked investments totaling 1.5 billion rubles in structured bonds and digital financial assets tied to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and broader crypto portfolios. Deputy Chairman Anatoly Popov confirmed active dialogue with the Bank of Russia and Rosfinmonitoring on integrating crypto services within regulated frameworks while building proprietary blockchain infrastructure for issuing and managing digital financial assets. Meanwhile, earlier today, it was confirmed that Tether has also registered its asset tokenization platform Hadron trademark in Russia after filing in October 2025, with Rospatent approving the application in January 2026 for trademark protection valid until October 2035. According to RIA, Tether has registered the trademark for its asset tokenization platform Hadron in Russia. The application was filed in Oct 2025 and approved in Jan 2026, with trademark protection valid until Oct 2035. The trademark covers blockchain-based financial services,… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 11, 2026 The trademark covers blockchain-based financial services, crypto trading and exchange, crypto payment processing, and related advisory services, as Tether’s USDT maintains a roughly $187 billion market capitalization as the world’s third-largest crypto asset. Despite adoption and infrastructure expansion, State Duma Committee Chairman Anatoly Aksakov recently reinforced payment restrictions , declaring cryptocurrencies “ will never become money within our country ” and can only function as investment instruments requiring all domestic payments in rubles. The regulators are now preparing for a strict crypto regulation framework and new penalties this year.

The staking strengthens Bitmine’s standing as a significant participant in the cryptocurrency staking industry, bringing the amount staked to 1,080,512 ETH, or approximately $3.33 billion . According to Arkham data, the Ether treasury company made several small deposits to Ethereum’s BatchDeposit contract on Sunday. On-chain data indicate that at the current price of $ 3,091.40 ETH, BitMine now holds approximately 2.738 million ETH, worth approximately $8.46 billion . BitMine expands Ethereum staking amid growth Tom Lee( @fundstrat )'s #Bitmine staked another 86,400 $ETH ($266.3M) 5 hours ago. In total, #Bitmine has now staked 1,080,512 $ETH ($3.33B). https://t.co/P684j5YQaG pic.twitter.com/TpEf32m6AF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 11, 2026 The recent staking follows the Ether treasury firm’s staking of 82,560 Ethereum, worth roughly $259 million, five days ago. Similar to the current staking, the firm made larger deposits on Ethereum’s BatchDeposit contract. After staking 82,560 tokens, the entire amount of Ethereum staked by BitMine increased to 544,064 Ether, worth about $1.62 billion. According to on-chain analyst Lookonchain, the corporation began staking Ether on December 26 and transferred approximately 74,880 ETH tokens, worth around $219 million, to staking-related contracts on the Ethereum network. The 74,880 ETH deposit marked Bitmine’s first attempt to generate revenue from staking its assets. Similar to Strategy’s Bitcoin buying program, the company built up its Ethereum holdings through methodical acquisitions. Bitmine’s decision to stake implies that the company plans to hold Ethereum for an extended period rather than aggressively trading the position. The vigorous staking push has helped drive Ethereum’s validator admission queue to approximately 1,815,746 Ethereum. According to the Ethereum Validator Queue on the blockchain explorer, new validators must wait an estimated 31 days and 13 hours to become active. Exit activity remains comparatively low , with little over 192,000 Ethereum available for withdrawal. Amid this growing validator backlog, BitMine began preparing its own staking infrastructure to enter the market last November strategically. On November 21, last year, BitMine announced its intention to utilize an internal infrastructure called the Made-in-America Validator Network (MAVAN) to begin staking Ether in the first quarter of 2026. The company chose three institutional staking providers for an initial trial before growing the program, deploying a small amount of Ethereum to assess performance, security, and operational dependability. Ethereum’s network statistics indicate that about 35.5 million Ethereum, or about 29% of the total supply, are currently staked. The yearly staking yield is approximately 2.54%. In an X post, Abdul Rehman, CEO of DeFi at layer-1 blockchain Monad, stated that Ether’s price doubled quickly after the entry and exit queue flipped in June. 2026 is “going to be a movie,” according to his prediction. Lee predicts Ethereum surge amid market recovery As of December 29 of last year, Bitmine reported a total holding of 4.11 million Ethereum, 192 Bitcoins, and a $23 million interest in Eightco assets. BitMine’s total crypto and cash assets amount to nearly $13.2 billion, with over $1 billion in cash. The corporation is approximately two-thirds of the way toward achieving its “alchemy of 5%” goal, with the ether position accounting for approximately 3.41% of the network’s circulating supply of over 120.7 million ETH. “We continue to be the largest ‘fresh money’ buyer of ETH in the world. Year-end tax-loss related selling is pushing down crypto and crypto equity prices, and this effect tends to be the greatest from 12/26 to 12/30, so we are navigating markets with this in mind.” Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine. Mr. Lee expressed a bullish outlook for Ethereum in a statement on December 26, predicting that Ethereum might reach $7,000 to $9,000 in early 2026. According to Lee, the future of cryptocurrency “is still really good for the next five to ten years.” Lee referred to tokenization as Ethereum’s main growth engine. He projected that the token would eventually reach $20,000 as Ethereum competes with established payment methods. In response to the October 10 reversal in cryptocurrency last year, the chairman described it as “a liquidation event that was similar to 2022 when FTX collapsed.” According to Lee, it took the markets eight weeks to recover and stabilize.

Most larger-cap alts have remained sluggish as well, with just a few impressive price gainers over the past 24 hours – XMR and RAIN. BTC Stalls at $90.5K Bitcoin entered 2026 after a controversial 2025 that actually ended in the red. It quickly started to regain value and surged past $90,000 on the second day of the new year. Even the geopolitical tension between the US and Venezuela couldn’t keep it down for long, and BTC remained above that key level last weekend. The bulls went on the offensive even more on Monday and Tuesday, pushing the cryptocurrency to a new multi-week peak of just under $95,000. However, after gaining roughly $7,000 in just days, BTC was poised for a correction, which transpired almost immediately. In the span of just 36 hours, bitcoin slipped by five grand and dipped below $89,500. It reacted well to this decline and quickly rebounded to over $90,000, where it has remained since Friday, when it was rejected at $92,000. The past 24 hours have been quite dull, as BTC has traded at around $90,500 without any deviations. This means that its market capitalization remains sideways at $1.810 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins is just shy of 57%. BTCUSD Jan 11.

SUI and TAO have also charted notable gains. In contrast, ZEC and CC have plunged by double digits, followed by DOGE, MNT, UNI, and HBAR.

When liquidity is low, trades become harder to complete, prices can shift suddenly and users often end up getting worse deals than they expected (slippage). On the other hand, strong liquidity allows trades to happen fast and at predictable prices, making the platform feel stable and trustworthy. There are roughly 28.39 million tokens that exist in the crypto market. Due to this, most exchanges face the challenge of maintaining enough buyers and sellers on their own. Liquidity providers or LPs for short remove this problem by combining prices and trades from multiple sources into a single stream, so exchanges can always offer the best available prices. Some providers, called market makers, simply post buy and sell prices on one exchange. Others, known as liquidity aggregators, work more like smart traffic controllers. They scan many markets at once and route trades to wherever the price is best. What matters most is not just how much trading volume exists, but how well that liquidity is spread across the order book. Deep, well balanced liquidity helps trades go through faster, with few price surprises, ultimately creating a better experience for users. A market depth chart is a way to show how many people are willing to buy and sell at different prices. When there is high liquidity, there are plenty of buyers and sellers close to the current price, so even large trades can go through without causing fluctuations in price. When liquidity is low, there are fewer orders available leading to price slippage and failed or delayed trades. By combining liquidity from multiple sources, exchanges can create deeper and more balanced markets for users from the start. In 2026, exchanges increasingly rely on external LPs and aggregators rather than building in house so that users experience minimal mishaps when trading. Faster Market Access & Reduced Infrastructure Overhead (ChangeNOW) Why this benefit matters New exchanges coming to market need liquidity quickly. Waiting to build a market making engine in house can take months but can also cost a lot. Estimates show that a centralized exchange minimum viable product can require around $500k to $1M up front and over a year of development. Syncing up with an existing provider’s API however gives instant depth. An API based integration with LPs gives exchanges deep order books from day one without amassing all that liquidity themselves. This approach cuts time to market by a lot. How ChangeNOW fits this benefit ChangeNOW works as one such aggregation platform. It connects multiple exchanges and trading pools and compares prices in real time. Partner platforms can route trades through ChangeNOW to access many markets at once without running its own full order books. ChangeNOW’s API handles the rate comparison and routing, so the partner can offer fast swap execution even for new token pairs or chains. Operational Impact Using an external provider lowers upfront costs and launch times can speed up launch times. Exchanges can add new tokens and networks fast, often within days, while avoiding the challenge of building and maintaining complex trading systems. Trade-offs The main trade off here is control. When using a third party provider, exchanges must rely on pricing and routing logic from the external party instead of being able to manage everything themselves. While this reduces customization, most growing platforms find the speed, cost savings and operational simplicity worth the trade-off. Improved Trade Execution & Tighter Spreads Why it matters High liquidity directly translates to better trade execution. This is a huge deal for the end user as they most often than not notice execution qualities first. When there are plenty of buyers and sellers, price stay close to the market rate and trades don’t cause sudden price jumps. The opposite is true when liquidity is weak. Prices can change and trades can take longer to fully execute. These hiccups can add up and create a poor trading experience. From a retention point of view, this becomes a very critical area to focus on. LP benefits By combining liquidity from multiple sources via an LP, exchanges can offer deeper markets and more stable pricing. If activity slows down in one source, the aggregator can simply route orders elsewhere automatically. This helps absorb market volatility and ensures users always get fair, competitive prices. Over time, fast and reliable execution builds trust, supports larger trades and allows the platform to scale without sacrificing user experience. Scalability across assets, chains and regions Why it matters Most crypto exchanges frequently list new tokens on multiple networks to their users. The task of managing strong liquidity for each asset is operationally complex as it would require massive capital expenditure and coordination. LPs address this by providing a plug and play depth for a wide range of assets. ChangeNOW for example already support 900+ coins across many networks. In effect, a partner exchange can add new trading pairs by routing trades into the existing shared pools of these liquidity networks. Liquidity Provider Advantages The result is much smoother scaling. Exchanges can support more assets, handle higher trade volumes and enter new regions without worrying about thin markets. By working with global liquidity networks rather than local, exchanges can grow faster while maintaining a consistent trading experience. Risk Management & Reduced Counterparty Exposure Trusting a single exchange or market maker for liquidity can be risky. Outages, technical glitches or sudden withdrawals by a single provider can stall all trading. Partnering through multiple LPs through an aggregator though dramatically decreases this single party risk. As an aggregator draws from multiple sources, if one platform experiences downtime, orders get routed to another LP automatically. What’s important is that aggregation also simplifies the whole process of dealing with multiple providers. Faster Go-To-Market & Better User Retention Crypto investors now expect exchanges to have sleek UI/UX. Gone are the days of clunky and complex crypto trading apps. Today, the biggest tier 1 exchanges are prioritizing a smooth experience for their users. With the competition out there, first impressions really matter for new exchanges. If users face failed trades or unexpected prices during their first few transactions, they are unlikely to return. As mentioned earlier, liquidity and UX go hand in hand. By integrating with LPs, exchanges offer active markets to their users without having to wait to build their own trading volume. This means fewer failed trades, predictable prices and a smoother onboarding experience. All of these factors are what investors look for in an exchange and they are extremely crucial during a launch. With time, a platforms reliability supports user retention. Trust is built when users see their trades go through without any challenges. FAQs What is a crypto liquidity provider? A Liquidity Provider is a firm or institution that supplies buy and sell prices so trades can happen smoothly on an exchange. Some directly quote prices, while others aggregate prices from many sources to offer the best available price. Do exchanges need their own market makers? No. Building that infrastructure internally can be expensive and time consuming. Most exchanges connect to external liquidity providers or aggregators to get market depth quickly. How does liquidity affect user experience? Good liquidity means trades execute quickly and at expected prices. Poor liquidity causes price slippage, failed orders, and frustration, which often leads users to leave the platform. Are liquidity providers suitable for small exchanges? Yes. Liquidity providers are especially useful for smaller or new exchanges. They allow platforms to launch with deep markets from day one, without needing a large user base or heavy upfront investment.

When speaking of sideways movement, this movement has dragged on for many months, although Ethereum did manage to make a new all-time high in 2025. Interestingly, a technical analysis shared on X by Egrag Crypto shows how Ethereum’s current price action fits into previous playouts when viewed through an inverted monthly chart. This offers a perspective on what appears to be stagnation about to break into new price highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator A Repeating Cycle With Changing Behavior The analysis is based on an inverted monthly Ethereum chart, which offers an interesting perspective that flips conventional interpretations of price movement. Ethereum’s inverted monthly chart shows a consistent pattern that’s changing with time in market structure across multiple cycles. A look at the inverted chart shows that previous price cycles were characterized by short accumulation phases followed by aggressive moves. As the market matured, those accumulation zones stretched out, and the resulting moves became less violent and more controlled. The first instance was in 2016, when Ethereum traded in a range for about 10 months before breaking out and going on a violent drop. A similar structure appeared between mid-2018 and mid-2020, when a longer consolidation phase preceded another drop that played out gradually at a softer pace. The current cycle, however, is playing out with a much longer accumulation. Therefore, the eventual drop should be shorter, according to Egrag Crypto. Inverted Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @egragcrypto on X A Drop Here Actually Means A Breakout The most important detail in this technical framework is that the chart is inverted. What looks like a downside move on this view actually points to upside expansion on the real Ethereum price chart. According to the previous outcomes, once Ethereum exits this range, the next move is likely to unfold quickly. It may not match the explosive nature of early-cycle rallies, but it is expected to be more orderly, sustained, and carry Ethereum to new price highs. When the structure is converted back into real price terms, Egrag Crypto identifies the $3,800 to $4,500 area as the first critical zone. This region represents initial resistance that must be cleared to confirm a bullish continuation. Only after a decisive move above this range would the $6,000 to $7,500 zone come into focus as a realistic upside target. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator The analysis also highlights a defined risk scenario. A pullback to the $1,800 to $2,200 region would postpone the breakout and act as a final shakeout before a final lift-off. However, as long as Ethereum holds its broader consolidation structure, such a retest would not invalidate the thesis. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,100.

57066782,656359,1768129245,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/57066782.jpeg,"Crypto Scam: Louisiana Bitcoin ATM Protections Help Recover $200,000 – Details",https://bitcoinist.com/louisiana-bitcoin-atm-protections-recover-200000/,"A recently ratified law in the state of Louisiana has helped seniors recover $200,000 following a Bitcoin ATM-related scam operation. This development represents a fine example of government protecting users’ interests even while encouraging digital asset adoption. Louisiana Law Presents Major Hurdle For Crypto Scammers According to a report by local media 7KPLC, a group of scammers recently targeted senior citizens in Louisiana and Texas in a sophisticated scheme resulting in at least four known victims. It was gathered that the scammers usually deceived the unsuspecting seniors into believing their bank accounts had been compromised and falsely implicated them in child pornography charges. Thereafter, these bad actors would proceed to threaten the elderly citizens with arrest unless they were obliged to pay lump sums of money. Eventual victims were guided to Bitcoin ATMs, which allow users to swap cash for cryptocurrency, to process these fraudulent transactions to anonymously owned wallets. According to data from Bitcoin ATM Map, there are 288 resident Bitcoin ATM/Tellers in Louisiana, representing the Southeastern state’s friendliness towards the crypto industry. However, a recently passed legislation in Louisiana introduced several measures to combat crypto scams. These include mandatory signage on all Bitcoin ATMs, which states that no government-affiliated person or entity would ever demand cash deposits into these machines. Furthermore, the machines are also programmed to display warning messages to users during transactions. In particular, users are advised to stay alert to scams, especially when provided with a QR code or wallet ID by someone else. In addition, the new regulations include a $3,000 daily limit on deposits and a 72-hour waiting period for all transactions to potentially detect all malicious fund transfers and scams. According to KPLC, these new regulations allowed authorities to recover $200,000 for four targeted senior citizens. Other victims of this scam are admonished to reach out to the AARP Louisiana branch, a large nonprofit, nonpartisan US organization focused on supporting and advocating for people 50 years and older and their families. Bitcoin ATM Scam: The Next Menace? While Louisiana has recently formulated laws to tackle scams involving the Bitcoin ATMs, Bitcoinist reported that the Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway had recently started an investigation into companies operating these machines, citing concerns around deceptive fee structure and fraudulent use by bad actors. As seen in Louisiana, Hanaway claimed to have received reports of new scam operations involving the key use of Bitcoin ATMs, thus resulting in the statewide probe. Notably, companies under the AG’s investigation include GPD Holdings, Rockitcoin, Bitcoin Depot, Athena Bitcoin, and Byte Federal.",Bitcoin ATM|Crypto Scam|Louisiana|Missouri|Senior Citizens|The Missouri AG,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-11 11:00:45

The post focused on endurance rather than optimism, presenting long-term holding as a deliberate choice made repeatedly under difficult conditions. Pumpius emphasized that remaining committed was not the result of chance, but a conscious decision taken when stepping away would have seemed more reasonable. The message framed patience as an active process shaped by doubt, silence, and the absence of external validation. According to Pumpius, being early required accepting isolation. Early participation meant watching public narratives develop that failed to align with what was unfolding behind the scenes. The commentator noted that XRP progressed at an institutional pace, which often conflicted with expectations set by fast-moving online commentary. This disconnect, the post suggested, created an environment where conviction was tested over time rather than confirmed quickly. To everyone still standing with XRP, If this were easy, everyone would still be here. This path was never designed to reward comfort or impatience. It was designed to test belief when there was no applause, no confirmation, and no clear timeline. Staying was not luck. It was a… — Pumpius (@pumpius) January 10, 2026 Years of Pressure and Invisible Progress Pumpius addressed the long stretch during which XRP appeared stagnant to many observers. Legal challenges, regulatory uncertainty, and persistent mischaracterization defined much of that period. Central to this phase was Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which weighed heavily on market confidence for years. The case, now resolved, served as a defining obstacle that limited visibility into ongoing development and contributed to widespread hesitation around XRP. Despite these pressures, Pumpius argued that meaningful work continued out of public view. The post stressed that systems designed for institutional and cross-border use are not built publicly or rapidly. Instead, they are developed quietly, under scrutiny, and often during moments of maximum resistance. The commentator describes this period as one of preparation rather than stagnation, suggesting that the lack of visible progress masked structural development. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From Survival to Execution The message went on to describe what Pumpius sees as a shift in tone around XRP. Rather than increased noise or promotion, the change was described as measured and deliberate. This calmer environment was presented as an indicator that foundational work is largely complete and that usage is positioned to expand. Pumpius associated this stage with real transaction flow and operational scale, rather than speculation or anticipation. The post also recognized the psychological toll of staying engaged without clear confirmation. Pumpius noted that only a small number of participants would understand what it meant to remain committed before XRP’s role became easier to explain. Respect was directed toward Ripple’s leadership, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse , for continuing to build throughout periods of intense pressure and delayed outcomes. Pumpius’s post presents long-term XRP holding as a position rooted in patience, long-term conviction, and acceptance of delayed clarity rather than immediate reward.

57066849,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892919,1768129467,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57066849.jpeg,Elderly couple lose $1.3 million retirement savings to crypto scammers,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-scammers-swindle-elderly-couple/,"Crypto scammers have successfully scammed an elderly couple out of $1.3 million meant for their retirement savings. The couple was conned by scammers pretending to be representatives from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The scammers tricked them into sending funds using Bitcoin ATMs and gold. The couple, Barbara and Larry Cook, were approached by crypto scammers who claimed they were security representatives from Amazon and TD Bank. The scammers were able to convince the couple that their identity had been misused on the dark web, noting that the individuals had made illegal purchases on the website. The Cooks were drawn into a web of deceit by the scammers who stole $1.3 million meant for their retirement, charity, and family, according to their will. Crypto scammers steal $1.3 million from elderly couple The con started with the crypto scammer asking them to pay stashes of $50 and $100 bills into Bitcoin ATMs , and hand over gold bullion in their home state of Maine and in Florida, where they lived in a condo for the winter. The scam went on for six months before the Cooks realized that they had been duped. According to reports, the crypto scammer gained their trust by highlighting that they were doing their civic duty by assisting the FTC, which was following the money to catch criminals. “My wife and I have always liked to help people,” Larry Cook, now 82, a former pastor in Pennsylvania and founding pastor of the Africa-based nonprofit, Kenya’s Kids, said. “We thought we were helping the US government.” In a follow-up call to the supposed contacts from Amazon and TD Bank, the crypto scammers convinced them to help by threatening expensive court action against them if they failed to comply with their directives. The criminals also included their two sons, noting that they won’t hesitate to drag them into the case. They highlighted that their sons were already successful and they could not afford to have their reputations damaged. Another tactic they used was to ask the Cooks to transfer their savings into safe accounts, after being converted to Bitcoin or gold. The crypto scammers mentioned that it was because the funds were at risk of being stolen. They convinced them by saying the criminals knew their social security numbers and other personal details. Criminals threatened the victims to cooperate The crypto scammer also kicked their scam up a notch by sending them a convincing letter with a seal purported to be from the previous treasury secretary. The letter said that if they revealed to anyone that they were part of the investigation, they would pay the price by stripping them of their assets. Larry mentioned that even though the story sounded unbelievable, they were scared. He mentioned that the fear led them to sign a fake agreement with the crypto criminals . The couple mentioned that they were later assigned an FTC agent, who said his name was Ryan Terry. Terry showed them how to download WhatsApp, which he often uses to make voice calls to them. At one point, he instructed them to set up a Bitcoin wallet. He impressed upon Larry to withdraw more than $1.3 million in increments from TD Bank, cleaning their savings account, including 401(k) plans. Larry mentioned that he was often questioned by bank clerks, most of the time, asking if it was a scam. Larry mentioned that he called Terry after returning from visiting one of the children’s homes of his organization, only to discover that his WhatsApp no longer worked. He tried several times before dialling the office of the FTC in Dallas, where he said he worked. He mentioned that his heart sank when he was transferred to a victim hotline and was asked to contact the police and FBI. He was also told that the FTC does not ask for money, crypto, or gold to aid investigations. The FTC also told him that they don’t keep investigations private.

Some notable examples include: Colombia’s DIAN tightens cryptocurrency transaction reporting laws, Brazil debuts a new government-backed stablecoin with yield sharing, and Venezuelan exchange Kontigo promises to fully recover cash following a security compromise. Colombia tightens cryptocurrency oversight with DIAN Colombia has implemented new bitcoin reporting laws through the DIAN (National Tax and Customs Directorate) to conform with OECD norms. Beginning in 2026, crypto service providers must declare transactions exceeding 50,000 pesos (about $13 USD), including the type of cryptocurrency and customer details. The laws apply to platforms, middlemen, and legal companies in an effort to promote transparency and reduce tax avoidance. The first complete reporting period begins in 2026, and platforms must submit their initial reports by May 2027. Users may lose anonymity while transacting with assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, and penalties for noncompliance may exceed 1% of unreported amounts. Experts recommend keeping detailed records of purchases, transactions, and holdings to guarantee accurate reporting and compliance. Tony Volpon unveils BRD, Brazil’s government-backed stablecoin Former Central Bank Director Tony Volpon has announced the introduction of BRD , a stablecoin backed by Brazilian government bonds. The idea intends to combine the stability of a digital currency pegged to the real with the high interest rates offered by Brazilian debt, which now averages 15% per year. During an interview with CNN Brasil’s “Cripto na Real,” Volpon stated that the BRD aims to democratize access to these rates for investors worldwide, making it easier for international participants to benefit from Brazil’s financial markets. BRD stands out as Brazil’s first real-backed stablecoin that openly shares returns with holders. With this launch, Brazil now has six real-backed stablecoins: BRZ, BRLA, cREAL, BBRL, BRL1, and BRD. Beyond BRD, Volpon continues to innovate in the Brazilian cryptocurrency area with projects such as real estate tokenisation and blockchain-based registry solutions, with the goal of modernising the country’s financial and real estate markets while encouraging transparency, efficiency, and increased investor access. Kontigo faces a security breach, promises full Fund recovery On January 5, 2026, the Venezuelan exchange platform Kontigo disclosed an unlawful access event involving some customer funds. The company promptly isolated the compromised systems, engaged security mechanisms, and informed users that all affected monies would be returned while it investigated the entire extent of the hack. Kontigo highlighted that user assets are still safeguarded despite the event, which affected both regular users and the CEO. The platform sent updates via its official X account, providing instructions to concerned users and emphasising fundamental security standards, such as not sending passwords or personal information via messaging. Analysts advise users to remain calm, avoid making fresh deposits, and keep all transaction data for future claims. Kontigo has temporarily banned withdrawals as a precaution while the inquiry is ongoing, with the next official update set for 2:00 PM Venezuelan time. The company’s resolve to refund any affected wallets adheres to industry norms for dealing with crypto security issues and wants to maintain customer trust in the face of mounting worries.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $150L by the end of 2026 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2032, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s outlook for 2026 has become highly debated. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the rally after the halving were expected to bring more clarity, but instead they’ve brought mixed volatility in Bitcoin price forecast. However, top analysts are bullish on BTC price prediction this year. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, has predicted that Bitcoin could reach about $250,000 by 2026. He bases this view on Bitcoin’s limited supply and the possibility that institutions and major companies will continue to adopt it. Investor and author Robert Kiyosaki has made a similar prediction, arguing that Bitcoin’s scarcity makes it a strong store of value in a world where traditional currencies are becoming less stable. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction 2026 model.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $95,339, it will fuel a bullish rally to $104,759. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $84,588, beginning a bearish trend to $83,492. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling pressure as buyers failed to push the price above immediate fib levels. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing 4,279 BTC for $451.06 million at an average price of $105,412. The report revealed that the company held 35,102 BTC as of December 30, 2025 Bitcoin price prediction January 2026 Bitcoin’s price dropped toward $84K due to the rising bearish threat. However, it is now facing minor accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a recovery around January 2026. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $95,000 and be pushed further, at least $105,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $82,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction January 2026 $82,000 $95,000 $105,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the years following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price after a downturn in 2025. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2026. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2026 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $150,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2028, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2029 By 2029, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2030 Projections for 2030 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2031 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2026, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $150,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $100,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,738 by the end of 2028. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K. In October, the price of Bitcoin crashed heavily below $110K. The price crashed further toward $84K in November. Bitcoin ended December 2025 on a bearish note by trading below $90K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-11 11:29:31

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Information Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in an active presale having undergone a number of pricing rounds. Every phase has a fixed price of the token and a limited amount that should be satisfied before the next phase is open. This has promoted front-runners because late entrants will incur high prices. The demand has been very high with over 18,800 holders having joined and up to 19.7M in funding being raised to date. In Phase 7, tokens now trade at a price of $0.04 under the level of $0.05, and this has remained attractive to both retail and large whale buyers interested in getting an early exposure to DeFi lending protocols. The current price has increased by 300% since the initial stages of Phase 1, which was at $0.01, and is currently priced at $0.04. Buyers that made purchases during Phase 1 are priced in at an estimated 500% increase at the confirmed launch price of $0.06. As the Phase 7 is advancing, the following phase is expected to have a partial increment of almost 20%, which will be a time-sensitive investment to those investors who will have a higher preference in entry pricing before the listing becomes effective. The V1 Protocol launch is about to enter into the testnet phase and plans to launch a borrowing and lending market in Q1 2026, which provides the token with a real product catalyst and not just a speculative story. What Mutuum Finance Is Building Mutuum Finance is building a decentralised marketplace in lending and borrowing. The protocol is meant to manage deposits, borrowing, generation and management of yield and collateral. The lending system aims at generating a steady yield to those who have deposited their money and at providing lenient borrowing by those who have collateralized their loans. As depositors inject money, they get mtTokens. These tokens are a symbol of their status and have yielded returns to rewards. These APY vary depending on the usage of the system and the activity of borrowing. Mutuum Finance is also intending to allow buy and distribute token models. This mechanism uses some protocol fees activity and then utilizes it to buy the MUTM token. Analysts assume that this model stimulates long term alignment between users of the protocols and token holders. The issue of security is regarded as a key to any lending protocol. Mutuum Finance has undergone a security audit with Halborn . Halborn is a reputable company in the industry and has collaborated with various large crypto-projects. The audit instills confidence in the protocol prior to its initial deployment in the protocol. This assists in overcoming smart contracts and safety of collateral worries by users. Stablecoin Plans and Price Prediction Mutuum Finance also intends to add support for stablecoins and oracles. It is anticipated that stablecoins would be used as the main collateral in lending, as well as in liquidity pools. Price details of collateral assets and loan management will be tracked by using oracles. This framework is significant in the proper risk control and liquidation rationale. Bullish predictions on MUTM have been made up to 2026. There are those who view MUTM as one of the most underestimated assets with a valuation of less than $0.05 because of its developing utility and the time of launch. Research group price models have provided a road map to 10x-15x gains in case the protocol can attract liquidity and keep on growing the deposits. These approximations are based on the effective mainnet launch and further demand of DeFi credit markets. The main driver of Mutuum Finance will be the launch of V1 protocol. This is when on-chain real lending will be in place. Repayment will start trickling into the hands of depositors and collateral will be introduced into the system. With the protocol adhering to its roadmap and V1 going live, which introduces the real usage, most of them assume that MUTM might leave 2026 as one of the most successful new DeFi assets.

Data from Bitfinex and Bitstamp show that this move typically precedes bullish breakouts and could signal Bitcoin’s imminent rally. Whales are closing their leveraged long positions on Bitcoin, a sign that analysts believe calls the bottom and could precede a bullish breakout past Bitcoin’s all-time high. According to data derived from crypto exchanges Bitfinex and Bitstamp, the move has historically occurred just before major breakouts, driving BTC to new highs. Data derived from Bitfinex shows that whale long positions have begun to decline after peaking at 73,000 BTC towards the end of last month. Analysts believe Bitcoin will rally to $135k soon ⚠️WHALES ARE EXITING BTC LONG POSITIONS! Large BTC holders are closing leveraged longs, a move that has historically preceded BULLISH breakouts. If this repeats, analysts see a path toward $135K BTC. pic.twitter.com/XKJF3p1t3H — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) January 11, 2026 Coin Bureau, a cryptocurrency education platform, wrote on X that analysts expect Bitcoin’s imminent rally to reach $135k. MartyParty, a crypto commentator with over 200k followers on X, wrote that a similar move occurred in 2025, driving Bitcoin from $74k to $112k in 43 days. The analyst also predicted that a Wyckoff Spring will follow shortly. A Wyckoff Spring is a bullish trading pattern where the price briefly dips below a support level before quickly returning to the trading range. The pattern often signals that an upward move is likely to follow. The bullish prediction aligns with data from CryptoQuant, which suggests that the Bitcoin-to-stablecoin ratio on the Binance exchange signaled potential rising buying power. The data also referenced a similar occurrence in March 2025, where BTC declined from $109,000 to $74,000 before launching a new rally that ultimately pushed Bitcoin to a fresh all-time high around $126,000. More analysts and entities have predicted that Bitcoin is on the verge of a rally. A recent report highlighted that Michael Schumacher, Wells Fargo’s Head of Macro Strategy, stated in an interview that the financial markets are experiencing declining volatility. The macro expert added that declining volatility is driving investor confidence towards riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies. A more comprehensive report compiled by Cryptopolitan revealed that renewed risk appetite could be making a comeback in the digital asset ecosystem. According to the report, large-cap crypto assets, such as Sui, XRP, and Solana, have performed significantly well, casting a shadow on BTC’s overall performance since the start of the year. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BTC is up 3.6% since January 1 and is currently trading at $90,596 at the time of this publication. The report also highlighted that the volume of spot, futures, and derivatives markets indicates that investors are gradually positioning themselves with a risk-on conviction. The aggregate futures open positions in BTC also showed signs of a recovery after the massive deleveraging seen in the last quarter of 2025. Mercado Bitcoin exchange predicts BTC will double its market cap this year Mercado Bitcoin, a Brazilian exchange based in São Paulo, predicts BTC will double its market capitalization in 2026. The exchange published a report outlining central projections in the cryptocurrency market. The Latin American exchange estimates that Bitcoin’s attributes, compared to gold, place the crypto asset at the forefront as a top alternative for institutions and organizations to store value. The report highlighted that gold investors face significant hurdles, such as logistics and storage challenges, and emphasized that Bitcoin’s digital, borderless, and self-custodial nature makes it more appealing. The report also noted that institutional influx in the crypto ecosystem will continue to increase following regulatory reforms in the U.S. that now allow registered companies to explore digital currency investment. Cryptopolitan recently reported that James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, predicted that BTC will land between $120,000 and $170,000 this year. The report also illuminated Carol Alexander’s prediction that Bitcoin’s price will bounce between $75,000 and $150,000 in 2026, settling “around $110,000.” Alexander is a professor of finance at the University of Sussex.

According to his analysis, this signal was communicated to subscribers ahead of the subsequent market reaction. Price action following that point moved sharply lower, with XRP recording a decline of roughly 15%. The move validated the relevance of the divergence signal as an early warning of weakening momentum despite price strength at the time. The chart shared by the analyst puts this development within a structural context rather than treating it as an isolated event. The divergence, visible on the relative strength index, suggested that upside momentum was deteriorating even as the price attempted to hold higher levels. This condition, in JD’s view, justified caution and reinforced expectations for a corrective phase. $XRP – posted H. Bearish Divergence for Patreon & Subscribers during the local top… then dipped 15% thereafter! (grey box did not hit yet) The deeper we go hitting bottom trendline, the higher measure target breakout will be! Bottom trendline is VERY LOW RT for updates!… pic.twitter.com/gnSxzMnP5j — JD (@jaydee_757) January 10, 2026 Measured Moves Within a Falling Wedge Structure JD’s analysis focuses heavily on long-term pattern behavior visible on the multi-day chart. The chart attached outlines a falling wedge formation that has guided XRP’s price action through extended periods of decline and consolidation. Historically, similar structures on the chart have produced measured moves that aligned closely with projected targets once a breakout occurred. The analyst highlights that previous downside movements respected the wedge’s internal trendlines, eventually reaching measured targets with notable precision. This historical behavior is used to frame expectations for the current setup. While price has already moved lower, JD notes that the chart’s pattern suggests the structure remains incomplete, with the lower boundary of the wedge not yet fully tested. Lower Price Levels Linked to Higher Breakout Targets A key point emphasized in the analysis is the relationship between downside extension and upside potential. JD explains that the deeper price moves toward the bottom trendline of the wedge, the larger the projected breakout target becomes once a reversal is confirmed. In this context, the lower boundary of the structure is described as being significantly below current price levels, implying that additional downside cannot be ruled out. This perspective was further clarified in a direct response to a question from another market participant, who asked whether XRP could revisit price zones last seen around October. JD indicated that a move toward lower levels would not invalidate the bullish breakout thesis but would instead increase the magnitude of the eventual upside move, provided the structure resolves as anticipated. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cautious Near-Term View With Long-Term Implications The overall tone of the analysis remains cautious in the short term, while constructive over a longer horizon. The presence of hidden bearish signals on momentum indicators suggests that volatility may persist, particularly if the price continues to gravitate toward structural support. At the same time, the wedge positions any deeper retracement as a potential contributor to a larger measured breakout in the future. JD’s assessment does not attempt to assign a specific timeline but instead stresses the importance of structure, confirmation, and patience. As XRP continues to trade within these defined boundaries, the focus remains on how the price interacts with the lower trendline and whether historical pattern behavior repeats with similar accuracy.

The new measures were announced as the agency continues to fight money laundering and terrorism financing. According to reports, the penny drop method requires the recording of geographical coordinates and the verification of bank accounts, while the use of know-your-customer has always been a part of the anti-money laundering KYC protocols put forward by the agency. The directive also includes limitations placed on Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Initial Token Offerings (ITOs), which the agency says are equivalent to IPOs in the stock market carried out by crypto exchanges. India’s FIU releases new guidelines for onboarding new users According to the FIU, Indian exchanges are banned from carrying out mixing services, with the agency noting that transactions linked to anonymous tokens should also not be facilitated. The new guidelines released by the FIU, a body that functions under the Union Finance Ministry, have been reviewed by the PTI. The PTI mentioned that the updated regulations would help India tackle terrorism financing and money laundering using digital assets. In addition, the agency has also updated reporting guidelines for exchanges. The update comes about three years after the first set of rules was published in March 2023. The FIU acts as the single-point regulator for crypto exchanges (reporting platforms or VDA service providers) operating in India under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The updated guidelines mean that all crypto exchanges operating within the country must register with the FIU as reporting entities and submit regular reports on transactions that they consider suspicious. They are also charged with maintaining the records of their customers to identify and combat illicit funding and proliferation financing risks associated with crypto assets. This doesn’t mean that digital assets are being recognized as legal tender, but for the payment of taxes. FIU shares update on crypto industry guidelines According to the guidelines, exchanges have been mandated to ask their customers to submit the Permanent Account Number (PAN), a selfie with license detections, latitude and longitude coordinates of the onboarding location, with date and timestamp. In addition, users are required to also submit their IP address as part of what the agency calls the “client due diligence” measures. Exchanges have also been asked to ensure that clients whose credentials were submitted are the ones accessing their accounts at all times. “The authenticity of such access and personal presence shall be established by capturing a live photograph of the client and employing liveliness detection technology to verify the client’s physical presence,” it said. Liveness detection is done by a specified software that is being used for several legal purposes in India, such as generating a life certificate for pensioners. The software requires them to blink to establish that they are alive and authentic. The exchanges have also been asked to collect another identity and address document of the client, which includes a driving license, proof of possession of Aadhaar, passport, voter ID, and driving license. In addition, they are also required to verify their mobile number and email using a one-time password (OTP). Also, exchanges are mandated to carry out a KYC update for customers that they deem to be high risk every six months, while updating for others after a year. In terms of ICOs/ITOs, the Indian agency mentioned that the activities present increased and complex money laundering and terrorism financing risks. It noted that they lack a justified economic rationale. The agency also mentioned that anonymous tokens or crypto mixers that are designed to conceal the origin of funds are also prohibited, warning exchanges to ensure that they do not carry out such transactions. ing-probe/”>complex money laundering and terrorism financing risks.

Social media buzz, rising volumes, and fresh presales are pushing traders to look closely at the best meme coins to invest before prices move fast. When momentum builds, timing becomes everything, and today’s market is all about spotting strong narratives early. From established meme giants to fast-growing newcomers, several names are circulating across crypto communities right now. This listicle breaks down APEMARS ($APRZ) alongside Floki, Dogwifhat, Bonk, ApeCoin, Baby Doge Coin, and Brett, showing where attention is flowing and why these projects are being talked about in the current cycle. 1. APEMARS ($APRZ): The Presale Meme Coin Everyone Is Watching Right Now APEMARS ($APRZ) is currently in Stage 3 of its live presale, and momentum is building quickly. At a Stage 3 entry price of $0.00002448, the project offers a compelling early-access opportunity ahead of its expected listing price of $0.0055. This sharp price progression represents a massive 22,367% return on investment from Stage 3, underlining the advantage of entering before market exposure and wider demand kick in. The numbers alone position this stage as a high-leverage point for investors focused on outsized upside potential. Unlike many meme projects that appear after hype peaks, APEMARS is positioning itself early. The branding, timing, and presale structure are designed to capture attention before exchange listings bring wider exposure. Utility Explained Simply APEMARS is built around community interaction and meme-driven engagement. The token is designed to be used inside its ecosystem for participation, rewards, and future integrations tied to social and digital experiences. Simple idea, simple use, something even a child can understand: hold, use, and be part of the fun. Presales are where price gaps are created. Once APEMARS moves from presale to public markets, the Stage 3 price is gone forever. Many people later wish they had clicked “buy” earlier when numbers were still tiny.

Bonk often benefits when meme coins and layer-1 ecosystems rise together. 5. ApeCoin: Utility Meets Meme Culture ApeCoin connects meme culture with broader Web3 utility. Linked to a well-known NFT brand, ApeCoin plays a role in gaming, metaverse concepts, and governance. Rather than being purely speculative, ApeCoin represents how meme-inspired assets can evolve into functional digital assets while still maintaining cultural relevance. 6. Baby Doge Coin: A Familiar Name With Staying Power Baby Doge Coin focuses on community, accessibility, and fun branding. It remains popular among meme-coin fans who enjoy light-hearted projects with strong social engagement.

With a 24-hour trading volume of $12.18 bn and a total market capitalization just above $1.81 tn, price action has narrowed into one of its tightest ranges of the year. The broader crypto market reflects that hesitation. Total crypto market cap stands near $3.1 tn, while daily volumes have cooled to around $44.4 bn. The Fear and Greed Index at 40 signals neutrality, not confidence, and the Altcoin Season Index at 34/100 confirms this remains a Bitcoin-led market rather than a broad risk-on cycle. Bitcoin dominance remains firm as capital stays selective rather than speculative. ETF Outflows Add Quiet Pressure Institutional flows are telling a more cautious story. Crypto ETFs recorded net outflows of $343.8 mn on Jan. 9, extending a choppy start to the year. While not panic-driven, the data suggests institutions are trimming exposure rather than chasing upside at current levels. This matters because recent rallies have relied heavily on ETF demand to sustain momentum. Without consistent inflows, Bitcoin is forced to rely on spot demand and technical structure to push higher. That combination has so far resulted in patience, not conviction. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Tight Triangle Signals a Decision Point Technically, Bitcoin price prediction is coiling. Price is compressing between rising trend support near $90,000 and firm resistance at $91,520, forming a clean symmetrical triangle. Candles remain small and neutral, a classic sign that traders are waiting for confirmation before committing. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key technical signals align with that pause: The 50-EMA and 100-EMA are flattening, creating a squeeze RSI near 47 reflects balance rather than momentum Higher lows since late December remain intact A confirmed close above $91,520 would likely open a move toward $93,011, with $94,800 acting as the next major upside test from prior breakdown zones. Failure to hold trend support would weaken the structure, exposing $89,241 and potentially $87,921, though buyers have repeatedly stepped in at higher levels. Why the Next Move Matters This isn’t just about Bitcoin ticking higher or lower. A clean breakout could reset sentiment across the market at a time when liquidity is stabilizing and speculative interest is starting to re-emerge at the edges. For now, the market is waiting. And when Bitcoin stops waiting, the move is unlikely to be subtle. Maxi Doge: A Meme Coin Built Around Community and Competition Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.43 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002775, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

Zedcex and Zedxion facilitated operational financing for the IRGC, with illicit flows accounting for roughly 56% of their total transaction volume and peaking at 87% in 2024. The exchanges incorporated in the UK between 2021 and 2022 used nominal directors, virtual office addresses, and repeatedly filed dormant accounts despite processing billions in on-chain activity. Corporate records directly connect Zedcex to Babak Morteza Zanjani, an Iranian sanctions-evasion financier previously sanctioned by the US and EU in 2013 for laundering billions in oil revenue on behalf of regime entities, including the IRGC, before those penalties were lifted under the now-defunct Iran nuclear deal. Source: TRMLabs Network Processed Record IRGC Flows Through Shell Structure IRGC-linked addresses at Zedcex processed $23.7 million in 2023, representing 60% of total activity, before surging to $619.1 million in 2024 when the IRGC share jumped to 87%. Activity declined to $410.4 million in 2025 as non-IRGC flows increased, reducing the corps’ share to 48%. The two exchanges operated as a single enterprise despite separate UK incorporation, with both entities sharing directors, addresses, and coordinated timing that indicated continuity rather than independence. Zanjani’s withdrawal from Zedxion in 2022, followed immediately by Zedcex’s incorporation under the same control structure and address, suggested operational continuity rather than separation. After being arrested in Iran and sentenced to death for embezzling millions from Iran’s National Oil Company, his sentence was commuted in 2024 after repaying funds, and he re-emerged publicly with proximity to regime-linked economic projects through DotOne Holding Group, a conglomerate spanning cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, logistics, and telecommunications. Source: TRMLabs TRM analysis linked Zedcex wallets directly to addresses designated by Israeli authorities as IRGC property under the Administrative Seizure Order ASO-43/25, issued in September 2025, many of which Tether subsequently blocklisted. Transfers conducted almost entirely in USDT on the TRON blockchain routed funds between designated IRGC addresses, offshore intermediaries, and domestic Iranian exchanges, including Nobitex, Wallex, and Aban Tether. The exchanges also integrated with Zedpay, a Turkey-based mobile payment processor that maintains relationships with Turkish financial entities, including Vepara, whose license was later suspended amid money laundering concerns, and Vakif Katilim, a state-owned Islamic bank previously scrutinized for facilitating Iran-linked financial activity. This integration extended capabilities beyond trading to support fiat settlement and real-world payments for actors under sanctions constraints. Direct Terrorist Financing Links Established On-Chain On-chain tracing revealed that over $10 million in USDT transferred directly from wallets dually attributable to Zedcex and the IRGC to addresses controlled by Sa’id Ahmad Muhammad al-Jamal, who is sanctioned by the US Treasury for providing material support to the IRGC and operating smuggling networks that generate revenue for Yemen’s Houthis. The absence of intermediary routing established Zedcex infrastructure as an active funding rail rather than an incidental touchpoint. The case emerges as sanctioned nation-states increasingly dominate crypto crime statistics , with Chainalysis reporting illicit addresses received at least $154 billion in 2025, marking a 162% jump from $59 billion in 2024, driven largely by a 694% increase in sanctioned entity activity. Stablecoins accounted for 84% of all illicit transaction volume, mirroring broader ecosystem trends in which these assets offer easy cross-border transfers and lower volatility. Iran’s broader crypto operations have faced mounting pressure throughout 2025, with flows involving Iranian entities falling to $3.7 billion between January and July , a 11% decline from 2024. The Treasury Department sanctioned two Iranian nationals in September for coordinating over $100 million in cryptocurrency oil sales benefiting the IRGC, while Iran has explored accepting digital currencies for advanced weapons sales, including ballistic missiles and drones marketed through its Ministry of Defense Export Center. Russia launched its ruble-backed A7A5 token in February 2025, processing over $93.3 billion in transactions in less than a year as Moscow similarly leveraged crypto infrastructure to circumvent Western financial restrictions.

It quickly reclaimed the fourth spot in terms of market cap, as its price surged past two crucial resistance levels – $1.90 and $2.00, both of which have turned into support now. However, its progress was stalled at $2.40, and XRP has slipped by double digits since then, currently fighting to stay above $2.10. We decided to ask ChatGPT about its take on the asset’s future price performance for the week ahead. Bear vs Bull Cases The popular AI solution acknowledged the early-2026 volatility and predicted that it would likely dampen in the following week. It laid out a few scenarios, with the bearish one envisioning another retracement to and below the two key levels mentioned above – $2.00 and $1.90. In fact, in this “worst-case” situation, XRP would find itself dipping to its 2025-end lows of $1.85. “A break below $1.85 would invalidate the recent bullish structure and suggest that the early-January rally was merely a relief bounce,” the AI platform said. On the contrary stands the bull scenario. In it, the token will decisively break out beyond the $2.40 line, which capped its January 6 run-up. Should the bulls be successful, XRP could be heading for another double-digit surge to around $2.60. ChatGPT predicted that the order books from the weekend could “actually accelerate such a move if buying pressure appears suddenly.” It’s worth noting, though, that the AI chatbot gave a higher probability chance for the bear case (25%-30%) compared to the bull scenario (20%-25%). However, the most probable scenario is less eventful. Base Case While the two prediction models from above sound more exciting, ChatGPT outlined that the ‘base’ case has the highest probability chance of 45% to 50%, even though it has a lot fewer fireworks. It noted that sideways consolidation is to be expected after such a rapid move from $1.85 to $2.40 and then down to $2.10. It added that XRP “appears to be digesting gains now,” and the $2.00-$2.05 zone is emerging as short-term support, while $2.35-$2.40 remains a heavy resistance area where sellers previously took control. ChatGPT explained that if there’s no major catalyst appearing in the next couple of days, XRP is “likely to trade in a tight range between $2.00 and $2.30, frustrating both bulls and bears as the market awaits for a clearer directional signal.” The post What’s The Most Likely Ripple (XRP) Price Scenario for the Week Ahead: AI Edition appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-01-11 12:43:45

The agency accused the three major prediction market platforms of violating state gambling laws by operating in Tennessee without the required licenses. Polymarket, Others Threatened With Fines For Offering Sports Event Contracts On Friday, January 9, the Tennessee Sports Wagering Council (SWC) issued cease-and-desist letters to Polymarket, Kalshi, and Crypto.com’s Derivatives Exchange. In the letters, the state regulator asked all three prediction market firms to stop offering sports event contracts to the residents of Tennessee. The state’s SWC also demanded that the three firms void all pending contracts entered into by Tennessee residents, and refund all customer deposits by January 31, 2026. SWC Executive Director, Mary Beth Thomas, wrote in the letter to Polymarket: The sports events contracts offered on Polymarket’s exchange are not compliant with these [Tennessee state consumer] protections (and many others) and are an immediate and significant threat to the public interest of Tennessee. The language in the Tennessee Sports Wagering Council letters to Kalshi and Crypto.com was quite similar to Polymarket’s cease-and-desist letter. This comes despite all three platforms being registered as designated contract markets with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), allowing them to offer event-based derivatives contracts nationwide. Despite this CFTC designation, these prediction market firms have had regulatory run-ins with different states in the US. In December 2025, the state of Connecticut sent a trio of cease-and-desist orders to Robinhood, Kalshi, and Crypto.com. The firms based their defense at the time on receiving the CFTC’s approval to operate in the United States. This Tennessee cease-and-desist order seems to be the first state-level regulatory issue faced by Polymarket, which currently only offers sports event contracts in the United States. In the letters, the Tennessee Sports Wagering Council threatened a range of penalties for any of the firms’ failure to comply. One of the letters further read: Failure to comply with the SWC’s demand will result in the imposition of fines pursuant to the Act, which states that the SWC shall impose a fine against any person offering wagers in Tennessee without a license in the amount of $10,000 for the first offense; $15,000 for a second offense; and $25,000 for a third or subsequent offense. ‘ Moreover, failure to comply with the SWC’s demand will result in the SWC seeking injunctive relief. Prediction Markets Facing Increased Regulatory Scrutiny The prediction markets, which gained prominence during the 2024 US elections, have continued to enjoy interest from users and institutional investors. However, the regulatory scrutiny faced by the industry has seen a similar surge lately. For instance, a Polymarket trader reportedly netted record gains of over $400,000 from predicting the recent US military action in Venezuela, prompting talks of introducing a bill to prevent insider trading. As Bitcoinist reported , Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) plans to introduce a bill that would ban all government-affiliated individuals from participating in state-related events in the prediction market.",Crypto News|crypto|Crypto.com|Kalshi|Polymarket|prediction markets,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-11 13:00:24

The move follows a broader drop in whale holdings of roughly 220,000 BTC during 2025, a change that has analysts and traders parsing what comes next. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator Price action has been steady. Bitcoin has been moving inside a tight range around $88,000 to $92,000 while the market seeks direction. Whale Moves And Historical Patterns Based on reports, some traders see this as a classic unwind pattern that precedes price gains. In early 2025, a similar fall in long positions coincided with Bitcoin slipping under $74k then staging a sharp rebound. That past recovery climbed to about $112k in 43 days after positions were flushed. MartyParty, a commentator on X, pointed to that episode when noting Bitfinex whales were “aggressively closing $BTC longs,” a behavior that has in the past been followed by big swings. Bitfinex whales are aggressively closing $BTC longs, a signal that historically precedes massive volatility. Last time this “unwind” happened in early 2025, Bitcoin was stalling at $74k. This precedes the Wyckoff Spring. See charts below. The flush cleared leverage and ignited… pic.twitter.com/2qfmH2eliJ — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) January 10, 2026 Market Breadth And Investor Mix Reports have disclosed that on-chain tracker CryptoQuant finds overall whale holdings fell by over 200,000 BTC across the year, while smaller investors have increased exposure. This shift is being read by some as a sign that ownership is broadening. If more participants hold coins, price moves can be supported by a wider base of buyers. That does not guarantee higher prices, but it does change the way risk spreads through the market. Price Range And Resistance Levels Traders are watching a near-term ceiling around $94,000 that has capped several rallies. Bitcoin currently sits near $91.5k. A sustained break above that $94,000 level with volume would be a stronger confirmation for bulls. On the flip side, a failure to move higher could see the range widen to the downside, especially if funding costs rise or if liquidations pick up. Fractal Targets And Caution Some analysts are using past patterns to project targets. Based on reports, one scenario maps a repeat of the spring-and-rally sequence, aiming at $135k or more if history repeats closely enough. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator That view depends on similar market conditions lining up, which is not certain. Whales are not a single, unified actor; different groups can close positions for different reasons, and some trades are used as hedges rather than bets on price direction. Volume, funding rates, and net positioning on major derivatives platforms will matter. A clean breakout above $94,000 with rising spot demand would support the bullish case. Conversely, rising selling pressure at that level could keep Bitcoin confined to the $88,000–$92,000 band until a new catalyst appears. The current action looks like a setup in progress — one that could lead to sharp moves once traders decide on direction.

The digital asset has been trading within a relatively narrow band after reaching multi-month highs, showing a balance between profit-taking and continued institutional demand. Market participants are now searching for insight into XRP’s next moves. Against this backdrop, we requested a forward-looking analysis from Grok , the artificial intelligence on Elon Musk’s X platform. Grok provided a detailed analysis of XRP’s potential price by January 31, 2026. Current Market Context for XRP XRP currently trades at $2.09 after briefly reaching $2.39 this week. This movement followed a sharp rally from levels near $1.85, representing gains of more than 25% in a short period. The asset retraced slightly from this peak and seems to be in another consolidation phase. Grok stated that its outlook was based on a synthesis of recent price action, technical indicators, on-chain data, and prevailing macro and crypto-specific conditions. The AI highlighted XRP’s early-January rally and expects the current consolidation phase to define price behavior over the next several weeks. XRP Price Target: Grok’s Base-Case Grok’s base-case projection places XRP between $2.45 and $2.85 by January 31, 2026. According to the AI, this scenario assumes that XRP continues to hold support in the $2 to $2.1 range, which it has identified as a key technical and psychological level. Grok highlighted XRP’s recent pullback, describing this as a normal cooling period after overbought conditions. From that base, Grok expects gradual upside driven by what it calls “renewed institutional demand and tightening available supply .” As part of this reasoning, Grok cited ongoing inflows into spot XRP Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs) and reduced exchange balances as supportive factors, framing them as tailwinds rather than immediate breakout catalysts. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bullish and Bearish Price Scenarios In a bullish scenario, Grok projected XRP to reach $3 or $3.50 by January 31, 2026. This outcome would require a decisive break above resistance levels. It would also place XRP just below its all-time high of $3.65 . Grok assigned a 35% probability to this scenario. Conversely, Grok outlined a bearish scenario in which XRP falls back between $1.80 and $2.05. This would likely occur if profit-taking accelerates without sufficient new demand. Grok placed a lower probability of 20% on this outcome, citing current institutional participation and supply dynamics as mitigating factors. Overall, Grok’s analysis suggests optimism for XRP this month, with price targets leaning upward but bounded by clearly defined risks.

The Tennessee Sports Wagering Council sent cease-and-desist letters this week to Kalshi, Polymarket, and Crypto.com, according to regulatory notices and company statements. The council said the platforms must immediately halt activity related to sports contracts in the state, void existing positions, and refund customer funds tied to those contracts. The move places Tennessee among a growing number of states drawing a hard line between licensed sports betting and crypto-based event markets. Regulators classify contracts as sports wagering Tennessee officials said the products offered by the platforms function as sports wagers under state law. As a result, only operators licensed by the state may legally offer them. In the letters, the council argued that labeling the products as “event contracts” does not change their underlying structure. Customers place money on the outcome of professional and collegiate sporting events, which Tennessee law treats as regulated gambling. The council also warned that failure to comply could lead to enforcement actions. Those may include fines and further legal steps if the platforms continue operating in the state. Platforms face mounting state pressure The Tennessee action follows similar scrutiny in other U.S. jurisdictions. State regulators have increasingly challenged platforms that allow users to trade contracts tied to sports results, even when those platforms operate nationally or claim federal oversight. Kalshi has previously argued that some of its contracts fall under federal commodities regulation rather than state gambling laws. However, state authorities have maintained that sports-related markets still require local licensing when offered to residents. Crypto.com and Polymarket have also adjusted their offerings in past cases, restricting or withdrawing sports products in certain states after regulatory warnings. Broader implications for prediction markets The dispute highlights a widening regulatory gap between traditional sports betting frameworks and emerging crypto-based markets. While licensed sportsbooks operate under strict state rules, prediction platforms often rely on different legal interpretations. For states like Tennessee , the priority remains consumer protection and enforcement of existing wagering laws. Officials have stressed that unlicensed operators pose risks tied to oversight, dispute resolution, and responsible gambling standards. As regulators continue to review these products, platforms may face increasing pressure to either seek state licenses, limit geographic access, or redesign contracts that touch on sports outcomes. The Tennessee order adds momentum to that trend and signals that state regulators intend to assert jurisdiction, even as federal debates around prediction markets continue.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-11 13:16:36

Daily trading volume stands near $6.5 bn, while Ethereum maintains its position as the second-largest crypto asset with a market capitalization of approximately $375 bn. On the surface, the move looks modest. Underneath, the structure suggests something more deliberate is forming. Since late December, ETH has consistently printed higher lows, holding above a rising trendline despite several attempts to push lower. That behavior typically reflects accumulation, not exhaustion, especially when price refuses to break key support zones. Rising Staking Queue Signals Supply Tightening On-chain data is adding an important layer to the technical picture. According to ValidatorQueue data , Ethereum’s Beacon Chain staking entry queue has surged to 1.759 mn ETH, equivalent to roughly $5.5 bn, the highest level since August 2023. New validators are now facing a wait time of more than 30 days before activation. According to ValidatorQueue data, the Ethereum Beacon Chain staking entry queue has surged to 1.759 million ETH (~ $5.5 billion), marking the highest level since late August 2023. New stakers now need to wait about 30 days and 13 hours before their validators can be officially… pic.twitter.com/QqP1Itq5pb — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 10, 2026 At the same time, the exit queue has dropped to zero, meaning no meaningful wave of stakers is rushing to leave. In simple terms, more ETH is lining up to be locked, while none is lining up to exit. That dynamic reduces available liquid supply just as price compresses near resistance. Ethereum Price Prediction: Technical Chart Structure Signals Pressure Is Building Technically, the Ethereum price prediction is coiling. Price is squeezed between the ascending trendline and a declining band formed by the 50-EMA and 100-EMA, which are flattening near $3,110. This convergence often precedes volatility expansion. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum indicators support the setup. RSI has recovered from oversold levels and is now hovering above 55, signaling improving bullish pressure without overheating. Candlesticks over recent sessions show repeated long lower wicks near $3,050–$3,070, reinforcing that buyers are stepping in early rather than waiting for deeper pullbacks. Ethereum Trade Outlook Hinges on $3,180 Break Using TradingView’s path projection, a sustained close above $3,180 would likely confirm the breakout, opening a move toward $3,250, followed by a retest of the $3,300 region. If momentum accelerates, extensions toward $3,380–$3,420 become technically reasonable. From a trading perspective, the structure favors patience over prediction. Strength above resistance matters more than anticipation. As staking demand builds and price continues to tighten, Ethereum appears less like a market running out of steam and more like one preparing for its next phase of growth, often the kind of environment where early positioning starts to matter most. Maxi Doge Presale Builds Momentum Through Community Engagement Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.43 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards.

Together, on chain data and multi timeframe technical setups now point to growing momentum across both institutional flows and price action. Bitmine sends 86,400 ETH to Ethereum staking deposit contract, post claims Bitmine sent 86,400 ETH to Ethereum’s staking deposit contract about eight hours before a post from Crypto Patel on X highlighted the transfers, pointing to fresh on chain deposits tied to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee. The screenshot of the transfers list shows four separate deposits from Bitmine labeled addresses to a “BatchDeposit” destination, with values of 23.04K ETH, 21.12K ETH, 19.2K ETH, and 23.04K ETH, which add up to 86,400 ETH.

Source: Crypto Patel/X The same transfer records show estimated dollar values near $71.02 million, $65.1 million, $59.18 million, and $71.02 million, totaling about $266.3 million for the batch. The “BatchDeposit” label appears alongside a shortened contract identifier, indicating the deposits routed through a batching method rather than a single transaction. Crypto Patel’s post said Bitmine has now staked 1,080,512 ETH worth about $3.33 billion. The post also claimed Bitmine holds 4.144 million ETH, or about 3.43% of Ethereum’s total supply, valued at roughly $12.80 billion. Ethereum breaks out of falling channel as chart signals higher price zone Ethereum broke above a long running falling channel on the daily chart, according to a technical setup shared by Crypto King on X, pointing to a shift in short term price structure. The chart, based on ETH U.S. dollar data from Binance, shows price moving out of a downward parallel channel that had guided trading since late 2025. After the breakout, Ethereum pulled back slightly but held above the former channel boundary, a move that often marks confirmation rather than rejection. Ethereum Downtrend Channel Breakout Chart. Source: Crypto King/X The chart also highlights a completed falling wedge pattern inside the broader downtrend. As price compressed toward the lower end of the structure, volatility narrowed before the upside break. Fibonacci levels drawn on the chart place the 0.618 retracement near the mid channel area, which Ethereum has now reclaimed. Price trades around $3,090 on the latest candle, well above the recent range lows near $2,600. Crypto King said consolidation appears complete and projected an upside target above $4,400 if the breakout holds. The forward path drawn on the chart shows a stepped advance, with an initial push toward the mid $3,600 area before a continuation higher. While the projection remains technical, the chart reflects a clear change in trend direction after months of lower highs and lower lows. Ethereum weekly chart points to higher cycle targets based on long term structure Meanwhile, Ethereum’s weekly chart suggests room for further upside in the current market cycle, according to technical analysis shared by the account Freedom By 40 on X. The chart, based on Ethereum U.S. dollar data from Bitstamp, outlines a broader rising structure that has remained intact since the 2022 market low. Price recently traded near $3,233, holding above a long term ascending trendline that has supported higher lows over multiple years. Ethereum Weekly Cycle Projection Chart. Source: Freedom By 40/X The chart applies Elliott Wave labeling and Fibonacci extensions to frame potential cycle targets. Markings show a completed corrective phase followed by a renewed impulse structure, with projected extensions ranging from the 1.0 level near $6,448 to higher bands above $9,000. The 1.236 and 1.38 Fibonacci extensions are also highlighted, placing longer term reference zones near $9,270 and $11,567, respectively. The analysis notes that even a move toward the lower extension would remain consistent with prior cycle behavior. Freedom By 40 said a minimum target around $6,400 would still fall within a conservative range for the cycle, based on the technical setup shown. The chart compares the current structure with the previous cycle’s peak, marked as the last Elliott Wave all time high, and shows Ethereum continuing to respect a rising diagonal support. While the projections remain technical, the weekly structure reflects sustained higher highs and higher lows, keeping the broader uptrend intact.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-11 13:22:59

Top Banks, Ripple Executives and Top Figures Reveal Their Outlook",https://coinpaper.com/13670/xrp-to-8-or-higher-by-2026-top-banks-ripple-executives-and-top-figures-reveal-their-outlook,"XRP traded around $2.09 as of writing, up more than 10% over the last seven days. The move reflects renewed market interest as long-term projections from banks and Ripple leadership circulate ahead of 2026. Price action has remained volatile, yet attention has shifted toward how institutional signals could shape XRP’s trajectory over the next two years. Standard Chartered Outlines a $8 XRP Scenario Standard Chartered has delivered one of the most widely cited forecasts. Geoffrey Kendrick, the bank’s head of digital assets research, estimates XRP could reach $8 by 2026, which implies a gain of roughly 330% from recent levels. Kendrick links the projection to regulatory clarity following Ripple’s legal resolution with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and to the approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds in the United States. ETF data supports the institutional narrative. According to SoSoValue, U.S. spot XRP ETFs recorded total net inflows of about $1.14 billion by late December. Kendrick frames these flows as evidence of sustained demand from traditional investors who previously avoided the asset. Market indicators, however, still reflect mixed conditions, as momentum metrics such as MACD signal short-term divergence despite strong inflows. Brad Garlinghouse Points to Institutional Acceleration Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has highlighted ETF demand as a defining signal for XRP’s next phase. Speaking at Binance Blockchain Week, Garlinghouse said XRP ETFs raised more than $700 million within weeks of launch. He described the surge as pent-up institutional demand following years of regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. Garlinghouse emphasized that the policy shift remains underpriced, given the U.S. accounts for roughly 22% of global GDP. He noted that major firms, including Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Vanguard, have entered the crypto space after long periods of caution. He also dismissed concerns around short-term ETF outflows, arguing that crypto’s current share of the global ETF market, estimated at 1–2%, leaves significant room for expansion by 2026. Ripple’s Regional Leadership Signals Confidence Ripple’s Senior Executive Officer for the Middle East and Africa, Reece Merrick, has echoed optimism heading into 2026. In a New Year message, Merrick reflected on strong performance in 2025 and expressed excitement for what lies ahead. His comments followed Ripple’s scheduled release of one billion XRP from escrow at the start of 2026, spread across three transactions tracked by Whale Alert. The unlock aligns with Ripple’s long-standing escrow framework and coincides with the company’s expanding stablecoin operations. Ripple’s stablecoin recently surpassed a $1 billion market cap and secured approvals across key Middle Eastern financial hubs, which has reinforced the firm’s presence in regulated markets. Tom Lee’s Macro Outlook Fuels Broader Speculation Fundstrat’s Tom Lee has added a macro layer to XRP discussions through his broader crypto outlook. Lee has projected Bitcoin at $1 million and Ethereum at $62,000 in a scenario that could lift total crypto market capitalization toward $20–25 trillion. While Lee has not issued a direct XRP forecast, analysts often view such projections as supportive of large-cap altcoins tied to institutional adoption and tokenized finance. XRP continues to trade above key technical levels near $1.90, with resistance observed between $2.09 and $2.22. As 2026 continues to mature, investors appear focused on whether regulatory progress and ETF growth can translate long-term projections into sustained market structure.

Daily trading volume stands near $1.12 bn, while XRP remains the fourth-largest crypto asset with a market capitalization of approximately $127.5 bn. On the surface, the move looks quiet. Underneath, the structure suggests the market is digesting gains rather than losing momentum. Since late December, XRP has continued to print higher lows, holding above a rising trendline despite repeated attempts to push lower. This behavior typically reflects controlled consolidation, not trend exhaustion, particularly when price refuses to break established support zones. Ripple’s UK FCA Approval Strengthens Backdrop Beyond the chart, regulatory developments are adding context to XRP’s current pause. Ripple recently secured registration with the UK Financial Conduct Authority , allowing its UK subsidiary to carry out certain crypto-related activities under the country’s anti-money-laundering framework Ripple secures FCA registration. The future of regulated digital assets payments in the UK has arrived! Ripple has officially secured approval of both an EMI license and Cryptoasset Registration from the UK's FCA. Who better to explain what it means than our UK and Europe Managing Director @CraddockCJ .… pic.twitter.com/q2xyeJQXEF — Ripple (@Ripple) January 9, 2026 While the approval stops short of full financial services authorization, it marks a meaningful step as the UK works to integrate digital assets into its regulatory structure. For markets, this type of clarity often matters less for immediate price spikes and more for reinforcing longer-term confidence during consolidation phases. XRP Price Prediction: Chart Structure Compresses Above Support From a technical standpoint, XRP price prediction is tightening. After rallying toward the $2.40 region, the pullback has taken the shape of a bullish flag, not a reversal. Price continues to hold above the $2.04–$2.06 support zone, which aligns closely with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, a level commonly associated with trend continuation. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The 50-EMA and 100-EMA are flattening and beginning to converge near $2.10, signaling declining volatility. Candlestick behavior reinforces this view, with repeated small-bodied candles and long lower wicks, suggesting buyers are absorbing supply rather than stepping aside. Momentum indicators support patience. RSI has recovered from oversold territory and is now stabilizing near the mid-50s, pointing to improving bullish pressure without signs of exhaustion or bearish divergence. XRP Breakout Hinges on $2.15 Resistance Using TradingView’s path projection, a decisive break above $2.15 would likely open the door toward $2.27, followed by a potential retest of $2.40 if momentum builds. As long as XRP holds above rising trend support, the broader setup favors continuation rather than distribution. Markets often move next when attention is lowest. With regulatory clarity improving and technical pressure building quietly, XRP’s consolidation phase may be laying the groundwork for its next expansion. This kind of environment tends to reward early positioning, especially as sentiment and participation begin to turn forward-looking again. Maxi Doge Presale Builds Momentum Through Community Engagement Maxi Doge is gaining traction as one of the more active meme coin presales this year, combining bold branding with community-driven incentives. The project has already raised more than $4.43 million, placing it among the stronger early performers in the meme token category. Unlike typical dog-themed tokens that rely purely on social buzz, Maxi Doge leans into engagement. The project runs regular ROI competitions, community challenges, and events designed to keep participation high throughout the presale phase. Its leverage-inspired mascot and fitness-themed branding have helped it stand out in a crowded meme market. The $MAXI token also includes a staking mechanism that allows holders to earn daily smart-contract rewards. Stakers gain access to exclusive competitions and partner events, adding a passive earning component while encouraging long-term participation rather than short-term speculation. Currently priced at $0.0002775, $MAXI is approaching its next scheduled presale increase. With momentum building and community activity remaining strong, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a meme coin focused on sustained engagement rather than one-off hype.

This was rather surprising to some, especially given the fact that most other financial assets had their best year to date. But is that a blessing in disguise? 2025 in Retrospect 2025 was a controversial year in the crypto land. Investors entered it with high hopes as they were expecting the then-president-elect Donald J. Trump to make good on his many pro-crypto promises. It was also a post-halving year, which was (until that point) always a catalyst for gains. The combination of the two should have made it historic, right? And it did, at least up until a point. It started with a few consecutive all-time highs, then a massive correction in April and May due to Trump’s tariffs, but then yet another rally. As Q4 approached, everyone was convinced the previous records would be broken again. After all, October is known as ‘Uptober’ for a reason. And the first week didn’t disappoint. Almost on cue, BTC skyrocketed to a fresh all-time high at just over $126,000 as the community celebrated and outlined the next massive targets ahead. However, that’s when it all went horribly wrong. Instead of aiming at $150,000, $200,000, or even higher, BTC crashed by double digits in just a day when $19 billion worth of liquidations hit over-leveraged investors. The landscape has just not been the same ever since. Even though BTC remained within the six-digit territory for over a month after that calamity, it felt as if it were on borrowed time and, inevitably, plunged below those levels to end the year at under $88,000. This meant a 6% yearly decline. Moreover, it was the first post-halving year to end in the red . Most Room for Growth in 2026? While all of that was unravelling, other financial assets soared. This is particularly true for precious metals as the two largest marked consecutive all-time highs, ending the year with a 65% surge (gold) and 150% increase (silver). The S&P finished with an 18% jump. Even if we examine their performance only since the aforementioned BTC ATH, the cryptocurrency pales in comparison . Data from Santiment shows that gold has gained 11% in those three months, while the S&P 500 is up by 3%. In contrast, BTC has tumbled by 26% as it now stagnates at $90,000. However, the analytics company believes this actually means that BTC and crypto as a whole could have the most significant upside for a 2026 rebound. Since Bitcoin’s $126K all-time high back on October 6th, cryptocurrencies have trailed equities and gold significantly. The past 3-month returns are: Gold: +11% S&P 500: +3% Bitcoin $BTC : -26% The crypto upside is there for a 2026 rebound. https://t.co/MwzVCs85Al pic.twitter.com/LYyxlMm63d — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 9, 2026 The post Do Bitcoin and Altcoins Have the Most Room for Growth in 2026? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Gold,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-01-11 13:45:16

Investigative reporting citing blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs said IRGC-linked entities moved close to $1 billion in cryptocurrency since early 2023, largely through USDT on the Tron network. The activity reportedly ran through two UK-registered exchanges, Zedcex and Zedxion, which investigators say were used to bypass international sanctions. The reported figure refers to transaction volume, not assets seized or frozen. However, headlines and social media posts quickly framed the finding as “Tether freezing $1 billion,” prompting confusion across crypto markets and policy circles. Tether has repeatedly said it cooperates with law enforcement and complies with sanctions requests. The company maintains the ability to freeze USDT at the address level when wallets are formally sanctioned or flagged by authorities. What Investigators Found in the IRGC-linked Flows TRM Labs said it identified IRGC-linked activity by tracking deposits, withdrawals, and wallet infrastructure tied to the two exchanges. According to the analysis, IRGC-associated crypto flows totaled about $24 million in 2023, surged to roughly $619 million in 2024, and reached around $410 million in 2025. Most of the funds moved in USDT, reflecting the stablecoin’s liquidity and acceptance across offshore trading venues. Investigators said Tron’s low transaction fees and fast settlement made it the preferred network for these transfers. The findings were shared with journalists and cited as part of broader reporting on how sanctioned actors continue to access crypto rails despite global compliance frameworks. What Tether Actually Froze Separately, documented enforcement actions show far smaller amounts were frozen. In September 2025, Israel’s National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing published a list of 187 wallet addresses it linked to IRGC activity. Following that designation, Tether blacklisted 39 of those addresses, freezing about $1.5 million in USDT held in those wallets at the time, according to blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic. That distinction matters. The $1 billion figure reflects cumulative crypto movement, while the freeze involved only balances present in sanctioned wallets when action occurred. Tether has not confirmed freezing anything close to $1 billion in a single enforcement move. The episode highlights the gap between tracking illicit crypto flows and actually seizing assets, as regulators and stablecoin issuers continue to face pressure over sanctions enforcement in global crypto markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|USDT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-11 13:58:00

Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-has-printed-macd-golden-cross-heres-what-to-expect/,"Early signals on higher timeframes rarely arrive with noise, but the breakouts can be life-changing. A recent post from crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) highlights one of those moments for XRP. The focus sits on the 5-Day MACD, where a key crossover now aligns with improving momentum. The chart he shared places attention on a developing trend rather than a short-term reaction, which gives the signal added weight. $XRP has printed a Golden Cross on its 5-Day MACD with a switch into positive on the histogram. The last time this signal printed was in July, where $XRP rallied to a new ATH. pic.twitter.com/LdCYU709Kt — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 9, 2026 ChartNerd Flags a 5-Day MACD Golden Cross ChartNerd wrote that XRP “has printed a Golden Cross on its 5-Day MACD with a switch into positive on the histogram.” The chart shows the MACD line crossing above the signal line near the zero level. The histogram flipped from red to green at the same time. This combination indicates a change in momentum direction on a higher timeframe. The 5-Day setting smooths volatility and reduces noise. Traders often view signals on these higher timeframes as more durable . The chart also highlights the crossover points with visual markers. These appear after an extended period of negative momentum. The histogram bars had been contracting toward zero before the flip. That contraction often signals selling pressure fading. The positive print confirms momentum has turned constructive rather than merely paused. Historical Context from the July Signal ChartNerd added context by referencing the last occurrence of this setup. He noted that the last time XRP printed this signal was July 2025. The rally that followed pushed the asset to a new all-time high . That comparison anchors the current signal within XRP’s recent technical history. On the chart, the earlier signal followed a rounded bottom in the MACD structure. The current setup shows a comparable curvature. The MACD lines flatten, then turn higher. The histogram shifts incrementally rather than spiking. This pattern often reflects controlled accumulation instead of abrupt speculation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? The current MACD crossover suggests momentum favors continuation. Sustained green histogram bars would reinforce the signal. Expansion above the zero line would further validate trend strength. Price behavior around recent consolidation zones will matter. XRP recently surpassed the $2 resistance and turned it into support. Holding above this support while momentum builds would align with the MACD signal. A rising MACD slope would indicate strengthening trend pressure rather than a shallow bounce. Follow-through will depend on consistency across upcoming candles. For technical traders, this chart presents a clear structure to monitor as XRP enters the next phase of its trend.

Rather than leaning on long-term promises, the exchange has spent 2025 shipping. For its growing community, the past year has been marked by the sleek, performance-driven EarnBIT 2.0 interface, the expansion of its launchpad, the successful integration of its EarniFi “learn and earn” platform, and the ongoing IEO. But features aren’t what users talk about most. What comes up instead is execution — fewer announcements, more things that actually work. A collective focus on utility and participation is the central thread pulling EarnBIT into 2026. Its roadmap blends financial infrastructure with community and content creation — a clear step beyond the traditional CEX model, with live video at the core. Vision for 2026: Streaming, AI & Deepened Utility The most talked-about milestone for early 2026 is the Video Streaming MVP — and it’s also the biggest test of the platform’s new direction. EarnBIT will integrate trusted creator streams directly into the trading interface, so users can learn, discuss, and potentially act — all within one environment. For many, this is less about entertainment and more about context and trust in a crowded market. Supporting this new social layer will be advanced KYB verification and a universal fiat gateway, streamlining both security and onboarding. A full derivatives section (perps, options) will cater to traders seeking more sophisticated instruments without leaving the platform. The long-anticipated Token Generation Event (TGE) for the platform’s EBT token (now available in an IEO) is slated for Q2, alongside listings on external CEXs and DEXs. A Staking & Rewards Program will give EBT a role users can actually feel — staking, rewards, and participation — while an AI-based moderation prototype will keep the streaming layer usable and credible. By Q3, the streaming service evolves with multiplatform streaming, copy trading, and donation functionality, transforming into an interactive, monetizable ecosystem for creators and a dynamic resource for users who want more than passive content. The year culminates in Q4 with AI-powered analytics for deeper market insights and a suite of monetization tools for streamers, solidifying the creator economy. An expansion of the supported asset range will ensure the underlying CEX grows in parallel. From Utility to Community EarnBIT reviews suggest the platform has solidified its utility foundation. It is betting big on community and building a new type of collaborative environment — weaving together live video, token utilities, and advanced trading. If executed well, the EarnBIT of 2026 will feel less like a financial terminal and more like a vibrant hub where the lines between watching, learning, and trading truly blur.

Momentum is returning, risk appetite is rising, and capital is flowing back into high-upside plays. Right as the market flips bullish, XYZVerse, the world’s first all-sports crypto-based e-platform, is approaching one of its biggest milestones yet: the Token Generation Event (TGE) and $XYZ token listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, scheduled for the end of January 2026. For a project that has spent months building, fundraising, and rolling out live utility, the timing couldn’t be better. XYZVerse at a Glance: A Listing the Market Has Been Waiting For XYZVerse is stepping into the spotlight as a sports-powered Web3 ecosystem that fuses meme-coin energy, real platform utility, and competitive gaming into a single high-impact product built to attract a massive global audience. The project has already proven its momentum, raising over $15 million in its presale and unveiling its flagship on-chain Counter-Strike 2 League featuring a $5.5 million prize pool, set to go live as the ecosystem opens to the public. Why XYZVerse Is Turning Heads🔥 A unique, first-of-its-kind concept at the intersection of crypto, sports, and memes taps into one of the largest and most engaged audiences in Web3 Real, playable utility built in: $XYZ is actively used across the ecosystem to join games and leagues, participate in predictions and voting, unlock digital items and rewards, and power on-chain engagement Officially recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , cementing its status as a standout in the meme-coin space Rock-solid security, backed by audited smart contracts verified by Pessimistic and SolidProof Massive upside narrative, with long-term projections pointing toward up to 99,900% growth from early-stage levels Where XYZVerse Fits: Meme Energy + Sports Utility + Esports Execution XYZVerse is trying to sit at the intersection of both worlds: meme culture (attention engine) sports + esports participation (retention engine) on-chain mechanics (verifiable engagement + reward rails) That positioning is important because it aligns with where late-2025 narratives were heading: memes still matter, but utility is increasingly the filter. The clearest demonstration of this approach so far is XYZVerse’s flagship CS2 League, which moves engagement beyond passive spectatorship and into active participation. Rather than simply watching matches, users are encouraged to return through Access Passes, voting and prediction mechanics, and on-chain reward distribution, creating a repeatable product loop instead of a one-off event. XYZVerse CS2 League: Bringing Esports On-Chain XYZVerse’s CS2 League, the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 esports league, represents one of the earliest large-scale attempts to connect blockchain infrastructure directly with mainstream competitive gaming. The league features: 10 teams competing in intense 5v5 MR12 matches Teams composed of top KOLs, project founders, and community players, with community participation selected via lottery from Access Pass holders A combined 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 $XYZ prize pool Fan-driven interaction, including map voting, match predictions, and digital moment collection Privacy-aware options such as masked play, alongside encouraged co-streaming On-chain transparency across match results, voting, and reward distribution Participation is enabled through 100 USDT Access Passes, which allow fans to vote, predict outcomes, access exclusive content, and collect digital collectibles tied directly to league activity. Every interaction is recorded on-chain, reinforcing transparency and accountability. Industry observers note that this combination of live esports competition and token-driven interaction sets XYZVerse apart from traditional meme projects, which often struggle to sustain engagement once initial attention fades. By embedding utility directly into the viewing and participation experience, the CS2 League offers a practical example of how meme-born projects can evolve into platforms with recurring usage. With an expected 1 million or more cumulative views across streaming platforms, the CS2 League positions XYZVerse at the crossroads of esports visibility and Web3 experimentation — a convergence that could define its next phase as it approaches its public market debut. Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! What Awaits $XYZ in 2026: From Breakout to Moonshot $XYZ is entering 2026 with serious momentum already locked in. Following a presale that surged from $0.0001 to $0.00715, the token has already delivered over 7,000% growth before public trading even begins — a clear signal of sustained demand across multiple stages and market conditions. The countdown toTGE and major exchange listings is on, with $XYZ expected to enter public markets at a starting price of $0.10. The open-market price discovery means that the ceiling is no longer defined by staged pricing. Instead, valuation begins to reflect real demand. Those who secure exposure before the listing benefit from first-mover advantage, while the broader market reacts after $XYZ hits exchanges and momentum accelerates. Price Discovery Mode: Where Momentum Takes Over Post-listing, $XYZ will no longer be constrained by presale mechanics. Instead, price action will be shaped by real-time market forces, including: Deepening liquidity across CEX and DEX platforms Rising trading volume as new buyers enter Explosive sentiment around meme + sports + esports tokens in early 2026 Most importantly, live platform utility, led by the CS2 League converting attention into on-chain demand This is the phase where breakout tokens separate from the pack — and XYZVerse is entering it with multiple engines already running. 🟢Strong Foundation Scenario: Utility Takes Hold Indicative range: $0.12 – $0.18Potential upside from listing: +20% to +80% In this scenario, XYZVerse executes cleanly out of the gate. The CS2 League launches as planned, Access Pass participation remains active, and on-chain interactions begin forming steady, repeat usage. As the market starts pricing in real esports utility rather than pure speculation, volatility stabilizes and $XYZ naturally moves above its listing level. This outcome alone would already place XYZVerse ahead of many meme-origin projects that struggle to retain engagement post-listing. 🔥 Acceleration Scenario: Visibility + Demand Collide Indicative range: $0.20 – $0.30Potential upside from listing: +100% to +200% Here, momentum begins to stack. High engagement across the CS2 League, rising visibility through streams and KOL participation, and growing transactional demand for $XYZ create a feedback loop. As sentiment around meme, sports, and esports tokens turns increasingly bullish in early 2026, XYZVerse benefits directly from all three narratives at once. In this environment, $XYZ could quickly trade at 2–3× its listing price, reflecting a market repricing driven by usage, exposure, and ecosystem activity — not hype alone. 🏆 Breakout Scenario: Ecosystem Momentum Unleashed Indicative range: $0.40 – $0.60Potential upside from listing: +300% to +500% This is the scenario where XYZVerse fully separates from the pack. It assumes the project successfully converts early traction into sustained ecosystem growth: League expansion, early brand and creator partnerships, visible buybacks, and strong community retention all begin reinforcing each other. At this stage, $XYZ starts to be valued less like an early-stage meme token and more like an engagement-driven Web3 platform with recurring activity and real revenue dynamics. Under these conditions, the market can justify a higher valuation bracket — and momentum has room to accelerate further as 2026 progresses. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Sustainability Initiative: Post-Listing Support for $XYZ After the TGE and exchange listings, XYZVerse will activate its Sustainability Initiative, designed to support $XYZ once it begins public trading. Under this model, 10% of net profits from partner projects are periodically used to buy back $XYZ on the open market, with all transactions executed through a public, verifiable wallet. For token holders, this model has several important implications after listing: Consistent buy pressure: Market buybacks introduce recurring demand for $XYZ, independent of short-term speculation. Supply reduction: Tokens acquired through buybacks may be removed from circulation, gradually reducing available supply over time. Alignment with platform success: As ecosystem revenue grows, the scale of buybacks can grow with it — directly linking platform performance to token dynamics. This approach directly links platform success to token performance — rewarding long-term holders through real revenue rather than hype. The Final Whistle Before the Listing XYZVerse is charging toward its January 2026 TGE and exchange listings fully battle-ready and backed by a strong presale, a live crypto-powered CS2 esports league, and a utility-driven token model built for real demand. With upcoming listings across major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid security confirmed by audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team behind the project, XYZVerse is entering the market ahead of the game. This is the final stretch before listing!

After securing over $15 million in presale funding, building a fast-growing global community, and launching its first live esports product, the project has officially confirmed its TGE and exchange listings on major exchanges for the end of January 2026. This move takes XYZVerse out of presale mode and into full public market participation, opening the door to broader liquidity, open price discovery, and large-scale exposure. XYZVerse approaches this moment with working infrastructure, active engagement, and a clear product narrative already in motion. XYZVerse – the ultimate sports-themed memeverse At its core, XYZVerse is a multi-title esports platform built around competitive play, sports, and blockchain, all powered by the $XYZ token. It combines the viral energy of meme culture with competitive sports of all kinds, be it football, MMA, or Dota 2, creating a platform where players and fans can actively participate rather than simply speculate. 🔥Why XYZVerse Is Getting Attention in the Market of Memecoins A one-of-a-kind concept bringing together crypto, sports, and meme culture — opening the door to one of the largest and most active audiences in Web3 Built-in, playable utility from day one: $XYZ powers real activity across the platform, from joining games and leagues to voting, predictions, digital items, rewards, and on-chain engagement Officially recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project, underlining XYZVerse’s breakout position in the meme-coin space Rock-solid security, with smart contracts audited and verified by Pessimistic and SolidProof A high-conviction upside narrative, with long-term projections pointing toward up to 99,900% growth from early-stage levels Join the ultimate sports memeverse and explore $XYZ as the project approaches its next major milestone. Proof of Utility: The World’s First On-Chain CS2 League XYZVerse isn’t positioning itself on promises alone. It is already delivering real-world utility through its flagship product: the world’s first on-chain Counter-Strike 2 League. The XYZVerse CS2 League is a crypto-powered esports tournament that merges competitive gaming with on-chain infrastructure, demonstrating how the platform operates in practice. Key highlights include: 10 teams will compete in intense 5v5 MR12 matches Teams composed of top KOLs, project founders, and community players, with community participation selected via lottery from Access Pass holders A 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 XYZ prize pool Fan-driven interaction, including map voting, match predictions, and reward-based engagement Digital collectibles and on-chain transparency, ensuring verifiable results and fair distribution Privacy-first options, such as masked play, alongside encouraged co-streaming for broader reach Participation is unlocked through the XYZVerse Access Pass, priced at 100 USDT, which grants: - Voting and prediction rights - Lottery entries to play in the league - Access to exclusive VODs and content - Deeper integration into the XYZVerse ecosystem With an expected 1 million+ views across streams, the CS2 League showcases XYZVerse as a functioning platform — not a theoretical one — and highlights how esports, blockchain, and community engagement intersect in a live environment. Secure your spot now before passes sell out! What Else Makes XYZVerse Special? At its core, XYZVerse is built around the idea that interaction with the platform itself becomes the engine of value creation. Most crypto projects generate income that flows primarily to the team or company. XYZVerse introduces a different model through its Revenue Router — a system that automatically redistributes platform revenue back into the ecosystem. In simple terms: XYZVerse is trying to turn a gaming platform into a self-feeding engine where usage automatically rewards the token and the players instead of just enriching the company. How the Revenue Router Works Whenever XYZVerse generates revenue — through competitions, games, betting mechanics, or other platform activity — that revenue is deterministically routed into three core areas: Token buybacks: A portion of revenue is used to buy $XYZ tokens from the open market, increasing demand. Token burns: Some of the tokens purchased are permanently removed from circulation, gradually reducing total supply. Prize pools and ecosystem growth: Funds are directed toward rewards, tournaments, incentives, and platform expansion to attract new users and retain existing ones. This creates a closed-loop value system: more players and fans lead to more activity, more activity generates more revenue, and that revenue strengthens the token and the platform itself. Sustainability Initiative: Supporting the Token, Rewarding Long-Term Holders Following the Token Generation Event, XYZVerse will activate its Sustainability Initiative, designed to reinforce long-term ecosystem health and align platform success with token holder value. As part of this initiative, 10% of net profits generated by XYZVerse partner projects will be periodically allocated toward buying back $XYZ tokens on the open market. These buybacks are not discretionary or opaque. All purchases are executed through a publicly visible buyback wallet, allowing the community to independently verify transactions and ensuring full transparency. The objective of the Sustainability Initiative is threefold: Support token demand through consistent market buybacks Reduce circulating supply by removing tokens from active circulation over time Reward long-term holders by aligning token dynamics with real revenue generation Rather than relying on inflationary rewards or short-term incentives, XYZVerse’s approach is designed to create a measured, sustainable feedback loop where ecosystem growth directly benefits the token economy. Presale Success and Market Position The XYZVerse presale has shown strong market confidence and support from a vibrant crypto community. The presale began at an initial price of $0.0001 and has since progressed to $0.00715, representing a 71× increase while still in the presale stage. This growth highlights consistent interest from early participants ahead of the project’s transition to public markets. According to project disclosures, a potential listing price of $0.10 has been outlined, positioning the upcoming TGE as a key moment for broader price discovery once the token becomes publicly tradable. From a security and transparency standpoint, the $XYZ token has undergone independent smart contract audits by both Pessimistic and SolidProof, and the core team has completed KYC verification, reinforcing a commitment to operational credibility and user trust. Looking ahead, XYZVerse has announced plans to list on multiple Tier-1 centralized and decentralized exchanges. Dive into XYZVerse presale before the price moonshots! sWhat Comes Next: Expanding the XYZVerse Ecosystem XYZVerse’s long-term vision extends far beyond a single title or tournament. As the platform evolves, upcoming developments include: Challenge Hubs and prediction markets Marketplace for cosmetics and moments Cross-title ladders and brand integrations Mobile apps, staking, and seasonal governance Supported by partnerships with networks such as Polygon and Gnosis, XYZVerse is positioning itself as a scalable and sustainable sports-focused memeverse built for players, creators, fans, and brands alike. Bottom Line XYZVerse is approaching its January 2026 TGE and exchange listings with a rare combination of factors already in place: a $15M+ presale, a live flagship CS2 League, deflationary token mechanics, audited smart contracts, and a growing ecosystem designed for repeat engagement rather than short-term hype. As the project transitions into its most visible phase, focus now shifts to execution — league expansion, ecosystem growth, community participation, and the activation of revenue-driven incentives that tie platform success directly to the $XYZ token. Presale is still live. The TGE is set. The listing is next. Stay tuned for updates, follow the project’s progress closely, and keep connected as XYZVerse prepares to enter its next and most visible phase.

Faster payouts, broader betting markets, and fewer restrictions are pushing American football fans toward crypto-native platforms. Among them, Dexsport stands out as a no-KYC sportsbook built specifically for on-chain sports betting. This guide explains how NFL betting on Dexsport works, what makes the platform different, and why it has become a preferred choice for crypto NFL bettors. What Makes NFL Crypto Betting Different? Traditional NFL sportsbooks rely on fiat payments, banking intermediaries, and strict identity checks. Crypto NFL betting changes that structure entirely. With crypto betting: Bets are funded directly from your wallet Withdrawals are processed on-chain Account access is not tied to personal documents Settlement speed depends on the blockchain, not the operator Dexsport takes this model further by removing custodial control altogether, allowing users to bet on American football with Bitcoin, USDT, and other cryptocurrencies without KYC. Dexsport Overview: Built for No-KYC NFL Betting Dexsport is a decentralized sportsbook and casino platform designed for users who want full control over their funds. Instead of operating like a traditional betting site that “accepts crypto,” Dexsport is crypto-native from the ground up. Core Platform Snapshot Feature Dexsport KYC Requirement None Supported Cryptos BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, TRON + others Registration Email, Telegram, or wallet connect Betting Type Pre-match & live NFL betting Cash-Out Available on in-play bets Transparency Public on-chain bet tracking This structure makes Dexsport especially attractive for players looking for crypto NFL betting sites without identity verification. How NFL Betting Works on Dexsport NFL betting on Dexsport follows a simple flow, even for first-time crypto users. Create an accountRegister via email, Telegram, or connect a DeFi wallet. No documents required. Deposit cryptocurrencyFund your account using Bitcoin, stablecoins, or other supported assets. Choose an NFL marketSelect pre-match odds or switch to live betting once the game starts. Manage your bet in real timeUse Cash-Out to lock profit or reduce exposure before the final whistle. This process allows users to bet on American football using crypto with minimal friction. NFL Betting Markets Available on Dexsport Dexsport focuses on quality and depth rather than flooding the interface with obscure options. NFL bettors will find all major market types, plus advanced live options. Popular NFL Betting Options Match winner (Moneyline) Point spread betting Over/Under totals (game and team totals) Player props (touchdowns, yards, receptions) Live betting with dynamic odds Same-game parlays and boosted combos Totals betting is particularly popular among NFL crypto bettors, as it reduces reliance on unpredictable match outcomes and focuses on scoring trends instead. Live NFL Betting and Cash-Out Features One of Dexsport’s strongest advantages is its live crypto NFL betting environment. Odds update in real time Cash-Out is available during active plays Live streams are accessible even without an active balance This setup is ideal for bettors who follow games closely and prefer in-play strategies over static pre-match bets. Bonuses and Rewards for NFL Bettors Dexsport does not rely on vague or restrictive promotions. Instead, its reward system is transparent and flexible. NFL bettors can access: A multi-deposit welcome bonus structure Free bets tied to sports wagering Weekly cashback on losing bets (paid in stablecoins) Monthly Sports Club rewards for active users These incentives are designed to support long-term betting rather than one-time promotions with heavy wagering conditions. Transparency and Fair Play A key concern with crypto betting sites is trust. Dexsport addresses this directly through on-chain transparency. Every wager is logged publicly, allowing users to: View live bets placed on the platform Track outcomes independently Verify settlement without relying on internal reports This model removes the “black box” common in traditional sportsbooks and makes Dexsport one of the more transparent crypto NFL betting platforms available.

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $3,321.49 and a minimum price of $2,797.05. By 2032, BNB’s price could surge to $6,817.80 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. In September 2020, Binance introduced BNB Smart Chain, which was initially designed for trading and transferring tokens and runs parallel to Binance Chain and supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2026 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

Binance Coin price analysis gives bullish prediction as the current market sentiment turns positive. The coin’s price also increased to $911.1 as buying momentum surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $928. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $889. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $6,817.80 in 2032. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $911.1, as bulls target $928. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.26 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding it above $800. BNB can cross the $1000 again in 2026 anytime. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction , BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2028, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $6,817.80 by 2032. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice. Recent news/opinions on BNB The BNB Chain has announced the Fermi hard fork upgrade.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November. By the end of November, the price of BNB declined below $800. In early December, BNB price triggered a strong bull run toward $900. At the start of 2026, BNB is trending near the $870 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-11 14:29:44

Faster payouts, global access, and better privacy are pushing bettors away from fiat and toward Bitcoin and stablecoins. But not every sportsbook handles NFL crypto betting equally well. Some platforms shine with deep markets and smooth live betting. Others focus on speed, anonymity, or multi-coin support. Below, we review the best crypto betting sites for American football, starting with a clear standout. Why Crypto Is Becoming the Standard for NFL Betting Before jumping into platforms, it’s worth asking a simple question:Why do so many players now prefer crypto NFL betting sites? Because crypto solves several long-standing problems at once: Payments settle faster than cards or bank transfers BTC and stablecoins work globally, without banking friction Fees are often lower (or nonexistent) Privacy is significantly stronger Many platforms offer crypto-only bonuses and better odds For American football bettors placing weekly wagers, parlays, and live bets, these advantages compound quickly. #1 Dexsport — The Most Complete NFL Crypto Betting Platform When it comes to crypto NFL betting, Dexsport clearly sits in a league of its own. Unlike platforms that merely accept crypto, Dexsport is built around it. The entire sportsbook operates with blockchain transparency, multi-chain payments, and no mandatory identity checks. What makes Dexsport ideal for NFL betting? First — coverage and depth. Dexsport focuses on popular, high-liquidity sports, and American football is one of them. NFL matches come with: Mainline markets (moneyline, spreads, totals) Alternative totals and handicaps Player props (touchdowns, yards, receptions) Live betting with real-time odds updates Early Cash Out options to manage risk mid-game Second — flexibility. You can bet using Bitcoin, USDT, ETH, BNB, TRON, and dozens of other coins across multiple networks. Deposits and withdrawals are fast and fee-efficient. Third — transparency. Every bet is logged on-chain, and the public betting desk allows users to verify activity in real time. That level of openness is rare among crypto NFL betting sites. Key Dexsport highlights for NFL bettors No KYC required (email, Telegram, or wallet sign-up) Supports 40+ cryptocurrencies across 20 networks Competitive odds with pre-match and live markets Cash Out available for in-play NFL bets Weekly cashback up to 15% on losses (paid in stablecoins) One of the strongest bonus systems in crypto betting For players looking for safe NFL betting with BTC and stablecoins, Dexsport sets the benchmark. #2 Stake — Strong Odds and Massive Market Coverage (With KYC) Stake remains one of the most recognizable names in crypto betting, and its NFL offering is solid. The platform delivers: Competitive NFL odds (low margins) Live betting with stats, streaming, and Cash Out Support for BTC, USDT, ETH, and many altcoins A broad sportsbook covering far beyond American football That said, Stake requires KYC for withdrawals, which may be a deal-breaker for users prioritizing anonymity. Bonuses are generous, but wagering requirements can be demanding. Stake works best for players who value odds depth and don’t mind identity verification. #3 Vave — Feature-Rich NFL Betting With Fiat-Like UX Vave positions itself as a high-performance hybrid sportsbook, and its NFL markets reflect that. American football bettors get access to: Deep pre-match and live markets Player props and long-term NFL futures Cash Out and live streaming Support for BTC, USDT, and multiple altcoins The interface is polished and mobile-friendly, but full KYC is required at withdrawal stage, and bonus wagering requirements are relatively high. Vave suits users who want a familiar sportsbook experience with crypto payments layered on top. #4 BetPanda — Privacy-First Crypto Betting With Limited NFL Depth BetPanda leans heavily into anonymity and simplicity. It allows NFL betting with no KYC unless flagged, fast crypto payments, and a clean interface. The downside is depth: NFL markets are more limited compared to larger platforms, and advanced live features are sparse. Still, for bettors who value privacy over complexity, BetPanda remains a respectable option. #5 Lucky Block — Flexible Crypto NFL Betting with Low Entry Barriers Lucky Block is a hybrid crypto platform that combines sportsbook, casino, and esports betting under one ecosystem. For NFL and American football fans, Lucky Block stands out due to its low minimum deposits, wide crypto support, and fast payouts without mandatory identity checks. The platform accepts BTC, ETH, USDT, SOL, BNB, DOGE, XRP, and several other assets. Crypto withdrawals are often processed within minutes, making it appealing for users who value speed and simplicity. NFL betting markets include match winners, spreads, totals, and live betting options. Why some NFL bettors choose Lucky Block: Very low entry barrier (deposits from €1); Fast BTC and USDT payouts with no platform fees; No KYC required to place bets; Large welcome bonus for new users. That said, Lucky Block is not a dedicated NFL-first sportsbook. Its market depth and advanced betting tools are more limited compared to platforms that focus heavily on American football. Still, for players looking for flexible crypto NFL betting with generous bonuses, it remains a solid alternative. Quick Comparison: Top NFL Crypto Betting Sites Platform NFL Market Depth Supported Cryptos KYC Policy Bonuses Best Suited For Dexsport High (deep markets, live bets, props) 40+ coins across 20 networks (BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, TRON) No KYC 480% bonus + free bets + cashback Serious NFL bettors, privacy-focused players Stake High 17+ coins (BTC, ETH, USDT, DOGE) KYC for withdrawals 200% bonus + VIP rewards High-volume bettors, sharp odds seekers Vave Medium–High BTC, ETH, USDT, DOGE, SOL, more KYC at withdrawal stage Up to 100% bonus + cashback Live betting & prop markets BetPanda Medium 13+ cryptocurrencies Mostly No KYC 100% bonus + weekly cashback Casual NFL bettors & casino users Lucky Block Medium BTC, ETH, USDT, SOL, BNB, DOGE No KYC 200% bonus + free spins Low-stakes NFL betting, fast payouts Summing It Up Crypto betting has become a natural evolution for NFL fans who value speed, flexibility, and control over their bankroll. Bitcoin and stablecoins remove many of the traditional barriers found in fiat sportsbooks—slow withdrawals, account freezes, and excessive verification steps—while opening the door to live betting, prop markets, and in-play action without friction. Among the available options, Dexsport clearly sets itself apart by combining deep NFL market coverage with full anonymity and on-chain transparency. Its no-KYC access, broad multi-chain support, and advanced live betting tools make it especially appealing to players who want more than just basic match odds. Other platforms can serve specific needs—whether it’s high liquidity, low minimum bets, or hybrid casino access—but they often introduce trade-offs in terms of verification, market depth, or payout speed. For bettors who want a modern, crypto-native NFL betting experience that prioritizes privacy, fast settlement, and long-term flexibility, Dexsport offers the most complete solution. It reflects where crypto sports betting is heading—and why more American football fans are choosing blockchain-based platforms over traditional sportsbooks.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2026-01-11 14:30:57

57071139,https://bitzo.com/2026/01/how-storytelling-shapes-visibility-in-crypto-role-of-narrative-in-crypto-pr,1768142300,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/57071139.jpeg,How Storytelling Shapes Visibility in Crypto: Role of Narrative in Crypto PR,https://bitzo.com/2026/01/how-storytelling-shapes-visibility-in-crypto-role-of-narrative-in-crypto-pr,"In crypto, activity is often mistaken for visibility. Teams ship features, publish updates, and announce milestones, assuming attention will follow. It often doesn’t. What cuts through isn’t volume, but clarity—and clarity comes from narrative. In crypto public relations, storytelling has little to do with slogans or dramatization. It is about explaining why a project exists, how it fits into the market, and why its development matters beyond internal progress. Many projects stall not because they stop building, but because they fail to communicate that logic to the outside world. Based on its work with Web3 companies, Outset PR has observed this pattern repeatedly. Crypto Media Covers Context, Not Changelogs Crypto media processes a constant flow of launches. New chains, protocols, and platforms arrive every month, often described in similar terms. Feature lists blur together. Roadmaps compete for attention. Editors rarely cover updates in isolation. They cover relevance—how a release connects to a broader market shift, a regulatory change, or a recurring industry problem. Communities respond in much the same way. They don’t organize around timelines. They organize around shared purpose. Outset PR approaches communication with this in mind. A feature is never treated as the story on its own. The story is the problem it addresses, and why that response matters in the current market environment. From Product Releases to Market Narratives One of the most common failures in crypto PR is confusing internal progress with external significance. Teams understand why a release matters. Readers usually don’t. Outset PR reframes product updates as responses to real market conditions. A governance upgrade is positioned within wider discussions about accountability and rushed decision-making in DeFi. An infrastructure release is connected to scaling failures exposed during previous market cycles. The product itself does not change. The framing does. That context makes the information usable for journalists and accessible to non-technical audiences. Positioning Comes Before Promotion Narrative work in crypto PR begins with positioning. Positioning defines the logic behind a project’s existence—what problem the founders identified early, what assumptions shaped development, and which trade-offs were made along the way. Outset PR works with teams to articulate this foundation before any outreach begins. Once established, it guides media angles, founder commentary, and community communication. Each public message reinforces the same underlying story. Over time, this consistency makes a project easier to recognize and easier to place within the broader market. One Narrative Across Media and Community Channels Crypto PR operates across different channels that function in distinct ways. Journalists and communities consume information differently, but both respond to coherence. Outset PR maintains a single narrative while adjusting emphasis. Media communication focuses on relevance to industry discussions and market trends. Community communication emphasizes direction, progress, and participation. The narrative itself remains stable across both. This approach prevents fragmentation and preserves a clear project identity. Timing and Narrative Alignment Narratives gain traction when they align with what the market is already discussing. Crypto cycles are shaped by regulation, infrastructure constraints, and shifts in user behavior. Outset PR tracks these cycles to identify moments where a project’s development naturally intersects with broader industry focus. Communication launched during these windows integrates more easily into existing coverage. The message remains consistent; the timing changes. What Storytelling Achieves in Crypto PR Narrative creates continuity in a fragmented information environment. Journalists gain clear reference points for coverage. Communities gain a sense of direction. Investors gain insight into how a team thinks beyond short-term releases. Projects that communicate through storytelling build recognition over time. In a sector dominated by constant announcements, narrative provides structure—and often determines whether a project is briefly noticed or actually understood.

It’s no longer just about placing a quick wager on a CS2 match or following your favorite Dota 2 team. Today, serious eSports bettors care about execution speed, flexible bankroll management, and access to platforms that actually understand how digital-native audiences bet. That shift naturally pushed crypto sportsbooks forward. And now, the conversation has moved one step further — from “Bitcoin betting” to crypto betting with multiple coins , including stablecoins and fast altcoins that fit the pace of eSports markets. Why eSports Bettors Use Altcoins Alongside Bitcoin Bitcoin remains the foundation of crypto betting. It’s trusted, liquid, and widely accepted. But eSports betting has its own rhythm — fast rounds, constant live markets, and frequent small-to-medium stakes. That’s where altcoins come into play. Many eSports bettors now use altcoins alongside Bitcoin, not instead of it. Why? Because altcoins solve practical problems: stablecoins remove volatility from live betting, low-fee networks make frequent bets cheaper, faster block times reduce friction during in-play action. For example, placing a live Dota 2 bet using USDT feels very different from doing the same with BTC. Your stake value stays constant. Your exposure is clearer. Decisions become simpler, especially during long series or multi-map matches. Bitcoin is still the backbone.Altcoins simply make the experience smoother. That combination is what modern online crypto sportsbook users are actually looking for. What Makes a Good Crypto Sportsbook for eSports Betting Not every crypto sportsbook is built for eSports. Some platforms support crypto payments but still treat eSports as a secondary category with limited depth. A good eSports-focused crypto sportsbook should get a few things right from the start. First — market relevance.CS2 and Dota 2 are not optional. They need proper pre-match odds, live betting, and series-based markets. Second — speed and stability.Odds updates must keep up with in-game events. Delays during live betting can turn value into frustration very quickly. Third — altcoin support that actually works.It’s not enough to list a coin. Deposits, withdrawals, and balances must feel native, not bolted on. And finally — user freedom.Clear rules, predictable payouts, and minimal friction matter more than flashy promotions for most experienced eSports bettors. The best crypto sportsbook sites for eSports are the ones that combine: real eSports focus, Bitcoin and altcoin flexibility, fast live betting execution, and transparent conditions. In the next block, we’ll look at the platforms that currently delivers all of this at scale. Comparison of Crypto Sportsbooks Platform eSports Focus Altcoins Supported KYC Policy Live Betting & Streaming Best For Dexsport ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (CS2, Dota 2, Valorant, more) 38+ coins across 20 networks (BTC, ETH, USDT, BNB, TRON, etc.) ❌ No KYC ✅ Live betting, Cash Out, live odds Serious eSports bettors who want privacy, flexibility, and transparency Vave ⭐⭐⭐⭐ BTC, ETH, USDT, DOGE, LTC, BCH, XRP, TRX, SOL ⚠️ KYC at withdrawal ✅ Strong live betting & cash-out Players who want a smooth UI and broad sports + eSports coverage Lucky Block ⭐⭐⭐⭐ BTC, ETH, BCH, DOGE, LTC, SOL, BNB, XRP, USDT ❌ No KYC (unless flagged) ⚠️ Limited live tools Bonus-focused users and casual eSports bettors Thunderpick ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (eSports-first) BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE, USDT, XRP ⚠️ Conditional KYC ✅ Live betting + streams Hardcore eSports fans focused on CS2 & Dota 2 Dexsport — Best Altcoin-Friendly Crypto Sportsbook for eSports When it comes to eSports betting with crypto, Dexsport clearly operates in a different category. The platform wasn’t built around traditional sports and later expanded into eSports. Instead, it was designed from the ground up as a Web3-native sportsbook, which is exactly what modern eSports bettors expect. Coverage is strong where it matters most. CS2 and Dota 2 are treated as core markets, not side content. You’ll find pre-match odds, live betting, map-based markets, and series outcomes — all updating smoothly during play. This is especially important for eSports, where momentum can shift in seconds. What really sets Dexsport apart is its altcoin-first flexibility. Bitcoin is fully supported, but bettors can also use stablecoins and fast networks without friction. That makes a noticeable difference for live betting, where speed, clarity, and predictable stake value matter more than anything else. Registration is instant and no-KYC by default. You can enter the platform via email, Telegram, or a DeFi wallet, place bets immediately, and withdraw winnings without account reviews slowing things down. For eSports fans used to fast-paced digital environments, this feels natural. Dexsport also balances incentives well. Instead of focusing purely on casino bonuses, the platform offers: sports-oriented free bets, weekly cashback for active bettors, and a loyalty structure that actually rewards consistent eSports play. Add transparent on-chain bet tracking and audited infrastructure into the mix, and Dexsport becomes one of the most complete crypto sportsbook solutions for eSports fans who want Bitcoin and altcoins working together. Besides Dexsport, there are several crypto betting platforms that support altcoins and offer access to eSports markets. Each of them targets a slightly different audience and betting style. Vave Vave positions itself as a fast, all-in-one sportsbook and casino with broad altcoin support. It covers major eSports titles alongside traditional sports and stands out for its smooth in-play betting and cash-out functionality. The platform supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and offers a polished live betting experience, although higher wagering requirements and mandatory KYC at withdrawal may be a drawback for some users. Lucky Block Lucky Block combines casino, sportsbook, and eSports betting under one ecosystem. It supports many popular altcoins and is known for fast payouts and a generous welcome bonus. eSports markets are available and easy to access, but the platform leans more toward high-volume promotions and broad coverage rather than deep, pro-level eSports betting tools. Thunderpick Thunderpick is heavily focused on eSports, especially CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant. It supports multiple cryptocurrencies and offers live betting with streams and competitive odds. While its eSports depth is solid, limited traditional sports features and occasional withdrawal delays make it less flexible compared to more multi-vertical platforms. Popular Altcoins Used in eSports Crypto Betting Altcoins didn’t become popular in eSports betting by accident. Different coins serve different betting styles, and experienced players often mix them depending on how they approach CS2 or Dota 2 markets. Here are the most commonly used options: USDT (Tether)The go-to choice for live betting. Stable value makes it easier to manage bankrolls during long BO3 or BO5 series. No volatility, no distractions. BNB / TRXOften chosen for low fees and fast confirmations. These coins work well for frequent bets, especially when placing multiple wagers across a single match. SOL / MATICPopular among more active eSports bettors thanks to fast networks and smooth transaction flow. Useful when speed matters and markets move quickly. Bitcoin (BTC)Still widely used for pre-match bets and higher-stake positions. Many bettors keep BTC as their base balance and switch to altcoins for live action. The key point is flexibility. A good crypto sportsbook doesn’t force you into one option — it lets you choose what fits the situation. Why Betting with Altcoins Can Be Smarter Than Bitcoin (in Some Cases) Is Bitcoin always the best choice for eSports betting?Not necessarily. Altcoins offer a few practical advantages that become obvious once you start betting regularly: Lower volatility means clearer decision-making during live matches. Faster settlements help when placing multiple bets in quick succession. Lower network fees reduce friction for smaller, frequent wagers. That doesn’t make Bitcoin obsolete. It simply means altcoins complement it. For many eSports bettors, the most effective setup is hybrid: Bitcoin for long-term positions and value bets, altcoins for live betting, props, and fast-paced series. Platforms like Dexsport make this approach easy by supporting multiple coins across different networks without restrictions. Conclusion For eSports bettors who want to use altcoins alongside Bitcoin, Dexsport offers the most complete and future-proof experience. It combines deep CS2, Dota 2, and Valorant markets with no-KYC access, multi-chain support, and transparent on-chain betting. While platforms like Thunderpick, Vave, and Lucky Block each have their strengths, Dexsport stands out for players who value privacy, altcoin flexibility, and real Web3 infrastructure rather than just crypto payments. If you’re betting with USDT, TRX, BNB, or other altcoins — and want full control over your funds — Dexsport is the strongest choice for eSports betting in 2026.",More News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|USDT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2026-01-11 14:39:32

Recent price action suggests buyers are regaining control, placing higher resistance levels back into focus. When focus and narratives constantly shift, sustained visibility is important. This is why data-driven agencies like Outset PR go beyond merely tracking token prices; they also monitor the wider media environment. Outset Data Pulse delivers current intelligence on crypto media performance, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of PR campaigns. BNB Reclaims Key Technical Levels BNB has moved above its 7-day simple moving average near $899 and reclaimed the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $871. These recoveries mark an improvement in short-term structure and signal that recent selling pressure has eased. The shift is reinforced by momentum indicators. The MACD histogram currently stands at +5.6, confirming bullish momentum and increasing participation from buyers. With momentum improving, attention turns to the $907–$921 resistance zone. This range has previously capped upside attempts and represents the next technical hurdle for the market. A decisive daily close above $921.55, which marks the recent swing high, would confirm a breakout and strengthen the bullish setup. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. BNB Price Outlook If BNB clears $921.55, the next technical target lies near $949, corresponding with the 127.2% Fibonacci extension. This level would become the primary upside focus for traders if the breakout holds. BNB’s reclaiming of key moving averages and Fibonacci levels, combined with strengthening momentum, supports a constructive near-term outlook. A confirmed break above $921.55 would likely open the path toward $949, while failure to clear resistance could result in short-term consolidation before the next directional move.

According to recent reports from Coindesk, Lithuania-licensed crypto payments app Brighty has brokered over 100 such deals, enabling high-net-worth clients to bypass traditional banking rails in favor of faster, more streamlined transactions. The trend signals growing confidence in cryptocurrency as a legitimate vehicle for large-scale investments, particularly as traditional banks remain hesitant to process such deals. THE WEALTHY ARE USING CRYPTO TO BUY REAL ESTATE Hundreds of wealthy investors are using crypto to purchase property across Europe. Brighty co-founder Nikolay Denisenko reveals the firm has already brokered 100+ real estate deals for HNWIs using crypto. pic.twitter.com/nLARidklwc — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) January 10, 2026 Brighty’s platform serves between 100 and 150 wealthy customers whose average monthly spending reaches $50,000, with residential property purchases representing the upper end of transaction volumes across European destinations, including Cyprus and Andorra. Euro Stablecoins Overtake USDC for European Deals Nikolay Denisenko, co-founder and CTO at Brighty App, explained that crypto transactions offer significant advantages over traditional methods like SWIFT, the global interbank payment network used by over 11,000 banks. Converting stablecoins such as USDC into euros eliminates the complexity and delays associated with conventional wire transfers, making the process more efficient for both buyers and sellers. This notable shift has emerged in stablecoin preferences among wealthy customers. While Circle’s USDC previously dominated large transfers, buyers now favor euro-pegged stablecoins to avoid conversion costs when purchasing European properties. Brighty observed average euro-backed transaction sizes surge from €15,785 in Q3 to €59,894 in Q4, as high-net-worth individuals executed major deals in Circle’s EURC rather than USDC. Source: Decta The preference for euro-denominated stablecoins stems from practical financial considerations. “Recently, we have started seeing our customers using euro stablecoins where previously they might have used USDC,” Denisenko said. “Why? Because if you deposit in USDC and you are buying something in Europe, you have a conversion cost. So it’s more convenient to use EURC because you remove any exchange rate.” Looking ahead, Denisenko said Brighty is engaging in numerous conversations with estate agencies to familiarize them with transparent, legitimately acquired crypto holdings as payment methods. Real Estate Sector Embraces Crypto Amid Banking Hesitancy The demand for crypto-powered property deals has intensified as traditional financial institutions continue avoiding such transactions, creating opportunities for specialized platforms. Denisenko said Brighty is now engaging with estate agencies to familiarize them with transparent, legitimately acquired crypto holdings as payment methods. “Our wealthy customers are simply looking to de-risk the assets in their portfolio by putting some of their money into real estate,” he said. Aside from Brighty, luxury brokerage Christie’s International Real Estate launched a dedicated crypto division in July 2025 after completing several high-profile transactions, including a $65 million Beverly Hills property purchased with Bitcoin. CEO Aaron Kirman told the Times that “crypto is here to stay” and the division would facilitate deals “without banks or fiat.” Meanwhile, outside of Europe, RAK Properties partnered with UAE fintech Hubpay last September to accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether for property purchases, opening international markets to digital asset buyers. Dubai’s government-backed tokenized real estate platform aims to tokenize $16 billion worth of properties by 2033, representing approximately 7% of total projected transactions. London’s luxury rental market has also adopted crypto payments, with Knightsbridge Prime Property completing a £45,000 weekly Bitcoin rental transaction through crypto payments platform Bitcashier in March 2024. San Francisco-based Opendoor Technologies also announced plans to accept Bitcoin and cryptocurrency for home purchases in October 2025, CEO Kaz Nejatian confirmed.

The movements can be viewed as a good indication of business prospects in tokens that are still inexpensive and at the initial stage of development. In recent weeks, a number of ETH whales have begun to put capital into a fresh cryptocurrency with a price of less than the equivalent of $0.5. This has resulted in speculation on how the token can be positioned too far high with it coming closer to its protocol launch. The project that has attracted this attention is a relatively new crypto lending project called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is soon to be deployed on the mainnet and have its exchange listing. Ethereum (ETH) Ethernet (ETH) continues to be the second biggest cryptocurrency globally. It is trading at around $3,100, and has a market capitalization of about $380 billion. Ethereum is still used to support decentralized finance and blockchain applications. It has been demonstrated to be mature, have good network effects and a huge developer community. Although ETH is undoubtedly a value in the long term, now a significant number of investors think that it cannot provide a significant multiplier in the following market stage due to its current price range. Analysts note that the $3,500 to $4,000 level has been a good point of resistance. Other predictions put ETH in an intermediate growth trajectory that can work well in giving returns to institutional investors but fail to provide 10x-type returns to smaller retail investors. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Constructing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is working on a two-way lending platform, which is a Peer-to market and a Peer-to-Peer market. This is aimed at creating a decentralized credit market with flexible borrowing terms and real yield to lenders. Peer to Contract market users may borrow and lend against common liquidity pools. Assets are deposited in the pool and if a lender, the lender is issued with mtTokens reflecting his or her position and yield. The APY varies according to the activity of borrowing and use of liquidity in the pool. Lending and borrowing is also supported by the Peer to Peer market except that it does not use a shared pool rather it matches the user to another user. The terms of loans like the type of collateral, interest rate, and repayment period are customized. The loans are collateralized and restricted by Loan to Value (LTV) requirements. According to analysts, the structure of Mutuum Finance offers a type of yield to depositors and a more adaptable collateralized borrowing to its users which provides a more complete credit market in comparison to single-sided pool systems. The structure matches the incentives of lenders to demand by the borrowers so that both the lender and the borrower operate without having to deal with hype cycles and speculation. Presale Metrics and Security Audit Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in a going presale which has gone through a number of pricing rounds. MUTM currently trades at and around $0.04 in Phase 7, therefore, holding the token below the $0.05 mark and experiencing consistent buy side flow. The allocation of presale is 45.5% of the total supply of 4B, where the participants involved early would have a large portion before listing. Every stage has a fixed cost and a limited number of units, which has favored early entry since the price increased from Phase 1 of $0.01 to $0.04. The actual price at which it has been launched is $0.06 which provides early adopters with an outright valuation advantage as soon as the secondary markets become open. The Presale Dashboard indicates steady increase in wallet participation and funding. Over 18,800 holders are already part of it and almost $19.7M has already been raised putting the funding at the $20M target. The tokens have been sold very fast with 825 million MUTM already sold out of the presale allocation. Analysts assume that the high turnout is an indication of increasing confidence before the V1 of the Ethereum ecosystem is released. Investor trust has also been primarily influenced by security. Mutuum Finance completed a core protocol audit with Halborn Security , a reputable company in the crypto industry that audits lending, derivatives, and infrastructure protocols. The auditing plays a key role in lending markets because of collateral custody, rate logic, matching of loans, and the liquidation channels. The Halborn review, which Mutuum Finance conducted early in its development cycle, has minimized the number of concerns about smart contracts among retail participants and whale buyers, who came in later in the sale. V1 Protocol Launch and Price Prediction The biggest driver of Mutuum Finance is the V1 Protocol launch . It is then that lending can be on-chain and yields can be paid to the holders of mtTokens. Collateral is posted by borrowers and credit is accessed whilst risk controls and liquidation logic come into effect. Analysts consider that such launch will result in only usage rather than speculation. Stablecoins will also be introduced into the system at Mutuum Finance. Stablecoins are the vital liquidity assets to borrow and lend. The pricing information of collateral management and liquidation triggers will be supplied by oracle feeds. This puts confidence into the system and scaled out the protocol. As the presale enters its final phases and V1 approaches launch, a growing number of analysts are placing MUTM on their lists of the best crypto to buy under $0.10 for 2026. In bullish scenarios, projections show MUTM trading between $0.30 and $0.36 within its first year of operation. This would represent a 650% to 800% increase from the current pricing tier near $0.04, assuming V1 adoption plays out as expected and capital flows into on-chain lending markets during the next crypto uptrend.

Interestingly, this technical setup resembles the structure Bitcoin formed before its last major rally that eventually pushed it to its price peak above $126,000. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator Bitcoin Revisits A Familiar Consolidation Structure A closer look at BTC price action on the daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that the leading cryptocurrency is tracing a pattern that looks very similar to what played out between March and May 2025. In that earlier phase, Bitcoin spent weeks trading between roughly $76,000 and $86,000, repeatedly failing to break higher and giving the impression of stagnation. During that time, the Bitcoin price held above support levels and continued to print lower lows within the range and gave the impression of a lack of immediate upside. That consolidation ultimately proved to be a base. Once Bitcoin broke above the upper boundary of that range at $86,000, the sentiment changed very quickly and created the stage for a strong upside move that eventually led to Bitcoin. The current structure shows the same characteristics, only at a higher altitude. This time, Bitcoin is ranging between approximately $84,000 and $94,000, with price compressing in a similar way to early 2025. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: @aganstwallst On X Why Bitcoin Might Push To New ATHs The $94,000 level has become the primary area determining Bitcoin’s current upward price action. Bitcoin’s price action tested this zone during an early January rally, briefly pushing toward $94,500 on January 5 before facing rejection and dropping back into correction. That rejection is now in the past, and the next priority is what Bitcoin might do once it finally secures a decisive break above this resistance. The previous performance is a good reference point for what could follow a confirmed breakout. After Bitcoin cleared $86,000 during the prior consolidation last year, it pushed up for many months, eventually reaching a peak price of around $126,080. That move represented a gain of about 46% from the breakout level. No two price movements can play out in exactly the same way, but the similarities between the current setup and last year’s structure suggest that Bitcoin may once again be building energy below resistance.

Reports have disclosed the comment came as part of a set of bold forecasts from Mow on January 11, 2026, and it quickly spread across crypto news sites and social feeds. Mow’s Price Call And Market Context Mow also attached a price target to his outlook, putting Bitcoin at $1.33 million — a rise of about 1,360% from levels near $90,590 cited in recent market data. That figure has been repeated across multiple industry outlets covering his post, and analysts are parsing what such a move would mean for funds, miners, and corporate treasuries. Samson’s Predictions for 2026 $1.33M #Bitcoin At least 1 country launches #BitcoinBonds @elonmusk goes hard into BTC $MSTR to $5,000 Bitcoin outperforms metals — Samson Mow (@Excellion) January 10, 2026 Why The Prediction Mattered To Traders Mow’s statement is framed as a prediction , not evidence of an actual purchase by Musk or Tesla. Multiple outlets emphasized that the post reflects Mow’s personal view of how events could unfold if a high-profile investor like Musk re-engages with Bitcoin. Headlines picked it up because Musk’s past comments and Tesla’s earlier BTC holdings have moved markets before. MSTR And Macro Anchors Alongside the Musk prediction, Mow forecasted MicroStrategy (MSTR) could reach $5,000 and suggested that at least one country might issue a Bitcoin bond. These points were presented as part of a broader bullish template that ties corporate demand and sovereign experiments into a faster adoption scenario. Market Reaction And Caution Some traders cheered the upside scenario , and others warned that Mow’s targets are aggressive compared with mainstream forecasts. Price moves after the post were modest; no verified billion-dollar purchases by Musk were reported. Several commentators urged readers to treat the forecast as one voice among many in a crowded field of crypto prognostications. Observers said the clearest confirmations would be filings, corporate disclosures, or transaction evidence tied to Musk or his firms. Until such proof appears, the call should be viewed as a high-conviction opinion from a prominent Bitcoin advocate rather than a market fact.

57071806,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892956,1768143651,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57071806.jpeg,Vitalik Buterin shares his opinions on challenges facing the concept of decentralized stablecoins,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/buterin-non-usd-decentralized-stablecoins/,"Vitalik Buterin recently shared his thoughts on the need for better decentralized stablecoins in a reply to a post on X, which claimed Ethereum is a contrarian bet against what most VCs are betting on. In his reply, Buterin outlined three challenges that are hampering decentralized stablecoins today while emphasizing the push towards resilience and independence from centralized elements. The first is the issue of figuring out an index to track that’s better than the USD price, another is fashioning what he called an Oracle design that’s decentralized and not capturable with a large pool of money; and the last would be solving the problem of competition from staking yield. Buterin on the need for stablecoins to be decentralized According to the beloved founder , tracking USD is fine in the short term, but for long-term resilience, stablecoins should focus on tracking something more independent, especially from the price ticker. He believes this could protect users even during times the dollar experiences moderate hyperinflation or other similar issues that have been linked to a single fiat currency. “This is a big part of why I constantly rail against financialized governance, btw,” he wrote. “It inherently has no defense/offense asymmetry, and so high levels of extraction are the only way to be stable. And, of course, it’s a big part of why I refuse to give up on DAOs entirely.” Buterin went on by pointing out that staking yield is not completely a terrible thing, and if it does not exist, what you have is a few percent APY suboptimal return rates, something he says is “quite bad.” The possible paths to solving this issue, he claims, are to reduce staking yield to about 0.2%, create a new category of staking that has yield almost as high as regular staking without the same slashing risk, or figure out how to make slashable staking compatible with usability as collateral. According to him, the “‘slashing risk” to guard against is *both* self-contradiction, *and* being on the wrong side of an inactivity leak, i.e., engaging in a 51% censorship attack.’” As far as he is concerned, folks think too much about the former and not enough about the latter. He also urged anyone thinking of creating such a stablecoin to remember that a stablecoin cannot be secured with a fixed amount of ETH collateral because, in the event of large drops, they will need to be able to handle rebalancing. Ethereum as a contrarian bet The post on X that drew Buterin’s attention was from Gabriel Shapiro, aka @lex_node on X, a well-known crypto lawyer and Founder/CEO of MetaLeX, a project that sits at the intersection of law and smart contracts for DAOs. In the post, he claimed it is becoming increasingly obvious that “Ethereum is a contrarian bet against most of what crypto VCs are betting on.” He then proceeded to list what those things were, and they include gambling, CeDeFi, custodial stablecoins, and the neo-banks. He ended the post by claiming Ethereum seems more focused on “tripling down on disrupting power to enable sovereign individuals,” and in the comment section, many echoed his sentiment. Most agreed that those things he listed had more to do with short-term value capture and continued control rather than the decentralization crypto was created to usher in. “Ethereum’s contrarian bet is actually a bet on freedom itself,” one user wrote . “Eth bets on sovereignty while vcs chase casinos,” another added . Buterin credits Bitcoin Maxis for avoiding corporate distractions As Cryptopolitan reported yesterday, Vitalik Buterin called out the dangers of what he has tagged “corposlop” in the crypto and digital space. He described it as a toxic mix that leads to the creation of products that at first glance seem user-oriented, but in truth are created to disempower people. Biuterin acknowledged that BTC maxis had incredible foresight in resisting ICOs and dismissing any tokens that’s not Bitcoin and arbitrary apps. He credited them for holding the line and keeping Bitcoin “sovereign” and not “corposlop.” “The big error that many of them made was trying to achieve this goal with either government crackdowns or user disempowerment (keeping bitcoin script limited, and rejecting many categories of applications entirely),” Buterin wrote. “But their fear was real.” Many in the comment section agree that Ethereum is some sort of last line in the fight to hold on to decentralization, but they also acknowledge that the grind toward true decentralization will be harder and much slower.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-believes-xrp-could-hit-new-aths-this-month-heres-why/,"XRP has returned to a price zone that has defined its largest moves against Bitcoin. That is the central point of the latest analysis shared by crypto analyst Bird (@Bird_XRPL). His post focuses on the XRP/BTC monthly chart, highlighting two horizontal resistance levels that have shaped long-term market behavior. He believes XRP can hit a new all-time high this month, and supports his claim with the chart. The First XRP Resistance The chart shows XRP trading just below the first blue line. Historically, that level has acted as a trigger . When the price closed above it, momentum expanded quickly. Bird wrote that “every time $XRP breaks above the first blue line, it has gone on a major rally.” The chart supports that claim. Bird points to 2021 and 2024 as clear examples. In both cases, XRP experienced sharp upward moves relative to Bitcoin after clearing that level. In 2021, XRP reached $1.96, and it rose by 500% in late 2024. Each breakout marked a shift from consolidation into trend expansion. Let me show you a simple XRP vs Bitcoin chart. Every time $XRP breaks above the first blue line, it has gone on a major rally, like in 2021 and 2024. Every time XRP breaks above the second blue line, we enter full price discovery, as seen in 2014 and 2017. Right now, XRP… pic.twitter.com/94Q7Cw5YCJ — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 9, 2026 The Role of the Second Resistance Level The second blue line carries even more weight in Bird’s analysis. That level marks the start of what he describes as full price discovery . According to the chart, XRP crossed that line only twice before. Those moves occurred in 2014 and 2017. In both historical cases, the asset outperformed Bitcoin aggressively. The rallies that followed set cycle highs for the pair. While XRP remains below that area today, the first level acts as the gateway. A confirmed move above it would shift attention toward the higher resistance that previously defined cycle peaks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Structure Signals Building Pressure Bird’s post also highlights the current market structure. On the right side of the chart, XRP forms a wedge directly below the resistance level. The price compresses into a narrowing range while holding support. Bird notes that “zooming in, you can clearly see the structure is set up for a push through the first blue line again.” The chart shows higher lows pressing into a flat ceiling. This setup suggests accumulation. The repeated tests of resistance without a deep pullback add to the significance of the level. Bird argues that XRP stands at a familiar point in its cycle relative to Bitcoin. He believes XRP can return to all-time highs this month. That view rests entirely on the historical reactions shown on the chart and the current price structure moving against resistance.

For the past three months alone, it has maintained a relatively healthy price tag of over $0.20. Moreover, it even charted some gains during the broader November correction. However, it also failed to follow suit in the past week when the entire crypto market showed signs of revival and remained in a tight range between $0.20 and $0.22. The daily, weekly, and monthly scales paint a clear picture – they show little to no movement at the moment, which is highly untypical for an altcoin, especially one that had displayed massive volatility during its initial months of trading. Consequently, we decided to ask ChatGPT about its view on the matter and whether PI will finally be able to break out (or down). Breakout (Down) Chances The popular AI solution sees a 25% probability of a price breakdown in the week ahead. If such a bear case indeed takes place, its target would be a price drop to $0.18 or a potential retest of the early October all-time low of $0.172. It noted that such a nosedive “would likely reflect broader market weakness rather than PI-specific bad news – but it would still damage short-term sentiment.” In contrast, a bull week would place the token somewhere up to the $0.25 resistance, which was last challenged in November. It admitted that a rally of such proportions in the following days seems unlikely at the moment, especially since there’s no evident catalyst. Consequently, it placed the odds at around 20%, making it a less likely scenario than the breakdown above. Consolidation Endures Following a month of sideways price behavior, ChatGPT said this consolidation phase is the most probable scenario for the week ahead. It noted that the $0.22 resistance has rejected PI’s breakout attempts on a few occasions lately, while buyers have stepped up consistently when the token neared the $0.20 support. “This price behavior suggests indecision rather than distribution. Unless a fresh catalyst emerges, PI is likely to remain stuck between $0.20 and $0.22, frustrating traders looking for volatility while long-term holders continue to wait on ecosystem progress.” Ultimately, the AI platform said the probability of another dull trading week for PI is around 50-55%, unless there’s something major coming from the team. They recently published the first update of 2026, but it wasn’t followed by a sharp price move.

CZ , fo under of Binance, interjected on social media that the UAE has been mining Bitcoin “for a while.” Governments in countries like Japan, El Salvador and Russia already sponsor Bitcoin mining and now the UAE has joined those ranks, according to recent reports. Is the UAE government involved in Bitcoin mining? The United Arab Emirates has joined the list of nations choosing to embrace government-sponsored Bitcoin mining, according to recent announcements circulating on social media. CZ, the founder of Binance, responded to an announcement post about the UAE’s mining activities stating, “Has been for a while, based on my knowledge.” Arkham Intelligence revealed back in August of 2025, that the UAE had approximately 6,300-6,450 Bitcoins worth $700 million gained through state-backed mining operations that were carried out through Citadel Mining. Rather than allowing private companies to control the sector or attempting to restrict it through regulation, the UAE’s government is choosing to directly participate in or sponsor mining operations. However, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi banned cryptocurrency mining on agricultural land in September 2025 and imposed fines of up to AED 100,000 on violators to protect energy resources and land-use laws. Despite this, the UAE regards Bitcoin mining as a core national infrastructure, in the same way that countries treat data centers, telecommunications networks, or energy projects. News out of Dubai and Abu Dhabi in recent years has reinforced the country’s progressive approach to regulating the digital assets sector, attracting major cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain companies, and establishing free zones specifically designed for crypto businesses. Which other countries are involved in Bitcoin mining? El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, and although that was rescinded in 2025, the country still holds 7,517 BTC. The country mined 474 BTC over a period of three years using geothermal energy from volcanoes. Bhutan , a small Himalayan kingdom, revealed in 2023 that it started secretly mining Bitcoin in 2018 using its abundant hydroelectric power resources. It mines 55-75 BTC weekly and uses the token to fund civil servant salaries and public services. Ethiopia is in agreement with international mining companies to run their mining operations on the country’s surplus hydroelectric power. Iran, Japan and Russia have also been making crypto-friendly policies to benefit in different ways. Iran legalized mining at the state level in 2019 to generate revenue and pay for imports under economic sanctions. The country shut down 100 illegal mining farms in 2025 and periodically bans even legal mining during periods of energy crisis. Japan recently launched state-sponsored mining in order to balance its grid load. Russia’s regional government and state-linked utility companies in Siberia run their mining operations on hydropower. However, mining is currently banned in different areas in Russia due to energy concerns. France’s government-backed mining operations are still in the proposal stage and are not yet fully operational, but the country intends to use its surplus nuclear energy to power its activities. For context, France produces over 70% of its electricity from nuclear power and could generate $100-$150 million annually from 1 gigawatt of surplus energy.

The integration leverages Solana Blinks and Actions, technologies that allow decentralized transactions and other blockchain interactions to be initiated from within traditional web and social media environments. The core of the integration is based on Solana Blinks, short for blockchain links, which convert Solana Actions into clickable URLs that can be embedded across the internet, including posts on X. When a user clicks a Blink link, compatible wallet extensions such as Phantom or Backpack interpret the link and enable a user to sign and execute a transaction without leaving the platform. Solana Actions function as the underlying API, allowing developers to construct transaction messages. For example, purchases, swaps, or NFT interactions, that can be previewed, signed, and submitted by the user from the interface they are already using. Several real-world use cases have already begun appearing: Tokens, NFTs, or DeFi operations initiated from embedded buttons or links in X posts. Prediction markets, tipping mechanisms, and wallet interactions tied to social feeds. Integration with wallet browser extensions that turn static URLs into interactive transaction windows. Technical Context and Adoption Solana’s Blinks and Actions were first introduced in mid-2024 as a means to make blockchain interactions more accessible outside traditional decentralized applications. These technologies aim to reduce friction by embedding blockchain capability into everyday internet surfaces. By converting complex smart contract calls into simple web links, Solana Blinks allow a range of interactions without deep technical knowledge — a step toward mainstream use. Typical actions enabled by Blinks include token transfers, NFT purchases, governance votes, and decentralized application calls. User Base and Platform Reach The X app, formerly known as Twitter, has grown to an estimated 600 million monthly active users, providing a substantial audience for on-chain social features. Although adoption rates of Solana Blinks specifically on X have not been formally disclosed, industry commentators describe the feature as an early but strategic integration point in bridging Web2 social experiences with Web3 functionality.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-11 15:16:00

Our Bonk price prediction for 2028 anticipates a price range of $0.00002891 to $0.00003433. In 2032, we expect the Bonk price to reach a maximum of $0.00007046 with an average of $0.00006775. Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 87.99 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk network that also drive Bonk’s price. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2026? Let’s get into the BONK price prediction for 2026 and beyond.

The memecoin increased to $0.00001064 after finding support around the $0.00001043 level. BONK is up 2.20% in the last 24 hours, signaling bullish momentum and increasing hopes for bullish traders as the coin regains its recent losses. Bonk 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day BONK price analysis indicates an uptrend. This movement suggests a bullish trend as buying activity dominates selling activity. However, the chances of reversal still seem high in the face of the larger downtrend. The area between the upper and lower bands of the Bollinger Bands indicator shows the intensity of volatility. As the bands are expanded, this signals increased volatility. The upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, serving as the resistance band, is at $0.00001267. Its lower limit, acting as the support, is around $0.00000605. BONK/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region. Its value is 58; however, its curve is ascending. The upward movement of the RSI confirms a positive market sentiment. Moreover, considering the larger downtrend, this marks stability in the trading atmosphere after the return of the buying interest. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart analysis The 4-hour price chart for BONK also presents a bullish scenario of the market events. The BONK/USD pair value increased to $0.00001065. The buying activities remained quite intense compared to the selling activities during the day, as the trend has changed again in the past few hours. This suggests an encouraging signal for investors waiting for price improvement. Volatility is decreasing and is on the lower end, which confirms higher market predictability. Moving ahead, the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands indicator is at $0.00001112, confirming the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower boundary of the Bollinger Bands indicator is at $0.00001035, securing stable support. BONK/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI graph displays an upward curve because of the recent support. In the past four hours, its value has increased to 46.

Bonk price analysis predicts a bullish outcome regarding the ongoing market events. The coin’s value has ascended to $0.00001064, as an upturn was recorded today. Moreover, the overall market sentiment remained positive. Technical indicators support the bears, but the price charts favor the buyers for today. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a surge in SOL’s price due to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has numerous side projects that enhance its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2032, Bonk will approach $0.00007046, making it a worthwhile investment tool. However, it is advised to do your own research and consult expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market and lay out a proper investment strategy according to your risk appetite. Why is Bonk up? BONK is experiencing some recovery as stakeholders start buying again. However, resistance still exists at $0.00001267 and is expected to hold over the next trading sessions. Will Bonk reach $0.000045? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.000010. Over the last few weeks, BONK saw a downtrend below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000045 by 2029, which is quite higher than the current price. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the coming future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now, considering BONK’s current value. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. However, analysts are optimistic about BONK, and some suggest long-term targets of $0.00007046, which makes it a viable option to buy Bonk tokens.

These decisive actions, announced on Saturday and Sunday respectively, represent the most aggressive governmental responses yet to AI-generated harmful content that violates fundamental human rights in digital spaces. The coordinated Southeast Asian response has triggered a cascade of international regulatory scrutiny, with India, the European Commission, and the United Kingdom launching their own investigations into xAI’s content moderation practices. Grok Deepfake Ban: Southeast Asia’s Regulatory Response Indonesian Communications and Digital Minister Meutya Hafid delivered a powerful statement on Saturday, declaring non-consensual sexual deepfakes as “a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space.” The Indonesian ministry has simultaneously summoned X officials for urgent discussions about content moderation failures. Malaysia followed with an almost identical announcement on Sunday, creating a unified regional front against AI-generated harmful content. These actions demonstrate how governments are increasingly willing to implement immediate technical blocks rather than pursuing lengthy diplomatic negotiations with technology companies. The regulatory response extends beyond simple blocking measures. Indonesia’s approach includes multiple coordinated actions: Technical blocking of Grok’s access across Indonesian internet service providers Ministerial summons requiring X officials to explain content moderation failures Public awareness campaigns about digital rights and AI risks Cross-ministry coordination between communications, law enforcement, and human rights agencies This comprehensive strategy reflects growing governmental expertise in addressing complex digital threats. Meanwhile, Malaysia’s similar approach suggests coordinated regional policymaking, potentially setting a precedent for ASEAN nations facing comparable challenges with AI content moderation. Global Regulatory Reactions to AI-Generated Content The Southeast Asian bans have ignited a chain reaction of international regulatory responses. India’s IT Ministry has issued a formal order demanding xAI implement immediate measures to prevent Grok from generating obscene content. The European Commission has taken the preliminary step of ordering xAI to retain all documents related to Grok, potentially laying groundwork for a comprehensive investigation under the Digital Services Act. In the United Kingdom, communications regulator Ofcom has announced a “swift assessment” to determine compliance issues, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer offering his “full support to take action.” These varied responses highlight different regulatory philosophies across jurisdictions: Country/Region Regulatory Action Legal Framework Timeline Indonesia Immediate blocking, ministerial summons Electronic Information and Transactions Law Immediate Malaysia Service blocking, investigation Communications and Multimedia Act Immediate European Union Document preservation order Digital Services Act Preliminary United Kingdom Compliance assessment Online Safety Act Ongoing India Content moderation order Information Technology Act 72-hour compliance This regulatory patchwork creates significant challenges for global AI companies, which must navigate conflicting requirements across different jurisdictions. The situation becomes particularly complex when considering the United States’ relative silence, where the Trump administration has not commented despite xAI CEO Elon Musk’s political connections and previous government role. Content Moderation and Ethical AI Development The Grok incident reveals fundamental tensions in AI content moderation systems. xAI initially responded with a first-person apology from the Grok account, acknowledging that generated content “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” regarding child sexual abuse material. The company subsequently restricted AI image generation to paying X users, though this restriction reportedly didn’t apply to the standalone Grok application. This technical distinction highlights the complexity of implementing consistent content controls across different access points and platforms. Digital rights experts point to several systemic issues exposed by this incident. First, the rapid generation of harmful content demonstrates how AI systems can amplify existing online harms at unprecedented scale. Second, the non-consensual nature of the imagery raises fundamental questions about digital consent and bodily autonomy in AI-generated media. Third, the targeting of minors introduces additional legal complexities under various national child protection laws. Finally, the international regulatory divergence creates enforcement challenges that may require new forms of cross-border cooperation. Technology analysts note that this incident follows a pattern of increasing governmental assertiveness in digital regulation. Over the past three years, multiple countries have implemented or proposed comprehensive digital content laws, including the EU’s Digital Services Act, the UK’s Online Safety Act, and various national approaches in Asia and Latin America. The Grok situation represents a particularly challenging test case because it combines rapidly evolving AI capabilities with deeply sensitive content categories and cross-border service delivery. Political Dimensions and Industry Implications The political context surrounding these regulatory actions adds additional complexity. In the United States, Democratic senators have called for Apple and Google to remove X from their app stores, while the Trump administration remains silent despite Musk’s political support and previous government role. This partisan divide reflects broader debates about platform regulation, free speech, and government intervention in technology markets. Elon Musk’s response to UK regulatory actions—claiming “they want any excuse for censorship”—further illustrates the ideological tensions between technology leaders and government regulators. The incident has significant implications for the broader AI industry. Companies developing generative AI capabilities now face increased scrutiny of their content moderation systems, ethical guidelines, and compliance mechanisms. Industry observers predict several likely developments: Enhanced content filtering requirements for AI image generation systems Increased transparency demands regarding training data and moderation processes Regional compliance teams to navigate diverse regulatory environments Industry standards development for ethical AI image generation Insurance and liability considerations for AI-generated content harms These developments may accelerate existing trends toward more controlled AI deployment, particularly for consumer-facing applications. The financial implications are substantial, with compliance costs potentially affecting profitability and market expansion plans for AI companies operating across multiple jurisdictions. Conclusion The Grok deepfake ban by Indonesia and Malaysia represents a watershed moment in AI regulation, demonstrating governments’ willingness to implement immediate technical blocks against harmful AI-generated content. This decisive action has triggered global regulatory responses while exposing fundamental challenges in AI content moderation and ethical development. As AI capabilities continue advancing, the tension between innovation and protection will likely intensify, requiring more sophisticated regulatory approaches and industry practices. The incident underscores the urgent need for international cooperation on AI governance while highlighting the particular vulnerabilities that emerging technologies create for digital rights and personal security. Ultimately, the Grok situation may accelerate the development of more robust ethical frameworks and technical safeguards for generative AI systems worldwide. FAQs Q1: Why did Indonesia and Malaysia specifically target Grok for blocking? Both countries identified specific instances where Grok generated non-consensual, sexualized deepfakes depicting real women and minors, which they classified as serious human rights violations in digital spaces. The immediate blocking represents their most direct regulatory response to what they perceive as urgent threats to citizen security. Q2: How does xAI’s corporate structure affect regulatory responses? xAI and X operate as separate entities under the same corporate umbrella, creating regulatory complexity. While xAI develops Grok, X provides the social platform where harmful content was reportedly shared. This interconnected structure complicates accountability and enforcement actions across different jurisdictions. Q3: What distinguishes this incident from previous AI content moderation issues? The scale and specificity of harmful content generation, combined with the non-consensual targeting of identifiable individuals and minors, represents an escalation beyond previous AI moderation challenges. The coordinated international regulatory response also distinguishes this situation from earlier, more isolated incidents. Q4: How might this affect other AI companies and their products? Other AI companies will likely face increased scrutiny of their content moderation systems and may need to implement more robust safeguards. Regulatory expectations around ethical AI development will probably increase, potentially affecting product roadmaps, compliance costs, and market access strategies. Q5: What are the long-term implications for global AI governance? This incident may accelerate the development of international AI governance frameworks and encourage more proactive regulatory approaches. It highlights the need for cross-border cooperation on AI safety standards while demonstrating the challenges of regulating rapidly evolving technologies across diverse legal and cultural contexts.

The initiative introduces ”Shib Owes You” (SOU), a dual-layer system designed to reimburse victims through blockchain-verified claims and community-driven fundraising mechanisms. The announcement came through Dhairya's year-end letter, which detailed how the cryptocurrency project plans to address losses from the Plasma Bridge exploit. The recovery framework combines official NFT-based accounting with community-powered liquidity generation across multiple blockchain networks. NFT-Based Claims on Ethereum Blockchain The SOU system operates through NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain. Each affected user receives an SOU NFT that serves as cryptographic proof of their claim against the Shiba Inu ecosystem. These tokens function as permanent, verifiable records rather than traditional database entries. The NFTs track principal amounts owed to individual users. The recorded debt decreases as payouts occur or community donations arrive. Users can verify their original claim amount, track received payments, and monitor outstanding balances through the blockchain. The system allows NFT holders to merge, split, or transfer their claims as needed. Shiba Inu team member Lucie provided additional clarity on the system's structure. The official layer consists of SOU NFTs on Ethereum, representing the team's formal accounting mechanism. These tokens document losses from the Plasma Bridge exploit with complete transparency and auditability. The NFTs maintain dynamic records that specify exact amounts owed to each holder. Lucie emphasized that these Ethereum-based tokens function purely as accounting instruments. They do not generate funds but instead track the ecosystem's debt obligations to affected users. Community Recovery Layer on BSC The second component operates on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This community-powered layer focuses on generating liquidity and transaction fees to support the recovery effort. Woofswap currently stands as the first project committed to this initiative. The BSC implementation differs fundamentally from the Ethereum NFTs. Lucie clarified that BSC tokens do not replace official claim records or serve as IOUs. The tokens instead create a funding mechanism that directs trading activity toward donations and ecosystem rebuilding. This layer generates volume through user activity, with resulting fees contributing to recovery funds. The community support structure operates independently from official Shiba Inu products. Its purpose centers on creating financial momentum rather than tracking individual claims. The distinction between both layers remains crucial to understanding the recovery framework. Ethereum NFTs represent verified debt records—the ”truth layer” of what the ecosystem owes. BSC tokens function as the ”liquidity engine,” generating resources to fulfill those obligations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-11 15:26:04

The call to action comes from the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, addressing senior government officials of other countries. The meeting will begin with a dinner scheduled for Sunday evening. It will include ministers and cabinet ministers from the G7 advanced economies, India, South Korea, the European Union, Mexico, and Australia. The secretary is expected to raise the issue in a meeting scheduled for Monday involving the Group of Seven nations and other countries. Scott Bessent is frustrated with the slow progress in rare mineral developments The visiting countries alongside the U.S. account for 60% of the global demand for critical minerals. Scott Bessent stated that the central theme of the day would be “urgency” and explained that they needed to move more quickly. The official told a news outlet that he had been pushing for an independent meeting to address the issue since the G7 summit in Canada back in June. During the summit, Bessent delivered a presentation on rare earth minerals to heads of state from other countries, including Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, the UK, the EU, and the U.S. During the summit, the leaders agreed to take action and secure their supply chains to boost their economies. However, Bessent is not satisfied with the progress made so far and has become increasingly frustrated with the lack of urgency from the heads of state. According to the U.S. official, Japan is the only country that has taken action on the matter after China suspended critical mineral supplies to its jurisdiction back in 2010. However, the Asian country still heavily depends on China. Cryptopolitan recently reported that China has cautioned Japan that it might cut off its supply of rare minerals following comments made by the Japanese Prime Minister about Taiwan. According to the report, Japan still relied on China for 60% of its rare minerals supply. According to the official, G7 member states still heavily rely on China for rare earth minerals. China has threatened to impose strict export controls on its critical minerals. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced the implementation of the strictest controls on rare earth metals on October 9, 2021, which included permanent magnet exports. These minerals are crucial for the development of defense technologies, including jets, submarines, missiles, radar systems, and unmanned aerial vehicles. China dominates the critical mining sector, according to the IEA The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that China commands 70% of global rare earths in 19 out of 20 important strategic minerals. Besides military equipment, minerals are vital components of semiconductors and batteries. The secretary declined to disclose more information about what would be discussed in the meeting, but he urged that no specific joint action is likely to be taken. “We’re ready to move with those who feel a similar level of urgency … and others can join as they realize how serious this is,” said Scott Bessent. In October 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump and Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement to pursue critical mineral investments in Australia amid ongoing efforts by the U.S. and its allies to reduce China’s global dominance in the rare earth mineral supply chain. The two governments pledged to invest $1 billion in the next six months into mining and processing projects. The investment has been highly advocated by Western miners who pushed for higher prices in July 2024 to fend off Chinese rivals. A separate statement issued by the White House added that the investment will target $53 billion worth of minerals. Still, it did not disclose what type of minerals the investment targets or the location of the investment. After the agreement, the U.S. Export-Import Bank announced letters of interest worth more than $2 billion channeled towards mineral projects in Australia. The bank stated that the projects will focus on critical minerals essential for developing defense systems and next-generation industrial technologies.

Announced at the National Retail Federation (NRF) conference in New York, this initiative represents a significant leap toward a more interconnected and intelligent commerce ecosystem. Consequently, this protocol aims to dismantle existing barriers between different shopping agents, facilitating a smoother journey from product discovery to final purchase and post-purchase support. Google UCP: The Technical Backbone for AI Commerce Developed in collaboration with retail giants including Walmart, Target, Shopify, Etsy, and Wayfair, the Universal Commerce Protocol serves as a common language for AI agents. Fundamentally, it allows specialized agents—for discovery, comparison, checkout, or support—to work together seamlessly across different retailer platforms. Google explicitly designed UCP to be modular and extensible. Therefore, businesses and developers can select specific protocol extensions that match their unique operational needs without implementing the entire framework. Notably, Google confirmed UCP’s compatibility with other emerging agentic protocols. These include the Agent Payments Protocol (A2P), the Agent2Agent (A2A) framework, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This interoperability is crucial for avoiding platform lock-in and fostering a diverse, competitive agent ecosystem. For merchants, Google is introducing new data attributes within its Merchant Center. These attributes will help sellers optimize their product listings specifically for AI-driven search surfaces and conversational interfaces. The Immediate Consumer Impact and Integration Google plans to integrate UCP directly into its consumer-facing products in the near future. Eligible product listings within Google Search’s AI mode and Gemini apps will leverage the protocol. This integration will enable a direct checkout experience with U.S.-based retailers while users research products. Shoppers can then complete transactions using saved Google Pay information and shipping details from Google Wallet. Additionally, Google announced upcoming support for PayPal as a payment option within this flow. Simultaneously, Google is introducing features for dynamic consumer engagement. Brands will soon have the ability to offer contextual discounts to users during AI-powered product recommendation sessions. For instance, a user describing their need for a “durable, easy-to-clean rug for a busy dining room” might instantly receive a tailored promotional offer from a relevant brand. This capability aims to capture purchase intent at its peak moment. The Competitive Landscape of AI-Powered Retail Google’s announcement arrives amid intense competition to define the future of AI commerce. Several key players are making parallel strides: Shopify unveiled a similar integration with Microsoft Copilot on the same day, enabling checkout within conversational flows. Meta and Shopify are also actively exploring AI tools for business customer support and outreach. Companies like PayPal and OpenAI are working on solutions to enhance merchant discoverability within AI chatbot results. Startups, such as prompting companies, are partnering with merchants to surface products directly within AI-generated answers. This flurry of activity underscores a broader industry trend. Major technology firms are racing to embed AI into every facet of the shopping experience. A recent Adobe report highlighted a staggering 693.4% growth in traffic to seller sites driven by generative AI during the past holiday season. While the conversion rate of this traffic remains unspecified, the data signals a massive shift in how consumers begin their shopping journeys. Enterprise Tools and Merchant Adoption Beyond the consumer protocol, Google is bolstering its enterprise offerings. The company announced Gemini Enterprise for Customer Experience (CX), a new suite tailored for retailers and restaurants to manage shopping and customer service through AI. Furthermore, Google now allows merchants to integrate an AI-powered Business Agent directly into their websites. This agent can field customer questions in real-time. Early adopters include major brands like Lowe’s, Michael’s, Poshmark, and Reebok. Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke encapsulated the transformative potential of this agentic shift. He emphasized AI’s unique ability to drive serendipitous discovery, connecting users with perfect products they might never have searched for directly. This move from search-based intent to discovery-based intent could fundamentally alter consumer behavior and marketing strategies. Strategic Implications and the Road Ahead The introduction of the Universal Commerce Protocol is more than a technical specification; it is a strategic play to position Google at the center of the next-generation commerce stack. By establishing an open standard, Google encourages widespread adoption while ensuring its services—Search, Gemini, Google Pay, and Google Wallet—become integral hubs for AI-driven transactions. The protocol also addresses growing merchant concerns about fragmentation and complexity in managing multiple AI agent integrations. However, challenges remain. Widespread adoption depends on convincing a critical mass of retailers and platform developers to build on UCP. Success also hinges on robust privacy and security frameworks, as AI agents will handle sensitive user data and payment information. The industry will closely watch how UCP evolves alongside competing standards and whether it achieves the seamless interoperability it promises. Conclusion Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of artificial intelligence and ecommerce. By providing a standardized framework for AI agents, Google UCP aims to create a more fluid, intelligent, and personalized shopping experience. Its development alongside major retailers and its planned integration into Google’s core products give it significant momentum. As the battle to define AI-powered retail intensifies, UCP represents a foundational effort to build an open, connected, and efficient future for digital commerce, transforming how consumers discover, evaluate, and purchase goods online. FAQs Q1: What is Google’s Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP)?

The tool is supposed to surpass traditional social networking by providing X users with access to financial information and market insights. Reports suggest that the first focus of the tool will be on price visibility, but it will not include full trading functionality. Users will be able to access simple crypto charts by tapping on tickers or token symbols mentioned in crypto articles. This illustrates how digital assets and traditional markets are converging, especially for younger investors. X uses unified asset tracking to aim for market convergence As of January 11, Elon Musk has not released any comments regarding the new feature. However, his previous statements indicate that he is interested in directly incorporating financial tools into regular digital activities. The new tool development represents Elon’s broader goal to make X an “everything app.” According to the plan, X will integrate financial services, payments, and media into a single ecosystem. Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, announced the strategy on June 19, 2022. Yaccarino said in an interview with the Financial Times at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. She explained how the new strategy aligns with Elon’s broader goal to make X an “everything app.” According to her, X will establish a comprehensive financial solution that will enable its users to manage everything from investments to payments. W ith the new expansion, Yaccarino added that consumers will be able to conduct deals and pay for things on the same platform they already use for content. “You’ll be able to come to X and be able to transact your whole financial life on the platform.” Yaccarino stated in reference to the new investment features. She added, “And that’s whether I can make an investment or a trade, or pay you for the pizza we shared last night. That’s the future, then.” X Money signals push toward a full-scale financial ecosystem In a Cryptopolitan report dated June 19, X was planning to introduce its banking services gradually. First up was X Money, a brand-new peer-to-peer payment system and digital wallet that will debut in the U.S. before spreading to other nations. Yaccarino said that X Money would enable features such as direct app purchases, savings, and tipping. Additionally, the social media platform intended to launch an X-branded credit or debit card last year. It collaborated with Visa to support the payment system. According to her, Visa is backing the new “X Money” service and would provide instantaneous peer-to-peer payments between conventional bank accounts and an app-based digital wallet. In 2022, Elon Musk paid $44 billion to acquire Twitter, which was then a publicly traded company. Since then, he has attempted to transform it into a universal platform based on WeChat, the Chinese program that combines social media, chat, retail, and finance. According to Yaccarino, the new extension goes beyond payments. “A whole commerce ecosystem and a financial ecosystem are going to emerge on the platform that does not exist today.” -Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X. However, the social media platform must address regulatory issues resulting from the addition of financial tools. Compared to what the company has encountered in the past, Money laundering regulations, licensing concerns, and compliance requirements for services such as stock trading, cryptocurrency transfers, and payments are significantly stricter than anything the business has previously faced. At the same time, X is still working to resolve its revenue gap. After Elon Musk took over the X platform, the majority of the sponsors withdrew. The majority claimed that they did not want to be associated with harmful content or political unrest. X revenue fell from $4.1 billion in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2025.

A large number have swapped slow-moving large caps with early-stage altcoins which have the ability to move with the minimal amount of capital. Among them, the focus has already begun to shift towards a $0.04 token which some analysts reckon has a lot of upward potential as development milestones are reached. The arrangement has put upon itself a silent frenzy into the investors seeking the next significant break. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an ecosystem of decentralized lending that is currently being developed based on two parallel markets that support the needs of various users. The former is a Peer to Contract (P2C) market, in which lenders supply assets to shared liquidity pools and receive interest as borrowers draw loans from that pool. This model renders lending passive, as users do not need to directly match with a counterparty. As an illustration, a trader may deposit ETH into the lending pool and earn yield while multiple borrowers access credit for margin trades or hedging. Borrowers interact with the pool in the same manner, accessing liquidity without negotiating terms each time. The second is a Peer to Peer (P2P) market. In this structure, lenders and borrowers interact directly when terms need to be tailored or when liquidity preferences differ from the broader pool. An example would be an over-the-counter loan with a structured repayment schedule between two users. Both lending and borrowing are supported here as well, but with negotiable conditions such as collateral type, rate model, and duration. This flexibility allows Mutuum Finance to serve both retail and advanced use cases without being restricted to a single settlement model. The confidence of investors has also increased because the project has increased its metrics. Over 18,800 holders are already members of the ecosystem, and it has already raised $19.7M. The importance of these figures is that adoption and capital flow is an indication of increased liquidity of the lending markets in future. The V1 testnet of the protocol will be launched on the Sepolia network of Ethereum, which is the basis of mainnet preparation. Pricing Framework Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a price of $0.04 in the presale stage 7 of its token cycle. The total supply of MUTM is 4B tokens with 45.5% the presale. Of that distribution, 825M tokens are sold, and they represent the consistent growth of retail and more significant purchasers. The cost has grown at every stage since its launch. Phase 1 early buyers were at $0.01. This is a 300% improvement of the initial stage up to the present level. In the event MUTM lists at its established launch price of $0.06, Phase 1 investors would be in a position of achieving approximately 500% MUTM growth at listing. Phase transitions have been closely followed by the investors since every stage comes with a fixed allocation and an increased price of a token in comparison to the preceding stage. Subsequently, the price will increase by approximately 20% with Phase 7 coming towards completion. This is important to early entrants, as every phase of entrance adds to the cost of new entrants base, making the market dynamics favorable once external listing starts. Halborn Security and CertiK Audit One of the most significant areas of concern among investors is security verification and enquires regarding which crypto to invest in during the ongoing cycle. Mutuum Finance passed through two high profile checks. CertiK gave the ecosystem a good security rating of 90/100 Token Scan. An independent audit of lending and borrowing modules in V1 was also done by Halborn Security . Such a two-fold process decreases uncertainty in a protocol that will control collateral, interest, and liquidations. Mutuum Finance is also conducting a $50,000 Bug Bounty which is operating on code vulnerabilities. This will motivate white-hat researchers to disclose the possible problems prior to the launching of V1. These measures have helped the investor build confidence in the development process and indicate that the team is planning scalable operations and not a brief speculative process. The Road to 2027 Being an Ethereum-based protocol, Mutuum Finance is already positioning for Q1 2026, when the first lending markets are expected to open. As analysts forecast rising structural demand for collateralized borrowing during bullish periods, the product development, security verification, and economic design have resulted in MUTM being listed among the new cryptocurrencies that traders are monitoring for high return potential. Some analysts believe that if V1 launches on schedule and user activity begins to generate protocol revenue, MUTM could trade in the $0.30 to $0.36 range during 2026. From the current $0.04 pricing tier, this would imply a 650% to 800% increase, which many market commentators explain as a valuation catch-up scenario rather than pure speculation, driven by expected lending usage and revenue mechanics rather than only narrative.

This is despite the privacy platform being under regulatory sanctions until March 2025. Before and after the sanctions, however, activity has been non-stop on the fund mixing service. Tornado Cash faced serious sanctions in 2022 from many Western countries, led by the United States, which placed sanctions on the privacy mixing platform that enables users to obscure transactions and make detection more difficult. How did regulators react to Tornado Cash? The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control alleged that Tornado Cash facilitated money laundering of over $7 billion, including $455 million stolen by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, and has since prosecuted the founders, who to date are still fighting legal battles. One of the founders, Alexey Pertsev, has already been sentenced to 64 months in prison. Cryptopolitan has reported that Roman Storm, another co-founder, is waiting to be sentenced, and the third co-founder is currently at large. The sanctions placed on the platform resulted in a reduction in activity, but operations continued due to Tornado Cash’s decentralized architecture. The protocol has since then gained more notoriety as the go-to platform for people who want to obscure transactions for legitimate privacy reasons o r ba d actors who want to launder funds. What’s the technology behind the privacy revolution? The technological foundation enabling these privacy protocols lies in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), a cryptographic technique that allows verification of information without revealing the data behind it. It was first proposed by some MIT researchers in 1985, and since then, ZKP technology has moved from just a theoretical concept to a practical infrastructure supporting billions in transactions. In Tornado Cash’s operating mechanism, users deposit cryptocurrency into smart contracts that pool funds from multiple sources. When withdrawing to a different address, users provide zero-knowledge proofs that show their ownership without revealing which deposit originated the withdrawal. This makes it very difficult for external observers to trace fund movements, effectively breaking the transparent audit trail that is usually a feature in most blockchain transactions. The privacy protocol ecosystem has also grown beyond Tornado Cash. Railgun , frequently mentioned by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, saw net inflows of $1.4 billion in 2025, according to Bitrace . Institutional players made considerable investments in privacy solutions in 2025, with Zcash receiving a lion’s share of those investments. The cryptocurrency, which is built with the same code as Bitcoin but with an added layer of privacy, caught the attention of users who wanted more privacy in their transactions. The Zcash token has since increased by over 750% year-to-date, with a market capitalization of over $6.45 billion. Another privacy platform, Monero , also saw considerable investments and now has a market capitalization of over $9.1 billion. However, these platforms are not crypto mixers like Tornado Cash, which may also contribute to their appeal. The compliance challenge for Web3 entitie s Th e sanctions on Tornado Cash were lifted following a federal appeals court ruling that immutable smart contracts do not qualify as property under US law, establishing that regulators lacked authority to sanction the software itself. However, this has not brought an end to the ongoing litigation and conversations regarding the protocol. The fundamental question facing the industry is whether privacy can be reconciled with regulatory requirements. The current trajectory points to growing adoption of zero-knowledge proof technology across legitimate use cases, from confidential business transactions to privacy-preserving identity verification. However, there is also increased usage by bad actors, and that is what regulators and other industry stakeholders must find a way to address without throwing the baby out with the bathwater—in other words, solve without taking steps that affect legitimate users.

The arrangement would wipe out tariffs on farm goods Kenya ships to China. Officials say the deal needs sign-off from the cabinet, lawmakers, and President William Ruto. But sources say the approval process stopped after the United States voiced concerns. Jobs and Exports on the Line Kenya is in a difficult situation because of the timing. On September 30, 2025, the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which allowed Kenyan goods to enter the United States duty-free for 25 years, expired. A long-term successor has not been authorized by Congress. As a result, apparel producers are now subject to levies of up to 28%. Kenya exports clothing to the United States valued at over $600 million annually. The Kenya Association of Manufacturers says more than 66,000 workers could lose their jobs if the situation drags on. Most work in textile plants or on farms. Kenya saw the China agreement as a safety net. Beijing promised to drop tariffs on tea, coffee, and avocados shipped from Kenya. Caught Between Two Giants American officials have told Nairobi that signing a full trade deal with China might hurt Kenya’s chances of joining the Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership, a US-backed program still taking shape. Kenya must now pick sides between Washington, its old security ally, and Beijing, which holds more of Kenya’s debt than any other country. Bi gger Picture Shows Easing Tensions Even as Kenya faces pressure, the United States and China appear to be cooling their own trade fight. Officials from both countries met recently in Malaysia and agreed to pause extremely high tariffs. Washington expects China to buy large amounts of American soybeans to balance trade flows. Kenya’s government says it hopes for a temporary extension of the old American trade program.

The move sets the groundwork for users to potentially reclaim up to 75–80% of their locked funds over time, depending on future profits and asset recoveries. Recovery Tokens Issued as Restructuring Plan Moves Forward In a post shared on X, WazirX said Recovery Tokens, or RTs, were issued within the 60-business-day timeline laid out in its restructuring scheme. The exchange added that users can now see their allocations directly in the Funds tab of the WazirX app. According to the company, the tokens were assigned on a pro rata basis, meaning each user’s share reflects the size of their approved claim, with no special treatment. It framed the update as a key milestone following the platform’s restart in late October last year. When trading resumed, eligible users received a First Distribution representing about 85% of their approved claims, based on reference prices set under the scheme. The newly issued RTs represent the remaining portion of user claims and give holders the right to future buybacks by the company, provided enough value is recovered. The exchange stressed that RTs are not tradable at this stage. Under the scheme, it will review recoveries in rolling three-month periods. If at least $10 million in unencumbered value is realized in a cycle, part of that amount will be used to buy back RTs, creating another distribution for users. Smaller recoveries will be carried forward until the threshold is reached. How the Hack and Court Rulings Shaped the Recovery Path The recovery effort traces back to the July 2024 exploit that drained more than $230 million from a WazirX multisignature wallet. Blockchain data later showed large amounts of Shiba Inu (SHIB), Ethereum (ETH), and other tokens being moved and sold, wiping out close to 45% of the exchange’s reserves. The incident kept the platform offline for more than a year and triggered legal disputes over how losses should be shared. In October 2025, the Madras High Court dealt a blow to WazirX’s initial plan to spread losses across all users. The court ruled that customer assets such as XRP could not be used to offset unrelated platform losses, affirming that cryptocurrencies remain the property of individual users. That decision, along with approval from the Singapore High Court and backing from over 95% of voting creditors, pushed WazirX toward a more structured, claim-based recovery model. Under the current setup, Recovery Tokens keep users tied to future progress without forcing immediate decisions.

The memory business is dealing with what industry watchers call an extraordinary supply crunch. Building out artificial intelligence infrastructure has eaten up most available NAND flash memory, DRAM chips, and hard drives. Other sectors are struggling to get supplies. PC and smartphone makers are having particular trouble getting components. Last month, Morgan Stanley’s chip analyst Joe Moore called i t a “generational supply and demand mismatch” in the memory industry. Tight supply has pushed prices up, delivering big revenue gains to manufacturers. Micron hit record quarterly sales and operating profits last month. Samsung said Thursda y it s fourth-quarter operating profits would likely triple compared to last year. Normally, extreme shortages and high prices would make manufacturer s qu ickly ramp up output. But memory companies are being careful. They’ve been burned by wild price swings before. Wall Street rewards caution That caution has rewarded investors. Memory stocks have become Wall Street darlings. Micron, Seagate, and Western Digital all sa w sh ares more than double in 2025, making them the S&P 500’s best performers. Sandisk, which split from Western Digital in February, has jumped tenfold. SK Hynix, the South Korean maker focused only on memory, gained 88% in just three months. Analysts think memory chip and hard drive prices will stay high this year, probably keeping stock values elevated. But the industry has a brutal history. Price drops have repeatedly pushed producers into the red and tanked their stocks. It happened as recently as 2023, when Micron, Western, Seagate, and Hynix all posted yearly operating losses. Will things be different now? Maybe. Computing systems from companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices need tons of specialized DRAM to work. These systems also create mountains of new data that have to go somewhere—on hard drives and flash-based solid-state drives. Bernstein analyst Mark Newman calls this a “data explosion.” He expects combined data-storage shipments for NAND flash and hard drives to grow 19% annually over four years. That beats the 14% average from the past decade. Nvidia and AMD have also sped up their release cycles. They’re now launching major new systems every year. Adding more DRAM memory to these systems boosts performance over older versions. Nvidia’s Rubin GPU chips, shown off last week at the Consumer Electronics Show, nearly triple the memory bandwidth of the Blackwell chips that started shipping last year. The demand depends on capital spending by the world’s biggest tech companies. That’s already at sky-high levels and shows no signs of slowing. Based on December quarter estimates, Amazon.com, Google, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms spent $407 billion combined in 2025. Analysts expect that to hit about $523 billion this year, according to Visible Alpha consensus projections. “If demand stays this robust, the upcycle could continue for multiple years,” Moore wrote. Memory executives remember the bad times Even with dire predictions of memory shortages for other electronics, producers like Micron, Sandisk, Seagate, and Western Digital are moving carefully on new production capacity. Only Seagate plans a real increase in capital spending this year, and that’s just to keep its spending around the usual 4% of revenue. Sandisk expects to grow capital spending by 18% for its fiscal year ending in June, even though revenue is jumping 44% in the same period, FactSet estimates show. At a UBS conference last month, Sandisk Chief Executive David Goeckeler said the lack of long-term supply deals in most of the NAND flash industry makes it tough for companies to plan big investments. Like other semiconductors, NAND flash chips need facilities that take years to build. “Perhaps the demand side should think about making commitments that are longer than three months at a time,” Goeckeler said at the conference. He added that companies “need to get the economics right to be able to continue to invest that money and not go through these huge episodic periods of losing money.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The tax proposal , introduced in October by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, targets people with assets worth more than $1 billion. If approved, it would be a one-time collection from roughly 200 individuals and bring in an estimated $100 billion for the state. According to The Wall Street Journal, dozens of technology executives have been talking about the measure in a private group chat on Signal named “Save California.” The group includes Palmer Luckey from defense tech company Anduril, David Sacks , who now works on cryptocurrency policy for the Trump administration, and Chris Larsen from Ripple, who previously gave significant donations to Kamala Harris. In their messages, some have called the proposal “Communism” while others say it lacks clear details. Many worry that tech company founders would leave California, hurting the region’s economy. Some members wrote about wanting California to encourage growth and job creation instead. Several participants argued that the state should eliminate wasteful spending and fraud before looking for new money. Others pointed to posts from New York hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, who suggested closing a tax break used by the very wealthy as a better way to raise funds. A few California billionaires have already started moving. Peter Thiel’s investment company Thiel Capital, mostly located in Los Angeles until now, recently signed papers for office space in Miami. Google’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who each have fortunes exceeding $250 billion, have been looking at houses in Florida. Page spent $173.4 million on two waterfront properties in Miami, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Brin is talking about purchasing a Miami residence as well. In late December, Garry Tan, who runs the startup program Y Combinator, wrote on X that his organization might need to look at opening programs in Austin or Cambridge if the tax passes. How the tax would work The proposed measure would apply to all of a person’s assets worldwide, including shares in both publicly traded and private companies, plus items like art. It would not count certain retirement accounts or real estate. To get on the November ballot, supporters need about 875,000 signatures. A simple majority of voters would need to approve it. The tax would apply retroactively to anyone who lived in California on Jan. 1, 2026. Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, who lives in the Bay Area and has roughly $150 billion, said he would accept the tax. The union estimates the money would help offset healthcare funding cuts in the Republican tax bill that President Trump signed last year. Debru Carthan, who serves on the union’s executive committee, said in a statement: “We’re simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives…the few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.” Some chat members said they don’t want to leave California, where their families live, but feel frustrated with Rep. Ro Khanna, whose district covers Silicon Valley. He has publicly supported the tax. The New York Times previously reported that some billionaires privately discussed trying to remove Khanna from office. Search for compromise solutions Khanna said in an interview that the tax needs adjustments so it doesn’t affect shares that people can’t easily sell, or voting shares. “There has to be some provisions in addressing that,” he said. He’s working to get tech leaders and union representatives talking. David Gamage, a law professor at the University of Missouri who helped write the proposal, said people wouldn’t be forced to sell their shares. They could borrow money using their assets or delay payments. Some billionaires have suggested giving the government stock for about 10 years as a no-interest or low-interest loan, taxing loans made using assets, or only taxing publicly traded stock. Phone discussions are planned for next week. On the Signal chat, some participants have raised concerns that economic growth slowed in countries that enacted wealth taxes. Discussion also touched on the benefits Silicon Valley gets from having tech founders, companies, investors, and universities clustered together. Some feared an exodus would reduce this advantage. Supporters of the tax point to the growth of many California companies, including recent gains in artificial intelligence, and say the state’s billionaires would remain among the world’s richest after the tax. Advisers working with the union say the 5% rate is modest because billionaires’ wealth has been growing an average of 7.5% yearly, accounting for inflation. San Francisco accountant Richard Pon, who works with extremely wealthy clients and typically votes Republican because of tax views, supports this proposal. “I’m not going to be a billionaire,” Pon said. “It’s never going to impact me.” Don’t just read crypto news.

The crypto-linked products have helped ensure significant capital influx into the altcoin in recent months. While the XRP ETFs recorded their first negative outflow day in the past week, the exchange-traded funds also reached a new record in terms of the total value traded in a single week. This milestone reflects the growing maturity of the XRP ETF market in the US. XRP Funds Post $219M Trading Volume In Past Week According to the latest market data, the spot XRP ETFs posted their highest weekly trading volume since debut at $219 million. This figure is almost double the value traded in the XRP ETF market in the previous week ($117.4 million). Related Reading: Analyst Outlines The Bull Case For XRP And Why Price Will Hit All-Time High Soon Meanwhile, this new record merely surpasses the previous record of $213.9 million reached in the third week of December 2025. This feat signals the rising investor demand for the XRP exchange-traded funds despite the waning interest in the broader crypto ETF market. As mentioned earlier, the US-based XRP ETFs registered their first negative performance in the past week, with a net outflow of $40.8 million on Wednesday, January 7. However, this single-day performance didn’t stop the exchange-traded products from ending the week in the green. Data from SoSoValue reveals that the XRP ETF market saw an additional $38.07 million in value for the week ending January 9. However, a look at the chart shows that the capital inflow for the crypto-linked products is steadily declining. As of this writing, the spot XRP ETFs have accumulated $1.47 billion in total net assets since launching in mid-November 2025. Canary Capital’s XRPC tops the list with $375.1 million in net assets under management (AUM), followed by Bitwise’s XRP fund at $300.3 million, and Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ at $279.6 million. XRP ETFs Shine While Crypto ETF Market Flounders While the XRP ETFs seem to be enduring the market storm, the more-established Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have seen better days. According to recent market data, the crypto funds saw a combined withdrawal of $749.6 million during their first full trading week of the year. Most notably, the spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day net outflows of $486.1 million on Wednesday, January 7. The BTC exchange-traded funds closed the week with a net outflow of over $681 million. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ETF market, which started on a positive note with inflows of $168.1 million on January 5 and $114.7 million on January 6, eventually ended the week with net withdrawals of $68.6 million.

The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the psychological $90,000 mark, with no significant movement observed over the past 24 hours. While the Bitcoin price action — or lack thereof — has lulled most investors to sleep, a particular market participant has just woken from their slumber. According to the latest on-chain data, a Satoshi-era miner just moved a significant amount of Bitcoin over the weekend. Satoshi-Era Miner Moves 2,000 BTC On Saturday In a post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, revealed that a Bitcoin miner from the Satoshi era moved 2,000 coins on Saturday, January 10. This would represent the first time such movement would be occurring from this group of network participants since November 2024. The Satoshi-era miners refer to entities that mined BTC during its earlier years, typically between 2009 and 2011, when the flagship cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was still active. At the time, mining BTC was a less competitive sport (could be done with a consumer CPU), with greater rewards. Moreno noted that, historically, the Satoshi-era miners have only ever moved their coins at key inflection points. In November 2024, when the last miner from this group made a transaction, the price of Bitcoin was around $91,000. The premier cryptocurrency has since gone on to set multiple all-time highs before reaching the current cycle peak of $126,080. While it is difficult to say what the Satoshi-era miner saw before its latest move, the pattern-like nature of these coin movements makes them too relevant to ignore. Why Bitcoin Investors Should Watch Out For $84,500 As earlier inferred, indecisiveness seems to be returning to the Bitcoin market, as the bulls and bears continue their battle around the $90,000 level. While this region has gained relevance in recent weeks, recent on-chain data has identified another crucial level beneath it. According to Alphractal’s CEO and founder, Joao Wedson, this level is the 2-year moving average (2Y MA) of Bitcoin. The on-chain expert highlighted that this level represents the last major support cushion for the market leader. From a historical perspective, the loss of the 2Y MA, which is currently around $84,500, could increase the probability of capitulation significantly. In essence, the premier cryptocurrency faces the risk of extended downward movement once it crosses below $84,500. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $90,435, reflecting no change in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT|Satoshi-era miner,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-11 17:00:44

A recent post by crypto analyst Steph (@Steph_iscrypto) highlights a comparison that places XRP at a position he believes mirrors Bitcoin’s earliest parabolic phase. The claim rests entirely on chart structure, focusing on where the price sits in a multi-year cycle. A Chart Built on Long-Term Structure Steph shared a split chart comparing Bitcoin’s early cycle to XRP’s current setup. On the left, Bitcoin traded near $2 in 2012, just before its historic expansion. On the right, XRP trades around $2 in the present cycle. Both assets sit near the base of a rising parabolic curve . The Bitcoin chart shows the price hugging the curve before acceleration followed. The XRP chart shows a similar relationship between price and curve. In both cases, the price compresses near the lower boundary rather than extending far above it. That positioning matters to long-term technical traders. Steph summarized his view succinctly, writing, “This XRP chart is hard to ignore.” This $XRP chart is hard to ignore. When Bitcoin traded around $2, it was sitting at the very start of its parabolic expansion. Almost no one believed in it back then. Today, XRP is priced around $2 — at the same relative point on the curve. Same stage in the cycle, same… pic.twitter.com/rpiUkKcaxL — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 10, 2026 Why the $2 Level Matters for XRP XRP has spent a lot of time consolidating around $2 after a gradual decline from its peak in July 2025 . On the chart Steph shared, that consolidation occurs exactly where the parabolic curve begins to steepen. Bitcoin showed similar behavior at the same stage of its cycle, just before its expansion phase began. In Bitcoin’s case, its price did not explode immediately. The major expansion came later, and the chart comparison suggests XRP now occupies that preparatory zone. The chart reveals a significant structural similarity, and repeating this historical performance could propel XRP to unprecedented levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Next Target A key detail on Steph’s chart is the projected upside if XRP follows the full curve. Using the same 56,000% expansion shown on the chart and applying it to XRP’s current $2.09 price produces a theoretical level around $1,172.50. This figure does not represent a short-term expectation. It reflects the scale of movement implied by the structure if the parabolic trend develops fully over time. XRP now trades at a price level that carries historical significance in this comparison. The chart presents this target as a function of historical price behavior rather than speculation. It anchors the projection in mathematical extension and suggests long-term positioning for investors. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Investors Stack Before Protocol Launch,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-cheapest-crypto-with-700-upside-investors-stack-before-protocol-launch/,"Before the next big crypto wave in the market comes, investors are looking to find the cheapest cryptocurrencies with the most upside potential. It is also thought that the best returns can be made on small market projects with genuine usefulness and definite launch strategies. As noted in recent research reports, there is one token that is currently cheap and one that is exhibiting a beginning adoption. It is being called by analysts as a potential 700% candidate when the protocol is released. The asset that is acquiring this attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Developing Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized market which is an automated financial infrastructure that connects depositors and borrowers. The protocol assists in collateral based loans that go along with interest rate models and liquidation triggers that safeguards liquidity pools. Users are able to deposit assets to get passive yield which increases or decreases according to demand. To illustrate it, a user may deposit 1,000 USDC in a lending pool and get mtTokens, which reflect his or her position. The yield of the holder of the mtTokens goes up as the other users borrow. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in preparation of its V1 protocol release . V1 will invoke lending, yield, collateral management and liquidation logic. Analysts believe that V1 will be the primary catalyst as it will start to be actually used and not speculated upon only. Development has always had security as a pillar. Halborn Security reviewed Mutuum Finance. Halborn has been considered as one of the most reputable security firms within the blockchain industry. This review makes investors have confidence that the protocol will manage collateral and liquidations safely on the launch of V1. Investment Measures and Price Trend Mutuum Finance has received good financial backing on the part of early investors. The project has been able to raise an excess of $19.6 million in financing and has attracted over 18,700 individual investors. Analysts think that such numbers are important as they are an indication of acceptance and trust before the launch. Clear price progression has also been enjoyed by the early participants. In Phase 1, MUTM was selling at $0.01; however, in the present phase, MUTM is at $0.04, which is a 300% increase over the first phase. Phase 1 purchasers will stand at approximately 500% increase in case the token is listed at the confirmed launch price of $0.06. This constant shift up the price scales points at the stable demand and the increase in the expectations of the protocol. The initial price gains are to many analysts considered an indication of investor confidence associated with the roadmap and product design of Mutuum Finance, as opposed to temporary trading. Security Rating and Whale Traffic Certik has also reviewed the token scan of Mutuum Finance. The token made a 90 out of 100 score in the Certik token scan. Retail buyers and institutional players are the two categories that heavily follow Certik ratings since they rank the behavior of smart contracts, exposure to vulnerabilities, transparency in their operation. The rating of token scan as high is a positive indicator of the development in the long term. The protocol also intends to incorporate the stablecoins in its lending. Stablecoins will be viewed as primary liquidity assets to borrow and collateral. Stablecoin integration will also play a critical role in controlling risks since they will lower the exposure to volatility among depositors and enable predictable yield mechanisms. Mutuum Finance is at phase 7 of its distribution plan. Phase 7 has experienced a fast rate of allocation depletion with both the retail and whale wallets already stacking tokens. A single purchase involved one whale whose allocation was more than $120,000. Whale activity is a good sign to analysts since large wallets tend to concentrate on long term growth and increased upside. Phase 7 is selling fast because the tokens are heading towards the last launch pricing point. The sense of urgency has been heightened by the impending release of the V1 protocol as well as the fact that analysts now predict between 700% and 1000% of the upside in case the protocol is adopted as planned. Having solid capital, a large number of investors, security approval, and a clear launch strategy, many have now discussed MUTM as being one of the most low priced crypto assets which have high upside into 2026.

Hearings are set for Thursday, and the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees will review and possibly revise their own sections. If they pull this off, it could set the first real legal rules for crypto in the country. This Clarity Act is supposed to make it easier for digital asset firms to stay in the U.S. without getting buried in legal mess. The bill could change how the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission divide up the job of regulating crypto. It also lays out rules for who needs to register, what kind of tokens exist, and what exchanges and brokerages have to do to stay compliant. Lawmakers will fight over stablecoins, DeFi, and Trump-linked profits Three issues are guaranteed to cause problems this week. First, stablecoin rewards. Second, the treatment of DeFi platforms and their developers. Third, whether elected officials like President Donald Trump should be banned from making money off crypto while in office. Trump-linked groups have already launched both a memecoin and NFTs. Cody Carbone, head of the Digital Chamber, said the stablecoin reward issue is the “biggest outstanding issue” on Capitol Hill. He said, “Stablecoin rewards, interest, yields, whatever you want to call it, will be addressed in the bill. Both Republicans and Democrats have come to that conclusion.” Earlier this year, the Community Bankers Council from the American Bankers Association told senators that stablecoin firms are offering rewards in a way that dodges rules from the GENIUS Act, which passed last year. That law bans dollar-linked tokens from offering yields, but these new schemes are slipping through the cracks and competing with traditional savings accounts. On the DeFi side, people are worried that coders and developers will get punished when others use their tools for crimes like money laundering. Amanda Tuminelli, the top lawyer at the DeFi Education Fund, said they are “very conscious of how illicit finance is treated in the bill,” but want to make sure that obligations “aren’t put on codes instead of person.” She said the goal is to protect developers from being blamed when their tools are misused.DeFi supporters also want the bill to give people the right to hold their own crypto, without needing a third party. They’re pushing for language from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that would let software developers and service providers off the hook if they don’t control or hold customer funds. Senate expected to merge committee drafts and push to vote before midterms The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are supposed to finish their parts and release updated drafts this Thursday. After that, the two sections will be merged into one full version of the market structure bill . That combined bill will head to the Senate floor. Lawmakers expect this process to drag out for several weeks before it even has a shot at becoming law. Senator Elizabeth Warren and some of her colleagues want the final draft to include strict rules banning public officials from profiting off crypto while they’re in office. Summer Mersinger from the Blockchain Association said this was dropped in the House, but the Senate is “not going to punt on this issue.” She also warned that time is running out. With the 2026 midterm elections coming fast, lawmakers might lose key allies. “There’s a lot of other priorities Congress has on the books for this year,” Mersinger said . “This is kind of the key window that they see to get something to move out of committee onto the floor and have the time that’s needed to get it done.” Supporters of the bill know they’re in a race. If this doesn’t pass before November, everything could fall apart. With so much riding on it, and both parties still clashing over key parts, the future of crypto in America is hanging by a thread.

Trader Tardigrade identified the breakout, which comes after an extended period of downward pressure that had kept the cryptocurrency under consistent selling momentum. The move represents the first significant technical development in weeks for the meme coin. Price action now sits above a resistance line that previously capped multiple attempts at recovery. The breach occurred at a point where lower highs had defined the market structure, suggesting that bearish control may be weakening. Source: X Technical Break Signals Possible Reversal Setup The descending trendline had acted as a dominant resistance feature across multiple sessions. Each attempt to push higher was met with renewed selling, creating a pattern of declining peaks that reinforced downward momentum. That structure has now been violated. Trendline breaks on intraday timeframes carry weight among technical traders. The 4-hour chart provides enough granularity to identify short-term shifts while filtering out noise from lower timeframes. Breakouts at this level often serve as preliminary signals that precede larger moves. The breach does not guarantee a trend reversal. It does, however, remove a technical barrier that had consistently rejected upward movement. Price now has room to consolidate or attempt higher levels without immediately encountering the previous resistance zone. A successful retest of the broken trendline from above would strengthen the bullish interpretation. Failure to hold above the line would negate the breakout and potentially trigger renewed selling. Price Stabilizes Near $0.14 With Moderate Volume Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.1387. DOGE’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex ) The asset has stabilized in this range following the trendline breach rather than launching into an aggressive continuation pattern. Recent candlestick formations show consolidation behavior as the market digests the technical development. Volume levels remain moderate. No significant spike accompanied the breakout, indicating that the move has not yet attracted strong momentum flows. This suggests the price action is primarily driven by technical positioning rather than fundamental catalysts or large capital inflows. Moderate volume during a breakout can signal two scenarios. Either the market is waiting for additional confirmation before committing capital, or the move lacks the participation needed to sustain upward momentum. Both interpretations require patience before drawing conclusions about durability.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-11 17:46:04

Shanghai Securities News reports that the documents were submitted to the ITU last month. For what would be one of the biggest satellite projects ever attempted, radio frequencies and orbital locations are covered by the request. The scale of this application, according to space industry experts, indicates that China is making space-based internet a significant national priority. The request does not guarantee that every one of these satellites will launch. Everything must be reviewed by the ITU, and nations must cooperate on these matters. However, China’s goals are obvious: it wants a sizable portion of the low-Earth orbit satellite market. New institute leading the charge A new group called the Radio Innovation Institute is leading the charge. The institute was officially established on December 30, 2025, in Xiong’an New Area. It is backed by the government and focuses on radio technology. Seven groups came together to create this institute. The State Radio Monitoring Center is one of the founders. China Satellite Network Group Co., Ltd., which runs the country’s main satellite internet operations, is another. The list also includes Hebei Xiong’an New Area Management Committee, Hebei Provincial Department of Industry and Information Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing Jiaotong University, and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation. The institute’s objectives are to maximize the available radio frequencies and promote the expansion of the satellite internet industry. It is the center of what officials refer to as the “national team” approach. Several constellations are in the works The applications ask for permission for more than twelve different satellite groups. Some are small, with just dozens of satellites, while others are huge. The two biggest proposals are called CTC-1 and CTC-2. The Radio Innovation Institute filed both, and each one includes 96,714 satellites. Smaller requests were submitted by other groups. Under the moniker CHINAMOBILE-L1, China Mobile intends to launch 2,520 satellites. For its SAILSPACE-1 network, Yuanxin Satellite requested 1,296 satellites. Guodian Gaoke proposed plans for 1,132 satellites in the TIANQI-3G system. The variety of companies involved suggests that the government is working with both more modern commercial companies and well-established state-run institutions. Experts warn that filing with the ITU is just the first step. China does not necessarily have the factories, launchers, or money required to launch the satellites just because it has frequency licenses. Building and launching hundreds of thousands of satellites requires years and enormous financial resources. Still, industry watchers think the Radio Innovation Institute could help speed things up. By bringing together resources from across the industry and using China’s large home market and strong manufacturing base, the institute might help Chinese companies move faster. This could let them catch up to SpaceX , which already has thousands of Starlink satellites in space, providing internet service to customers worldwide. Whether China can pull this off depends on many factors. The country will need to continue spending money on the project for many years. Scientists and engineers will need to solve tough technical problems. Chinese officials will need to work with other countries through the ITU to settle disputes about who gets to use which frequencies and orbital locations. The satellite internet race is heating up. China’s massive filing shows the country plans to be a major player in this market. The coming years will reveal whether these ambitious plans become reality.

This development, confirmed on October 14, 2025, represents a notable retreat for Google’s ambitious AI search integration and highlights the persistent challenges of deploying automated systems in sensitive domains where accuracy can directly impact human health outcomes. Google AI Overviews Medical Query Removal Details The Guardian investigation discovered that Google’s AI Overviews provided incomplete information for liver function test queries, presenting numerical ranges without crucial contextual factors. Specifically, when users searched for “what is the normal range for liver blood tests,” the AI-generated summaries displayed standardized numbers that failed to account for variables including nationality, sex, ethnicity, and age. Consequently, this omission could potentially lead individuals to misinterpret their medical results, believing them to be within healthy parameters when they might not be. Following the investigation’s publication, Google removed AI Overviews from results for several specific queries. The affected searches include “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests.” However, the Guardian noted that variations like “lft reference range” or “lft test reference range” continued to trigger AI-generated summaries initially, though subsequent testing showed these too had been disabled. Interestingly, in several instances following the removal, the top search result became the Guardian’s own article about the investigation and Google’s response. Healthcare AI Reliability Challenges This incident underscores fundamental challenges in deploying AI systems for healthcare information. Medical data interpretation requires nuanced understanding of numerous variables that automated systems may oversimplify. The liver function test case demonstrates how standardized information, while technically accurate in isolation, becomes potentially misleading without proper contextualization. Healthcare professionals consistently emphasize that medical reference ranges serve as guidelines rather than absolute standards, requiring professional interpretation based on individual patient factors. Google’s response to the investigation reveals the company’s approach to managing AI accuracy concerns. A Google spokesperson told the Guardian that the company does not “comment on individual removals within Search,” but emphasized ongoing efforts to “make broad improvements.” The spokesperson also noted that an internal clinical team reviewed the highlighted queries and found that “in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.” This statement suggests Google believes the issue involves presentation and contextualization rather than factual inaccuracy. Industry Expert Perspectives Vanessa Hebditch, Director of Communications and Policy at the British Liver Trust, welcomed the removal as “excellent news” but expressed broader concerns. She noted that addressing individual problematic queries represents “nit-picking a single search result” while the fundamental issue of AI Overviews for health information remains unresolved. Her comments highlight the tension between reactive fixes and systemic solutions in AI deployment for sensitive applications. The medical community has long expressed concerns about search engine reliability for health information. Studies consistently show that patients increasingly turn to online sources before or instead of consulting healthcare professionals. While this democratizes access to information, it also creates risks when automated systems provide incomplete or decontextualized medical guidance. The liver function test example illustrates how even technically accurate information can become problematic when stripped of necessary qualifications and contextual explanations. Google’s Healthcare AI Development Timeline This incident occurs within Google’s broader healthcare AI initiatives. Last year, the company announced enhanced features specifically designed to improve Google Search for healthcare use cases. These improvements included refined overviews and specialized health-focused AI models. The current situation suggests ongoing challenges in translating these ambitions into reliable, real-world implementations. Google Healthcare AI Development Timeline Year Development Significance 2023 Initial AI Overviews testing Early integration of generative AI in search results 2024 Healthcare-specific AI models announced Specialized development for medical queries 2025 Guardian investigation published Revealed limitations in liver test queries 2025 AI Overviews removal for specific queries Reactive response to identified issues Broader Implications for AI Search Integration The removal of AI Overviews for specific medical queries raises important questions about the future of AI-integrated search engines. Several key implications emerge from this development: Accuracy vs. Accessibility Balance: Search engines must balance providing immediate information with ensuring its accuracy and appropriateness for sensitive topics. Contextual Understanding Limitations: Current AI systems struggle with the nuanced contextual understanding required for proper medical information interpretation. Reactive vs. Proactive Moderation: The incident highlights challenges in proactively identifying problematic AI responses before they reach users. Transparency Concerns: Limited communication about specific removals creates uncertainty about how and when AI features are modified. This situation also reflects broader industry challenges with generative AI deployment. As companies race to integrate AI features across products, ensuring reliability in sensitive domains remains a persistent challenge. The healthcare sector presents particularly difficult requirements due to the potential consequences of misinformation and the complex, contextual nature of medical knowledge. Technical and Ethical Considerations The technical architecture behind AI Overviews involves complex natural language processing systems trained on vast datasets. While these systems excel at identifying patterns and generating coherent responses, they may struggle with domains requiring precise, contextualized information. Medical queries often involve subtle distinctions and qualifications that challenge even advanced AI systems. Ethically, the deployment of AI for healthcare information raises questions about responsibility and accountability. When automated systems provide medical information, determining responsibility for potential harms becomes complex. The current incident demonstrates how companies navigate these challenges through reactive adjustments while developing more robust systems. Conclusion Google’s removal of AI Overviews for specific medical queries following the Guardian investigation represents a significant moment in the evolution of AI-integrated search. This development highlights ongoing challenges in deploying automated systems for healthcare information, particularly regarding contextual understanding and appropriate presentation of medical data. While Google continues developing specialized healthcare AI models, this incident underscores the need for careful implementation and ongoing evaluation of AI systems in sensitive domains. The broader implications extend beyond individual queries to fundamental questions about AI reliability, transparency, and appropriate application across different information domains. FAQs Q1: What specific medical queries lost Google AI Overviews? The Guardian investigation identified removal for “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” and “what is the normal range for liver function tests.” Variations like “lft reference range” initially retained AI Overviews but were subsequently disabled. Q2: Why did Google remove AI Overviews for these queries? The removal followed a Guardian investigation revealing that AI Overviews provided liver function test ranges without necessary contextual factors like age, sex, ethnicity, or nationality, potentially leading to misinterpretation of medical results. Q3: How did Google respond to the investigation findings? A Google spokesperson stated the company doesn’t comment on individual removals but works on “broad improvements.” An internal clinical team reviewed the queries and found the information “not inaccurate” and supported by quality websites in many instances. Q4: What are the broader concerns about AI Overviews for health information? Experts like Vanessa Hebditch of the British Liver Trust note that addressing individual queries doesn’t solve systemic issues with AI Overviews for health, emphasizing the need for more comprehensive solutions rather than reactive fixes. Q5: How does this incident fit into Google’s healthcare AI development? This occurs within Google’s broader healthcare AI initiatives, including last year’s announcement of improved overviews and health-focused AI models, highlighting ongoing challenges in translating these ambitions into reliable implementations.

Tech giants like Apple and Samsung are opposed to the move , claiming that the package lacks any global precedent and could reveal proprietary details and trade secrets, especially the source code, something Apple protects fiercely and has in the past resisted sharing with countries like the US and China. However, the country claims the demands are part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s broader strategy to strengthen cybersecurity in India, which is the world’s second-largest smartphone market. India’s government makes demands of phone makers Below is a list of some of the security requirements India is proposing for smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, which has prompted behind-the-scenes opposition from tech companies. Source code disclosure mandating manufacturers to not only test but also provide proprietary source code for review by government-designated labs, expected to identify vulnerabilities in the phone operating systems that could be exploited by attackers. Background permission restrictions that restrict apps from accessing cameras, microphones or location services in the background while phones are inactive, and when those permissions are active, a continuous status bar notification is required Permission review alerts that demand devices to periodically display warnings prompting users to review all app permissions, with continuous notifications. One year-long log retention, which requires devices to store security audit logs, including app installations and system logs, for up to 12 months. Periodic malware scanning, where phones must periodically scan for malware and identify any potentially harmful applications. Option to delete pre-installed apps that come bundled with the phone operating system, except those essential for basic phone functions. Informing a government organization before releasing any major updates or security patches. Tamper-detection warnings that detect when phones have been rooted or “jailbroken”, and display continuous warning banners to recommend corrective measures. Anti-rollback protection that permanently blocks the installation of older software versions, even if officially signed by the manufacturer, to prevent security downgrades. What tech companies think of the requirements The Indian Government has defended the security requirements by claiming it is to protect its citizens, a move that aligns with Narendra Modi’s data security push. However, major players like Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, and Google, represented by MAIT, the Indian industry group that represents these firms, have expressed opposition, especially regarding the sharing of source code. “This is not possible … due to secrecy and privacy,” MAIT, the group representing the smartphone makers, said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal. “Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia, and Africa do not mandate these requirements.” They claim that there is also no reliable way to detect jailbroken phones or prevent tampering, saying that the anti-rollback lacks standards, and that many pre-installed apps need to be kept as they are critical system components. MAIT has reportedly asked the ministry to drop the proposal, according to a source with direct knowledge. The documents from the firm also say regular malware scanning would significantly drain a phone’s battery and that it is “impractical” to seek government approval for software updates, as they are supposed to be timely fixes. As for the phone logs that the government has requested to be stored for at least 12 months on devices. MAIT claims most devices lack the capacity to store such logs on them, making it an impossible request to fulfill. In response to the points made by MAIT, IT Secretary S. Krishnan claimed that any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind, while adding that it was “premature to read more into it.” Meanwhile, a ministry spokesperson refused to comment further, claiming consultation was ongoing with the tech companies on the proposals.

This $0.04 Altcoin Targets 20x for 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/missed-early-dogecoin-doge-this-0-04-altcoin-targets-20x-for-2026/,"You are not alone, in case you missed the initial boom of Dogecoin. A lot of traders revise the meteoric surge of DOGE and question what the next breakout cryptocurrency would be. Currently, market analysts single out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the new altcoins which are drawing attention during the current cycle, a presale. This project has a real product roadmap and a decentralized finance (DeFi) focus which means that it will not only provide community sentiment and meme appeal. Evaluating what crypto to purchase today, it is possible to run a comparison between long-established ones such as Dogecoin and new promising alternatives to make informed decisions about risk-reward scenarios. The experience of DOGE has demonstrated how community support and liquidity can perform over the long term, but it also demonstrates constraints that more recent protocols are currently placing themselves to address. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) is among the most established brands in the crypto market. Having been created by the culture of the internet, it today has become a significant digital asset that is owned by a large number of people in their portfolios. DOGE currently sells at approximately $0.14, and the market cap is approximately $24B – becoming one of the strongest tokens within the ecosystem. Although the prices of the cryptos fluctuate occasionally, DOGE has still maintained a lot of liquidity and trading volume per day. Its crypto charts are closely monitored by traders, who observe the resistance zones existing above the pricier levels of higher prices that have been difficult to breach. This is a constant spectrum that restrains the short-term decisions of investors who are eager to know which crypto to purchase or which crypto to invest in at different Market cycles. The popularity of DOGE is greatly motivated by the support of the community, network recognition and representation in the retail listings across the globe. Its inflationary supply model and non-evolving utility are, however, some of the limits to explosive gains in the future, according to market commentators, as is its failure to build on functional products as protocols do. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Unlike the long-standing history of DOGE, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new altcoin that is linked to a futuristic lending and borrowing protocol that is decentralized. The project is doing a staged pre-sale, where the token is currently priced at approximately $0.04 in Phase 7, which is a stage that is selling out quite rapidly. Since demand is rising, each presale stage has a fixed price and distribution structure that results in tokens being shifted into higher pricing levels at a faster rate, which may result in organic upside pressure. Mutuum Finance is not only a presale token. It is establishing a working crypto platform on which people can lend, borrow, and receive interest off of shared liquidity. The official updates show that the initial V1 protocol will be deployed to the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026, with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot deployed. Security is another focus. The protocol had already been audited by Halborn Security , a reputable company in the blockchain industry, and this further presents an added level of examination to its smart contracts before being publicly tested. Strengths and Limitations of MUTM and DOGE Comparing DOGE and Mutuum Finance, it is worth comparing the popularity of community-based projects to the utility of the protocol. The strength of dogecoin is obvious; popular, with a strong liquidity level, and present on virtually every exchange. But the essential application of DOGE has not yet developed to a transfer medium or a market sentiment vehicle. This is a disadvantage to investors that usually receive the question of what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in over time as the value of the products being used. In comparison, Mutuum Finance is establishing the infrastructure that can be revenue-generating through lending activity, which can potentially finance token buyback and the staking dividend to token stakeholders in the safety module. Dogecoin lacks that direct connection between platform income and token demand. Early investment situations can be instructive to show possible variations in the result. As an illustration, taking an early bet of $550 in DOGE would have seen your returns pegged much more to macro trends and social trending. DOGE will have an opportunity to rise in a positive crypto market, yet the market environment of stagnation or declines would also restrict the demand on meme-based assets. Now suppose the same $550 is deployed into MUTM during its early presale stages. With strong presale demand, a defined roadmap, and utility still being built out, some analysts believe this setup could create more direct valuation support once the platform begins generating activity. In bullish scenarios, projections show MUTM trading between $0.30 and $0.36 within its first year of operation. At those levels, an early $0.04 entry would represent a return of 650% to 800%, assuming user growth and protocol revenue arrive as expected. Presale Selling Out The Phase 7 presale of Mutuum Finance is progressing fast, which indicates that there is continued interest with the launch milestones close to being reached. A completed audit work and a definite roadmap to the V1 testnet have ensured that the momentum has been maintained. The anticipation of a functioning borrowing protocol at launch has held the interests of crypto investors seeking new crypto currency to purchase with practicable use not merely in speculation of the prices. With the presale heading towards its final stage, there has been some market commentary that the more allocation and visibility amongst users, the higher the interest may be regenerated that may turn into heightened demand once tokens are launched on larger markets.

The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index went up 25% in 2025, while the S&P 500 climbed 16%. But those gains came almost entirely from just two companies: Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Experts on Wall Street believe this pattern will stick around in 2026. They point to slower profit growth and growing doubts about whether massive spending on artificial intelligence will actually pay off. Early signs support their view. The Magnificent 7 index has risen only 0.5% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.8%. Picking the right tech stock now matters more than ever. The three-year bull market has been driven by tech giants. Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. alone made up more than one-third of the S&P 500’s gains since October 2022. But excitement about these companies is fading as interest spreads across the broader market. Tech giants face earnings slowdown As Big Tech’s earnings growth slows down, investors want more than promises about AI riches. They want actual returns. The Magnificent 7 are expected to see profits grow about 18% in 2026, the slowest rate since 2022. That’s barely better than the 13% growth projected for the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. One bright spot is valuations. The Magnificent 7 index trades at 29 times projected profits over the next 12 months, well below the 40s multiples seen earlier in the decade. The S&P 500 trades at 22 times expected earnings, while the Nasdaq 100 Index sits at 25 times. Nvidia, the leading AI chipmaker, faces pressure from growing competition and worries about whether its biggest customers will keep spending. Still, Wall Street remains bullish. Of the 82 analysts covering Nvidia, 76 recommend buying. The average price target suggests a roughly 39% gain over the next 12 months, the best among the group. Microsoft spent 2025 underperforming the S&P 500 for the second straight year. The data center expansion is boosting revenue growth in Microsoft’s cloud business, but customers aren’t paying as much for AI services built into its software products. Apple took a different path with less aggressive AI ambitions. Revenue is expected to expand 9% in fiscal 2026, ending in September, the fastest pace since 2021. With the stock valued at 31 times estimated earnings, the second highest in the Magnificent 7 after Tesla, it needs that growth to keep going. Amazon leads the pack in early 2026 Alphabet went from worry to Wall Street favorite in a year. The stock rose more than 65% last year, the best performance in the Magnificent 7. But shares trade at around 28 times estimated earnings, well above their five-year average of 20. The average analyst price target projects just a 3.9% gain this year. Amazon was the weakest Magnificent 7 stock in 2025, marking its seventh straight year in that position. But the company has started 2026 strong. Concerns about AWS falling behind rivals had pressured the stock, along with aggressive AI spending that includes warehouse automation using robotics. Meta Platforms shows how investors have grown skeptical of big AI spending. The stock fell in late October after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $72 billion and projected “notably larger” spending in 2026. After hitting a record in August with a 35% gain for the year, shares have since dropped 17%. Tesla’s shares were the worst performers in the Magnificent 7 through the first half of 2025, then jumped more than 40% in the second half as CEO Elon Musk shifted focus from slumping electric vehicle sales to self-driving cars and robotics. The stock now trades at almost 200 times estimated profits, making it the second most expensive stock in the S&P 500 behind takeover target Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. After two years of flat revenue, Tesla is expected to start growing again in 2026. Revenue is projected to rise 12% this year and 18% next year, following an estimated 3% drop in 2025. Still, the average analyst price target projects a 9.1% decline over the next 12 months. Data centers are expected to require roughly $7 trillion in capital spending by 2030, according to a McKinsey & Co. report . At the rapid rate data centers are being built in the U.S., there’s no end in sight for electricity needed to power them. 3,778 data centers are in the U.S., according to Data Center Map . Through 2028, another 280 or so are expected to come online. The Bank of America Institute has reported that U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow 2.5% annually over the next decade, five times faster than the growth rate over the past decade.

According to posts from XRPL developers and industry figures, the ledger can support 24/7 access, quick transfers, and integration with automated market makers. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator Meld Gold is cited as a concrete step: reports have disclosed that Meld partnered with Ripple in June 2024 and launched gold and silver tokens in Q3 2024, with each token backed by one gram of physical metal held by trusted providers. That move put an actual product on the ledger instead of just talk. Tokenized Metals Moving Toward XRPL Advocates argue that having on-ledger tokens backed by real metal changes the use case for XRP and the XRPL. Phil Kwok, co-founder of Web3 technology company and education platform EasyA, told followers that “tokenized gold is coming to the XRPL,” and validators like Vet pointed out the technical fit. absolutely. tokenised gold is coming to the xrp ledger. and it’s going to be epic. https://t.co/wSPobxHD2W — Phil Kwok | EasyA (@kwok_phil) January 9, 2026 Vet highlighted features such as constant availability and links to DeFi tools, and raised the question of why broad adoption has not happened yet. Some future features, including lending and escrow, were mentioned as ways to make tokenized metals more useful. Market Demand And The Incentive Gap Demand already exists in other corners of crypto. Reports note Paxos and Tether manage billions of dollars’ worth of tokenized metals, showing investor interest is real. Still, execution matters. Pano Mekras of Anodos Finance told the discussion that incentives are likely the missing piece; large firms may be reluctant to launch products on the XRPL unless there are clear economic reasons to do so. Attracting high-volume projects may require active outreach and stronger on-ledger incentives. Market Reaction And Price Action Based on reports, XRP’s price moved above $2 early in January 2026 and touched around $2.41 during a broader crypto upswing. The token later settled near $2 as traders digested gains. A pullback of roughly 14% has been reported since the highs, and trading has shown both inflows from institutions and bouts of profit-taking. There is no clear proof that tokenized metals have driven these swings, however; market moves are being tracked separately from on-ledger product launches. What This Means For The XRPL If more tokenized metal products arrive, the XRPL could find new uses beyond payments. Trading and settlement for gold and silver tokens would add transaction volume and could open room for new DeFi tools built around those tokens.

Here’s Why You Should be Excited,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-sold-8-billion-xrp-in-2025-heres-why-you-should-be-excited/,"Ripple began 2026 with a significant milestone. According to Crypto X AiMan, the company sold over $8 billion worth of XRP in 2025. This figure comes directly from Ripple’s annual report and reflects the company’s strategic use of XRP to fund business operations. The sales are part of a larger plan to expand Ripple’s core businesses and develop its RLUSD stablecoin. Despite the scale of these transactions, XRP holders should not view this as negative. Crypto X AiMan emphasizes that the sales are a strategic distribution rather than a market dump. Ripple uses the proceeds to acquire profitable companies , strengthening its long-term position in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This approach aligns the company’s success with the value of the digital asset. HUGE WARNING: Ripple SOLD $8B XRP?! And YES, Ripple will sell MORE XRP in 2026! But here’s what most people get WRONG • Why this is NOT bearish • Ripple will NEVER sell 25 BILLION XRP • XRP on exchanges is at an 8-YEAR LOW This is NOT a dump, this is strategic… pic.twitter.com/QqwwoHS2T2 — Crypto X AiMan (@CryptoXAiMan) January 10, 2026 Exchange Supply Multi-year Low Supply data reinforces this perspective. The amount of XRP available on exchanges has fallen to an eight-year low. Crypto X AiMan notes that XRP on exchanges dropped from approximately 4 billion to less than 1.5 billion tokens in recent months. A reduced exchange supply can support market stability and may increase demand pressure as more investors enter the market. This dynamic suggests that the XRP sales do not weaken the market. Ripple Retains Significant XRP Stake Ripple also maintains a significant stake in XRP. According to a previous Ripple report cited in the video, the company plans to retain 25% of all XRP issued, approximately 25 billion tokens. This ensures that Ripple holds a substantial portion of the total 100 billion token supply . The company’s commitment to holding XRP signals confidence in the currency’s long-term value and provides stability despite ongoing sales. Crypto X AiMan highlights that this strategy benefits both Ripple and XRP holders. By funding acquisitions and expanding core operations with XRP sales, Ripple strengthens the ecosystem. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Positive Outlook for XRP in 2026 The combination of declining exchange supply and strategic XRP sales positions the market for potential growth. Even with billions of XRP sold, Crypto X AiMan emphasizes that demand remains strong . Investors who continue to hold XRP may benefit from the company’s expansion and the controlled supply on exchanges. This situation contrasts with concerns about oversupply or market dilution. Looking ahead, Crypto X AiMan confirms that XRP sales will continue in 2026. These sales will fund Ripple’s expansion, but do not indicate a loss of confidence. The company’s strategy shows a deliberate approach to scaling operations while maintaining a strong commitment to the XRP community.

TRM said this jump is directly tied to tougher sanctions, more governments using crypto, and a tech platform called Beacon Network that lets investigators talk to each other and share wallet info fast, which means dirty wallets are getting flagged sooner. Russia-linked wallets dominated 2025’s illicit crypto flows, says TRM TRM’s report said only 1.5% of all known crypto traffic in 2025 was dirty, down from 1.7% in 2024 and way lower than 3.5% in 2023. Same thing happened with incoming money, where only 2.7% of new flows went to bad wallets, down from 2.9% the year before and 6.0% in 2023. So there’s more crime in dollar terms, but less compared to how much clean money is flying around. Source: TRM One Russia-linked token called A757 got $72 billion in dirty money, and another $39 billion was sent straight to the A7 wallet group, which means over 80% of all sanctions-linked volume was connected to Russian players. TRM named Garantex, Grinex, and A7 as key players. A wallet is one thing, but TRM also flagged a token called A7A5, a ruble-backed stablecoin tied to Russia’s larger game plan: cut out the US dollar and build their own rails. The A7 wallets are mostly for sanctions dodging, but A7A5 was used in all kinds of official flows. TRM alleged that 95% of all cash going to these sanctioned wallets came in through stablecoins. That tells you the tools have changed. These people know how to hide, and they’re using stablecoins to stay under the radar. Sanctions are stricter now. So they’ve shifted to smaller, riskier platforms that don’t play by the rules. In Venezuela, the government allegedly used crypto to keep the lights on since banks are frozen there. So they turned to tokens for state payments, remittances, and whatever else they could sneak through. TRM also pointed at Chinese-language escrow services and underground banks being used by scammers, hackers, and sanctions dodgers. In 2020, that activity was around $123 million, but now it’s over $103 billion. These services move huge amounts of stablecoins into legit systems, through over-the-counter brokers, money mules, and casinos in Asia, according to TRM. Enforcement speeds up and dirty wallets get caught faster TRM broke the numbers down by crime type. Sanctions violations grew more than 400%. Blocklisted wallets went up 32%. Hacked or stolen money rose 31%. Darknet markets added 20%. Sales of illegal goods and services rose 12%. This wasn’t because criminals got better. TRM said the difference was faster enforcement. Beacon Network made it easier for investigators to connect the dots across countries. It didn’t change what’s defined as “illicit,” but it sped up how fast dirty wallets got tagged. Stablecoin companies joined in too. TRM said Tether in particular started going after bad wallets linked to terrorism, scams, and hacks. That helped explain why so many of the flagged transactions involved stablecoins. Enforcement is getting smarter and faster. TRM also updated how it counts crime. They used to compare illicit crypto activity to total blockchain traffic. That made crime look smaller because bots, trading firms, and exchanges inflate volume with fake trades and rapid moves. Now, TRM compares illicit money to cash actually leaving VASPs, real providers like exchanges. That shows what part of real usable money is going to bad actors. If $100 comes in and $20 ends up in criminal wallets, that’s a real 20% risk. Doesn’t matter how many times the same $100 got bounced around. Source: TRM Labs TRM also removed fake volume from the math; stuff like wash trading, peel chains, and internal movements. These things don’t add capital. They just move it in circles to boost stats. That junk is gone from the new model. They said the numbers are conservative. They don’t include fiat crimes that later turned crypto, or unaudited wallets. They also skipped laundering chains. They only tracked income, not what happened after the money was moved around. TRM said these totals are going to go up later. New wallets always get found after the fact. Investigations take time. Sanctions get updated. Court records get unsealed. So what’s $158 billion today might be more tomorrow. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The year also marked major corporate and product developments, from record-breaking acquisitions to broader access for on-chain assets, solidifying the exchange’s position as a leading full-stack crypto platform. Record Growth and Global Expansion In a January 6 post on X, Coinbase listed its milestones from last year, including becoming the first crypto-native company listed on the S&P 500, cementing the place of digital assets in mainstream financial portfolios. The exchange also completed ten acquisitions, including Liquifi Finance, Echodot.xyz, and Deribit, which incidentally was the largest acquisition in crypto history, broadening its offerings from token launch support to secondary trading. On the regulatory front, Coinbase secured approval under Europe’s MiCA framework, allowing it to offer regulated crypto services across the EU with a single license. U.S. operations also evolved, with the company reincorporating in Texas. Institutional trading grew as the exchange introduced 24/7 CFTC-regulated futures, U.S.-style perpetuals, and cross-margin trading, while retail users gained access to crypto-backed loans exceeding $1 billion in Bitcoin collateral, now including Ethereum loans as well. The firm’s product expansion included Solana DEX trading within its app, offering 100 million users access to millions of tokens on the fast-growing blockchain. Additionally, token sales returned to retail with fair allocation models, the Coinbase One Card launched with Bitcoin rewards, and Base, the platform’s social, trading, and payments app, rolled out globally. 2025 also brought legal victories. The SEC voluntarily dismissed its case against the exchange, ending prolonged litigation that many in the industry saw as a major regulatory hurdle. Rising Ambitions Meet Persistent Security Concerns Despite its commercial successes, Coinbase faces ongoing criticism over security and user protection. Following CEO Brian Armstrong’s 2026 roadmap announcement, crypto researcher Taylor Monahan argued earlier in the week that user safety was still not a priority, citing over $350 million in preventable losses in 2025. She referenced a 2024 incident where a Coinbase Commerce contract was linked to suspicious outflows of $15.9 million, an issue highlighted at the time by investigator ZachXBT. Critics say the exchange’s rapid growth and new product launches, including prediction markets and expanded trading, have at times outpaced its security infrastructure. The company is also engaging in new legal battles. Last year, it filed lawsuits against Illinois, Michigan, and Connecticut, challenging state efforts to classify prediction market contracts as illegal gambling. Coinbase argued that these products fall under the exclusive federal jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This move came just ahead of its planned January 2026 rollout of event-based contract trading via a partnership with CFTC-regulated platform Kalshi.

Open interest data reveals a sharp decline in leveraged positions across major trading platforms. The meme cryptocurrency now faces a significantly weakened market structure. This shift raises concerns about potential volatility amplification during future price movements. Open Interest Plummets After September Peak CoinGlass tracking showed Dogecoin futures open interest climbing from approximately $1.5 billion in late June to nearly $6.0 billion by mid-September. The asset traded within a narrow range of $0.25 to $0.28 during this accumulation phase. The ETF rollout failed to sustain speculative momentum. By mid-October, open interest had crashed to around $2.0 billion. The metric continued to decline through year-end, stabilizing at around $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion from December to January. Source: CoinGlass This 75% reduction from peak levels signals a mass exodus of leveraged traders. The collapse occurred despite initial market optimism surrounding institutional product launches. Binance-specific metrics painted an equally bearish picture. The exchange's DOGE futures open interest reached approximately $1.15 billion in mid-September. The figure subsequently dropped below $400 million before settling near $300 million in recent weeks. Source: CoinGlass The price action reflected diminished market participation. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.1380, suggesting a 1.41% decline over the past 24 hours. DOGE’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinCodex ) Market Structure Shifts Create Volatility Risk The decline in futures positioning has fundamentally altered Dogecoin's liquidity profile. Reduced leverage participation typically indicates fewer active traders maintaining positions across the derivatives curve. This environment creates conditions for sharper price swings. Thinner order books and lower open interest mean individual transactions can move markets more easily. Liquidation cascades become more probable when fewer participants provide depth. The current market structure contrasts sharply with the robust activity seen during the summer months. September's elevated open interest supported tighter spreads and more efficient price discovery. That foundation has eroded.

It never has. Companies enter, companies leave. Some grow fast and earn a spot, while others shrink, merge, go private, or collapse. Stability is not how this index works. So perhaps this churn helps explain how the market behaves over time. Prices can rise while the lineup behind them shifts quietly. The S&P 500 today is not the same index from ten years ago. It is not even close. The market keeps replacing its own parts. Turnover changes leadership and investor outcomes Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Snider put numbers to this change. “On average, 20% of S&P 500 constituents turn over every five years,” Ben wrote in a January 6 research note. He shared a chart tracking this pattern back to 1985. The data shows steady turnover across decades, not a one‑off event. This matters because the market is never pushed by all stocks at once. At any moment, a small group drives gains. Those leaders usually look unstoppable. Then many of them slow down and fall behind. New stocks take their place and carry the market forward. That handoff keeps happening. Recent history shows it clearly. Six of the Magnificent 7 joined the S&P 500 only within the past 25 years. They were not permanent fixtures. They earned entry over time. Their rise shows how quickly leadership can change inside the index. Turnover also explains why beating the market is so hard. Long‑term returns come from a minority of names. Most stocks do not outperform. Picking a winner is worse than a coin flip. The odds lean toward underperforming the S&P 500, not beating it. Timing makes it tougher. Buying a strong stock is only half the job. Selling before it drags returns is just as critical. As companies spend less time in the index, that timing window keeps shrinking. Mistakes happen faster. Many investors avoid those choices by buying index funds. Holding an S&P 500 fund is called passive investing because it limits trading. But the holdings inside that fund still change. Investors own a rotating mix of companies as names enter and exit.

Users have reported receiving multiple password reset request emails following the alleged hack reported by Malwarebytes. However, Meta continues to insist that there was no breach. Was Instagram’s user data leaked? Malwarebytes reported that Instagram discovered a breach in its security during a routine dark web monitoring scan. And it claims that it has resulted in the sensitive data of approximately 17.5 million Instagram users being made available for sale on underground forums so far. The compromised information includes Instagram usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and additional personal details. The cybersecurity company said this incident is linked to a potential API exposure that occurred in 2024. However, Meta , Instagram’s parent company, has so far denied the breach claims, stating it fixed a technical issue and, in the process, had password reset emails triggered by an external party. “We fixed an issue that let an external party request password reset emails for some people. There was no breach of our systems and your Instagram accounts are secure. You can ignore those emails — sorry for any confusion,” the company wrote . Despite Meta’s denial, many Instagram users have reported receiving multiple password reset request emails in recent days, and panic has spread on social media that cybercriminals are attempting to exploit people’s stolen information. The leaked information could also be used by the attackers to craft convincing fraudulent messages that make users more likely to click on malicious links or provide additional sensitive information. With access to usernames, email addresses, and phone numbers, cybercriminals can attempt to gain control of an individual’s accounts. The attackers can use it to spread spam, scam the victim’s followers, or access any linked payment information or private messages. The physical addresses included in the breach could potentially be used for identity theft, targeted harassment, or even to threaten someone’s physical safety. How can Instagram users protect themselves? ManageMyHealth, New Zealand’s largest patient portal with about 1.8 million registered users, revealed that there was unauthorized access to its application. It stated that approximately 6% to 7% of its users may be impacted, which is roughly 108,000 to 126,000 people. Security experts strongly recommend that all Instagram users take immediate protective measures like enabling two-factor authentication on their accounts. The security feature requires a second form of verification beyond just your password, which is typically a code sent to your phone or generated by an authentication app. They also recommend changing your Instagram password, especially if you’ve been using the same password for an extended period or if you’ve reused it across multiple platforms. Users should create strong, unique passwords that have uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers and special characters. Instagram users have been warned to be skeptical of unexpected emails, text messages, or direct messages asking for personal information or urging immediate action. Meta was in a similar situation back in November 2024 when a leak reportedly exposed 489 million Instagram user records on a dark web platform. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Investors Prefer This New Altcoin Over Shiba Inu (SHIB),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-with-300-investors-prefer-this-new-altcoin-over-shiba-inu-shib/,"Many new people enter into crypto with a simple question. Which crypto is the most profitable when investing with a low amount of money. To a number of people three hundred dollars is sufficient to place a bet on something which has the potential of increasing in the long run. In previous bull markets, the solution could have been Shiba Inu (SHIB). The discussion is changing to new altcoins that are much further down their growth curves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the names that drew attention. According to some analysts, the difference is in utility, the room of valuation, and timing. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu was trendy when the meme coins were enjoying their boom. It shot up thousands of per cent as traders jumped in. Nowadays, the token is trading at $0.000009 and has a market capitalization of $5B. SHIB still is popular and has a big community. It has also been quoted on most of the major exchanges. That provides it with liquidity, but it also puts a ceiling. The price action has been languishing beneath critical resistance levels for months. Cryptocurrency traders citing crypto charts suggest that it lacks new stimuli and it becomes hard to propel a multi-billion dollar valuation without new utility. According to some market commentators, SHIB might not be able to get back to its early highs, particularly in the absence of a new story to power demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new cryptocurrency that is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing platform. The protocol will also allow the users to deposit assets in liquidity pools and earn interest. Loans are allowed where the borrowers post collateral rather than selling their possession. The platform utilizes the use of mtTokens to monitor supplied assets and debt tokens to monitor loans. The MUTM token is under presale. It is priced around $0.04 in Phase 7. Already, the presale has raised over 19M and more than 18,800 holders. Being limited in the number of slots per stage and price, the increased demand will result in the stages selling out and advancing to the next crypto stage of the price scale. Phase 1 appreciation of close to 300% have already been seen by early entrants. 3 Reasons MUTM May Do Better Than SHIB Valuation Room and Growth Curve. Shiba Inu has already reached a $5B market cap. That degree restricts its distance of movement. A lot of traders realize that SHIB will not be able to replicate its initial growth since such exponential returns were achieved on a small valuation foundation. Mutuum Finance is in the initial growth curve. The market capitalization is very low and the token is yet to be potentially listed on any big exchange. This will leave it space to grow within a new crypto cycle in case the product is adopted. To an individual with $300 that is significant. Utility vs Meme Dynamics SHIB remains a meme token. It is culturally high with little direct usage. Demand depends on sentiment. That is a problem in lateral markets. Mutuum Finance is organized with respect to real utility. Collateralized borrowing gives yield to the lenders. It operates by the buy and redistribute system in which the MUTM bought on the open market is re-distributed to users who stake the mtTokens in the safety module. That links revenues of the platform to token demand. This, according to commentators in the market, makes a more sustainable token economy. Timing and Capital Rotation Timing is also a factor. There are already thousands of former SHIB owners who have made some money. Certain analysts feel that they are now moving to presales and early stage protocols with better upside potential. Mutuum Finance has recorded high presale momentum. The team also attested that its V1 platform is going live on testnet. Such developments present investors with something new to look forward to other than price. Incentives and Onboarding Support Mutuum Finance (MUTM) passed an audit by Halborn Security . That has assisted in confidence building before launch. It also operates a 24 hour leader board in the project that rewards the best daily contributor with $500 of MUTM. A bug bounty of $50k is also available concerning the code vulnerabilities. These rewards have assisted in driving the presale and also maintained the community interest. With increasing numbers of investors posing the question of which crypto to purchase during the upcoming bull cycle, MUTM is regarded as an altcoin with a higher potential of earlier stages of development than Shiba Inu. The disparities in developing utility, timing, and valuation justify why numerous new entrants with $300 to invest are considering things other than the old meme tokens and a fresh take on projects that may outline the subsequent stage of crypto investment.

The two companies will work together to let users put money on what they think will happen to median prices in cities like Miami and Los Angeles for starters. These markets will close on February 1, using Parcl’s daily price index to determine winners. But according to Polymarket, there will be new housing prediction markets every month, so people can keep trading based on fresh data. Right now, most Americans still can’t use Polymarket; access is limited to a waitlist. But its competitors, like Kalshi and Robinhood, are already open to the public. Users bet on real-time housing price movements The housing market has always been full of stale data. Most price indicators use past sales and come out months after the fact. Real estate agents and analysts say that’s still the most reliable way to judge demand in a city. But the problem is that these reports move slower than the market itself. Polymarket wants to change that by giving people real-time exposure. And supporters say prediction markets have a major advantage, as people are literally betting their own cash. When money is on the line, people pay more attention. These types of bets aren’t just about opinion. They’re about incentives. And apparently, those incentives work. Polymarket traders were closer to predicting Donald Trump’s 2024 win than most political polling firms. The idea is simple: when a lot of people put skin in the game, the average of their bets often beats expert guesses or surveys. This is happening as the U.S. housing market hits a new, weird milestone. There are now more homeowners with mortgage rates above 6% than below 3%. During the pandemic, loans under 3% were common. Now they’re rare. The average 30-year mortgage rate has stayed above 6% for more than three years, according to Federal Reserve numbers. People who locked in those low rates are staying put. They don’t want to trade a cheap loan for a more expensive one. This has made the housing supply tight. Fewer listings means higher prices, a situation known as the mortgage lock-in effect. Market stays frozen as rates discourage sellers Even though rates are high, people still sell when they have no other choice. Life happens. Jobs change, families grow, divorces hit, people retire. That’s why some homes still hit the market. But most of the new 30-year mortgages are now in the 6% range, so the pool of ultra-low-rate owners keeps shrinking. Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, said the shift from sub-3% to over-6% mortgages won’t fix things fast.“It’s becoming less of a problem the more that time goes on, but it’s a slow unwinding,” she said. To her, anyone with a rate under 4% is still basically stuck. That includes over half of all current mortgage holders. Even rates under 5% are too good for most people to walk away from. “It’s probably going to be another four, five years of it being a major factor in the housing market,” said Daryl. A Bankrate survey in July found that 54% of Americans wouldn’t sell their homes no matter what the mortgage rate is. That’s up from 42% the year before. About 32% said they’d only sell if rates dropped below 6%, and 23% said they’d need to see them below 5%. That 1% difference might not sound like a lot, but over a 30-year loan, it can add up to tens of thousands of dollars. Not everyone is sold on the idea of betting on housing data. Stephen Kates, a senior analyst at Bankrate, said there’s already enough tracking happening in the space. “This partnership simply allows participants to speculate on existing trends,” he said.

After reaching an all-time high in 2025, the cryptocurrency continues to show strength in early trading sessions. Analysts and industry observers are noting its potential to maintain a robust upward trajectory throughout the year. Rising Above Key Levels XRP’s early gains in 2026 signal renewed confidence among investors. The price breaking above $2 reflects sustained buying pressure. This level, previously a point of resistance, now acts as a foundation for potential further growth. The shift indicates that market participants view XRP as a strong asset with continued upside potential. YoungHoon Kim (@yhbryankimiq), a prominent voice in the crypto community with an IQ of 276, shared his outlook on the currency. He stated that XRP is in a super-cycle, and its recent performance supports that view. He previously predicted that the asset could hit a new all-time high this month , and this assessment suggests he sees 2026 as a year of decisive gains. Analysts who track XRP’s performance have echoed similar optimism, noting that technical signals and historical trends support ongoing growth. HUGE WARNING: Ripple SOLD $8B XRP?! And YES, Ripple will sell MORE XRP in 2026! But here’s what most people get WRONG • Why this is NOT bearish • Ripple will NEVER sell 25 BILLION XRP • XRP on exchanges is at an 8-YEAR LOW This is NOT a dump, this is strategic… pic.twitter.com/QqwwoHS2T2 — Crypto X AiMan (@CryptoXAiMan) January 10, 2026 Market Momentum and Predictions XRP’s performance in early 2026 builds on the gains recorded in 2025. After hitting an all-time high last year , the cryptocurrency has drawn attention for its ability to maintain bullish trends. The current price action supports expectations for continued strength, as investors respond to positive momentum. Kim emphasized the significance of the current cycle, and if he is right, everything could change for XRP. His view aligns with forecasts from other analysts who predict further gains and widespread adoption. He has also previously set a 5-year timeline for XRP to hit $100 , and the current super cycle could contribute to that growth. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The combination of technical strength and market interest points to a period of sustained activity for XRP throughout the year. Investor Confidence and Outlook Investor sentiment appears firmly positive. The move above $2 has reinforced confidence in XRP’s potential. Overcoming support levels provides stability while enabling future price increases. Early 2026 trends suggest that XRP may continue to outperform expectations, building on the gains of the previous year. With Kim’s prediction of a super cycle, XRP may enter a phase of extended growth. This perspective encourages investors to closely monitor price action, as continued activity above key levels often strengthens momentum.

In this context, the relative strength index ( RSI ) is among the notable indicators being used to gauge market conditions and inform decisions. Notably, the RSI measures the speed and change of price movements on a scale from 0 to 100. When RSI readings climb above 70, it typically signals that an asset is overbought, meaning it may have risen too quickly and could be due for a correction or pullback as sellers step in to take profits. Now, for investors looking for assets to buy in the coming week, some tokens are flashing high RSI readings, signaling the need for caution. Polygon (POL) Starting with Polygon ( POL ), the token, priced at $0.169, has shown mixed performance in the immediate term, with a 5.8% decline in the past 24 hours. However, its RSI readings paint a clearer picture of the underlying momentum. On the 15-minute timeframe, the RSI sits at 51.79, indicating neutral conditions in the very short term. The one-hour RSI is 47.12, still balanced, but the four-hour reading rises to 61.39, edging toward stronger buying pressure. The real concern emerges over longer periods, with the 12-hour RSI at 80.25 and the 24-hour RSI at 76.34. POL RSI readings. Source: Coinglass These elevated levels above 70 suggest that POL has experienced sustained upward momentum that may not be sustainable, increasing the risk of a reversal. Investors considering entry points should monitor for signs of cooling, as overbought conditions like these often precede periods of consolidation or downward adjustment. Render (RENDER) Similarly, Render ( RENDER ), trading at $2.615, has demonstrated stronger recent gains, up 13.99% over the past 24 hours, reflecting heightened interest in the token. Its RSI values, however, raise red flags for those eyeing trades this week. The 15-minute RSI stands at 70.53, already crossing into overbought territory and hinting at short-term buying exhaustion. This has intensified on the one-hour chart at 76.58, showing even stronger momentum. While the four-hour RSI dips slightly to 69.39, just below the threshold, it rebounds on the 12-hour timeframe to 73.33 and on the 24-hour to 75.97. RENDER RSI readings. Source: Coinglass Such consistently high readings across multiple timeframes imply that RENDER’s price surge could be overextended, making it vulnerable to profit-taking and a potential dip. Traders may benefit from waiting for the RSI to fall back toward more neutral levels, around 50, before committing capital.
