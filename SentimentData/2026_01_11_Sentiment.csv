That’s what leading Chinese AI researchers said Saturday. Two big Chinese AI startups, MiniMax and Zhipu AI, had strong debuts on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange this week. Investors seem confident in the sector as Beijing fast-tracks AI and chip listings to build homegrown alternatives to advanced US tech . Chipmaking equipment shortage holds back progress Yao Shunyu used to work as a senior researcher at OpenAI, the company that makes ChatGPT. Tencent named him their chief AI scientist last December. Ya o th inks there’s a good chance a Chinese firm could become the world’s top AI company in three to five years. But he says not having advanced chipmaking machines is the biggest technical problem. “Currently, we have a significant advantage in electricity and infrastructure. The main bottlenecks are production capacity, including lithography machines, and the software ecosystem,” Yao told an AI conference in Beijing. China finished building a prototype of an extreme-ultraviolet lithography machine last month, Reuters reported. It might eventually make semiconductor chips that rival what the West produces. But the machine hasn’t produced working chips yet. People familiar with the matter told Reuters it probably won’t until 2030. Yao and other Chinese industry leaders at Saturday’s Beijing conference admitted the US still has an edge in computing power. That’s because of heavy investments in infrastructure. Limited resources push firms to find creative solutions Lin Junyang is the technical lead for Alibaba’s flagship Qwen large language model. He explained the difference in scale. “The U.S. computer infrastructure is likely one to two orders of magnitude larger than ours. But I see that whether it’s OpenAI or other platforms, they’re investing heavily in next-generation research,” Lin said. He spoke at a panel discussion during the AGI-Next Frontier Summit. The Beijing Key Laboratory of Foundational Models at Tsinghua University held the event. “We, on the other hand, are relatively strapped for cash; delivery alone likely consumes the majority of our computer infrastructure,” Lin added. Lin says China’s tight budget has actually pushed researchers to get creative. They’ve focused on algorithm-hardware co-design, which lets AI firms run large models on smaller, cheaper hardware. Tang Jie founded Zhipu AI , which raised HK$4.35 billion in its IPO. He pointed to something new happening with younger Chinese AI entrepreneurs. They’re willing to take on high-risk projects now. That’s usually been a Silicon Valley thing, and Tang sees it as good news. “I think if we can improve this environment, allowing more time for these risk-taking, intelligent individuals to engage in innovative endeavors … this is something our government and the country can help improve,” Tang said.

Market momentum is returning, capital is rotating beyond Bitcoin, and altcoin season is back on the agenda. As the risk appetite grows, attention is shifting toward high-upside plays with the power to dominate this cycle. And right as the market turns bullish, XYZVerse, a multi-title esports platform, steps into the spotlight, preparing for its Token Generation Event (TGE) and $XYZ token listing at the end of January 2026, fully geared up to take advantage of open-market momentum. Over the past months, the project delivered a standout presale, raising over $15 million, rallying a fast-growing community across X, Telegram, and CoinMarketCap, and pushing far beyond theory into live product development. On top of all that, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. And now, as altcoins begin to run, XYZVerse is entering the arena fully prepared. XYZVerse: Built to Dominate the 2026 Altcoin Run With Bitcoin setting the pace and liquidity rotating aggressively, 2026 is shaping up as the year altcoins take over. What many expected to peak in 2025 has been delayed — stretching the cycle and creating the conditions for a longer, stronger, and more explosive altcoin expansion. As capital pours in, the market enters full acceleration mode: Capital rotation intensifies, moving from majors into high-beta altcoins Utility-driven projects outperform, as users and investors seek real engagement Narratives scale faster, fueled by social momentum and renewed market optimism Price discovery becomes aggressive, especially for tokens entering public markets XYZVerse is entering public markets as 2026 altcoin momentum ignites, not after the crowd has already piled in. With its TGE and listing scheduled for January 2026, the platform is perfectly positioned where attention, liquidity, and participation begin to explode. Unlike many projects scrambling to launch during altseason, XYZVerse enters 2026 with: Live esports infrastructure already in motion On-chain engagement mechanics fully active A battle-tested community built before the bull market returned Deflationary tokenomics and sustainability initiative This setup allows XYZVerse to convert raw altcoin momentum into immediate platform usage, reinforcing demand for the $XYZ token as the cycle accelerates. A Massive Exposure Play: Crypto Meets Counter-Strike 2 Adding fuel to the fire, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. By entering the CS2 ecosystem, XYZVerse instantly taps into one of the largest and most passionate gaming communities in the world, dramatically increasing product visibility and putting the XYZVerse brand in front of millions of players, fans, streamers, and esports viewers. Every match, vote, prediction, and reward is powered on-chain, turning pure esports hype into real engagement and measurable demand. This move connects the project to a global audience far beyond crypto, amplifying awareness, adoption, and momentum exactly as the market turns bullish. The league features are: a 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 $XYZ prize pool 10 teams competing in 5v5 MR12 matches teams made up of KOLs, project founders, and community players (selected via Access Pass lotteries) fan-driven mechanics like map voting, predictions, and digital collectibles full on-chain transparency across results and rewards Participation is enabled via 100 USDT Access Passes, giving fans voting rights, prediction access, exclusive content, and collectibles tied to match outcomes. Rather than a one-off event, the CS2 League is designed as a repeatable engagement engine, showing how XYZVerse turns esports into an interactive, on-chain experience. As altcoin season heats up and esports attention explodes, the CS2 league becomes a powerful catalyst, supercharging XYZVerse exposure right at the start of the 2026 altcoin run. Grab an Access Pass and join the league before $XYZ hits exchanges. From Meme Origins to a Utility-First Esports Platform XYZVerse did not start as a traditional esports company. It began its journey in the meme-coin space built around the idea of fusing all-sports fandom and crypto lovers. The project tapped into the same attention-driven dynamics that have powered some of crypto’s largest communities. Rather than remaining a purely speculative token, the project evolved into a utility-first esports platform, combining the virality and cultural reach of meme coins and the engagement mechanics of sports and fan tokens. The result is a platform where attention is converted into participation — and participation into measurable on-chain activity. XYZVerse eSports Platform: Where the Utility Lives At the core of XYZVerse is a simple principle: engagement should create real demand. XYZVerse connects a single on-chain system designed to reward participation and scale with usage. Utility That Drives Demand The $XYZ token is embedded directly into platform activity. It is used to join competitions, support teams and players, and unlock items, cosmetics, and fan perks. As users engage, their actions generate on-chain transactions routed through XYZVerse’s infrastructure, meaning demand for $XYZ is driven by gameplay and participation rather than speculative holding. Engagement That Shapes Esports XYZVerse turns fans into active participants. Users can vote on maps and formats, influence seasonal structures, and support teams with verifiable on-chain impact. This shifts esports from a passive viewing model to a transparent, community-influenced experience where engagement has measurable outcomes. Revenue Router and the Closed-Loop Model All product activity flows through XYZVerse’s Revenue Router, which automatically allocates a portion of platform revenue toward $XYZ buybacks, token burns, and prize pools. This creates a closed-loop system: increased usage drives token demand, buybacks and burns reduce circulating supply, and rewards reinforce engagement. Designed as a multi-title esports platform, XYZVerse enables players to compete, fans to participate and collect, and brands to measure performance — all within a scalable, on-chain economic loop. 7,000% Presale Growth Lights the Fuse for January Listing Momentum is already on the scoreboard, and the main event hasn’t even started yet. As the January TGE and exchange listing approach, $XYZ is entering public markets off the back of one of the most explosive presale performances in the space. The token price surged from $0.0001 to $0.00715 during the presale, locking in a gain of over 7,000% (71×) before open-market trading begins. This wasn’t a one-stage spike. Demand built consistently across multiple presale rounds, signaling sustained appetite and strong positioning ahead of listing. The expected starting price at listing is $0.10. Once $XYZ goes live on exchanges, presale caps disappear and valuation is driven by real-time market demand, the phase where volatility, visibility, and momentum tend to accelerate. For many projects, this is where the story begins. For XYZVerse, it’s simply the next gear. Unlike hype-only launches, XYZVerse enters its listing phase with multiple engines already running: Live esports utility, led by the CS2 League, converting gameplay into on-chain demand Continuous participation mechanics, including leagues, predictions, and digital collectibles Mass-market visibility from esports audiences far beyond crypto-native circles Transparent buyback and burn mechanisms, directly linking platform revenue to token supply Together, these drivers are designed to sustain momentum after listing, not just during the countdown. The presale growth is already on record. The listing is next – Grab $XYZ before it goes public Sustainability Initiative: Built-In Support After Listing Following the TGE and exchange listings, XYZVerse plans to activate its Sustainability Initiative, a post-listing mechanism designed to support the $XYZ token as it enters open-market trading. Through this model, 10% of net profits generated by partner projects are periodically allocated to buying back $XYZ directly from the market. All buybacks are executed via a public, on-chain wallet, allowing full transparency and independent verification. For $XYZ holders, this structure introduces several long-term benefits: Ongoing buy pressure, created by recurring market purchases rather than speculative demand Gradual supply reduction, as tokens acquired through buybacks may be removed from circulation Direct alignment with platform growth, where higher ecosystem revenue translates into stronger token support By embedding these mechanics into its revenue flow, XYZVerse ties token performance to real platform activity, positioning $XYZ as a value-driven asset rather than one dependent on short-term hype. Roadmap: What Comes Next XYZVerse’s roadmap is built around progressive infrastructure rollout and ecosystem expansion, with each phase designed to strengthen platform utility, deepen engagement, and reduce reliance on one-off events. Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 Revenue Router contracts & public dashboard Challenge Hub with dispute windows Prediction and fantasy side pools Marketplace v1 for Moments and cosmetics Q1 – Q2 2026 Forging and crafting mechanics Liquidity staking programs Mobile companion app Regional paid cups and cross-title ladders Q3 – Q4 2026 Advanced micro-markets Brand marketplace launch Creator Collectives Cross-chain expansion Seasonal Router governance Taken together, the roadmap outlines a measured, step-by-step expansion strategy, prioritizing infrastructure first, engagement second, and decentralization last — a structure that suggests long-term planning rather than short-term momentum chasing. Final Takeaway XYZVerse is approaching its TGE and token listing at the end of January 2026 as a full-fledged multi-title eSports platform with live mechanics, a clear economic model, and an expanding roadmap. By combining meme-driven visibility with sports-style engagement and on-chain transparency, XYZVerse is attempting to build what many meme projects lack: a reason to stay after listing. $XYZ is nearing its public market debut. Get involved while the presale is still open and stay alert for official announcements on the TGE and exchange listings. 🌐 Website: https://xyzverse.io 🎮 CS2 League: https://cs.xyzverse.io 🐦 X (Twitter): @xyz_verse💬 Telegram: https://t.me/xyzverse Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Beiko clarified that he would remain at the foundation but shift to an advisory role within the Protocol team while stepping back from his responsibilities coordinating the All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) calls, which serve as the primary forum for coordinating changes to Ethereum’s execution layer. He simply noted his transition to exploring “frontier use cases” for the blockchain platform. Beiko did not exit the Ethereum Foundation “The protocol is approaching its endgame, yet we’ve only just begun scratching the surface of what a permissionless, scalable, cryptoeconomically secure, and cheaply verifiable world computer can do,” Beiko wrote , outlining his interest in exploring applications that could only exist on Ethereum. His departure from day-to-day protocol coordination reflects confidence in Ethereum’s existing governance structures. Ansgar Dietrichs, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation who joined core research in 2019, has agreed to extend his interim stint as ACDE chair while Beiko supports what he described as establishing a “stable long-term configuration” for the developer calls. Dietrichs, who holds a background in mathematics, economics, and computer science, has contributed to research on account abstraction, state expiry, and EIP-4844, the proposal that introduced “blobs” to reduce transaction costs for layer-2 networks. According to call minutes from September, he assumed the interim role when Beiko took leave earlier in the year. Beiko’s transition is happening as Ethereum developers come up on the two major network updates they have lined up in 2026. The “ Glamsterdam ” upgrade, which is expected in the first half of the year, will focus on gas optimizations and enshrined proposer-builder separation, while “Hegota,” slated for late 2026, will address state bloat and storage inefficiencies. Ethereum is trying something new Beiko’s new focus on frontier use cases suggests a strategic recognition that while core protocol work continues, the network’s value proposition increasingly depends on applications that leverage its unique properties. Beiko said that the following questions have been on his mind for a while: “What are things that can *only* exist on Ethereum? That fully leverage its unique properties?” He framed the question as identifying what makes Ethereum “not only unreasonably sufficient, but reasonably necessary for the world.” Beiko stated that “it feels like the right time to thoroughly explore them!” Looking back on his tenure coordinating protocol development, Beiko expressed gratitude for what he called “such a transformative period” and confidence in the individuals stewarding Ethereum’s future. “A big part of why I feel comfortable stepping away now is my confidence in the individuals and processes involved in the protocol’s stewardship,” he wrote. Beiko concluded by stating, “a pivotal year for Ethereum, at all layers of the stack,” signaling his continued involvement in the network’s development despite the shift in focus.

This article spotlights key cryptocurrencies outside the top 10 that show promise. Discover which digital assets are on the rise and potentially ready to soar, capturing the attention of savvy investors. Find out which tokens are set to make waves. Injective (INJ) Poised for Potential Upsurge Amidst Volatile Trends Source: tradingview Injective (INJ) is currently priced between mid-four to mid-five dollars, marking a steady climb of over 8% in the past week. This upward trend comes after a decline of more than half over the past six months. Despite its recent volatility, the cryptocurrency shows potential for growth, particularly if it can break through the nearest resistance level of just under six dollars. If successful, it might aim for the next target above seven dollars, which would represent about a 27% increase from its highest recent price. With positive indicators like a high RSI and Stochastic values, INJ might be ready for an upward surge soon. Immutable (IMX) Bounces Back: Can It Surpass 40 Cents? Source: tradingview Immutable (IMX) is showing signs of life with its price moving between 23 and 30 cents recently. The coin is hovering around the 27-cent mark, close to its short-term moving average. With a rising RSI nearing 63, there's a chance for growth if momentum continues. If IMX breaks past the 33-cent resistance level, it could aim for the 40-cent mark, which would be a strong uptrend of around 33%. Still, it has fallen nearly half of its value over the past six months, making any upward movement feel significant. IMX's journey remains uncertain, but optimism is bubbling among its supporters. Sei (SEI) Experiences Volatility but Eyes Potential Gains Source: tradingview Sei is showing a bit of a roller coaster ride in the crypto world. It is trading between slightly above ten to thirteen cents. Despite recent dips, it has the potential to grow if it breaks past its main barrier at over thirteen cents. If Sei climbs, it might aim for around about fifteen cents, which is nearly a jump of fifteen percent from its current top. The coin's ups and downs are reflected by its one-week and one-month changes, displaying small and steep declines. Sei sits below the ten-day and one-hundred-day trend averages, hinting it could rise with the right momentum and a bit of market luck. Celestia Edges Up, Eyes on Breaking Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Celestia (TIA) is finding its footing between $0.48 and $0.63, experiencing a slight upward tick of just over six percent in the last week. Traders are keeping an eye on the $0.68 resistance level. If it breaks through, there’s potential for TIA to aim for the next level at $0.83. This would represent an impressive jump from its current range. Despite a downward trend over the past six months, the recent movement is garnering attention, especially with an RSI close to 60, suggesting momentum is building. As market sentiment improves, there’s room for optimism and possible growth if key levels are surpassed. Stacks (STX) on the Rise: Potential for Gains Source: tradingview Stacks (STX) is on a promising upward trend, with its price currently fluctuating between 27 and 40 cents. This shows a significant boost of around 40% in just a week. It's nearing its resistance level at 45 cents, suggesting there could be room for more growth. If it breaks this barrier, it might head toward the next level at 59 cents. There's an optimistic monthly growth of about 27%, yet it's still recovering from a dip over the last six months. Key indicators like RSI and Stochastic point toward further bullish movement, hinting at continued potential for short-term gains. Stacks seems to be in a strong position to continue its path upward. Conclusion INJ, IMX, SEI, TIA, and STX show promising potential for investors looking beyond the top 10. Each has unique features and solid use cases. These assets demonstrate resilience and growth opportunities in the current market. Keeping an eye on their development and performance may benefit those interested in diversification. These movers offer a mix of established projects and emerging contenders, adding dynamic options to any portfolio. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Only half of SpaceX’s proposed 30,000 satellites were approved for deployment by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). SpaceX must deploy half of the satellites authorized by the Federal Communications Commission by December 2028. Full deployment is expected by December 2031. Will Elon Musk keep growing his Starlink constellation? The FCC’s Chairman, Brendan Carr, said the approval is “a game-changer for enabling next-generation services.” SpaceX also received approval to upgrade its satellites and operate across five different frequencies. The newly authorized satellites will provide direct-to-cell connectivity outside the United States and supplemental coverage within American borders. Next-generation mobile services will be available to deliver internet speeds reaching up to 1 gigabit per second, similar to high-speed fiber-optic connections. The FCC stated that these upgrades will help ensure no community is left without connectivity options. However, SpaceX must launch 50% of the maximum authorized second-generation satellites, place them in their assigned orbits, and have them operational by December 1, 2028. The remaining satellites must be launched by December 2031. The company also faces a November 2027 deadline to complete deployment of its 7,500 first-generation satellites. Why did the FCC approve half of SpaceX’s request? SpaceX initially asked for approval to deploy nearly 30,000 satellites, but the FCC refused to approve the deployment of the remaining 14,988, including those planned for operations above 600 kilometers altitude. The FCC explained that its cautious approach is because “the Gen2 Starlink Upgrade satellites remain untested on orbit.” The commission believes that authorizing half of the proposed number of satellites serves the public interest while also allowing them time to evaluate the performance of the upgraded satellite design. Jessica Rosenworcel, the predecessor to current FCC chief Carr, wanted more companies to compete with SpaceX’s satellite constellation in 2024. Starlink already controlled nearly two-thirds of all active satellites at that time. Its overwhelming number of active satellites has raised concerns about space safety and market dominance in the satellite internet sector. Amazon is attempting to challenge that dominance with its rebranded Project Kuiper satellite internet service, now referred to as Amazon Leo, starting in November 2025. Amazon began a preview of its services that same month and allowed select business customers to test the network using production hardware and software. The company plans to roll out the service more widely in 2026. The FCC granted Amazon permission to deploy 3,236 satellites, with requirements to launch and operate half the constellation by July 30, 2026, and the remainder by July 30, 2029. Last week, Starlink announced plans to increase space safety by lowering all satellites currently orbiting at approximately 550 kilometers to 480 kilometers throughout 2026. Satellites operating at lower altitudes will naturally deorbit more quickly if they fail. The focus on safety is due to a December incident in which one Starlink satellite experienced an anomaly in space, creating a small amount of debris and losing communications at an altitude of 418 kilometers.

Speculation is thick in the air: is Shiba Inu positioned for a new price climb or is the timing premature? This article delves into the factors that might signal a bullish trend and the coins ripe for potential growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Eyes Recovery with Bullish Signs Source: tradingview Shiba Inu is trading between $0.0000074 and $0.0000100, showing signs of trying to bounce back. In the past week, SHIB's price saw a bit of a rise with a 7% increase. The next challenge is breaking past $0.000011, which is the nearest resistance. If it manages to overcome this, it could aim for around $0.0000136, potentially marking a growth of roughly a third. However, it recently faced a longer-term decline of nearly 35%. Yet, with its RSI near 53 and a high stochastic value, it might still have room to climb further. Keep an eye on market conditions as they shift. Conclusion SHIB has shown signs of renewed interest. Recent trends and market activities suggest growing momentum. However, patience may be required to see significant price movement. The market's response will determine if this anticipation translates to actual gains. For now, close observation is essential to gauge SHIB's next steps.

This decisive action by Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Informatics represents a critical turning point in how nations address the escalating crisis of non-consensual AI imagery, particularly content depicting women and minors in sexually explicit or abusive scenarios generated through simple user prompts on the X social platform. Indonesia’s Groundbreaking Grok Blockade Indonesian Communications and Digital Minister Meutya Hafid delivered a forceful statement to international media outlets including The Guardian, articulating the government’s position with unprecedented clarity. “The government views the practice of non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity, and the security of citizens in the digital space,” Hafid declared. This philosophical framing elevates the issue beyond mere content moderation into the realm of fundamental rights protection. The Indonesian ministry has simultaneously summoned X officials for urgent discussions about the platform’s content governance mechanisms. This dual approach—combining immediate technical restrictions with diplomatic pressure—demonstrates a sophisticated regulatory strategy. Indonesia’s move follows months of escalating complaints from digital rights organizations documenting Grok’s capacity to generate harmful content despite existing safeguards. The Technical and Ethical Breakdown Investigations reveal that Grok’s image generation capabilities, when prompted by users on X, have produced thousands of non-consensual sexualized depictions. These AI creations frequently feature recognizable public figures, private citizens, and alarmingly, minors. The technology’s accessibility—requiring only text prompts without technical expertise—has accelerated the proliferation of this harmful content. Digital forensics experts examining the phenomenon note several critical failures in xAI’s content moderation pipeline: Insufficient filtering algorithms for identifying requests targeting real individuals Inadequate age verification systems for generated content Delayed response mechanisms for removing violating material Weak user accountability measures for those requesting harmful content Global Regulatory Responses Intensify Indonesia’s action has catalyzed simultaneous regulatory movements across multiple jurisdictions, creating an unprecedented coordinated response to AI content governance. Within the same week, India’s IT Ministry issued a formal directive to xAI demanding “immediate and effective measures to prevent Grok from generating obscene content.” This represents India’s first major intervention in AI content moderation since implementing its Digital Personal Data Protection Act. Meanwhile, the European Commission has taken preliminary investigative steps by ordering xAI to preserve all documents related to Grok’s development, training data, and content moderation systems. Legal analysts interpret this preservation order as groundwork for potential formal proceedings under the Digital Services Act and AI Act frameworks. Global Regulatory Responses to Grok Content Issues Country/Region Action Taken Legal Basis Timeline Indonesia Temporary platform block Electronic Information and Transactions Law Immediate India Formal compliance directive IT Act 2000 7-day response window European Union Document preservation order Digital Services Act Preliminary investigation phase United Kingdom Regulatory assessment initiated Online Safety Act 2023 Assessment underway United Kingdom’s Measured Approach Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, has announced it will “undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation” under the recently implemented Online Safety Act. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly endorsed this approach, stating in a recent interview that Ofcom has his “full support to take action where necessary.” This regulatory posture reflects the UK’s emerging framework for platform accountability, which emphasizes evidence-based interventions rather than immediate punitive measures. Digital policy experts note that the UK’s approach balances consumer protection with innovation considerations, though critics argue it may allow harmful content to proliferate during assessment periods. United States Political Divisions Emerge The American response reveals significant political fractures regarding AI regulation. While the current administration has maintained official silence on the Grok controversy, Democratic senators have independently called upon Apple and Google to remove X from their respective app stores. This legislative pressure highlights growing concerns about platform accountability across party lines. The political dynamics are particularly complex given xAI CEO Elon Musk’s substantial financial support for political campaigns and his previous role in the administration. This entanglement between technology leadership and political influence has complicated straightforward regulatory responses, creating what policy analysts describe as “unprecedented governance challenges at the intersection of technology and politics.” xAI’s Evolving Response Strategy Following Indonesia’s blockade, xAI initially issued what appeared to be a first-person apology through the official Grok account, acknowledging that certain generated content “violated ethical standards and potentially US laws” concerning child sexual abuse material. The company subsequently restricted AI image generation features to paying X Premium subscribers, though technical analysis suggests this restriction applied primarily to web interfaces rather than the standalone Grok application. Musk’s personal commentary on the situation has added further complexity. Responding to questions about regulatory disparities between Grok and other AI image tools, Musk asserted that “they want any excuse for censorship.” This framing positions the controversy within broader debates about free expression versus content moderation, a tension that has characterized platform governance discussions for nearly a decade. The Technical Architecture of Harm Forensic examination of Grok’s capabilities reveals specific technical vulnerabilities that enable harmful content generation. Unlike traditional content moderation challenges involving user-uploaded material, Grok’s architecture creates entirely new imagery based on textual prompts. This generative approach bypasses many conventional detection systems designed for existing media. Security researchers have identified several critical failure points in Grok’s current implementation: Prompt interpretation systems that insufficiently flag requests for non-consensual content Training data contamination with problematic associations between names and sexual content Output filtering mechanisms that fail to recognize novel generated violations Cross-platform integration issues between X’s moderation and Grok’s generation systems Comparative Analysis with Other AI Platforms Industry observers note that Grok’s content moderation challenges differ significantly from those faced by other major AI platforms. While systems like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion have implemented increasingly sophisticated content filters over several years, Grok’s rapid deployment and integration with X’s social platform created unique vulnerabilities. The table below illustrates key differences in content moderation approaches: AI Platform Content Moderation Comparison Platform Primary Moderation Method Response Time to Violations Transparency Reporting Grok/xAI Post-generation filtering Hours to days Limited public disclosure DALL-E 3 Pre-generation prompt screening Minutes to hours Regular transparency reports Midjourney Hybrid human-AI review Real-time to hours Community guidelines published Stable Diffusion Open-source community moderation Variable by implementation Varies by deployment Legal Precedents and Future Implications Indonesia’s action establishes significant legal precedents for international technology regulation. By framing non-consensual AI-generated sexual content as a human rights violation rather than merely a terms-of-service breach, the Indonesian government has elevated the legal stakes for platform operators. This approach aligns with emerging international norms articulated in United Nations discussions about digital rights. Legal experts anticipate several potential developments following this regulatory escalation: Cross-border enforcement mechanisms for AI content violations Standardized reporting requirements for generative AI systems International cooperation frameworks for AI content moderation Enhanced liability structures for platform operators The Path to Resolution Industry analysts suggest that resolving the current crisis will require multi-stakeholder engagement beyond simple technical fixes. Effective solutions must address: First, technical improvements to Grok’s content generation and filtering systems, potentially including real-time human review for sensitive queries. Second, policy enhancements to X’s community standards specifically addressing AI-generated content. Third, transparency mechanisms that allow external verification of moderation effectiveness. Fourth, user education initiatives about appropriate AI use and reporting procedures. Conclusion Indonesia’s decisive move to block Grok over non-consensual sexualized deepfakes represents a watershed moment in AI governance, demonstrating how national regulators can respond rapidly to emerging technological threats. This action has triggered a cascade of international regulatory responses that collectively signal growing impatience with self-regulatory approaches to AI content moderation. The Grok controversy ultimately highlights fundamental tensions between innovation velocity and responsible deployment, between free expression and harm prevention, and between national sovereignty and global platform operations. As governments worldwide develop more sophisticated regulatory frameworks for generative AI, the Indonesian model of immediate protective action combined with diplomatic engagement may establish new norms for international technology governance in an increasingly AI-integrated world. FAQs Q1: What specific content triggered Indonesia’s block of Grok? Indonesian authorities identified thousands of AI-generated sexualized images depicting real individuals without consent, including public figures, private citizens, and minors. The content frequently showed explicit sexual scenarios and sometimes depicted assault or abuse, all generated through simple text prompts on the X platform. Q2: How does Indonesia’s approach differ from other countries’ responses? Indonesia implemented immediate technical blocking combined with human rights framing, while other nations have pursued investigative, directive, or assessment-based approaches. The Indonesian method prioritizes immediate citizen protection, whereas other responses emphasize procedural compliance and evidence gathering. Q3: What technical measures has xAI implemented since the controversy began? xAI initially restricted image generation to paying X Premium subscribers and enhanced content filtering systems. However, technical analysis suggests these measures primarily affected web interfaces rather than the standalone Grok application, and experts question their effectiveness against sophisticated prompt engineering. Q4: How might this situation affect other AI image generation platforms? The regulatory scrutiny on Grok has increased pressure on all AI platforms to demonstrate robust content moderation systems. Industry observers anticipate more stringent compliance requirements, enhanced transparency expectations, and potentially standardized reporting frameworks across the generative AI sector. Q5: What are the long-term implications for AI development and regulation? This situation accelerates the development of international AI governance frameworks, increases emphasis on ethical AI design principles, and may lead to more proactive regulatory interventions. The controversy also highlights the need for technical solutions that balance innovation with fundamental rights protection across different cultural and legal contexts.

The police are working to trace the ownership of the machines confiscated in Teluk Intan and identify the people running the operations. Authorities warn the public that illegal crypto mining is a criminal offense that poses safety risks and can cause property damage. Is cryptocurrency mining legal in Malaysia? Police in Hilir Perak confiscated 41 machines suspected of being used for illegal cryptocurrency mining after a series of coordinated raids in Teluk Intan. Hilir Perak police chief Bakri Zainal Abidin confirmed that the first raid conducted on the night of January 9 resulted in the seizure of 24 machines. Two additional raids carried out earl y Ja nuary 10 led to the seizure of the remaining 17 machines. Despite this, no arrests have been made. The operations targeted three separate locations within the Teluk Intan area. All the suspects in the operations are being investigated for property damage and misuse of electricity supply, both of which are criminal offenses under Malaysian law. Cryptocurrency mining itself is not illegal in Malaysia, but it is illegal to steal electricity or damage property to run cryptocurrency mining operations. The machines seized in Teluk Intan are suspected of being connected to illegal electricity supplies and stealing from the national power grid. Unauthorized crypto mining operations often bypass electricity meters or tap directly into power lines to avoid paying for the massive amounts of electricity required to run mining rigs. Over the years, Malaysian authorities have conducted raids across various states. Some of those operations led to the destruction of thousands of mining machines. The police previously publicly destroyed confiscated equipment using steamrollers as a deterrent to would-be illegal miners. Malaysia advises against illegal crypto mining There have been instances in Malaysia and other countries where illegal mining operations have caused electrical fires and building damage. Illegal mining can cause safety risks and property damage because the equipment used for it generates substantial heat and requires proper cooling systems and electrical infrastructure to operate safely. Illegal setups usually lack these safety measures. Overloaded electrical systems can lead to fires, putting both the operators and surrounding properties at risk. Buildings where the illegal mining operations are carried out may suffer structural damage from the weight of equipment and the constant heat generation. Power theft also contributes to higher electricity costs for legal users and can cause voltage fluctuations or power disruptions in certain areas. The extra load on the electrical infrastructure can lead to transformer failures and other equipment damage that requires costly repairs. As reported by Cryptopolitan, Russian and Kazakh authorities have rolled out periodic restrictions on mining activities, especially during high-demand periods such as winter and holiday seasons. Hilir Perak police have urged the public not to engage in illegal cryptocurrency mining activities. Citizens with information on suspected illegal mining operations are urged to contact the authorities and help identify and shut down these operations before they cause harm.

Amongst the old popular cryptocurrencies which have still not managed to live up to their grand promises is Ripple (XRP). On the flip side, amongst new popular cryptos is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This new crypto has managed to achieve immense popularity by collecting over $19.7 million in its presale. XRP Price Analysis XRP is within the re-accumulation stage, thanks to the market rally created by whales and the consistent accumulation within the ETF. It is quite positive that the current price is holding above the essential support levels, which is a strong indicator of a strong market structure. The essential level at $2.20 has been created as a new anchor level. The resistance level at $2.20 presents numerous opportunities for a move to $3.20. XRP is a major market participant. But the growth rate is lower compared to those within the development stage, such as MUTM. MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance has already seen the participation of over 18,770 investors and has generated $19.7 million. After considering the diverse costs in phases 7 and 8 of $0.04 and $0.045, it is clear that coupled with public listing at $0.06, it would be very profitable to join in early. According to projections, it is expected that within a couple of months’ time, the price per token of the crypto could be as much as $0.40, thereby rendering a gain of up to 10x for those who join now. Phase 8 would give a marginal gain of 8x, while for those who wait until it is listed in the market for $0.06, a gain of merely 6x is to be achieved. DeFi Functionality Triggers Demand Mutuum Finance features a DeFi platform that combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. P2C lenders deposit assets in lending pools that generate up to 10% APY. A 7000 USDT for example would yield $700 in interest at the end of the year. Peer-to-Peer lending provides higher yields, wherein interest rates can be established by transacting parties on a volatile asset such as Dogecoin. P2P lending may outdo the interest rates for P2C lending to go as high as 20%, thus underpinning its usefulness and intention in the creation of income with volatile cryptocurrencies. The system developed by MUTM has a reward system for fees generated based on activities performed on the platform, which are used to buy MUTM tokens in the market and share them amongst the stakers of mtTokens. mtTokens are the yield-generating assets which are earned for a deposit made in the MUTM lending system on a 1:1 ratio. For example, for a deposit of 10,000 USDT in the lending market, a user gets 10,000 mtUSDT. Apart from earning from the lending, the user gets staking dividends. Security and Testnet Achievements Security is another one of the key considerations for MUTM. It has been able to pass the Halborn Security test, where all feedback has been incorporated for securing the protocol. Functionality wise, the launch of the V1 protocol will be carried out on Sepolia Testnet, where it plans to enable engagement with the liquidity pool, mtTokens, debt tokens for loans, as well as the automatic liquidator for under-collateralized accounts. Why MUTM Must Be in Your Smart Portfolio Where XRP provides stability, Mutuum Finance provides initial project exposure, presale development, DeFi integration, and several ways to reward token investors. Additionally, its target ROI of 10x for Phase 7 investors makes MUTM one of the best low-cost cryptos available for a well-diversified portfolio.

While BTC’s most recent retracement raises suspicions of resistance lying at the $94,000 price, the latest on-chain evaluation hypothesizes the presence of a more relevant resistance just beneath $100,000. New Whales’ Cost Basis Sits Around $99k On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr recently took to the social media platform X to share an interesting hypothesis on the Bitcoin price trajectory. His on-chain observation was based on the Realized Price New Whale STH Vs Old Whale LTH indicator. For context, this metric compares the acquisition cost, on average, of recently accumulated whale holdings (short-term holders) with that of Bitcoin’s long-term whale holdings. Related Reading: Why Morgan Stanley’s Bitcoin ETF Is The ‘Most Bullish Thing Ever’: Jeff Park Axel Adler Jr shared in his post that new whales have an average entry price near the $99,000 level. Currently, Bitcoin holds a valuation near $90,000, meaning its new whales are holding through unrealized losses. Hence, if the premier cryptocurrency ascends towards these whales’ average acquisition price of $99,000, the crypto pundit explained that these investors might become incentivized to sell their holdings. This means that these large BTC holders exit the market at break-even prices, or while incurring minimal losses. When the largest Bitcoin investors sell their holdings, the effect often translates to price through reduced buying momentum and a simultaneous increase in downside pressure. As a result, the entry price of these investors — in this case, $99,000 — becomes major resistance, both psychologically and technically. Long-Term Whales’ Average Cost At $39K In a separate post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Arab Chain revealed the average cost basis across varying cohorts of Bitcoin’s investors. As the new whales hold through their unrealized losses, the Binance user deposit addresses metric tells a fascinating story. According to the analyst, the average holding cost on Binance is approximately $52,691, indicating that a good portion of Bitcoin’s traders are doing so while enjoying their profit. Interestingly, the Miner Whales are not left out of this comfort zone. This group of holders, who have more than 1,000 BTC stowed away, has an average holding cost of $58,681. Considering that price is well above their cost basis, it suggests that Bitcoin miners are also in deep profit. As a result, there will be expectedly minimal selling pressure from this faction of the market. For Bitcoin’s Long-term Holder whales, the story is more rosy. These investors are holding their coins with an average acquisition cost of $39,681. As is intuitively obvious, this group of BTC holders is also operating within clear bounds of profit. Ultimately, it is clear that Bitcoin has a structurally bullish outlook, with unshaking investor support. If downside momentum were to enter the market, it would likely be short-term, as its oldest traders appear to be under no pressure to shave off their holdings. If retracements sponsored by these investors occur, it would likely be as a result of light profit-taking, rather than capitulation events. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands at around $90,624, with no significant movement since the past day.

While the market leader has made a solid start to 2026 , concerns are still swirling around about BTC’s prospects over the coming months, especially in relation to the four-year cycle theory. Why $65,000 Could Be Crucial In This Cycle In a recent post on the X platform, Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, weighed in on the current structure of the Bitcoin price. The market expert said that the premier cryptocurrency has taken a breather in the past few months and lagged compared to other assets, like gold, in 2025. Timmer revealed that Bitcoin is drifting away from the historically steep power law trajectory and instead following the internet S-curve. This structure shift also opened the door to the ongoing conversation about Bitcoin’s typical cyclical behavior. According to several pundits, the traditional Bitcoin four-year halving-driven cycle is now dead, and a new structural upward wave seems to be taking root in the market. Proponents of “ Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead ” often state institutional adoption and spot exchange-traded funds as evidence of the new bullish market structure. While Timmer agrees that the relevance of the BTC halving event is decreasing, the Fidelity Director of Global Macro rejected the idea that the premier cryptocurrency would no longer see bear markets. “I’m skeptical, not about the waning power of the halving cycle (with which I agree), but the idea that bear markets are no longer going to happen,” Timmer said. Speaking from a technical point of view, Timmer identified $65,000 — around the previous cycle high — as a crucial level for the price of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the next most important level lies around $45,000, the power law trendline. For context, the power law is a mathematical model that suggests that Bitcoin’s growth follows a predictable and consistent trajectory. This metric, often used to identify key levels in price analysis, shows the correlation between the value of BTC and time. Timmer noted that while the power law trendline is far from the current price of BTC, it could move to $65,000 if the flagship cryptocurrency enters a prolonged consolidation phase for the next year. This could make the $65,000 level an even more important zone for the Bitcoin price.

Top Analyst Says Epic Rally Starts Now,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-ready-to-explode-top-analyst-says-epic-rally-starts-now/,"The crypto market has entered a defining phase where volatility no longer signals weakness but opportunity. Rapid price swings, shifting macroeconomic data, and accelerating regulatory developments continue to reshape investor expectations. As capital rotates across the market, a small group of assets has begun to stand out, drawing attention from traders and institutions searching for the next sustained breakout. Insights shared by Bullrunners place XRP firmly within this emerging narrative. Their recent in-depth market analysis frames XRP’s latest move as part of a broader structural shift rather than a short-lived rally, suggesting that conditions now favor a more aggressive upside phase. Broader Market Conditions Set the Stage Overall crypto market health remains constructive despite short-term pullbacks. Total market capitalization recently stood near $3.11 trillion, reflecting mild cooling after recent gains, while daily trading volume remained robust. #XRP Ready to Explode? Top Analyst Says Epic Rally Starts Now? pic.twitter.com/FcTRiLVyHg — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) January 9, 2026 Market sentiment stayed neutral, indicating restrained optimism rather than speculative excess. Bitcoin dominance hovered around 58.5%, showing that capital still favors large-cap assets even as select altcoins begin to outperform. Macroeconomic data reinforced this cautious balance. Softer manufacturing inflation, weaker job openings, and improved unemployment claims reduced pressure on risk assets. At the same time, rising services inflation and anticipation around non-farm payroll data kept markets alert to sudden shifts. Traditional equities reflected similar dynamics, with the Nasdaq 100 maintaining a bullish long-term structure but lacking short-term momentum. XRP’s Price Action Signals Strength Against this backdrop, XRP delivered one of the strongest performances among major digital assets. The token surged roughly 25% in early January 2026, briefly reaching the $2.40 region. A wave of liquidations later pushed the price back toward $2.12 on January 9, yet the broader structure remained intact. XRP continued to outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum on a relative basis, reinforcing the view that the move carried deeper significance. Bullrunners highlights that technical charts show XRP holding key support levels despite volatility. This resilience suggests that buyers remain active and that recent selling reflected market mechanics rather than a shift in sentiment. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Changes the Narrative One of the most important drivers behind XRP’s renewed momentum lies in regulatory resolution. XRP now trades without the legal uncertainty that constrained institutional participation for years. This clarity has reshaped investor perception and reopened channels previously closed to regulated capital. Analysts cited by Bullrunners point to growing institutional exposure through XRP-related exchange-traded products. Cumulative inflows into these vehicles have reportedly exceeded $1 billion, signaling rising confidence from professional investors who typically avoid unresolved regulatory risk. Infrastructure, Adoption, and Institutional Interest Beyond price and regulation, ecosystem development continues to strengthen XRP’s outlook. Activity on the XRP Ledger remains stable, while speculation around enterprise integrations has intensified. Recent report have highlighted potential collaboration between Ripple and Amazon Web Services, particularly involving Amazon Bedrock AI for XRPL analytics. While no official confirmation exists, the narrative reflects growing interest in enterprise-grade use cases. At the policy level, momentum around the US market structure bill adds another supportive layer. The legislation now advances toward committee markups, with a possible path to presidential approval by the end of Q1 2026. This progress signals accelerating regulatory clarity across the digital asset sector. Outlook: Momentum With Measured Expectations Bullrunners concludes that XRP now sits at the intersection of technical strength, regulatory clarity, and institutional access. Some analysts project long-term targets above $30, framing XRP as a potential leader in the next expansion phase. While such forecasts remain speculative, current conditions give the bullish case more credibility than at any point in recent years. As markets await the next macro catalyst, XRP’s positioning suggests it will remain one of the most closely watched assets in the months ahead.

Market momentum is returning, capital is rotating beyond Bitcoin, and altcoin season is back on the agenda. As the risk appetite grows, attention is shifting toward high-upside plays with the power to dominate this cycle. And right as the market turns bullish, XYZVerse, a multi-title esports platform, steps into the spotlight, preparing for its Token Generation Event (TGE) and $XYZ token listing at the end of January 2026, fully geared up to take advantage of open-market momentum. Over the past months, the project delivered a standout presale, raising over $15 million, rallying a fast-growing community across X, Telegram, and CoinMarketCap, and pushing far beyond theory into live product development. On top of all that, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. And now, as altcoins begin to run, XYZVerse is entering the arena fully prepared. XYZVerse: Built to Dominate the 2026 Altcoin Run With Bitcoin setting the pace and liquidity rotating aggressively, 2026 is shaping up as the year altcoins take over. What many expected to peak in 2025 has been delayed — stretching the cycle and creating the conditions for a longer, stronger, and more explosive altcoin expansion. As capital pours in, the market enters full acceleration mode: Capital rotation intensifies, moving from majors into high-beta altcoins Utility-driven projects outperform, as users and investors seek real engagement Narratives scale faster, fueled by social momentum and renewed market optimism Price discovery becomes aggressive, especially for tokens entering public markets XYZVerse is entering public markets as 2026 altcoin momentum ignites, not after the crowd has already piled in. With its TGE and listing scheduled for January 2026, the platform is perfectly positioned where attention, liquidity, and participation begin to explode. Unlike many projects scrambling to launch during altseason, XYZVerse enters 2026 with: Live esports infrastructure already in motion On-chain engagement mechanics fully active A battle-tested community built before the bull market returned Deflationary tokenomics and sustainability initiative This setup allows XYZVerse to convert raw altcoin momentum into immediate platform usage, reinforcing demand for the $XYZ token as the cycle accelerates. A Massive Exposure Play: Crypto Meets Counter-Strike 2 Adding fuel to the fire, XYZVerse is gearing up to launch the world’s first crypto-powered Counter-Strike 2 league, with full on-chain mechanics baked directly into competitive gameplay. By entering the CS2 ecosystem, XYZVerse instantly taps into one of the largest and most passionate gaming communities in the world, dramatically increasing product visibility and putting the XYZVerse brand in front of millions of players, fans, streamers, and esports viewers. Every match, vote, prediction, and reward is powered on-chain, turning pure esports hype into real engagement and measurable demand. This move connects the project to a global audience far beyond crypto, amplifying awareness, adoption, and momentum exactly as the market turns bullish. The league features are: a 500,000 USDT + 5,000,000 $XYZ prize pool 10 teams competing in 5v5 MR12 matches teams made up of KOLs, project founders, and community players (selected via Access Pass lotteries) fan-driven mechanics like map voting, predictions, and digital collectibles full on-chain transparency across results and rewards Participation is enabled via 100 USDT Access Passes, giving fans voting rights, prediction access, exclusive content, and collectibles tied to match outcomes. Rather than a one-off event, the CS2 League is designed as a repeatable engagement engine, showing how XYZVerse turns esports into an interactive, on-chain experience. As altcoin season heats up and esports attention explodes, the CS2 league becomes a powerful catalyst, supercharging XYZVerse exposure right at the start of the 2026 altcoin run. Grab an Access Pass and join the league before $XYZ hits exchanges. From Meme Origins to a Utility-First Esports Platform XYZVerse did not start as a traditional esports company. It began its journey in the meme-coin space built around the idea of fusing all-sports fandom and crypto lovers. The project tapped into the same attention-driven dynamics that have powered some of crypto’s largest communities. Rather than remaining a purely speculative token, the project evolved into a utility-first esports platform, combining the virality and cultural reach of meme coins and the engagement mechanics of sports and fan tokens. The result is a platform where attention is converted into participation — and participation into measurable on-chain activity. XYZVerse eSports Platform: Where the Utility Lives At the core of XYZVerse is a simple principle: engagement should create real demand. XYZVerse connects a single on-chain system designed to reward participation and scale with usage. Utility That Drives Demand The $XYZ token is embedded directly into platform activity. It is used to join competitions, support teams and players, and unlock items, cosmetics, and fan perks. As users engage, their actions generate on-chain transactions routed through XYZVerse’s infrastructure, meaning demand for $XYZ is driven by gameplay and participation rather than speculative holding. Engagement That Shapes Esports XYZVerse turns fans into active participants. Users can vote on maps and formats, influence seasonal structures, and support teams with verifiable on-chain impact. This shifts esports from a passive viewing model to a transparent, community-influenced experience where engagement has measurable outcomes. Revenue Router and the Closed-Loop Model All product activity flows through XYZVerse’s Revenue Router, which automatically allocates a portion of platform revenue toward $XYZ buybacks, token burns, and prize pools. This creates a closed-loop system: increased usage drives token demand, buybacks and burns reduce circulating supply, and rewards reinforce engagement. Designed as a multi-title esports platform, XYZVerse enables players to compete, fans to participate and collect, and brands to measure performance — all within a scalable, on-chain economic loop. 7,000% Presale Growth Lights the Fuse for January Listing Momentum is already on the scoreboard, and the main event hasn’t even started yet. As the January TGE and exchange listing approach, $XYZ is entering public markets off the back of one of the most explosive presale performances in the space. The token price surged from $0.0001 to $0.00715 during the presale, locking in a gain of over 7,000% (71×) before open-market trading begins. This wasn’t a one-stage spike. Demand built consistently across multiple presale rounds, signaling sustained appetite and strong positioning ahead of listing. The expected starting price at listing is $0.10. Once $XYZ goes live on exchanges, presale caps disappear and valuation is driven by real-time market demand, the phase where volatility, visibility, and momentum tend to accelerate. For many projects, this is where the story begins. For XYZVerse, it’s simply the next gear. Unlike hype-only launches, XYZVerse enters its listing phase with multiple engines already running: Live esports utility, led by the CS2 League, converting gameplay into on-chain demand Continuous participation mechanics, including leagues, predictions, and digital collectibles Mass-market visibility from esports audiences far beyond crypto-native circles Transparent buyback and burn mechanisms, directly linking platform revenue to token supply Together, these drivers are designed to sustain momentum after listing, not just during the countdown. The presale growth is already on record. The listing is next – Grab $XYZ before it goes public Sustainability Initiative: Built-In Support After Listing Following the TGE and exchange listings, XYZVerse plans to activate its Sustainability Initiative, a post-listing mechanism designed to support the $XYZ token as it enters open-market trading. Through this model, 10% of net profits generated by partner projects are periodically allocated to buying back $XYZ directly from the market. All buybacks are executed via a public, on-chain wallet, allowing full transparency and independent verification. For $XYZ holders, this structure introduces several long-term benefits: Ongoing buy pressure, created by recurring market purchases rather than speculative demand Gradual supply reduction, as tokens acquired through buybacks may be removed from circulation Direct alignment with platform growth, where higher ecosystem revenue translates into stronger token support By embedding these mechanics into its revenue flow, XYZVerse ties token performance to real platform activity, positioning $XYZ as a value-driven asset rather than one dependent on short-term hype. Roadmap: What Comes Next XYZVerse’s roadmap is built around progressive infrastructure rollout and ecosystem expansion, with each phase designed to strengthen platform utility, deepen engagement, and reduce reliance on one-off events. Q4 2025 – Q1 2026 Revenue Router contracts & public dashboard Challenge Hub with dispute windows Prediction and fantasy side pools Marketplace v1 for Moments and cosmetics Q1 – Q2 2026 Forging and crafting mechanics Liquidity staking programs Mobile companion app Regional paid cups and cross-title ladders Q3 – Q4 2026 Advanced micro-markets Brand marketplace launch Creator Collectives Cross-chain expansion Seasonal Router governance Taken together, the roadmap outlines a measured, step-by-step expansion strategy, prioritizing infrastructure first, engagement second, and decentralization last — a structure that suggests long-term planning rather than short-term momentum chasing. Final Takeaway XYZVerse is approaching its TGE and token listing at the end of January 2026 as a full-fledged multi-title eSports platform with live mechanics, a clear economic model, and an expanding roadmap. By combining meme-driven visibility with sports-style engagement and on-chain transparency, XYZVerse is attempting to build what many meme projects lack: a reason to stay after listing. $XYZ is nearing its public market debut. Get involved while the presale is still open and stay alert for official announcements on the TGE and exchange listings. 🌐 Website: https://xyzverse.io 🎮 CS2 League: https://cs.xyzverse.io 🐦 X (Twitter): @xyz_verse💬 Telegram: https://t.me/xyzverse Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

57049009,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892696,1768075830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57049009.jpeg,Vitalik Buterin claims corposlop is a growing pandemic that needs to end,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/buterin-warns-crypto-against-corposlop/,"Vitalik Buterin recently called out the dangers of what he has tagged “corposlop” in the crypto and digital space. He described it as a toxic mix that leads to the creation of products that at first glance seem user-oriented, but in truth are created to disempower people. Buterin’s post was a direct response to a tweet from a pseudonymous X user who made several predictions about what would happen to human society between 2026 and the year 2030. There were quite a number of predictions, including about how “the internet officially splinters” and how “after a year of AI-slop, the low-fi aesthetic wins.” Buterin claimed to agree with 60% of the predictions, but one bit he felt he needed to highlight is the “explicit separation between what the poster called ‘the open web’ (really, the corposlop web), and ‘the sovereign web.’” He called it a distinction he had not realized until recently, acknowledging that BTC maxis were far ahead because it turns out that their resistance to ICOs, disinterest in tokens besides Bitcoin, and arbitrary apps has actually been about keeping Bitcoin “sovereign” and not “corposlop.” “The big error that many of them made was trying to achieve this goal with either government crackdowns or user disempowerment (keeping bitcoin script limited, and rejecting many categories of applications entirely),” Buterin wrote. “But their fear was real.” What is corposlop according to Buterin? As far as the Ethereum co-founder is concerned, corposlop is made up of three components, including “corporate optimisation power, an aura of respectableness of being a company with sleek polished branding, and behavior that is the exact opposite of respectable, because that’s what’s needed to maximize profit.” He gave examples that he believes confirm how soulless corposlop, tagging them both lame and evil as they disempower the average user while making it seem like they’re serving them. Apple came up in the discussion, with Buterin acknowledging he has qualms with the company but admitting that the firm has many “non-corposlop traits.” “They serve users not by constantly asking ‘what do users want this quarter’, but by having an opinionated long-term vision,” he wrote. “They have a strong emphasis on privacy. They resist and create trends rather than following them. I just wish they could take the brave step of ending their monopolistic practices and switching to an open-source-first strategy. It may damage their market cap, but man must live for something higher than market caps.” How do you resist corposlop? According to Vitalik Buterin, in the year 2000, sovereignty was largely focused on avoiding the “iron fist of government.” However, today, that has expanded also to cover securing your digital privacy through cryptography, as well as protecting your mind from corporate mind warfare focused on extracting attention and dollars. “It also means doing things because you believe in them, and declaring independence from the homogenizing and soul-sucking concept of ‘the meta,’” Buterin wrote, claiming builders needed to focus more on creating tools that helped achieve or encourage that. As reported by Cryptopolitan yesterday, a16z crypto executives advised crypto projects to resist falling victim to the mind virus that has gripped the meta, where everyone is building trading apps. They warned against the upcoming “homogeneous competition” that the proliferation of trading platforms will inevitably lead to. Buterin mentioned some tools he believes will help and become highly sought after in the future, including: privacy-preserving local-first applications that minimize dependence on and data leaks to third parties social media platforms, and tools that let the user control what content they see and appeal to people’s long-term goals financial tools that help users grow their wealth, without encouraging 50x leverage, sports betting or taking out a loan AI tools that are maximally open, private and that maximize productivity from merging the power of human and bot applications, companies and physical environments with opinionated views on the kind of world they want to see DAOs that can support organizations and communities that steadfastly pursue a unique objective, as long as they are not all captured by the same groups “Be sovereign,” he concluded . “Reject corposlop.

The growing adoption rate of the XRP Ledger Protocol could push XRP to an average price of $6.55, with a possible maximum trading value of $7.11 in 2028. In 2032, the target price for XRP is between $13.47 and $14.59, with an average price of $14.03. XRP has a strong community of supporters and developers and continues to see tremendous potential in Ripple’s technology and products. Despite short-term price fluctuations and a bear market, many analysts believe XRP has a bright future. Whether it will reach new highs or continue to grow steadily remains to be seen, and despite its history of legal battles with the Securities and Exchange Commission, this digital asset will undoubtedly play an important role in global financial institutions. So, how high can XRP realistically go? Will XRP reach 5 dollars? Let’s answer these questions in our XRP price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Ripple Token XRP Price $2.09 (-1.57%) Market cap $127.03B Trading volume (24-hour) $1.68B Circulating supply 60.69B XRP All-time high $3.65 on July 18, 2025 All-time low $0.002686 on May 22, 2014 24-hour high $2.13 24-hour low $2.08 XRP price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility 6.35% 50-day SMA $2.03 200-day SMA $2.57 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green days 12/30 (40%) XRP price analysis: XRP holds above $2 TL;DR Breakdown XRP price analysis confirms a downward trend at $2.09. The token lost 1.57% in value. XRP has support at $2.02. On January 10, 2026, XRP is showing a mild correction as the trend remains bearish for the day. The coin is trading near $2.09 following a 1.57% decrease over the past 24 hours. While XRP experienced a series of strong corrections over the past four trading sessions, selling pressure still persists, causing the coin to continue its correction. Sellers are striving to gain momentum, and conditions now warrant caution for bullish traders, as the price could plunge below the psychological mark of $2. XRP price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of XRP confirmed a downward market trend. XRP/USD value decreased to a $2.09 low in the past 24 hours. Red candlesticks on the price chart signify rising selling momentum. XRP/USD 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening as volatility is increasing. Moreover, the upper band of the Bollinger Bands indicator, indicating the broken resistance, is at $2.29. The lower Bollinger band, indicating support, is at $1.67. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral area. The indicator is currently at 54 and moving downwards. The selling activities have led to a decrease. This descent is reflected by a downward curve on the RSI graph. If the bearish momentum continues to rise, the market can enter a period of instability. XRP price analysis on the 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of XRP confirmed a bullish market trend for the cryptocurrency. Its value increased to $2.09 in the past four hours. The decreased volatility signals less signs of reversal in the coming hours. The Bollinger bands are moving closer as volatility levels are decreasing. This decrease in volatility signals a higher market predictability. Moreover, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $2.18, indicating the resistance threshold. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band is at a low of $2.05, securing the support. XRP/USD 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is in the neutral zone as it moves slightly upwards. Its value has increased to index 43 in the past few hours. The curve on the RSI graph confirms a positive trend as the indicator’s score increases. The recent upturn refers to a relatively balanced trading environment for investors.

The daily price analysis for the XRP/USD pair presents a bearish trend for the cryptocurrency, as the selling pressure continues. In the past 24 hours, the bears continued their lead, thereby creating unfavorable circumstances for the investors. As a result, the coin value has corrected to $2.09 because of the decreasing momentum today. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically designed for quick and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The easing of regulatory hurdles for Ripple, along with the rising adoption, might boost the XRP price. Additionally, several recent acquisitions and CBDC developments make XRP a good long-term investment option. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. It is advised to proceed with caution. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as selling momentum picked up over the past week, driving the coin’s price to $2.13. However, the coin has corrected to $2.09 today. How much will XRP cost in 2026? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $2.81 by the end of 2026. Will XRP reach $5? If demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent, the coin could approach $5 by 2027. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.65, achieved on July 18, 2025. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a chance of reaching near $20 but not before 2032. However, it is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, making it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Still, the token provides a good buying opportunity to investors looking for long-term goals. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is expected to reach a maximum price of $14.59 by 2032, making it a valuable asset, particularly with the continued efforts of Ripple Labs. However, some regulatory uncertainties still exist for XRP. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network Cryptopolitan reported that XRP trading was twice as volatile as BTC trading in 2025. On-chain data revealed that XRP recorded 80% realized volatility during the past year, highlighting a need for deeper liquidity to achieve stability. To maintain liquidity flow, Ripple released 1 billion XRP tokens in three tranches on January 1, 2026. 🚨 XRP ESCROW MOVE 🚨 1 BILLION $XRP unlocked from escrow in minutes, catching the market’s attention fast.

XRP historic price sentiment XRP price history: Coinmarketcap Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022, it plummeted to as low as $0.31, significantly decreasing XRP market cap. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP reached a peak price of $3.19 and traded near the $2.90 level in February. It stepped down to $2.1 in March and to $1.79 in April. By the middle of May, XRP touched $2.57, and in July, it marked a new all-time high of $3.65. Near the start of August 2025, XRP was trending above $3, showing significant growth as the market sentiment was tilting toward the positive side; however, it lost $3 by the end of the month. In October through November, XRP traded around $1.83 to $3.10. At the start of December, XRP is trading around $1.99 to $2.18.

Still, he noted that the refunds wouldn’t be returned all at once, but instead would be rolled out over time, possibly over weeks or even a year. Currently, the U.S. Treasury has nearly $774 billion in cash on hand. Bessent, however, does not expect the court to overturn the tariffs. He argued that if the court reverses the tariffs, businesses that transferred the costs to customers would only benefit immensely. He commented, “It won’t be a problem if we have to do it, but ‍I can tell you that if it happens, which I don’t think it’s going to – it’s just a corporate boondoggle. Costco, which is suing the U.S. government, is going to give the money back to their clients?” Bessent says most businesses did not pass on the tariff costs to consumers Bessent also warned that if the court issues a mixed ruling, rather than a clear yes or no decision, it could make it more difficult to determine who is eligible for a refund and by how much they should be repaid. Previously, Morgan Stanley analysts had also projected that the court’s ruling could be far from clear-cut. The Treasury Secretary also told reporters that most businesses absorbed the tariffs themselves, and hence, consumers saw little to no price increase. Moreover, he pushed back on claims that Trump’s tariffs drove inflation, affirming that goods inflation stayed lower than overall inflation. Businesses and lawyers were expecting a Supreme Court decision on Friday, but the justices ruled on another case instead. The court has yet to say when it will issue a ruling on the dispute over Trump’s trade measures . However, Bessent believes that longer deliberations increase the likelihood that the court will support the president. Nonetheless, he insisted that the Treasury can still make repayments if the court rules otherwise. The government is projected to reduce its deficit in 2025 by about $300 to $400 billion, which would increase its financial capacity, Bessent said. For the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2025, the U.S. ran a $1.775 trillion deficit. Meanwhile, importers believe that collecting repayments on tariffs would be difficult if the Supreme Court were to rule against Trump’s IEEPA-based tariffs. Customs data showed that $133.5 billion has been collected through December 14, an estimate that is likely to reach $150 billion altogether. However, Bessent challenged the estimate, claiming it did not accurately reflect the number of tariffs that might qualify for refunds. He stated that tariffs collected under other laws also exist, although he did not provide a figure for those under IEEPA. Torres cautioned that reversing tariffs under the emergency act could push rates higher Some economists were deeply concerned about the possibility of repealing the tariffs. Jose Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, for example, explained that eliminating the tariffs would have serious consequences. He stated, “If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds. President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.” Thus, he argued that cutting off tariffs would hurt onshoring and fiscal conditions, and push rates up. Still, it would boost corporate profits by lowering input costs and easing trade. The prediction market Kalshi currently assigns only a 30% chance that the court will uphold the tariffs as implemented. Earlier, Bessent had also shared his concern that refunding tariffs could burden the administration and hinder efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit.

Her comments come as Republicans push toward a January 15 markup, even as Democratic support remains uncertain. The Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2026 is expected to shape how digital assets are regulated in the United States. Lawmakers are now racing to finalize draft language while negotiations continue behind closed doors. Senator Lummis Outlines Goals of the 2026 Crypto Bill Senator Cynthia Lummis said the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2026 aims to bring long-needed clarity to the digital asset market. In a recent post, she said the bill draws a clear line between digital asset securities and commodities. She added that the bill also adds consumer protections and gives both companies and regulators a unified framework to work within. If passed, U.S. banks would be permitted to stake crypto assets and earn yield, and more capital could remain onshore instead of flowing to offshore markets. Supporters, including Senator Cynthia Lummis, say these changes could position the United States as a leader in the next phase of blockchain innovation, creating a safer environment for users and more certainty for financial institutions. As Coinpaper previously reported , Lummis has long argued that unclear regulation has pushed crypto activity offshore. She believes defined rules can encourage responsible growth while keeping oversight intact. Senate Committees Prepare for January 15 Markup The Senate Banking Committee confirmed it will hold a markup hearing on January 15. Chairman Tim Scott said the committee has engaged in months of bipartisan talks and is ready to proceed. An official notice stated that the markup will consider the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025. The manager’s amendment is expected on January 12, while member amendments are due by January 13. The Senate Agriculture Committee is also expected to act on its related crypto bill. That legislation focuses on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s authority over digital asset commodities, as Coinpaper outlined earlier. However, despite ongoing talks, Democratic support is not guaranteed. Senator Cory Booker, a key negotiator on the Agriculture Committee, has raised concerns that could delay progress. Senator Ruben Gallego has also warned that limits on senior officials profiting from crypto are a requirement for his support. He described this issue as a red line during recent discussions. Advocates say seven Democratic votes are needed for final Senate passage. Without those votes, the bill could stall despite strong Republican backing.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|COMMODITY|MARKET|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-10 20:31:12

The operations targeted locations suspected of stealing electricity to power mining equipment. Hilir Perak police chief Bakri Zainal Abidin reported that officers seized 24 machines during the initial raid on the night of January 9. Two subsequent raids conducted early on January 10 led to the confiscation of the remaining 17 machines across three separate locations in the Teluk Intan area. No arrests have been made at this stage. Investigators continue working to identify the individuals or syndicates behind the operations. Authorities are examining evidence related to property damage and misuse of electricity supply, both of which are criminal offenses under Malaysian law. Cryptocurrency Mining Remains Legal Under Proper Conditions Mining cryptocurrency is not illegal in Malaysia when conducted through legitimate means. The issue arises when operators steal electricity or damage property to run their mining rigs. The machines seized in these raids are believed to have been connected to illegal electricity supplies. Unauthorized operations typically bypass electricity meters or tap directly into power lines. This allows operators to avoid paying for the substantial electricity required to run mining equipment. Such practices constitute theft from the national power grid and violate Malaysian law. Malaysian authorities have conducted numerous raids on illegal mining operations across various states in recent years. Some operations resulted in the seizure and destruction of thousands of machines. Police have previously used steamrollers to publicly destroy confiscated equipment as a deterrent to potential illegal miners. Safety Hazards and Infrastructure Damage Illegal cryptocurrency mining poses significant safety risks beyond the legal violations. The equipment generates substantial heat and requires proper cooling systems and electrical infrastructure to operate safely. Illegal setups typically lack these essential safety measures. Overloaded electrical systems can trigger fires that endanger both operators and surrounding properties. The constant heat generation and equipment weight can cause structural damage to buildings housing these operations. Several incidents in Malaysia and internationally have resulted in electrical fires linked to unauthorized mining activities.",News|Legal|Crypto,EN,0,0,MINING|REGULATION|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-10 20:52:30

This divergence between surface-level price action and underlying structure suggests that the BTC long-term thesis remains intact even as the forces shaping its next phase become more complex and more mature. Why Bitcoin Trend Strength Persists Despite Cooling Momentum Bitcoin remains firmly aligned with its long-term uptrend, but the more important signal is not showing up in price. CryptoELITES revealed on X that liquidity has been quietly tightening, and one of the clearest signals is TOTAL/BTC, which continues to bleed while BTC holds its structural levels . This kind of setup does not leave the market in panic; it just needs patience. If liquidity conditions begin to ease while the BTC trend continues to hold, the response won’t be instant. However, it will emerge gradually through rotations first, but not headlines. “How are you reading this phase right now?” CryptoELITES ask. The recent dip in Bitcoin doesn’t change the broader setup unfolding across the market . While BTC has chopped lower over the past few days, meme coins across the board have been quietly forming some of the cleanest corrective structures seen in this cycle. Crypto analyst 0xBossman highlighted that these meme coins have been reacting strongly to even modest BTC bounces and holding their structure during flash dips. In combination with the tight corrective structures, overwhelming bearish sentiment across major assets has swung bearish again. At the same time, meme coins continue to act as the leading edge of this broader rally , which will lead to an explosion soon. From 0xBossman’s perspective, this setup suggests that 2026 is where many of these meme coins will fully express their upside. The signals are already visible for anyone paying attention. From Downtrend Pressure To Structural Relief According to Ardi, one of the more constructive developments for Bitcoin over the past week has been the reclaim and hold of the 200 Simple Moving Average (200-SMA) on the 4-hour chart, a level that has acted as a reliable trend filter throughout this cycle. When this move slopes downward, price action will struggle to maintain local higher highs, and downside flushes will continue to appear. However, when the price regains the level and begins to turn up, the market will transition into a phase of sustained momentum. What stands out is that this is the first reclaim and hold of the BTC 4-hour 200-SMA since the October crash . This doesn’t automatically signal that the bull run is back, but it would give BTC a better chance to continue pushing through the $94,500 level.",Bitcoin News|0xBossman|200 SMA|Ardi|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CryptoELITES|Simple Moving Average|SMA,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-10 21:30:00

While price action remains subdued for now, key resistance levels near $94,100–$107,500 will likely dictate the market’s next major move. Whether BTC resumes its upward trajectory or tests deeper support, the coming week could provide the confirmation the market has been waiting for. Expect Slower Bitcoin Market Moves According to Kamile Uray, the market has entered the weekend, a period typically characterized by slow and subdued price action. The key support region between $90,588 and $88,280 has not yet formed a clear bottom, but it continues to prevent a sharper decline. Related Reading: Three Key Levels For Bitcoin: Top Analysts Caution Against Potential Drop Below $70,000 On the upside, a daily close above the $94,130 resistance would signal that bullish momentum is resuming. If this level is cleared, the next key resistance to watch is in the $98,200–$107,500 range. The $107,500 mark is particularly significant, as a daily close above it would represent the first higher high relative to the last downward wave on the daily chart, potentially opening the door for further upward continuation. Should the market face deeper declines, there are multiple support zones to monitor: $86,398, $83,822, and $82,477. As long as BTC holds above $82,477, any pullbacks are likely to be considered retests of previous breakouts, keeping the broader bullish scenario intact. If BTC closes below $82,477, it could trigger a continuation of the downtrend, possibly testing the $74,496–$71,237 zone, which represents a strong support area. Once a clear reversal is confirmed from this region, an upward move targeting the downtrend line could follow, offering a potential opportunity for traders to re-enter the market. Weekend Choppiness Expected As Volume Remains Light In a more recent update by Lennaert Snyder on X, Bitcoin has entered its weekend liquidity phase. As usual, trading activity is expected to be muted due to weak weekend volume. Looking ahead to next week, Snyder noted that the best-case scenario would be a break above the monthly open in the next weekly candle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Absorbs The Flush: Quantum Structure Signals Wave (3) Toward $104,000 Snyder is monitoring key triggers for quality trades. Historically, Sunday “scam-pumps” have provided opportunities to execute short trades near liquidity zones. Currently, the $87,600 monthly open is viewed as the main target for potential downside. A diagonal line drawn on the chart highlights buy-side liquidity from shorts, which could be swept before a market structure break (MSB) forms, allowing shorts to be executed. If Bitcoin climbs above the current weekly high near $94,700, Snyder notes that the setup would simply wait for the next MSB to enter shorts again. Another key resistance to watch next week is around $96,500. A clean break above this level would invalidate the bearish thesis targeting the monthly open, signaling that upward momentum could dominate.

According to a January 10, 2026 report from Wired, this initiative forms part of a broader strategy among AI companies seeking high-quality training data to enhance their models’ capabilities. The approach raises immediate questions about intellectual property protection, data sourcing ethics, and the future trajectory of white-collar automation. OpenAI’s Contractor Data Collection Initiative OpenAI, in collaboration with training data company Handshake AI, has reportedly implemented a system requesting third-party contractors to provide concrete examples of their professional work. Company presentations specifically ask contractors to describe tasks performed in other roles and upload samples of “real, on-the-job work” they have “actually done.” These submissions can include various file formats such as Word documents, PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, images, and repository files. The company provides guidelines for removing proprietary and personally identifiable information before uploading, even directing contractors to a specialized ChatGPT “Superstar Scrubbing” tool for this purpose. This data collection method represents a significant departure from traditional approaches to AI training data acquisition. Historically, companies have relied on publicly available information, licensed datasets, or synthetic data generation. The shift toward authentic professional work samples suggests AI labs are pursuing more nuanced, domain-specific training materials. Consequently, this strategy could potentially accelerate the development of AI systems capable of performing complex white-collar tasks with greater precision and contextual understanding. Intellectual Property and Legal Concerns Intellectual property lawyer Evan Brown expressed serious reservations about this approach in the Wired report. Brown emphasized that any AI laboratory adopting this methodology is “putting itself at great risk” by relying heavily on contractor discretion regarding confidentiality. The process inherently requires “a lot of trust in its contractors to decide what is and isn’t confidential,” creating potential vulnerabilities for both the AI companies and the contractors themselves. This concern becomes particularly acute when considering that contractors might inadvertently include proprietary information from previous employers, potentially violating non-disclosure agreements and employment contracts. The legal landscape surrounding AI training data remains complex and evolving. Current intellectual property frameworks were not designed with artificial intelligence data sourcing in mind, creating gray areas regarding fair use, derivative works, and commercial exploitation. Furthermore, different jurisdictions maintain varying standards for data protection and intellectual property rights, complicating compliance for global AI companies. OpenAI’s reported approach highlights the tension between rapid AI advancement and established legal protections for creative and professional work. Industry-Wide Implications and Ethical Considerations The reported initiative reflects a broader industry trend where AI companies increasingly seek specialized, high-quality training data. As AI models advance beyond general capabilities toward domain-specific expertise, the demand for authentic professional materials grows correspondingly. This trend raises ethical questions about consent, compensation, and transparency in data collection practices. Contractors providing work samples might not fully understand how their contributions will train future AI systems that could potentially automate aspects of their own professions. Additionally, the quality and diversity of training data significantly influence AI system performance and potential biases. By sourcing materials primarily from contractors, AI companies might inadvertently narrow the range of perspectives and approaches represented in their training datasets. This limitation could affect the models’ ability to generalize across different organizational cultures, industries, and geographic regions. The ethical imperative for diverse, representative data collection becomes increasingly important as AI systems assume more significant roles in professional decision-making processes. The Competitive Landscape of AI Training Data OpenAI’s reported strategy emerges within a highly competitive environment where access to quality training data represents a critical advantage. Other major AI developers, including Google, Anthropic, and various specialized firms, are simultaneously exploring innovative approaches to data acquisition. The race to develop more capable AI systems has intensified focus on data quality, with companies seeking materials that demonstrate professional reasoning, nuanced judgment, and domain-specific expertise. AI Training Data Acquisition Methods Comparison Method Advantages Disadvantages Public Web Scraping Large volume, diverse sources Quality variability, copyright issues Licensed Datasets Clear rights, consistent quality High cost, limited customization Synthetic Generation Complete control, privacy protection Potential artificiality, limited realism Contractor Work Samples High quality, professional context IP risks, ethical concerns, limited scale The contractor-based approach offers distinct advantages in terms of data quality and professional relevance. Real work samples provide authentic examples of professional decision-making, communication styles, and problem-solving approaches that synthetic data might not capture accurately. However, this method faces significant scalability challenges compared to web scraping or synthetic generation. Each contractor can provide only limited samples, and the vetting process for confidentiality adds administrative overhead. Balancing these trade-offs represents a central challenge for AI companies pursuing this data acquisition strategy. Technological and Practical Implementation The reported initiative involves specific technological components designed to facilitate data collection while addressing privacy concerns. The mentioned “Superstar Scrubbing” tool suggests OpenAI has developed specialized software to help contractors identify and remove sensitive information from their work samples. This technological approach attempts to balance data utility with privacy protection, though its effectiveness remains untested publicly. The tool likely employs natural language processing and pattern recognition to flag potential confidential information, proprietary terminology, and personal identifiers. From a practical perspective, contractors participating in this program must navigate several considerations: Employment Agreement Review: Contractors must carefully examine previous employment contracts for confidentiality clauses Data Sanitization: Proper removal of proprietary information requires significant attention to detail Context Preservation: Maintaining the educational value of work samples while removing sensitive elements Compensation Structure: Understanding how their contributions translate to payment and potential future benefits These practical considerations highlight the complexity of implementing such data collection initiatives responsibly. Contractors serve as intermediaries between their previous employers’ intellectual property and AI companies’ training needs, creating potential conflicts of interest and legal exposure. The success of this approach depends heavily on clear guidelines, effective tools, and transparent communication between all parties involved. Future Implications for White-Collar Professions The reported data collection strategy directly supports AI companies’ ambitions to automate increasingly sophisticated white-collar work. By training models on authentic professional materials, developers aim to create AI systems capable of performing tasks traditionally requiring human judgment, creativity, and domain expertise. This development trajectory has profound implications for various professions, including content creation, data analysis, administrative support, and even aspects of legal and financial services. However, the relationship between AI automation and professional work remains complex rather than purely substitutional. In many cases, AI systems trained on professional work samples might augment rather than replace human professionals, handling routine aspects while humans focus on higher-level strategy, creativity, and interpersonal elements. The quality and nature of training data significantly influence whether resulting AI systems serve as collaborative tools or competitive replacements. This distinction makes the current debate about data sourcing methodologies particularly consequential for the future of professional work. Regulatory and Industry Response The reported initiative occurs within an evolving regulatory landscape where governments worldwide are developing frameworks for AI governance. Recent legislative efforts in the European Union, United States, and other jurisdictions increasingly address data sourcing practices, transparency requirements, and accountability mechanisms for AI systems. OpenAI’s approach might attract regulatory scrutiny regarding data provenance, consent mechanisms, and intellectual property compliance. Industry associations and professional organizations are also likely to develop guidelines or position statements regarding the use of professional work for AI training purposes. Several key considerations will shape the regulatory and industry response: Transparency Requirements: Whether AI companies must disclose their data sources and collection methods Consent Standards: What constitutes valid consent for using professional work in AI training Compensation Frameworks: How contractors and original content creators should be compensated Audit Mechanisms: Procedures for verifying that training data complies with legal and ethical standards These considerations reflect growing recognition that data sourcing practices fundamentally influence AI system behavior, fairness, and societal impact. As AI becomes more integrated into professional domains, the methods used to train these systems warrant correspondingly greater attention from regulators, industry bodies, and the public. Conclusion OpenAI’s reported initiative asking contractors to upload real work from past jobs represents a significant development in AI training data acquisition with far-reaching implications. This approach highlights the industry’s pursuit of higher-quality, domain-specific training materials while raising substantial questions about intellectual property protection, ethical data sourcing, and the future relationship between AI and professional work. As artificial intelligence systems advance toward greater capabilities in white-collar domains, the methods used to train these systems will increasingly shape their impact on professions, organizations, and society. The current debate surrounding OpenAI’s contractor data collection initiative underscores the need for balanced approaches that foster AI innovation while respecting legal protections and ethical considerations. FAQs Q1: What exactly is OpenAI asking contractors to upload? OpenAI reportedly requests contractors to provide authentic work samples from previous and current employment, including documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and other professional materials they have actually created in their roles. Q2: Why would OpenAI want real work samples for AI training? Authentic professional work provides high-quality training data that demonstrates real-world problem-solving, communication styles, and domain expertise, potentially helping AI systems learn to perform complex white-collar tasks more effectively. Q3: What are the main intellectual property concerns with this approach? Contractors might inadvertently include proprietary information from previous employers, potentially violating confidentiality agreements. The approach relies heavily on contractors correctly identifying what constitutes confidential information. Q4: How does OpenAI address privacy and confidentiality concerns? The company reportedly provides guidelines for removing sensitive information and directs contractors to a specialized “Superstar Scrubbing” tool to help identify and remove proprietary and personally identifiable information. Q5: Is this approach unique to OpenAI or common in the AI industry?

The holders and investors wait for some gains. However, it seems that this steady growth is not in line with the good performance and massive gains displayed by some relatively new cryptocurrencies that have a real value and application for users. In order to get massive benefits, it is usually necessary to look out for some prospects that exist outside the major movers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quite an alluring investment opportunity available at a presale price of $0.04 due to its innovative approach that is set to provide profits to its investors. Presale Designed for Early Advantage Mutuum Finance presale is the best method for initial investors, giving the highest returns. Phase 7 is currently open with tokens costing $0.04, but it won’t last since the availability of tokens is limited for this stage. Phase 8 will offer tokens costing $0.045, an increase of almost 20%. More price increases will follow until launch at $0.06. This gives the biggest returns to investors who act first, while those who wait are required to pay more for the same tokens. An investment of $500 may see an ROI of $1375 to become $1875 when Mutuum Finance hits $0.15 like predicted. This translates to 3.75x growth from the current price. Over-Collateralized Loans The utility of Mutuum is vast and includes leveraging borrowed funds while retaining control over assets. For example, MUTM allows an investor to lock away $15,000 in ETH and subsequently borrows $10,000 in stable currencies, which is an important aspect for those looking for the best crypto to invest in. The utility offered allows stakeholders to access more funds for investments without selling ETH, in case it appreciates in price in the subsequent market periods. Assuming the $10,000 is put in a yield-farming pool with an annual yield of 10%, an individual is able to make an annual profit of $1,000, hence justifying MUTM as a utility-rich cryptocurrency with potential as an ideal long-term investment opportunity. The Buy-and-Distribute Dividend Model This model ensures that it generates utility for its stakeholders in an organized approach in which it churns out tokens for stakeholders’ acquisition through the structured system in which it operates. A fraction of all fee revenues generated is used in acquiring MUTM tokens, which are rewarded to stakeholders who stake in mtTokens. Assuming the platform generates revenues of $1 million in fee revenues. 20% of that could go to buying back tokens which are distributed to stakeholders for free. This could offer several hundreds of dollars in earnings for those who stake as little as $1000. Positioning in an Expanding Project Although there are stability patterns for Bitcoin within a range, Mutuum Finance clearly has steady developments. The project has finished its security audit by Halborn Security and is soon to unveil the test network on Sepolia, which signifies a heavy focus on security measures. This ensures that risks are well mitigated for investors to contribute to the growth of the token price. In a region of investors who are highly selective regarding sound tokens to invest in, Mutuum Finance offers an exceptional opportunity. Anyone interested in investing in an authentic cryptocurrency that has passed all required approvals should invest in MUTM.

Burn Metric Explodes Overnight,https://coinpaper.com/13666/shiba-inu-price-breakout-imminent-burn-metric-explodes-overnight,"Shiba Inu has recorded a dramatic spike in its token burn rate, marking a potential turning point for the meme cryptocurrency. Data from Shibburn reveals that more than 7.2 million SHIB tokens were removed from circulation within 24 hours on January 10, 2026. The burn rate jumped by 38,043% compared to the previous day. This massive increase breaks a prolonged streak of minimal burn activity that had kept the metric in negative territory for several consecutive days. Supply Reduction Shows Long-Term Strategy The total SHIB supply now stands at 589,245,806,058,242 tokens. This figure reflects ongoing efforts to reduce the original quadrillion-token supply through systematic burning. Sustained burn activity often correlates with broader network health. The recent spike suggests renewed engagement from the SHIB community. Previous periods of elevated burns have coincided with price rallies, though past performance does not guarantee future results. The Shiba Inu development team has implemented various burn mechanisms since the token's launch. These include transaction-based burns and community-driven initiatives. The latest data indicates these programs may be gaining traction again after a quiet period. Price Movement Mirrors Burn Activity SHIB's price increased by 0.81% over the last 24 hours. The token traded at $0.00000871 at the time of reporting. This modest gain marks a shift from recent red territory into positive momentum.

New data shows retail traders growing more optimistic as ETF headlines and macro narratives increasingly influence crypto price movements. According to the latest social and sentiment data compiled by Santiment, there has been a renewed optimism among retail traders, even as recent price action has begun to flatten and Bitcoin (BTC) tests key psychological levels. Recovery has not been limited to large-cap cryptocurrencies. In fact, several altcoins and meme coins also posted strong gains. Fresh Retail FOMO Social media discussion across platforms such as X, Reddit, and Telegram has shifted noticeably and reflected a more positive tone after months of bearish sentiment following Bitcoin’s October 2025 all-time high. Bitcoin remains at the center of the narrative. Its recent moves have been heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors and traditional financial market dynamics. ETF flow headlines played a significant role, particularly after US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a sizable one-day net outflow led by major issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity. The pullback coincided with traders de-risking ahead of crucial US economic data and expectations around interest rate cuts, which validates the view that Bitcoin is increasingly trading like a macro-sensitive asset. Ethereum has seen a more mixed sentiment profile. According to Santiment, discussion around the world’s largest altcoin by market cap has focused less on price action and more on staking-related developments, including staking rewards tied to regulated investment products. While interest in staking has increased, sentiment has remained scattered. This essentially reflects a lack of a clear directional catalyst for ETH in early 2026. This is true for several major outperformers, as retail sentiment remains uneven and highly reactive to short-term catalysts. For instance, Ripple (XRP) stood out with a nearly 14% weekly gain. This coincided with an increased attention around XRP’s January escrow unlock, which released 1 billion tokens, with a large portion reportedly re-locked. The scheduled supply event, combined with strong early-year momentum, drove a surge in retail participation. However, optimism rose sharply as traders attempted to buy perceived dips, followed by renewed caution as prices corrected from recent highs. Solana (SOL) also saw a significant jump in sentiment and price, which was swayed largely by institutional headlines, including a Reuters report that Morgan Stanley filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for ETFs tied to Bitcoin and Solana. Meme Coins Rebound Meme coins have also re-entered the spotlight. The OG, Dogecoin (DOGE), saw double-digit gains over the week, supported in part by strong performance from the 21Shares 2x Long Dogecoin ETF, which posted gains of roughly 38-39% in the first days of 2026. The ETF’s performance has contributed to fresh interest across the meme coin sector. Several meme coins have also witnessed synchronized whale buying and social hype this year.

The pullback has so far been controlled, with price holding above former resistance that has now turned into short-term support. A technical analysis shared on X by crypto analyst Bird proposed that conditions are now right for a familiar macro setup that has preceded XRP’s largest historical rallies. The focus of this outlook is on XRP’s reaction with the US dollar index and what its next move could mean for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Crypto Market Watches As Clarity Act Enters Senate Debate Next Week: US Senator How DXY Weakness Has Always Unlocked XRP Rallies Bird’s analysis is based on the US Dollar Index, or DXY, and its inverse relationship with XRP during important phases. The chart accompanying his post pointed to three previous periods, around 2017, 2021, and 2024, where sustained weakness in the dollar coincided with aggressive upside moves in XRP. In each of those cycles, red candles on the DXY chart led to a loss of dollar strength, while XRP responded with strong upward expansion shortly after. This recurring pattern means that XRP’s largest moves tend to follow macro shifts, not just even events related to XRP. When dollar dominance fades, capital always rotates into crypto assets, and XRP has been one of the primary beneficiaries of that transition. Interestingly, the current setup shows that DXY has returned to a similar structural zone seen before past rollovers. As shown in the chart below, the DXY is now trending downwards. US Dollar Index, XRPUSD. Source: @Bird_XRPL On X XRP To New All-Time Highs? The first highlighted phase captures the late-2017 to early-2018 cycle, when a weakening dollar backdrop lined up with XRP’s rally run into the cycle peak in the mid-$3 range. A similar relationship appeared around the 2020-2021 window, where dollar softness was followed by XRP surging to $1.90 at its cycle top. The latest was in H1 2025, which culminated in XRP reaching its current all-time high of $3.65 in July. The important context is why the current moment is a decision point. At the time of writing, the DXY is sitting around 99, and from here it can either turn lower and start printing red candles again or catch a bid and print green. If DXY starts printing red candles again and rolls over, the pattern Bird is pointing to suggests the macro backdrop becomes supportive for another strong XRP leg higher, which is why a new all-time high above $3.65 could come into view within the next few months. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Next Peak Might Ignite ADA’s Rally, Says Cardano Creator If DXY prints green and strengthens, that would be the opposite signal: it can tighten liquidity conditions and keep XRP’s price action capped in consolidation around $2 before any breakout attempt. Either way, the dollar’s next move will signal what comes next.

The release targets both staked and unstaked validators, including test nodes, and signals the network’s continued focus on operational resilience. According to Solana Status, validators should apply the patch immediately to reduce exposure to potential disruptions. Consequently, the update reinforces Solana’s approach of deploying preventative fixes before issues affect users or applications. Validator Update Reinforces Network Reliability The v3.0.14 release continues a pattern of rapid maintenance updates across Solana’s v3 validator client series. Besides addressing potential vulnerabilities, these patches aim to strengthen long-term performance and stability. Developers often push such updates quietly, ensuring validators install them before any network impact becomes visible. Hence, the absence of a detailed changelog aligns with Solana’s emphasis on proactive defense. Additionally, rising on-chain activity has increased the importance of validator reliability. The recent launch of the SKR token highlights growing demand across DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets. Stable validator layer supports higher throughput and smoother user experiences. Consequently, the network continues prioritizing infrastructure hardening alongside ecosystem growth. Major Upgrades Shape Solana’s Roadmap Moreover, Solana’s broader roadmap includes structural upgrades designed to address congestion and decentralization concerns. The Alpenglow upgrade, introduced in September 2025, replaced legacy consensus components with Votor and Rotor. These changes target faster finality and parallel execution, improving scalability. The network plans mainnet deployment this year, expanding capacity for complex applications. Significantly, the Firedancer validator client also plays a central role. Released in Q1 2025 by Jump Crypto, Firedancer runs alongside the Agave client. Its modular design enables parallel processing and targets extremely high throughput. The Agave 3.0.6 release, recommended in October, further supported validator efficiency. Together, these upgrades aim to future-proof Solana’s infrastructure. SOL Price Structure Reflects Compression and Accumulation Source: CoinCodex However, SOL price action shows near-term caution despite structural optimism. Solana traded near $135.31, posting a mild daily decline while maintaining a weekly gain above 2%. Market capitalization hovered near $76.3 billion, supported by steady circulation levels. According to moonbag, SOL’s long-term chart structure supports a breakout toward higher psychological levels, with $400 emerging as a potential upside target. Weekly price compression within a symmetrical triangle suggests prolonged accumulation. Resistance near $260 remains critical, while sustained strength above $180 could unlock higher targets. Source: X Eljaboom highlighted improving short-term structure after SOL reclaimed the $135–$138 demand zone. Additionally, higher lows continue forming, which limits downside risk. Analysts see $145 as a near-term pivot, with $187 emerging as a key resistance level ahead of February.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-10 23:31:01

The incident is the latest breach to affect a DeFi protocol on the Arbitrum network in 2026, with only ten days into the year. The news first broke when Phalcon, BlockSec’s threat detection platform disclosed on X that it had detected suspicious transactions targeting Futureswap’s contract. The security firm said it had attempted to contact the team but had received no response at the time of publication. For context, the project’s X account last posted in 2022. According to Phalcon, “The attacker appears to have drained funds through multiple changePosition operations, eventually withdrawing a large amount of USDC.” It also added, “Since the contract is not open-sourced, the exact root cause still requires further investigation.” ALERT! Our system detected a suspicious transaction targeting @futureswapx ’s contract on #Arbitrum a few hours ago, resulting in an estimated loss of ~$395K. We have attempted to contact the team, but have not received a response so far. The attacker appears to have drained… pic.twitter.com/SD5CUCfA8h — BlockSec Phalcon (@Phalcon_xyz) January 10, 2026 How did Futureswap get hacked? BlockSec analyzed the on-chain behavior and stated that it suspects “the incident may be related to unexpected stableBalance accounting changes during earlier position updates, which later allowed USDC to be released when removing collateral.” A few days earlier, on January 5, Cryptopolitan reported that two Arbitrum projects lost $1.5 million in smart contract access attacks. USD Gambit and TLP, both launched by the same deployer, suffered unauthorized withdrawals after an attacker gained admin access and replaced smart contracts with malicious versions. According to blockchain security firm Cyvers Alert, preliminary analysis shows that the single deployer may have lost access to their account. “The attacker then deployed a new contract and updated the ProxyAdmin privileges to gain control,” Cyvers Alert stated. The stolen funds were later bridged to the Ethereum network and deposited into Tornado Cash. Are hackers targeting Arbitrum? Arbitrum’s name has come up a lot in the 2026 DeFi hacks reported so far. In early January, TMX Tribe suffered a $1.4 million exploit, while the IPOR Fusion USDC vault lost $336,000 through a legacy contract vulnerability, though the DAO pledged full user reimbursement. Security researchers have noted that recent attacks follow a similar pattern that has been linked to North Korean state-sponsored hackers, who predominantly use Tornado Cash to launder funds. The attackers have learned to move quickly to swap and mix stolen funds almost immediately to avoid address blacklisting. These breaches typically target high-liquidity ecosystems because that way, the exploiters maximize their chances of major hauls. According to Defillama, Arbitrum holds over $3 billion across DeFi protocols on the platform, and it has never been far from the number one spot among Ethereum L2s in terms of TVL since it launched in 2021. Another common theme among recent hacks has been that they typically go for older smart contracts still holding liquidity. In July 2025, Cryptopolitan reported that the Arbitrum Foundation rolled out a $14 million war chest via the Arbitrum Audit Program to support native projects by subsidizing their smart contract audits. Exploit loot is quickly rerouted through mixers The fourth quarter of 2025 saw a spike in Tornado Cash deposits, with the mixer now holding a record value locked from both new hacks and older exploits. The platform contains more than 338,000 ETH, which is more than its 2021 peak. Mixers like Railgun have also experienced an uptick in activity at the end of 2025. The attacks have primarily targeted relatively obscure projects based on what analysts have observed. USD Gambit, for instance, points to a singular exchange being phased out in the coming weeks. Despite launching in 2023, the project did not benefit from the recovery of DeFi and perpetual futures trading, making it an easier target with less security oversight.

According to CoinsKid, a technical analyst known for his market commentary, XRP may experience further downside before the next phase of bullish momentum begins. XRP entered 2026 with strong gains , rallying above $2 in early January and reaching a peak of $2.41 on January 6. Following this advance, the token encountered resistance, resulting in several intraday declines. At the time of reporting, XRP is trading around $2.08 , testing the $2 support level. While many market observers anticipate a short-term rebound, CoinsKid suggests that the current pullback may not represent the final low for the year. Historical Bottoms Provide Context In a recent video commentary, CoinsKid referenced historical lows to contextualize his 2026 prediction. He noted that XRP’s bottom in 2020 was $0.21, rising to $0.55 during the 2021 bull market. In 2022, the bear market triggered by events like the Terra and FTX collapses pushed XRP down to $0.29. The following year, 2023, saw limited upward momentum, leaving the bottom at $0.30. By 2024, the low had improved to $0.388, though the cryptocurrency was still underperforming relative to expectations. XRP’s performance improved markedly in late 2024 and throughout 2025, surpassing the $1 and $2 thresholds. During the correction in April 2025, the bottom for that year was identified at $1.64, which CoinsKid had previously highlighted despite some pushback from the community when prices were above $3 at the time. Technical Basis for 2026 Bottom For 2026, CoinsKid projects a lower support level of $1.14. In his commentary, he presented a technical analysis showing that XRP broke above a seven-year symmetrical triangle during the November 2024 uptrend, initiating the first wave of an Elliott Wave structure that peaked at $3.4 in January 2025. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to CoinsKid, the subsequent decline represents Wave 2, an ABC corrective pattern that could push XRP toward the $1.14 level before resuming upward momentum. He also highlighted the importance of the 1.414 Fibonacci extension in identifying potential corrective lows. If XRP loses its current structure and drops below $1.9, the analyst expects the correction to reach this level, consistent with historical patterns observed in 2015 and 2021. Potential Upside After Correction Following the completion of the correction, CoinsKid anticipates that XRP could enter a strong recovery phase. Under this scenario, the cryptocurrency might ultimately reach $27 , representing a potential increase of nearly 1,200% from current prices. He emphasized, however, that this projection is hypothetical and contingent on the correction concluding as expected. CoinsKid acknowledged that both the predicted bottom and the potential peak carry significant uncertainty and are not guaranteed outcomes. This analysis underscores the importance of patience for investors, as technical setups suggest that XRP could experience additional short-term weakness before positioning itself for a potential long-term rally in 2026.

Meme coins are waking up, charts are moving, and people are chasing the next big breakout like kids chasing an ice cream truck. If you’re looking for the top crypto to buy now you’re in the right place, because timing is everything in crypto. In this article, we’re comparing three meme-powered contenders: APEMARS ($APRZ), Floki (FLOKI), and SNEK (SNEK). Floki continues to ride strong community energy while staying active in the meme coin spotlight. SNEK keeps holding its place as one of Cardano’s favorite meme tokens with loyal supporters. But APEMARS ($APRZ)? It’s still in presale, which means the “early advantage” is still alive and kicking. APEMARS ($APRZ) Presale Stage 3: Why It Feels Like Getting a Golden Ticket Early Imagine a candy shop where the candy is still cheap… but soon it becomes expensive. That’s what APEMARS feels like right now, a presale project where you can still buy at tiny pricing before it lists publicly. Here are the correct Stage 3 presale stats for APEMARS ($APRZ): Presale is Live Current Stage: 3 Stage 2 Price: $0.00002448 Listing Price: $0.0055 ROI From Stage 3: 22,300% Holder Count: 268 Amount Raised: $60k+ Tokens Sold: 2.90B The gap between the presale price and the listing price is what makes APEMARS ($APRZ) so exciting. It’s not just about the meme, it’s the math that creates the FOMO. Unique Utilities That Make APEMARS ($APRZ) More Than Just a Meme APEMARS isn’t trying to be “just another meme.” It’s built like a fun mission from Earth to Mars, almost like a story you can join. People love stories and adventures, and they love feeling like they’re part of something exciting. That’s why a strong theme makes it easy for the community to share it online, talk about it everywhere, and grow the hype naturally. APEMARS also has a presale structure that rewards early moves. It’s staged like levels in a game, and each stage gets more expensive, meaning early buyers get more tokens for the same money. While many meme coins rely only on hype, APEMARS adds real momentum through structured progress, rising stages, and early-entry rewards, which is why presales often create the biggest FOMO. How to Buy APEMARS ($APRZ) in Stage 3 Buying APEMARS is simple, even if you’re new: Go to the official APEMARS presale website Connect your crypto wallet (MetaMask is common) Select how much you want to buy Pay using the supported crypto method (like ETH/USDT depending on the presale setup) Confirm your purchase Track your tokens after purchase No complicated steps. Just simple click-and-buy. The $1,000 APEMARS ($APRZ) Scenario: The “I’m Early” Move That Could Become Legendary Let’s make this fun and real. If you invest $1,000 into APEMARS ($APRZ) right now at the Stage 3 price of $0.00002448, you’d get around 48,402,711 APRZ tokens. Now imagine APEMARS reaches its listing price of $0.0055, that same bag could be worth about $233,215. Of course, crypto isn’t magic and nothing is guaranteed, but this is exactly why presales get people excited: the upside gap is massive, the early advantage is still alive, and you’re getting in before the crowd. Now think about what $266K could mean for someone in the U.S., a down payment on a house, paying off student loans, starting a dream business, buying a car with zero debt, helping your family, or finally leaving a job you hate. That’s the kind of “life upgrade” dream people chase in crypto, and APEMARS ($APRZ) is offering that dream while it’s still early. Floki Today: Strong Brand, Strong Community, Still a Meme Powerhouse Floki has already proven it can survive meme cycles, and that’s impressive. It has a loyal fanbase, big branding, and continues to stay relevant in the meme coin space. Floki is often viewed as a strong “community-first” token, and it’s still supported by traders who believe meme projects with identity can keep thriving. Floki’s momentum comes from recognition, many people already know it, trust it, and follow it. But here’s the key difference: Floki is no longer in early presale pricing. It’s already in the market, and many investors are already inside. That’s why APEMARS ($APRZ) stands out, it’s offering a “start before the crowd” advantage that Floki can’t offer anymore. SNEK Today: Cardano Meme Strength + Community Loyalty SNEK is one of Cardano’s most recognized meme coins and has held strong attention because it’s deeply connected to its ecosystem. People who love Cardano often love SNEK because it feels like “their meme coin.” SNEK’s power is loyalty. It has strong community support and continues to stay active in the Cardano meme narrative. For investors who believe Cardano will grow more in 2026 and beyond, SNEK becomes a natural meme choice. Still, SNEK is already trading publicly, and that means you’re not getting presale pricing anymore. This is where APEMARS ($APRZ) becomes different, it gives people the chance to enter early, grab more tokens, and potentially enjoy the benefit of listing momentum. Conclusion: Top Crypto to Buy Now, Don’t Let This Become One of Those “I Wish I Bought” Moments Floki is powerful and established, and SNEK is strong with deep ecosystem love, both have proven communities and real momentum. But APEMARS is the early-stage opportunity that feels different, because it’s still in Stage 3, where the entry price is tiny and the upside potential looks massive for anyone who wants to move before the crowd arrives. If you’re seriously hunting for the top crypto to buy now, APEMARS offers something rare: a live presale, a Stage 3 price of $0.00002448, a listing target of $0.0055, 22,300% ROI potential, and 268 holders already building momentum. Don’t wait until everyone is shouting about it, the worst crypto regret always sounds like, “I almost bought it… But I didn’t.” Join the APEMARS ($APRZ) presale today before the next stages make it more expensive.

57054725,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892275,1768093200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57054725.jpeg,Solana (SOL) Whales Pivot to $0.04 Token Dubbed the Next Big Cryptocurrency,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-whales-pivot-to-0-04-token-dubbed-the-next-big-cryptocurrency/,"A massive transformation taking place within the crypto market is Solana whales showing massive attraction to a newer token, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With SOL showing rather unpitching price actions on its charts, these investors have begun searching for something with more concrete and rapid developments in growth and usage. Hence, many of these large investors have now begun allocations to MUTM, which is a decentralized finance token that is only worth $0.04 and is in its presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Phase The presale mechanism adopted in Mutuum Finance allows early investors to buy with fair and transparent prices. It has reached Phase 7 with tokens priced at $0.04, a 300% increase from the opening presale value. The current stage is selling out rapidly, and subsequently, Phase 8 will offer a hike to $0.045 before reaching the launch price of $0.06. In this regard, Phase 7 buyers get a natural advantage right from the onset, and this is why many financial analysts find MUTM to be the most tempting cheap cryptocurrency to purchase currently. For those who may still be wondering what sort of cryptocurrency is ideal for their investment, a clear-cut pricing system makes this a non-issue with MUTM. MUTM Lending Users can earn an immediate return on their investment from Mutuum Finance’s peer-to-peer lending option. Accordingly, there are no strict guidelines in connection with the mechanism, and users are free to implement their own terms and regulations. The lender may negotiate an 18% APY to earn passive returns of $900 from a $5,000 deposit in a niche asset. Risk Management is also another critical component of Mutuum Finance design, as indicated by the presence of the reserve factor in the protocol, where a percentage of all the interest rates in the reserve fund is set aside. If the annual interest on the platform is $1 million with a reserve factor of 10% for risk management, such reserves amounting to $100,000 are set aside. Given that the investor has placed a $20,000 investment with an expected APY of 12%, the arrangement ensures that the net APY of $2,400 is achieved regardless of the fluctuations in the marketplace, thus instilling confidence among investors and putting Mutuum Finance among the best cryptocurrencies in the marketplace. Liquidity Mining Another advantage of Mutuum Finance is the reward program for long-term investors, which uses liquidity mining, where the investor will be rewarded in the form of tokens, apart from the interest earned. An investor staking $10,000 in the ETH-USDC pool will earn a lucrative APY, apart from having a chance to earn more rewards in the form of MUTM tokens. The team has allocated 10% of the total tokens, 400 million MUTM, for this program. This model offers the sense of ownership to the participants within the protocol. The earning system overall is considered to be one of the key points that have led MUTM to become a top investment choice for investors. Why Whales Are Switching Smart money players always stay at least one step ahead of the trend, and their transition from slower-performing assets such as Solana to Mutuum Finance shows that they find the new asset appealing. MUTM provides the capability of earnings generation, growth plans, and attractive pricing to address the question of which cryptocurrency to invest in at the moment. Most importantly, with the steady rise in demand and fundamentals being sound, MUTM is soon to be the next big crypto of the year.

Although XRP has experienced short-term pullbacks following its early 2026 recovery, one market observer argues that the broader setup resembles a prior cycle that preceded a substantial price expansion. This observation has renewed discussion around how high XRP could move if the structure develops similarly. XRP’s Early 2026 Recovery and Pullback XRP entered 2026 with a sharp rebound after a difficult final quarter in 2025. In the first days of January, the asset climbed from approximately $1.83 to a local high near $2.41, representing a gain of more than 30% in less than one week. This advance reversed a large portion of the losses recorded during the fourth quarter of 2025, when XRP fell roughly 35%. However, the upward momentum slowed as the price encountered resistance near the $2.41 area. Since reaching that level, XRP has retraced part of its gains, declining by over 13% and settling closer to the $2.10 region. While some market participants interpreted the pullback as a sign of weakness, analyst CryptoWZRD has suggested that the movement fits within a broader technical structure rather than signaling a breakdown. SIMILAR FORMATION? For over a year $XRP has been trading sideways.. The last major explosive rally in XRP came from an identical setup, can history repeat? Patience Pays. pic.twitter.com/vJpcBWjgfz — CRYPTOWZRD (@cryptoWZRD_) January 9, 2026 The Role of Prolonged Consolidation According to CryptoWZRD, XRP’s current behavior mirrors a longer-term consolidation pattern that previously appeared before a major rally. Extended consolidation phases are marked by price trading within defined boundaries for several months, as buying and selling pressure gradually balance out. During these periods, volatility tends to remain constrained, and directional momentum is limited. In 2024, XRP spent much of the year trading well below $1, fluctuating between a lower boundary near $0.40 and an upper limit around $0.75. Repeated attempts to move beyond resistance failed, while declines were consistently supported near the lower end of the range. This environment persisted for most of the year, preventing a sustained trend from forming. As that consolidation matured, XRP transitioned into a narrowing price structure following a decline from roughly $0.66 in September 2024. This development signaled that the market was approaching the end of its consolidation phase. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In early November 2024, XRP broke out of this structure, coinciding with a sharp increase in trading activity. The breakout was followed by a rapid advance that carried XRP to approximately $3.40 by January 2025, representing a multi-hundred-percent increase from the consolidation lows. Similar Conditions Emerging Again CryptoWZRD argues that XRP may now be undergoing a comparable process. Since early 2025, the asset has largely remained within a broad trading range, fluctuating between roughly $1.60 and $3.60. After peaking near $2.70 in late October 2025, XRP entered another period of downward pressure, which culminated in the steep decline seen during the fourth quarter. During this phase, XRP once again formed a tightening price structure similar to the one observed in the prior cycle. The analyst notes that, in the past, the appearance of such a structure marked the latter stages of consolidation rather than the beginning of a prolonged bearish trend. From this perspective, the strong rebound recorded at the start of 2026 may indicate that the corrective phase is nearing completion. At the time of analysis, XRP is trading at $2.08 and attempting to maintain stability above the $2 level. CryptoWZRD has raised the possibility that, if the asset were to replicate the magnitude of its previous breakout, the resulting upside could be substantial. Applying a similar percentage increase to current prices would place XRP well above its recent highs. While this scenario depends on broader market conditions and sustained demand, the analysis underscores why some traders are closely monitoring XRP’s technical structure. Rather than focusing solely on short-term fluctuations, attention remains on whether the broader consolidation resolves in a way that aligns with XRP’s historical price behavior.

Rumors Swell With No Confirmation,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-and-amazon-happening-soon/,"There is ongoing speculation in the crypto community that Ripple, the crypto payments company, and Amazon, the global tech giant , may soon enter into a partnership. While some claims indicate that an alliance has already been formed, others suggest it may be in the works. Whatever the case, no confirmation has yet been issued to verify the rumor’s validity. Rumors Swirl About A Potential Ripple And Amazon Deal Rumors about a possible connection between Ripple and Amazon are quickly gaining attention in the crypto community. Prominent analysts and influential XRP supporters are speculating that the crypto payments company and the tech giant may be heading into a possible partnership. While there has been no concrete evidence to support such claims, advocates like Stellar Rippler, who has over 24,000 followers on X, alleged that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had hinted years ago that Amazon might use XRP for payments and settlement. The supporter argued that previous nondisclosure agreements were not just speculation, but part of a broader plan. Moreover, he believes that recent developments are increasingly aligning with those earlier hints as new details surface. Abdullah Nassif, host of the Good Evening Crypto show, also weighed in on the widespread speculation. He said Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Ripple are looking at using Amazon Bedrock AI with the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to speed up system log analysis from days to just minutes. Crypto expert John Squire added that AWS had previously shown interest in XRP for payments. He claimed the company even assigned a team member to explore XRP’s use cases , which has now grown into talks about combining Amazon Bedrock with XRPL. Despite the growing rumors about the company, Amazon, and XRP, neither the crypto company nor the tech giant has officially confirmed any partnership or future collaboration. Amazon Web Services Adds The Firm To Partner Profile Page It could be argued that one of the major reasons rumors of a potential Ripple and Amazon partnership are growing is the crypto payments company’s recent appearance on the AWS Partner Profile page. On its official site, Amazon Web Services highlights the firm’s evolving role in the financial sector, positioning it as a key infrastructure provider for global payments. It showcased the company’s core features and products, including real-time payments, On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) , and the ability to send international payments through a single integration. AWS also described RippleNet as a decentralized network of banks and payment providers that enables real-time messaging , clearing, and settlement of financial transactions. According to the cloud computing platform, the payment firm connects banks, digital asset exchanges, and corporations through RippleNet to facilitate global money transfers . AWS also disclosed several RippleNet use cases, including e-invoicing, real-time cash pooling, global currency accounts, international P2P payments, real-time remittances, and more. The cloud computing network has revealed that Ripple has collaborated with more than 100 financial institutions. Many of these organizations are based in different regions outside the US.",Ripple|Abdullah Nassif|amazon|Amazon Bedrock AI|Amazon Web Services|AWS|Brad Garlinghouse|Good Evening Crypto|John Squire|ODL|On-Demand Liquidity|P2P Payments|ripple|RippleNet|Stellar Rippler|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-11 01:00:35

This adjustment was observed after this sector announced a slight ease of mining difficulty to a record of 146.4 trillion on Thursday, January 8. Notably, mining difficulty illustrated the extent of hardship miners needed to expect when introducing a new block to the decentralized blockchain. During this incident, CoinWarz , a long-standing crypto platform (since 2013) offering essential tools for miners, shared its prediction, urging miners to expect the next adjustment to take place on January 22, 2026, at 04:08:12 AM UTC. However, different from the recent adjustment, this forecasted one is anticipated to raise Bitcoin mining difficulty from a record of 146.47 trillion to 148.20 trillion. In attempts to explain this increase, analysts conducted research and discovered that the average block times were recorded at 9.88 minutes, slightly below the set target of 10 minutes. With this finding, they asserted that the next adjustment could lead to a surge in difficulty, aligning more closely with the target time. Miners publicly note down the Bitcoin mining difficulty in the sector Reports in 2025 highlighted that the Bitcoin mining difficulty skyrocketed to new all-time highs , with a slight increase experienced in the last adjustment of that year. Interestingly, even after this increase was recognized, sources claimed that the difficulty record remained below November’s peak of 155.9 trillion. To break down the meaning of surging Bitcoin mining difficulty, reports suggest that such a situation indicates miners should expect stiff competition in this sector, which is anticipated to arise when they launch new blocks to the network. As a result, the situation worsens in the industry, consequently affecting economic and regulatory status across 2025. At this particular moment, analysts have admitted that Bitcoin miners face significant hardship in generating profits, as margins have greatly shrunk due to the halving event that occurred in April 2024. If block rewards were reduced by half, several key economic factors would be affected. Later, miners and mining firms reported facing increased pressure from the crypto market decline that began in November. This stress arose when miner hash price drastically decreased below the expected level essential to break even. This price illustrated the anticipated yields for each computing power unit utilized to mine blocks effectively. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the miner hash price is the expected daily revenue generated per unit of computational power (hashrate), usually measured in dollars per terahash per second per day ($/TH/s/day). Bitcoin’s price drastically drops amid significant challenges in the Bitcoin mining industry Considering the increased uncertainties in the Bitcoin mining sector, miners have been encouraged to choose whether to continue with their operations or halt them when the price reaches a record of $40 per petahash-second per day. This price marks an increase from a low point of $35 recorded in November. Another factor that has significantly contributed to the recent pressure in the mining industry is US President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, which have sparked concerns about the potential for a supply chain shortage in the sector. Notably, October’s flash crash marked the beginning of declines in the crypto market, which led to a drop in the price of BTC by over 30% in November , with a low of just above $80,000. Nonetheless, even with this decline, the crypto industry became hopeful once more after the price of the cryptocurrency started rising, maintaining a level lower than October’s peak of more than $125,000.

On-chain analysts have noticed more whales selling off their holdings in waves since late 2024. In 2025, whale holdings dropped to 3 million BTC raising concerns about the sales destabilizing the market. Why are Bitcoin holders selling now? A Bitcoin miner who earned rewards back in 2010 has moved 2,000 BTC to Coinbase Exchange after keeping the coins untouched for 15 years. At current prices near $100,000 per Bitcoin, this transfer is worth close to $200 million. The miner stored these coins in 40 separate Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) addresses, the original way Bitcoin addresses worked in 2010 before newer and better formats were introduced. CryptoQuant reported that after BTC crossed $100,000 for the first time in December 2024, there were three major periods of selling in late 2024, July 2025, and November 2025. In July of 2025 a whale moved 80,000 BTC that sat dormant for 14 years. Galaxy Digital helped with the transaction, which was worth about $9 billion at the time Bitcoin traded near $108,000. The company’s CEO Mike Novogratz confirmed that companies like Strategy and other corporate Bitcoin buyers quickly purchased the coins without crashing the market. Strategy already acquired 673,783 BTC as of early 2025. Will BTC’s price drop due to whale sales? Bitcoin was valued above $126,000 in early October 2025 before falling 30% to around $86,000 by mid-December. During the first two waves of whales selling their holdings, Bitcoin ETF demand was strong enough to outpace the supply from sellers. ETF inflows kept prices rising even as old holders cashed out. When ETF buying cooled down and another wave of whale activity arrived in November, prices finally started dropping. After the BTC halving event cut mining rewards in half, mining companies needed to sell more of their Bitcoin to cover electricity and operating costs. Riot Platforms, a major Bitcoin mining company reported selling 1,818 BTC during December, generating net proceeds of $161.6 million at an average price of $88,870 per coin. The sales reported in filings was a serious escalation from November when the company sold just 38 BTC. Back in January 2025, another dormant whale caused a stir when they sent 500 BTC worth $47 million to Coinbase Prime after six years of inactivity. That wallet originally received those coins when Bitcoin was trading around $7,000, meaning the holder gained 13x on their investment. Market observers have been debating whether or not Bitcoin will follow its traditional four-year cycle that usually includes a bear market after price peaks. CryptoQuant’s CEO Ki Young Ju believes that the market has changed because ETFs and corporate treasuries create new demand that didn’t exist in previous cycles. He believes further gains could come in 2026 if institutional buying continues. According to Cryptopolitan reports, investment firms such as Berstein, Bitwise, Standard Chartered and Grayscale agree with the CryptoQuant executive in dismissing the importance of the four-year cycle as more relevant macro factors have come into the picture with the crypto market’s maturity and regulatory status.

In particular, analysts and commentators have explored what XRP’s valuation might look like if it were to process a small share of transaction flows associated with SWIFT, the dominant international financial messaging network. While such projections are theoretical, they provide a framework for understanding why XRP’s long-term role in cross-border payments continues to attract attention. XRP’s Proposed Role in Global Payments Ripple’s leadership has consistently emphasized that XRP was created to enhance international settlements rather than eliminate existing financial infrastructure. According to statements from Ripple executives, traditional systems remain functional but often involve delays, multiple intermediaries, and high operational costs. Blockchain-based settlement, by contrast, allows transactions to finalize more quickly and with fewer steps, potentially freeing up capital that would otherwise remain locked in transit. From this perspective, XRP is often discussed as a settlement asset that could operate alongside established networks. Under such an arrangement, SWIFT would continue to serve as a messaging layer, while XRP and the XRP Ledger could be used to move value more efficiently between institutions. The Scale of SWIFT’s Transaction Network To assess XRP’s hypothetical price impact, it is important to understand the magnitude of SWIFT’s daily activity. The network processes tens of millions of messages every day, with reported averages exceeding 40 million messages daily in recent years. Although SWIFT does not publish exact figures for the total value transferred, historical estimates suggest that daily transaction values reached approximately $5 trillion as early as the mid-2000s. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Given the growth of global finance since then, current volumes are widely assumed to be higher. However, using the conservative $5 trillion figure provides a reasonable baseline for illustrative calculations. Modeling a 5% Share Scenario If XRP were to facilitate just 5% of a $5 trillion daily transaction flow, that would equate to $250 billion moving through the asset each day. At present, XRP trades near $2.09 and typically records daily trading volumes of roughly $3 billion. An increase from $3 billion to $250 billion in daily activity would represent a significant expansion in usage. Applying a simplified proportional framework that compares current trading activity with this hypothetical level, XRP’s price could rise substantially under such conditions. Using this approach, some estimates place XRP’s potential price near $170 per token, assuming the market adjusts upward in line with increased volume. At that level, XRP’s total market capitalization would reach several trillion dollars, positioning it among the largest financial assets globally. However, asset prices do not scale directly with transaction volume, particularly in markets dominated by institutional liquidity, net settlements, and high-frequency activity. Much of the increased volume could reflect operational usage rather than sustained buying pressure. Nonetheless, this analysis helps explain why XRP’s potential integration into large-scale payment flows remains a subject of interest. Even limited participation in systems associated with global settlement activity could have meaningful implications for XRP’s long-term valuation, depending on adoption, regulation, and market structure.

Bitcoin is holding near $90,000, while big altcoins are stuck in choppy ranges that punish hesitation and weak conviction. Cardano sits right in that storm. ADA is trading around $0.39 to $0.40 today, but the market still cannot agree on a clean Cardano price prediction for the months ahead. When that uncertainty drags on, money rotates toward clearer catalysts, and one name keeps coming up as traders hunt for the next big altcoin in 2025 style momentum, just delayed into 2026: Remittix (RTX). Cardano price prediction stays tense as traders watch key levels Cardano is not collapsing, but it is also not convincing the market. The current Cardano price prediction debate is focused on whether ADA can build above the $0.42 area, which many see as a near term ceiling. When price cannot reclaim a level like that and hold it, rallies start to look like short lived bounces instead of real trend shifts. Derivatives positioning has also jumped, which can make volatility sharper in both directions. From a chart view, some analysts point to a falling wedge breakout attempt, but they warn the move needs strong follow-through volume to matter. If that volume does not show up, the Cardano price prediction talk turns into the same range trade again: traders sell strength, buy dips, and wait for a narrative that actually changes. Traders shift focus to utility plays like Remittix for 2026 This is where Remittix enters the conversation, not as another “maybe,” but as a deadline-driven story that traders can actually trade around. The project is pushing a crypto-to-fiat payments angle, and it has put a hard date on its platform rollout: February 9, 2026 . When Cardano price prediction threads feel stuck in technical noise, a fixed launch date feels like oxygen. Remittix has also pushed two urgency triggers that hit the market’s FOMO nerve fast. One is a limited 200% token bonus that is capped at 5 million tokens, with the team saying a large chunk of that cap moved in the last 24 hours. The other is product distribution momentum, with the Remittix wallet now live on the Apple App Store and Google Play, described as next in line. If you are trying to land a Cardano price prediction for 2026, the hardest part is identifying what changes the story. With Remittix , the story change is already scheduled, and the market tends to front-run scheduled catalysts. RTX is priced at $0.119, with 695 million tokens sold and over $28.7 million raised so far. The project also points to over 30,000 investors acquiring RTX in recent months, which adds social proof at the exact time supply pressure is increasing. Then there is credibility. Remittix has leaned hard into security and trust signals, with the team fully verified by CertiK and positioned as the top-ranked token on CertiK’s pre-launch listings. That matters because serious buyers do not just chase hype; they chase projects that can survive scrutiny. Here is the simplest truth: waiting is a strategy, but in early-stage crypto investment, waiting often becomes regret when the price resets higher. Why buyers are moving now instead of later: Remittix is built as a DeFi project with a real payments mission that aims to move value from crypto into everyday spending routes. The February 9, 2026 rollout date gives traders a clear catalyst calendar instead of open ended promises. The CertiK verification and top ranking status raise the trust floor for new buyers who demand proof before they deploy capital. The exchange roadmap and third CEX preparation increase the odds of faster liquidity expansion when attention turns into volume. What to watch next Cardano price prediction debates will stay noisy until ADA proves it can push through resistance and hold it. If ADA fails to reclaim key levels with conviction, traders will keep hunting for clearer catalysts elsewhere, because uncertainty is expensive in a fast market. Remittix is giving traders a schedule, a product rollout, and a tightening supply story that punishes late entries. If you keep seeing the same name on 2026 watchlists, it is usually because the market is already positioning, not because it is brainstorming.

A realistic Cardano price prediction depends on whether ADA can reclaim and hold key resistance zones like $0.42 with strong follow-through. If ADA stays stuck near $0.39 to $0.40, the Cardano price prediction outlook remains range-bound and driven by short-term sentiment. 2) How can beginners buy RTX tokens if they want early exposure? If you want to buy RTX tokens, start by using the official Remittix site and only follow verified project announcements. Many buyers treat this as an early-stage crypto investment because access conditions can change quickly as milestones are hit. 3) Why do some traders call Remittix the best crypto to buy now among upcoming crypto projects? Some traders view Remittix as the best crypto to buy now because it has a fixed rollout date on February 9, 2026, visible product distribution with the wallet on the Apple App Store, and a clear path toward centralized exchanges. Those signals can matter more than endless Cardano price prediction debates when the market wants a cleaner catalyst.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-11 03:29:57

With LINK trading around $13 and fresh Chainlink Price Prediction reports now mapping paths toward $50 over the next cycle, interest has picked up among both retail and institutional traders. At the same time, some investors do not want to wait years for a move from $13 to $50. They are starting to compare the slower upside on LINK with Remittix, a payment-focused DeFi project that links crypto to bank accounts and combines real utility with aggressive incentives. Chainlink Tries To Confirm A New Uptrend Chainlink trades around $13.24, with a live market capitalisation of $9.3 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $385 million. Recent Chainlink price predictions from outlets that track technical data suggest a move toward $15.50 in the coming weeks, provided support near $12 continues to hold, and current momentum readings remain positive. That is why many Chainlink Price Prediction notes treat talk of a new $50 high as a longer-term scenario that would need a stronger crypto market and sustained demand for oracles. Fundamentals remain one of the main reasons analysts stay positive on LINK. Chainlink continues to lead the oracle sector and has extended CCIP to more networks, while Coinbase has selected Chainlink CCIP as exclusive bridge infrastructure for its wrapped asset growth program, which deepens links with major institutions. Overall, the near term tone leans cautiously bullish, with a grinding move higher seen as more likely than a straight run to any $50 target. Remittix Builds A Higher Upside Payments Narrative Where Chainlink already carries a large cap valuation, Remittix sits earlier in its journey and targets a different problem. The project is building a PayFi stack that joins crypto wallets, fiat rails, and bank payouts so users and businesses can move money across borders in a direct way. For investors who study every Chainlink Price Prediction but want much higher upside, RTX offers a smaller starting base and a roadmap built around payment activity rather than only price action. The delivery record behind Remittix is a key part of that case. The team reports that more than 697 million RTX tokens have already been sold at $0.119, with over $28.7 million raised and progress toward a $30 million milestone that will unlock a major new exchange reveal. BitMart listed RTX after the raise crossed $20 million, and LBANK followed after $22 million, while a third top-tier listing is now in preparation. Security and trust are reinforced by a f ull CertiK audit , a number one ranking for pre-launch tokens on CertiK Skynet with a Grade A score of 80.09, and a fully KYC-verified team. On the product side, the Remittix Wallet is live on the Apple App Store, Google Play is in progress, and the main Remittix Platform will launch on 9 February 2026 to switch on global crypto to fiat payouts. The current sale phase also includes a 200% bonus offer that is selling out fast, activated using the RTX2026 code and a 15% USDT referral reward that pays every 24 hours through the dashboard, adding a clear layer of crypto with passive income potential for early supporters For investors, several Remittix features stand out, including: Solving a real-world $19 trillion cross-border payments problem Utility first token model built around real transaction volume Deflationary tokenomics with growth potential Global payout rails are expanding, with a focus on key remittance corridors Built for adoption rather than short-term speculation Why Remittix Deserves A Place Beside Chainlink Chainlink is likely to remain a key building block for DeFi and tokenized assets, and a price boost would support the bullish side of any medium term Chainlink Price Prediction. Yet the same market now rewards projects that bring fresh utility and stronger upside from a lower starting point. Remittix fits that description, with a confirmed 9 February 2026 platform launch, a wallet already in the Apple App Store, and multiple CEX listings that anchor liquidity plans. When that is combined with the 200% bonus window and the 15% USDT referral program, Remittix looks like a payment token that can sit beside LINK in a portfolio while offering much more aggressive growth potential.

Most recent analysis sees LINK grinding to maintain price action, helped by firm support and growing network usage. Higher targets near $50 usually depend on a much stronger crypto market phase and sustained demand for Chainlink services. Why Is Remittix Viewed As A Higher Upside Alternative To LINK Right Now? Remittix starts from a much smaller valuation and is entering its main product launch phase. That combination gives it more room to move compared to a large cap like Chainlink, where growth is usually steadier. Why Are Some Investors Pairing Chainlink With Remittix Instead Of Choosing One? Chainlink offers steady, infrastructure-driven growth, while Remittix targets faster upside through payments and adoption. Holding both allows investors to balance long-term utility with higher reward potential.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-11 04:00:00

As a result, several analysts predicted that the core consumer price index would soar by 2.7% in December compared to 2024. Regarding the analyst’s prediction , sources claimed that this forecast was slightly above the 2.6% annual surge recorded in November. Nonetheless, reports declared that this record demonstrated the slightest rise since early 2021. The Upcoming December report sparks hope among individuals Earlier, analysts had anticipated that overall and core prices would increase by 0.3% monthly. Unfortunately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released a statement informing individuals that it was unable to publish the month-to-month amendments to the last Consumer Price Index report due to the recent government shutdown . Following this announcement, analysts noted that the November report showed a decline in the inflation rate. Additionally, due to the struggles the agency encountered while gathering price data in October, this report anticipated that key rent indexes would remain stable in that month. Consequently, this situation challenged figures recorded in November. However, even with this scenario, optimism was sparked once again in the ecosystem after sources pointed out that the December report could shift this trend to a more positive outlook. Notably, this report is scheduled to be made public on Tuesday, 13 January. At this point, the reason why the Federal Reserve officials looked forward to maintaining interest rates unchanged for the time being was clear. These reasons included insufficiently clear inflation readings and signs of stabilization in the US job market after reports about weak wages were leaked, according to an analysis conducted by analysts. “We believe the CPI report will create some misleading stories. We anticipate that the December data will be high, largely due to the correction of some of the downward trends seen in November’s data. Some analysts might interpret this high reading as a sign that inflation is coming back, but we think that’s not correct,” they said. They also acknowledged that the November report exaggerated the downturn in inflation, possibly by about 20 basis points, but still expressed the belief that several retailers have been reducing prices and that tariff effects have reached their peak, with several products already at their highest levels. Analysts describe this week as a busy, economically related week As the situation surrounding inflation intensified, reports highlighted that Monday would initiate an eventful week for John Williams, the President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who would address matters concerning US central bankers who are expected to make public appearances. Other prominent leaders appointed to speak on economic matters this week include Michelle Bowman, Philip Jefferson, Alberto Musalem, and Anna Paulson. Meanwhile, sources confirmed that consumer spending in the fourth quarter demonstrated impressive performance. These sources also noted that government data, anticipated to be published on Wednesday, January 14, will disclose another significant rise in retail sales. Following this assertion, analysts forecast a 0.4% surge in November, similar to the rise encountered in October. This percentage was calculated after they excluded auto dealers. Other reports set to be released this week are expected to address issues concerning October’s new-home sales, the November producer price index, and December’s industrial production and home resales.

The group behind the campaign identifies itself as “Investors For Transparency.” Ad Campaign Targets Lawmakers With Hotlines And Numbers According to reports , the ads warn of broad risks if DeFi is folded into federal law. They cite a figure — $6.6 trillion — that has been used in public discussion about how much in bank deposits might be affected if stablecoins gain wide acceptance with interest-like features. The ads urge people to call Senate offices and push senators to strip DeFi provisions from the CLARITY Act ahead of a scheduled markup on January 15, 2026.

Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott has said he expects the committee to move on crypto legislation, and senators are weighing how to balance investor protections with innovation. Outside groups and industry players have ramped up outreach. Some hope the bill moves quickly, while others see the political heat as likely to slow progress. Crypto: Industry Response And Questions About Funding Crypto firms and DeFi supporters have pushed back. Hayden Adams, CEO of Uniswap Labs, publicly criticized the group’s name as misleading and questioned who is funding the ads. Based on public filings and media reporting, no clear single donor has been identified that explains the scale of the TV buy. Industry leaders say that a campaign attacking DeFi while claiming to speak for investors should disclose its backers. The ads’ emphasis on bank-deposit risk has been called overstated by some market watchers, who argue that the figures are speculative and depend on many assumptions. What The Campaign Wants And What It Means Reports say that the ads want senators to approve a version of the CLARITY Act without language covering decentralized finance platforms or new stablecoin rules that could allow interest-like yields. Supporters of that view say the rules would protect the traditional banking system from a sudden outflow of deposits. Opponents say excluding DeFi would lock in regulatory uncertainty and hurt US competitiveness in an area where developers and users already operate globally.

A bullish bias remains as long as the price holds above $0.30. A break above $0.325–$0.33 opens $0.34–$0.35 next. Optimism 1-day price chart On the 1D chart for January 11, OP is trading around $0.32 after a sharp impulsive move from the $0.26–$0.27 region, confirming a short-term trend shift. The price is holding above the 20-day basis of the Bollinger Bands, near $0.295, which now acts as the first dynamic support. Meanwhile, the upper band, around $0.345, defines the immediate upside ceiling. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The recent small-bodied candles signal digestion rather than rejection, and as long as daily closes remain above $0.30, the structure stays bullish. A daily expansion back toward $0.34–$0.35 would indicate momentum continuation, while a loss of $0.295 would expose a deeper pullback toward $0.27 without fully breaking the trend. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the price is compressing just above the Alligator averages, clustered between $0.317 and $0.319, indicating equilibrium rather than weakness. The CMF holding around 0.19 confirms sustained capital inflow, and the Accumulation/Distribution line continues to slope upward, suggesting dips are being absorbed. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume has cooled, which fits a consolidation phase after expansion, not distribution. A clean 4-hour close above $0.325 would likely trigger a push toward $0.34, while acceptance below $0.315 would risk a range reset toward $0.30. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3211 SELL SMA 5 $0.3175 BUY SMA 10 $0.3029 BUY SMA 21 $0.2852 BUY SMA 50 $0.3031 BUY SMA 100 $0.3910 SELL SMA 200 $0.5422 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3207 SELL EMA 5 $0.3159 BUY EMA 10 $0.3048 BUY EMA 21 $0.2972 BUY EMA 50 $0.3212 SELL EMA 100 $0.3944 SELL EMA 200 $0.5368 SELL What to expect from Optimism? OP is in a pause within an emerging bullish structure, favoring continuation as long as $0.30–$0.295 holds. Upside expansion requires volume re-entry, but downside risk remains controlled unless structure support breaks decisively. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

57059899,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892821,1768108904,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57059899.jpeg,Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says tokenized stocks will be a huge.,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/tokenized-stocks-will-transform-trading/,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong believes tokenized stocks will redefine global trading. He commented, “Tokenized stocks will be huge. So many opportunities.” The Coinbase executive noted that tokenized stocks will expand their international access and continue to offer fractional stock purchases and round-the-clock trading. He added they’ll provide perpetual futures, real-time settlement, and novel governance innovations. X users agree that tokenization offers real benefits, some sharing Armstrong’s optimism for growth In response to Armstrong’s post , X user Andreas Kohl supported the executive’s argument that tokenized shares will blow up. However, he excluded the derivatives of CSD-held shares on Base in his success projection, adding , “What’s going to be huge is on-chain DRS with disintermediated trading for native BTC.” Another X commenter, Jack Holdorrson, shared his optimism that capital markets will be tokenized in the years to come. Another X user also pointed out that while tokenized stocks come with real upsides, including continuous trading and fractional ownership, the government is hijacking them. He explained that Washington is dressing up old Wall Street politics in blockchain language instead of letting real innovation happen. He slammed the U.S. law, which sets up a $55 million government program run by 11 insider-heavy advisory committees. He likened it to the 2008 bailout, saying it feels more like a handout to powerful players than real innovation. These comments come as tokenized stocks are gaining ground as a means for ordinary people to access investment opportunities that have long been reserved for high-net-worth individuals and other accredited investors. However, while retail traders’ interest in the emerging asset class is accelerating, some experts are cautioning them to slow down. This is because tokenized stocks are less regulated, and they can pose more legal and financial risks to inexperienced traders, some experts say. “With a token, it is an instrument not issued by the company,” said James Angel, an associate professor at Georgetown University. “It’s a side bet on the future prospects of the company.” Additionally, the German Foundation Coin stated , Tokenization is powerful. But only if legal rights, settlement finality, and accountability are enforced on-chain, not just promised off-chain. Access and liquidity scale fast. Trust and enforceability don’t – unless they’re designed into the system.” Armstrong stated that Coinbase will establish an “everything app.” Earlier, Armstrong revealed that Coinbase is building an all-in-one exchange for everything from crypto to stocks and commodities in 2026. The plan positions Coinbase to challenge major brokerage firms and expand into new types of digital trading. The platform has also recently partnered with prediction market Kalshi . Last November, some images surfaced showing Coinbase testing a prediction market that allows users to trade with USDC or USD on topics such as politics, sports, and the economy. According to reports, Coinbase Financial Markets manages the offering, creating event contracts that are simple binary bets under Kalshi’s rules. Coinbase is also moving to produce tokenized shares internally, departing from rivals who depend on external partners. Robinhood and Kraken continue to utilize external partners for stock tokens in select jurisdictions, although U.S. users are currently unable to access them. So far, tokenized equity transfers have increased by nearly 76% over the last month, reaching around $2.46 billion, according to RWA.xyz. In December, Coinbase also announced plans to acquire The Clearing Company to strengthen its event-based trading offerings. Its agreement with the prediction platform will formally close this month. Following the acquisition, the Clearing Company’s staff will support Coinbase in expanding its prediction markets, with nearly all its 10 employees joining the exchange. The exchange has yet to confirm deal value, although it noted it will pay for the acquisition in both cash and Coinbase stock. The Clearing company’s executive, Gemayel, at the time told reporters that joining Coinbase gives them the chance to bring their knowledge to a bigger audience, emphasizing that prediction markets thrive on strong structure and broad distribution. Beyond the Clearing Company deal, Coinbase also revealed its deals with Roam, Spindl, Iron Fish, Deribit, Opyn Markets, Liquifi, Sensible, Echo, and Vector.fun, last year.

Spiegel’s statements place tokenization and digital assets at the center of the next phase of institutional finance, emphasizing that the industry is moving beyond experimentation and toward operational deployment. According to his remarks, clients are no longer satisfied with real-time access to data alone and are increasingly demanding the ability for assets and value to move instantly, a capability that traditional systems have yet to fully deliver. Spiegel noted that demand for always-on financial services is accelerating, particularly in emerging and fast-growing markets. He describes tokenization as a practical response to this shift, arguing that it introduces reliability and innovation that financial institutions can extend directly to their clients. In his words, digital finance is approaching a tipping point, with tokenized assets and digital instruments transitioning from pilot programs into mainstream use. $XRP : Standard Chartered's Michael Spiegel; head of transactions banking speaking at SIBOS 2025, key partners of Ripple and SWIFT ""The landscape of digital finance is at a tipping point, tokenization and digital assets are about to move from pilot into mainstream"" Ripple… https://t.co/NF8iMhds66 pic.twitter.com/R7WUI5d1Y6 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 9, 2026 Standard Chartered and Ripple’s Strategic Alignment The tweet further outlines the longstanding strategic relationship between Standard Chartered and Ripple , which dates back to 2016. This relationship has included direct investment and the use of Ripple’s technology to support cross-border payment solutions. Beyond operational use cases, Standard Chartered’s ventures arm has also been involved in several broader tokenization initiatives aligned with Ripple’s strategy. One cited example is participation by both institutions in Singapore’s Monetary Authority Project Guardian, a regulatory-led initiative focused on tokenized assets and market infrastructure. This involvement extends to tokenized deposit experiments for major clients, including Ant International, under programs targeting large Asian treasury operations. These initiatives reflect a coordinated approach to applying distributed ledger technology within regulated frameworks, rather than isolated proofs of concept. APAC as a Center for Tokenization Development According to the analysis shared in the tweet, the Asia-Pacific region is emerging as a primary environment for advancing tokenization . Regulatory conditions in several APAC jurisdictions are described as clearer and more supportive than in parts of the Western world, enabling faster progression from design to deployment. This regulatory clarity is viewed as a key factor allowing banks and infrastructure providers to test and scale tokenized financial products with institutional clients. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Effect on XRP and the Distributed Ledger Infrastructure The general objective described involves using distributed ledger technology to enable faster and more cost-efficient movement of value across borders . This includes exploration across multiple infrastructures, such as the XRP Ledger and SWIFT’s evolving consensus-based systems, either independently or in complementary roles. Within this context, assets such as XRP are increasingly discussed in relation to real-world asset tokenization and global settlement efficiency, rather than purely speculative use cases. Taken together, Spiegel’s remarks and the institutional partnerships highlighted suggest a coordinated push by major financial players to integrate tokenization into mainstream banking operations, with distributed ledger technology positioned as a foundational component of that transition.

According to the report, PlayStation Network may integrate XRP payments in the second quarter of 2026. While the information is explicitly framed as a rumor and has not been confirmed by Sony or PlayStation, it aligns with certain developments suggesting that major technology firms are increasingly exploring blockchain-based payment systems. The claim does not reference internal documents or official statements, but it indicates a potential shift in how PlayStation Network could handle digital transactions in the future. If accurate, such a move would represent one of the most prominent consumer-facing payment integrations involving XRP to date. RUMOR: PSN will integrate $XRP payments in Q2, 2026! pic.twitter.com/9nDUgKTWBC — Coinvo (@Coinvo) January 8, 2026 Context Within Sony’s Broader Blockchain Strategy The rumor emerges at a time when Sony has already signaled interest in blockchain infrastructure and digital payments. The company has acknowledged plans related to blockchain technology, including experimentation with digital assets and reports surrounding a possible Sony-backed stablecoin targeted for use across its ecosystem. While those initiatives have focused on stable, fiat-pegged assets rather than volatile cryptocurrencies, they indicate that Sony is actively evaluating alternatives to traditional payment rails. Coinvo’s report suggests that XRP, known for its fast settlement times and low transaction costs, could theoretically fit into a large-scale digital marketplace like PlayStation Network. However, no confirmation exists that XRP has been selected or formally evaluated by Sony for this purpose. Potential Implications for XRP Adoption If PlayStation Network were to support XRP payments, the implications for the asset’s visibility and usage could be significant. PlayStation Network serves a global user base numbering in the hundreds of millions, and even limited optional support for XRP could introduce the asset to a mainstream consumer audience. This would mark a shift from XRP’s current perception as primarily an institutional or cross-border settlement tool toward a broader consumer-facing utility. Such integration could also demonstrate XRP’s capacity to handle high transaction volumes efficiently, particularly for digital goods such as games, subscriptions, and downloadable content. Increased real-world usage, if sustained, could strengthen the narrative around XRP’s practicality as a payment-focused digital asset.

Sony and PlayStation have not issued any statements confirming plans to integrate XRP , nor have they acknowledged Coinvo’s claim. Regulatory considerations, price volatility, and user experience challenges would all need to be addressed before any such integration could realistically occur. Until official confirmation is provided, the rumor should be viewed as an indicator of market interest rather than a guaranteed development. Still, the claim underscores how expectations surrounding crypto payments continue to grow, particularly as major consumer platforms evaluate alternatives to legacy financial systems.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin mining difficulty dipped slightly in the first adjustment of 2026. Faster block times point to a difficulty increase later this month. Mining profitability remains under pressure despite the brief relief. The adjustment, completed Thursday, lowered difficulty to 146.4 trillion, reflecting modest changes in network conditions as the year begins. Bitcoin Difficulty Set to Rise After Blocks Run Faster Than Target Mining difficulty measures how hard it is to add a new block to Bitcoin’s blockchain and is recalibrated roughly every two weeks to keep block production close to the 10-minute target. At the time of the adjustment, average block times were running at about 9.88 minutes, slightly faster than the protocol’s goal. As a result, the next recalibration is expected to reverse course. Data from CoinWarz estimates the next adjustment on Jan. 22, which would lift difficulty to around 148.2 trillion. Despite the latest dip, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty remains historically elevated. The metric climbed steadily throughout 2025, reaching record levels before easing late in the year. Even after the most recent changes, difficulty remains below the all-time high of roughly 155.9 trillion set in November, but competition among miners remains intense. The elevated difficulty underscores the strain facing the mining sector following a difficult 2025. Miners endured what many described as the harshest margin environment on record, driven by the April 2024 halving that cut block rewards in half and by worsening macroeconomic conditions. A nonce is a changing value miners adjust within a block header to generate a hash below the difficulty threshold required by proof-of-work. Miners iterate billions of nonces per second while searching for a valid block hash. pic.twitter.com/n8p2vQjUT6 — American Bitcoin (@ABTC) January 11, 2026 Those pressures intensified during the crypto market downturn that began late last year. Profitability metrics reflected the squeeze. Miner hash price, which tracks expected revenue per unit of computing power, slipped below breakeven levels in November. Industry data shows the figure fell under $35 per petahash per second per day, well below the roughly $40 level many operators view as the threshold for sustainable operations. External factors compounded the challenge. New US tariffs introduced during President Donald Trump’s term raised concerns over mining equipment supply chains, while a sharp market sell-off in October triggered a broader crypto decline. Bitcoin prices dropped more than 30% in November, briefly falling to just above $80,000. Study Challenges Bitcoin Mining Energy Criticism Bitcoin mining can strengthen electrical grids and lower consumer electricity costs rather than strain power systems, according to a detailed analysis by independent researcher Daniel Batten. His research challenges common claims that mining destabilizes grids or drives up energy prices, drawing on peer-reviewed studies and operational data to argue that the industry’s flexible power usage can provide measurable system benefits. Meanwhile, Bitmain is cutting prices aggressively across multiple generations of Bitcoin mining hardware as pressure builds across the mining sector, according to recent promotional campaigns and internal price lists circulated to customers. One promotion dated Dec. 23 offered a package of four S19 XP+ Hydro units paired with an ANTRACK V2 container, implying an effective price of roughly $4 per terahash for the 19 J/TH machines.

Ripple’s native token was among the prime examples, as it skyrocketed by about 30% in less than a week from under $1.90 to a multi-month peak of $2.41. This came amid growing ETF inflows and declining token holdings on exchanges. However, this rally was halted, and the asset has slumped by 13% since then to $2.10 as of press time. According to Ali Martinez, there could be more pain on the horizon for the XRP bulls. He noted that the cross-border token could be printing a gravestone doji candle, warning that it’s “not a great look.” This setup is typically regarded as a bearish reversal candlestick pattern that looks like an upside-down “T.” It signals that the bulls’ push was rejected and could lead to a prolonged downtrend, especially if it follows an instant uptick, as it happened with XRP last week. $XRP appears to be printing a gravestone doji. Not a great look! pic.twitter.com/e5m4hf0lie — Ali Charts (@alicharts) January 10, 2026 The other warning sign for XRP’s price is related to the declining whale activity. CryptoPotato reported earlier this week, right after the token’s impressive price surge, that whale-sized XRP transfers had skyrocketed by double digits to their highest levels since October. Santiment warned that this could indicate the price movement at the time was most likely erratic and unsustainable, given the sudden rise in such transactions. More recent data shared by Martinez again shows a massive decline in this metric, which could spell further trouble for the underlying token. Whale activity on $XRP spiked to 433 transactions on January 6, but has since fallen to just 33. pic.twitter.com/6iuo55v7qk — Ali Charts (@alicharts) January 9, 2026 The post Ripple Price Warning: 2 Signals Suggest XRP’s Early 2026 Rally Is Running Out of Steam appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2026-01-11 07:27:30

Analysts Track This $0.05 Altcoin for 2026,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-next-cheap-crypto-to-15x-analysts-track-this-0-05-altcoin-for-2026/,"Traders are in search of the next altcoin with substantial returns in the next market cycle as it remains undervalued. It is anticipated that the next 15x candidate might not be recruited by the big caps, but by an inexpensive asset in its infancy. There is already a whale interest in one of the new cryptos that cost less than $0.5, with an initial presale interest and rising media attention. It is currently in the low valuation range, and it is only anticipating its primary mainnet release; hence, some investors are already positioning. This has led to a growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto protocol that is going to make its debut in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance proposes a dual lending framework that is based on a Peer to Contract and on a Peer to Peer markets. It is aimed at decentralizing credit markets and offering new means of access to yield and borrowing to users. The Peer to Contract market allows the user to lend and borrow via shared liquidity pools. Assets are deposited by the lenders in the pool and they are issued with mtTokens. Such mtTokens display the deposit size and yield with time. The interest rate varies depending on the use of a pool. The more borrowers borrow out the greater the APY to the lenders. As an illustration, a person providing 1,000 USDC is issued with the mtUSDC. In case borrowing demand increases, the yield of those mtUSDC increases. This model renders lending inactive and quick in cases where the borrower does not have to be directly matched with another user. The Peer to Peer also facilitates lending and borrowing; however, it pairs the lenders and borrowers together. Between them, terms like interest rate, collateral type and repayment schedule can be made. Loans are kept collateral and the loan to value regulations are put in place to make the system secure. In case the value of collateral falls below the necessary levels, there is a liquidation event. Some of the debt is repaid and discounted collaterals are given to liquidators. The process is beneficial in safeguarding the solvency and keeping the lenders covered even in the face of unstable price movements. Presale Information and Token Distribution Early investors have been highly attracted by the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. The fund has been increasing as each new stage has been launched, and now it stands at $19.7M. Over 18,800 participants have participated and the token has gone through various pricing rounds. Phase 1 MUTM was listed at $0.01, and currently trades at approximately 0.04 in Phase 7, which is approximately 300% higher than it traded at the time it was listed. There are 4 billion MUTM fixed supply tokens of Mutuum Finance. presale is allotted 45.5% of the supply. This equals 1.82 billion tokens. The presale is allocated in phases that have increasing prices. There is a special 24 hour leaderboard of new inflows and large buyers. The demand has remained high over several weeks and analysts reckon this is because of the launch utility and revenue of future protocol. The token price has been doing well in increasing the level of phase 1 to the present stage price. The token will list at a higher fixed price at launch which is already fixed in the documentation. This provides the instant valuation boost to the levels of the entry presale holders. Halborn Security Review and V1 Launch The Mutuum Finance gets ready to launch its V1 protocol. The launch of the V1 is a critical one as it brings in actual borrowing and lending flows into the system. This protocol starts to issue APY to the depositors of the mtToken and opens the access to the P2P borrowing. This first live version, according to analysts, is the main driver of valuation expansion. It provides the token operational utility and demand and not just presale speculation. Analyst projections have seen a 15x case within a reach in 2026 in case of continued adoption. They note that the token is not expensive compared to protocols that have similar designs and on-chain lending products. The lending markets depend on security because of collateral handling and liquidation mechanisms. Mutuum Finance has undergone a Halborn Security audit . Halborn is a reputable blockchain security company and the audit provides authority to the protocol prior to mainnet launch. According to analysts, this allows early users to reduce their smart contract concerns as well as heighten the confidence of institutional capital. Security validation in crypto markets can affect the inflow of liquidity and eventual adoption. Audited protocols are usually popular among investors prior to the deposit of funds or collateral.

I challenge Buffett's GOAT status, arguing his strategies thrived in a bygone era where value outperformed growth and technology was less dominant. BRK.B's performance has lagged the S&P 500 over the past 17 years, with a 445.77% total return versus the S&P's 554.84%. Buffett's inability to adapt to new market realities and innovation undermines his reputation for consistent outperformance. Common sense might suggest if you follow the advice of someone who was successful in the past, it will help you succeed too. But that's actually not always the case; sometimes you should try to do things differently than those who have achieved success in an outdated world, as adaptation to the modern world is essential. Recently retired Berkshire Hathaway ( BRK.A ) ( BRK.B ) CEO Warren Buffett is often called the "" GOAT "" (Greatest Of All Time) in investing, business, and capitalism by many financial commentators, pundits, CEOs, and investors, recognizing his unparalleled long-term success and influence in the financial world, as seen in headlines from several media sources, including CNBC, Yahoo Finance, Simply Wall Street, and others, along with numerous social media posts. Reasons he is called the GOAT: Long-Term Success: Warren Buffett's consistent, monumental, decades-long success in value investing and building Berkshire Hathaway and historical outperformance of the S&P 500 from 1965 to 2025. Wisdom & Guidance: He's seen as a source of immense financial wisdom, influencing many past, current, and upcoming generations of investors. Capitalism Icon: Figures like the Brooks Running CEO call him the ""GOAT of capitalism"" for his principles and accomplishments. Legacy: His impact is so remarkable that terms like ""Oracle of Omaha"" or ""Sage of Omaha"" also highlight his legendary status, but ""GOAT"" has become a very popular modern descriptor for his achievements. Berkshire Hathaway produced a 5 million percent return during Warren Buffett's 60-year reign as CEO. Let's Start by Admitting He's Actually Not the ""GOAT"" I would argue that this reputation, as the ""GOAT,"" is undeserved, unwarranted, overrated, and certainly no help to the modern-day investor looking to become as successful as him or replicate him in some way. Sure, Warren Buffett did some amazing things in his youth that led to Berkshire Hathaway's massive growth in early years, during a period where value outperformed growth, a period where conditions were just right for Warren's strategies to thrive... He may have been the ""greatest"" of his time, in the early days of Berkshire Hathaway, but all time? He has failed at adapting to new realities as growth, technology, innovation, social media, cryptocurrencies, and artificial intelligence have become major themes in today's world. His investing methods seem like they are stuck in the past, afraid of new ideas, change, technology, growth, and innovation. His approach has become, in my opinion, so narrow-minded that he's incapable of thinking outside the box and entertaining nontraditional ideas. However, we can certainly learn from Warren's mistakes, study what he did wrong, and become more prepared to invest in the future, using methods that Warren Buffett would never touch and developing a deeper imagination and thought process of what achievements are possible going forward. Berkshire Hathaway Versus the S&P 500: A Changing Dynamic Berkshire Hathaway had outperformed the S&P 500 over every 5-year period for many years, until 2008-2013 came along, where it underperformed for the first time. In Berkshire's 2013 annual shareholder letter , he wrote, ""Over the stock market cycle between year-ends 2007 and 2013, we overperformed the S&P. Through full cycles in future years, we expect to do that again. If we fail to do so, we will not have earned our pay."" So he was stretching the goalpost from 5 years to 6 to define (or redefine) what constitutes a 'full market cycle.' But his prediction/expectation that Berkshire would (perhaps consistently) outperform the S&P 500 over full-market cycles didn't really pan out the way he suggested in that letter. Over the past 17 years (2008-2025), the S&P 500 outperformed Berkshire Hathaway by a margin of 554.84% to 445.77% (when accounting for reinvested dividends). Granted, in his 2015 annual shareholder letter, Warren Buffett did clarify that, due to Berkshire Hathaway's immense size, ""I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won't be great,""... So he admitted there wouldn't be significant outperformance (like in Berkshire Hathaway's early years) but still seemed to imply there would be mild outperformance. I don't think that mild outperformance really ever came to fruition, although it depends on which time period you're looking at, as Berkshire Hathaway did outperform the S&P 500 over the past five years, but not the past three, ten, or seventeen. What we learned about Berkshire Hathaway's expected future performance going forward: We can say that this mild outperformance over the S&P 500 may happen over some periods but is no longer happening consistently and reliably, as it did before 2013. And periods of underperformance may last a long time, such as ten to seventeen years, or even longer, especially in a growth environment. The ""Greatest (Investor) of All Time"" Told Us to ""Stay Away"" From the Greatest Investment of All Time A $1 investment in Bitcoin ( BTC ), ( IBIT ), or ( FBTC ) in 2010 would have grown to over $1.62 million in 2025. While exact estimates vary, sources indicate that Bitcoin's return since its inception in 2009 to the present day represents millions of percentage gains, with some sources citing over 9 million percent or even 162 million percent returns from its earliest days. (Bitcoin generated a higher return than Berkshire Hathaway's 5 million percent gain (which took 60 years) in about one-fourth of the time or less). The fact is, Bitcoin has outperformed every asset or stock in history, including Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, Amazon, Google, and Berkshire Hathaway, since its inception in 2009. It's a numerical fact. Bitcoin first delivered a 100x return within a few months in 2011. (before it was very well-known). After gaining widespread media attention for the first time around 2013 at $100/coin, it delivered another 100x return within four years, to $10,000/coin in 2017. So this took about four years (2013-2017). By contrast, it took Berkshire Hathaway somewhere around two decades (after Buffett took over in 1965) to deliver its first 100x return, from $19 to $1900. Warren Buffett made his first of many anti-Bitcoin comments in an interview on CNBC in March 2014, when it was trading around $600 at the time, telling investors to ""stay away"" from Bitcoin, calling it a ""mirage."" (After this interview, Bitcoin did go down to the $200 range for a little while in 2015, but this correction proved to be quite temporary, as it came back stronger and soared to new heights in 2017). In 2018, Warren Buffett said , ""In terms of cryptocurrencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending."" While Bitcoin did have a lot of volatility along the way, I don't think such a ""bad ending"" really ever materialized, considering that Bitcoin is trading much higher today than when Warren Buffett made this statement and has gained a lot of mainstream acceptance (such as the creation of spot ETFs and the U.S. creating a Strategic Bitcoin reserve). I believe Warren's failure to identify this opportunity and telling investors to ""stay away"" from it is a big stain on his legacy and reflects an old mind stuck in the past, unwilling and unable to think outside the box and adapt to a new reality. The numbers speak for themselves; Bitcoin's 16-year return exceeded Berkshire Hathaway's 60-year return. The lesson here: When you see a new, untested idea, you should try to imagine and entertain the possibilities for it, even if such a reality might seem crazy, silly, and far-fetched at first glance. Bitcoin is not a ""mirage,"" and it's not something to ""stay away from."" It's a fast-growing and increasingly mainstream part of our modern world's economy, widely seen as a digital version of gold , with characteristics like scarcity, decentralization, durability, fungibility, divisibility, portability, a store of value, and maybe, to some extent, a currency. (Although I'm not big on using the term 'currency,' as its ability to grow isn't totally dependent on being accepted as payment with mainstream retailers.) It's also widely seen as "" The People's Money, "" or money that is resistant to government control. Bitcoin deserves a place in every diversified portfolio. A Presidential Bet While I don't normally write about politics on this platform, I would like to discuss a time when Warren Buffett spoke about a big political event and demonstrated that he refuses to entertain nontraditional ideas. Warren Buffett never made public predictions about political election outcomes before...until that changed one day: In October 2014, Warren Buffett was a featured guest speaker at Fortune's Most Powerful Women summit, and he said he would ""bet money"" on Hillary Clinton winning the 2016 presidential election (before she even announced her candidacy). He added, ""I will bet money, and I don't do that easily."" He repeated this prediction a few times throughout the election campaign season (at one point hedging a little, saying she will win as long as she stays healthy), and he turned out to be wrong. She was healthy, she was not under criminal indictment, she was on the ballot as expected, and she lost the electoral college by a vote of the people. While it's unknown if Warren Buffett really did bet any money on this, he may have influenced his fans and followers to do so. These ' prediction markets ' do trade like a stock. Hillary Clinton was the establishment candidate, and Donald Trump was certainly a nontraditional candidate. The fact that Warren Buffett was unable to entertain the possibility of a nontraditional candidate winning, in my opinion, shows that Buffett's philosophy was very narrow-minded, unable to think outside the box and imagine a different reality...similar to how Warren has been known to avoid investing in disruptive and revolutionary technology among his stock picks within Berkshire Hathaway. The Lesson: From this presidential bet, we should learn to imagine the possibilities of strange things coming true. We should not be stuck in the mindset that the traditional and 'normal' events will transpire the way we expect. Instead, we should be prepared for nontraditional, exotic, crazy, strange, and chaotic events to become reality and react accordingly. We should expect a 'truth is stranger than fiction' kind of world, because strange things have already happened that may not have previously seemed possible. That goes for stocks, politics, technological developments, and personal goals in daily life. Although we should still balance this type of thinking with realistic expectations, I believe that the level of what should be considered 'realistic' has expanded into a broader universe. Late to the Party on World-Changing Technology Granted, I will give Buffett credit for investing in Apple ( AAPL ) in 2016 and Google/Alphabet ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) in 2025, but his followers and investors should be very disappointed that he waited so long to do so. Apple did go up about 10x since 2016, but if he bought around 2006 or 2007, he could've been looking at a 100x return. In 2012, Buffett flat-out said he wouldn't buy Apple or Google. He was more interested in IBM ( IBM ), his first major technology investment, which he bought in 2011, which didn't perform very well around that time and lost a lot of value from 2012 to 2015 before he eventually sold it in 2017 and 2018. Buffett actually did learn something from his IBM mistake. He bought it because he thought it would be difficult for large corporations to switch from IBM for their critical IT needs, creating a possible moat around their business. However, he learned to focus less on 'stable but stagnant' enterprise tech and more on disruptive, consumer-centric technology with powerful branding. He finally realized that enduring moats in tech come from an ecosystem lock-in and brand loyalty rather than just enterprise necessity. It was his mistake at IBM that may have contributed to him investing in Apple later on in 2016. While it's nice to see he finally came around to buying Apple and (later on) Google, this falls under the category of 'better late than never.' Especially considering that in 2015, Google morphed into Alphabet , a conglomerate of sorts, taking a page out of Berkshire Hathaway's playbook, structured to maximize good allocation and reinvestment of capital and foster transparency of income streams and operational costs, not too dissimilar from Berkshire Hathaway's structure. You'd think Warren Buffett could've appreciated that and taken a hint from it. Utilizing a conglomerate structure is what contributed to Berkshire Hathaway's success, as it created benefits such as diversification, decentralized management, and a powerful system for appropriate capital allocation in financing. Not many companies have replicated Berkshire Hathaway's success using this model, although Google's decision to use this model and apply it to a very different type of company should've definitely caught Warren's attention. Around 2017, Warren Buffett even admitted that he made a mistake by missing out on Google and Amazon ( AMZN ), and similar comments were echoed by Berkshire's Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, in 2019 (more so focused on Google than Amazon). Yet even after admitting that, they still waited until 2025 to buy stock in Google/Alphabet. That seems very slow and sluggish on their part. From the date Warren Buffett first admitted he made a mistake missing out on Google (May 8, 2017) to the date Berkshire finally bought Alphabet stock in Q3 2025, Alphabet returned about 300% to the S&P 500's 200%. The Lesson: Have some appreciation for new technology and its capabilities, even if you don't fully understand them at first glance. Realize that the power of an ecosystem with strong brand loyalty is very mighty, a true moat, and it's not enough of a moat just for your technology to be 'necessary' or hard to switch away from. It's also important to pay attention to fast-changing events and capitalize on them by acting early. And when a company transforms into a conglomerate, study the benefits of why such a structure would be good for that company. And when you admit you made a mistake by missing out, act quickly to correct that mistake rather than waiting. Resistant to innovation and missing out on modern trends Berkshire Hathaway also missed out on some of the other, most revolutionary technology companies that changed our world and reflect new trends, such as NVIDIA ( NVDA ), Facebook/Meta ( META ), Netflix ( NFLX ), and Tesla ( TSLA ). It's as if Berkshire is afraid to go near innovative companies that change the way we do things, challenge tradition, break mainstream norms, and reflect new trends in human behavior. Lesson: Have some appreciation for new and different kinds of innovative, scalable companies that may represent a significant part of a modern, dynamic economy. Don't be afraid to get educated and learn more about a new or strange idea, and keep up with modern trends and changes in daily human lives. Underperforming Blue Chips Warren Buffett's investments (through Berkshire Hathaway) have usually focused around large, mega-cap blue chips that were very mature companies but lacked the growth and momentum necessary to outperform the S&P 500. Wells Fargo ( WFC ) was once Berkshire's #1 holding in its stock portfolio, surpassing Coca-Cola ( KO ) for the spot in Q4 2012. Both Wells Fargo and Coca-Cola significantly underperformed the S&P 500 for many years while being a large part of Berkshire's stock investments. In 2013, Warren Buffett purchased stock in Exxon Mobil ( XOM ), only to sell it in Q4 2014 after a period of underperformance. Warren also invested in Kraft Heinz ( KHC ), which has been underperforming over the past decade. Warren made his first major technology investment in 2011 when he bought IBM, but this was the wrong kind of technology. IBM underperformed because it failed to adapt to the rapid shift in cloud computing, unable to keep up with competitors, leading to a decline in revenues and stalled earnings. Lesson: Avoid companies that fail to change and adapt quickly and have a slowing rate of growth. It's okay to invest in 'mature' companies if they know how to adapt, build strong ecosystems with impressive brand loyalty, and are showing strong revenue growth. It's time to realize we're no longer living in a value-oriented world. Great returns are achieved through growth and technology stocks. Airline Fumble - Twice Warren Buffett decided to invest in the airlines twice. In 1989 and 2016. Neither time went well. After losing so much money on his 1989 investment in USAir, he sold in 1994 and confessed in his shareholder letter that he made a mistake in buying the airlines. You'd think he would not fall for this same trap again, but he did in 2016. His changing view around 2016 was likely a result of the airline industry consolidating, with less competition. This consolidation actually began around 2013 , as CNBC host Jim Cramer famously turned bullish on the airlines for the first time in over a decade due to the unprecedented situation. In 2013, Warren Buffett didn't flinch at first; he still called the airlines a "" death trap ."" However, in 2016, Warren Buffett changed his views on this and invested in the four major airlines: American Airlines ( AAL ), Delta Air Lines ( DAL ), Southwest Airlines ( LUV ), and United Airlines (UAL). The airline stocks actually performed well in 2013 as Cramer started recommending them in the early innings of the industry transformation...but this momentum didn't last into the following years. In 2020, the airlines crashed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Warren Buffett then sold his stake in the airlines at a huge loss and admitted that the airlines have all the ingredients of a bad business. It wasn't just the legacy airlines that lost tremendous value, but smaller, more disruptive airlines as well, such as Spirit Airlines ( SAVEQ ), JetBlue ( JBLU ), and Alaska Air Group ( ALK ). None of the airlines were spared. Warren Buffett's long-time friend , Microsoft ( MSFT ) Founder and former Chairman, Bill Gates, famously gave a ' Ted Talk ' in 2015, warning that a global pandemic could happen some day. Warren should've understood the risks of that when investing in the airlines. I would think that the ""greatest of all time"" should've had a better handle on this: being able to learn from past mistakes, not investing in the wrong kind of business, being able to listen to Bill Gates' perspective on this, and being able to better identify the dangers of what might happen in a changing traveling economy. He should've understood that airlines really do make a lousy business because they have high fixed and variable costs and vulnerability to exogenous events. There's also a perception that the airlines have poor service, cramped seating, and inconvenient schedules, which makes it difficult for airlines to raise prices to a level that would be necessary to return to profitability. Warren should've been aware of this. Making the same mistake with the airlines not once, but twice, was certainly not very diligent. Learning and adapting from past mistakes is essential to a solid investing plan and philosophy. The Lesson: Pay attention to how flawed a certain business like the airlines can be, gather a better understanding of the risks of something you invest in, and pay attention to possible catastrophe scenarios (like a pandemic) that could change the fundamentals of a business very quickly. If something goes wrong the first time, don't repeat the same mistakes again. And for heaven's sake, never invest in the airlines, regardless of how few competitors there are in the space. An oligopoly cannot fix a flawed business or a flawed industry. A True and Genuine ""GOAT"" Wouldn't Have Made These Errors I do not believe Warren Buffett earned his reputation as ""the greatest of all time."" I know many of you are likely to respond, ""He's not perfect."" Well, I'm not asking for perfection, but I still think he let us down in ways that were beneath the honor and reputation of the ""GOAT"" title and unbecoming of that title, given the nature of these mistakes and how these mistakes demonstrated a tendency to think inside a closed box rather than thinking outside the box. I know these aren't the only mistakes he made, and I could probably write a much longer article covering more of them, but I'm not trying to write a laundry list of errors. Rather, I am documenting the mistakes I believe to be the most significant, unreasonable, and perhaps mistakes we can learn valuable lessons from in teachable moments. A True and Genuine ""GOAT"" Should Help You Do More Than Just Keep Up With the Averages Granted, I appreciate that Warren sometimes gives decent basic advice to average investors, like investing in a Vanguard S&P 500 index fund ( VOO ). (and that actually is good advice)... But the ""greatest of all time,"" if that title is legit, should be able to provide investors with advice that will help them outperform the S&P 500 and beat the averages. We Can Change What It Means to Be the ""GOAT"" While I am disappointed in the ways Mr. Buffett has let us down, and the investing community's unbelievable willingness to forgive, look past, and continue calling him the ""GOAT"" after all the fumbles and mistakes he made, I do think we can learn something from Warren Buffett's life and career: that we should not follow his lead and instead be open-minded to innovation, technology, and nontraditional ideas. Think outside the box and imagine new possibilities. I agree with Warren Buffett that VOO should be a part of every diversified portfolio. I also believe Bitcoin should be included in every diversified portfolio; that's something Warren will never advise you to do. But it's time to quit listening to Mr. Buffett and use some more modern and innovative logic in our investing decisions to reflect changing trends today. Summary A sensible investor should never follow any ""guru"" into any position. Blindly copying or coat-tailing others will make you vulnerable to making errors. Within reason, expand your ability and willingness to take absurd, wild, and ridiculous ideas and memes seriously, and don't laugh them off. Crazy ideas start off as jokes...until they aren't. People laugh at them until they don't. Many investors failed to take Bitcoin seriously. Many pundits failed to take a Trump victory seriously. A 'truth is stranger than fiction' scenario occurred, and now these 'jokes' aren't so funny anymore. Granted, expanding your ability to take wild ideas seriously does come with significant risk; you could lose up to 100% of your investment. I wouldn't advise risking a large portion of your portfolio on something 'silly,' but keep in mind that, if an investment grows 1000x, as Bitcoin did from 2012 to 2017, it would only take about a $1,000 investment to grow into $1 million. So in that context, perhaps it's possible to make an enormous amount of profit while only risking a small portion of your portfolio. Warren Buffett once said , ""Never invest in something you don't understand,"" leading him to miss out on many disruptive, revolutionary, and innovative technology investments. But the lesson here is if you don't understand something, you should make a stronger effort to educate yourself about it and have a broader imagination of what's possible to achieve. Historically, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks by an average of 4.4% annually since 1927. It's easy to say we should follow history, but history reflects a time when technology was a much smaller part of our economy. Today, technology and artificial intelligence are much bigger contributors. It's time to have a growth-oriented and tech-oriented strategy to deliver outperformance. When a business as fundamentally flawed as the airlines may change in a way where it becomes less competitive in nature, don't fall for it. Some flawed industries are destined to remain flawed forever, and an oligopoly or monopoly-type situation can only do so much to change that. If you have developed a successful track record, and you have a large following of fans who trust your words and listen to your wisdom, you don't have to opine on everything. If you are asked about a topic you're unsure about, sometimes staying quiet or neutral, not opining on such a topic, is the best and most appropriate course of action. However, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to study and learn about the topic to gain a better understanding of it.",AAPL|GOOG|GOOGL|VOO|IBIT|DAL|LUV|UAL|FBTC|AAL|BRK.A|BRK.B|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2026-01-11 07:50:55

The post centers on Birla’s view that XRP was designed primarily for real-time, regulated payments rather than for speculative investment narratives or congestion-prone smart contract ecosystems. According to the account, Birla emphasized a clear distinction between assets built to support institutional-grade financial infrastructure and those oriented toward store-of-value themes or experimental application layers. The remarks were delivered during an appearance on Paul Barron’s show, where Birla discussed his familiarity with XRP and its role in earlier products he helped develop. He presented XRP as a foundational component in systems designed to enhance the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments, describing it as technology created with practical financial use cases in mind from the outset. Evernorth CEO Asheesh Birla: #XRP is built for real-time regulated payments, not just investment narratives like BTC, and not congestion-heavy smart contract ecosystems like ETH. pic.twitter.com/SUvTqMsPr1 — Skipper | XRPL (@skipper_xrp) January 8, 2026 Early Design Choices and Institutional Utility Birla explained that XRP’s original architecture reflected a payments-first mindset. He referenced its transaction speed and its suitability for settlement use, noting that these characteristics were not later additions but core design goals. He also pointed to the early inclusion of a built-in decentralized exchange mechanism, describing it as a liquidity engine that anticipated real-world financial requirements well before similar features became common elsewhere in the digital asset sector. In his view, these design decisions, dating back more than a decade, positioned XRP to support institutional-grade products rather than experimental or consumer-focused applications. He suggested that many newer projects now attempt to replicate elements that were already present in XRP’s early development, particularly those related to liquidity and efficient value transfer. Regulation and the Global Payments Market A central theme highlighted in Skipper’s post was Birla’s emphasis on regulation. He argued that succeeding in global foreign exchange and payments markets requires more than a standalone digital asset. Instead, it demands infrastructure that can operate within existing regulatory frameworks while delivering speed and reliability at scale. Birla indicated that regulatory clarity surrounding XRP played a significant role in his assessment of its suitability for enterprise use, presenting it as a practical choice rather than a speculative one. According to his comments, this regulatory alignment reduces uncertainty for institutions seeking to integrate blockchain-based solutions into compliant financial products. He framed this clarity as a decisive factor when evaluating which technologies can realistically support global payment flows. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Deliberate Focus on Financial Transformation Birla also contrasted his priorities with other areas of the digital asset market. While acknowledging the broad range of use cases across the sector, from highly speculative tokens to entertainment-driven applications, he made it clear that his interest lies in initiatives aimed at improving the financial system itself. His stated focus remains on building tools that address real inefficiencies in payments and foreign exchange rather than engaging with short-term trading trends. Overall, the post portrays Birla’s perspective as one grounded in long-term infrastructure development. By emphasizing XRP’s original design goals, institutional orientation, and regulatory positioning, the commentary reinforces the view that its primary role is tied to real-world financial utility rather than investment-driven narratives.

The exchange predicted that 2026 will be a significant year in the crypto industry, with expansion in stablecoins, altcoins, and Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Mercado Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency exchange platform in Latin America, has published a report outlining potential growth trends in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The report highlighted six major trends that are expected to shape the cryptocurrency market this year. Mercado Bitcoin projects significant growth in the crypto industry this year The São Paulo-based cryptocurrency exchange highlighted that significant developments in the crypto industry will occur in stablecoins, ETFs, Altcoins, AI-powered trading activities, and tokenization. According to the report, the exchange anticipates substantial growth for Bitcoin in 2026. It highlighted that BTC’s market capitalization will more than double by the end of 2026, to meet 14% of gold’s total market capitalization. The prediction was derived from a valuation methodology developed in collaboration with researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The report noted that the valuation model capitalizes on the Total Addressable Market (TAM) approach, among other methods, to estimate Bitcoin’s theoretical value, using gold as the primary benchmark instead of relying on traditional cash flow models. According to the report , Bitcoin is primarily viewed as a store of value, similar to gold. However, the digital asset has more advantages compared to gold, which faces logistical challenges and storage hurdles. The report identified a growing trend among institutions that now view Bitcoin as a better store of value compared to gold, due to its characteristics as a borderless and self-custodial asset. Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. alone have $116.86 billion in net assets under management, equivalent to 6.48% of the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization. The report also outlined significant growth in the stablecoin infrastructure. The exchange predicted that the market capitalization of this sector will reach $500 billion by the end of the year. According to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator, stablecoins have a combined market capitalization of $311.674 billion as of the time of this publication. The Brazilian exchange emphasized that stablecoins play a crucial role as a source of liquidity for the sector, evolving from trading tools into payment instruments across countries and sectors. The exchange cited the stablecoin growth in 2025, which increased nearly 50% year-over-year. The report attributed the growth to regulatory developments that have provided clarity to stablecoin issuance and usage. Cryptopolitan reported in June last year that the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act, which became the first-ever U.S. law to regulate stablecoin issuers. XRP and Solana ETFs will account for 80% of inflows in Altcoin ETFs MB projected that Altcoin ETFs will stand out in 2026. The exchange flagged altcoin funds tied to XRP, Chainlink, and Solana as top ETF altcoins that have been attracting institutional capital since their debut. Data from SosoValue, an ETF tracking website, shows that XRP ETFs now have $1.47 billion in net assets under management, which is equivalent to 1.16% of the total XRP market cap. The data also shows that these funds have witnessed consistent inflows since November 14 and have only witnessed negative flows on January 7. Solana ETFs also crossed the $1 billion mark in net assets under management and now hold 1.43% of SOL’s total market cap. The exchange’s report estimates that altcoin ETFs will grow to $10 billion by the end of the year and projects that Solana and XRP will account for 80% of the total inflows. The exchange’s report identified tokenization of real-world assets as a significant sector and estimated its growth will surpass $54 billion, increasing by 200%. MB researchers believe the sector has attracted institutional interest, with major firms such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton launching their own tokenized funds. In the report, MB also projected that the prediction market will expand by more than 25X, with platforms such as Kalshi and Polymarket leading the pack. The forecast indicates that capital influx in these markets may reach $20 billion by year-end. MB also expects blockchain-powered AI agents to make significant contributions to the development of crypto ecosystems. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Key Takeaways: Tennessee ordered Kalshi, Polymarket and Crypto.com to halt sports-related contracts and issue refunds by Jan. 31, 2026. Regulators allege the platforms are offering unlicensed sports wagering in violation of state law. Failure to comply could result in steep fines and potential criminal referrals. In cease-and-desist letters filed on January 9 , the Tennessee Sports Wagering Council (SWC) directed the three companies to immediately halt sports event contracts offered to Tennessee customers, void all existing contracts entered into by state residents, and refund all customer funds by January 31, 2026. Tennessee Regulator Accuses Prediction Markets of Unlicensed Sports Wagering The regulator accused the platforms of operating unlicensed sports wagering products in violation of the Tennessee Sports Gaming Act. In a letter addressed to Polymarket, SWC Executive Director Mary Beth Thomas wrote that the company’s sports event contracts fail to meet state consumer protection standards and pose “an immediate and significant threat to the public interest of Tennessee.” Nearly identical language appeared in the letters sent to Kalshi and Crypto.com’s North American Derivatives Exchange. All three platforms are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as designated contract markets, allowing them to list event-based derivatives nationwide. The companies have argued that federal oversight preempts state gambling laws, though courts have issued mixed rulings on where federal authority ends and state jurisdiction begins. C&D to Polymarket: pic.twitter.com/OuinQf8AD4 — Daniel Wallach (@WALLACHLEGAL) January 9, 2026 The enforcement action comes as activity on prediction markets continues to expand. Polymarket re-entered the US market last year following its $112 million acquisition of derivatives exchange and clearinghouse QCX and began opening its US app to waitlisted users in December. The Tennessee action appears to be the first publicly disclosed state-level cease-and-desist order specifically targeting Polymarket, which currently offers only sports-related contracts to US users. Tennessee’s letters outline escalating penalties for noncompliance, including civil fines of up to $25,000 per violation. More significantly, the regulator warned that continued violations could trigger criminal referrals. Under Tennessee law, gambling promotion can carry misdemeanor or felony charges, depending on severity. State Opposition to Prediction Markets Builds Over Consumer, Tax Concerns State opposition to prediction markets has been building for months. In 2025, the SWC urged the CFTC to prohibit sports event contracts, arguing that such products bypass state safeguards such as age verification, responsible gaming rules and anti-money laundering requirements. Tennessee officials have also warned that prediction markets threaten tax revenue generated by licensed sportsbooks. The letters were copied to Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, who has backed other states in legal challenges against Kalshi. As reported, a new legislation to limit the interactions between government officials and the prediction markets is being supported by more than 30 Democrats in the US House of Representatives, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The lure behind new restrictions is a controversial Polymarket bet, which started as a bet of $32,000 but eventually became more than $400,000 shortly before the unexpected detention of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The bill proposed by the New York Representative Ritchie Torres is the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026.

The North American Derivatives Exchange of Crypto.com, Polymarket, and Kalshi received letters dated January 9 from the Tennessee Sports Wagering Council. The letters demanded that the companies, which operate under federal CFTC supervision, must cease operations in Tennessee, nullify open contracts, and return user deposits by January 31st. The Tennessee letters demanded that failure to comply may result in criminal referrals for aggravated gambling promotion, a felony under state law, as well as civil penalties of up to $25,000 per infraction. Tennessee threatened a variety of sanctions for failure to comply. The Tennessee Sports Gaming Act allows the SWC to sanction anybody who offers wagers without a state license $10,000 for the first crime, $15,000 for the second, and $25,000 for successive infractions. Additionally, the regulator threatened to file a request in state court for injunctive action. Tennessee challenges CFTC-regulated platforms over unlicensed sports contracts If it's Friday, it must be Tennessee issing cease-and-desist orders against @Kalshi , @Polymarket and @cryptocom https://t.co/rmUzOhoTE8 — Bill Speros (@billsperos) January 10, 2026 The Tennessee Sports Wagering Council (SWC) accused all three companies of unlawfully selling sports wagering goods under the pretense of event contracts. The companies are currently registered as designated contract markets with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), allowing consumers to purchase contracts based on the results of sporting events. However, any organization that takes bets on athletic events is required to have a state-issued license under Tennessee’s Sports Gaming Act. The SWC said none of the three firms has one. Accordingly, the letters declare that the contracts offered for sporting events constitute wagers under the Act and are being sold illegally in violation of Tennessee law and regulations. In the letter to Polymarket, SWC Executive Director Mary Beth Thomas stated, “The sports event contracts offered on Polymarket’s exchange are not compliant with these Tennessee state consumer protections and many others and are an immediate and significant threat to the public interest of Tennessee.” The language used in the letters to Crypto.com and Kalshi was almost identical. Market activity on Kalshi and Polymarket continues to rise, despite the persistence of legal disputes. Polymarket reentered the U.S. market after acquiring derivatives exchange and clearinghouse QCX for $112 million during the summer. In December, it started making its U.S. app available to waitlisted users, though the firm hasn’t made a public relaunch. States intensify crackdown on prediction markets despite federal oversight States have frequently pursued these platforms, even though they operate lawfully under federal derivatives legislation. In December of last year, Cryptopolitan reported that Connecticut issued three cease-and-desist orders against Crypto.com, Kalshi, and Robinhood. The Department of Consumer Protection (DCP) Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli ordered the platforms to immediately cease advertising, marketing, offering, or otherwise making available contracts or any other type of unauthorized online gaming to Connecticut citizens. Cafferelli accused Kalshi, Crypto.com, and Robinhood of conducting unlicensed online gambling, more specifically, sports wagering. Cafferelli claimed that even if they were licensed, their contracts would violate several other state rules and regulations, including those that prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from gambling. “These platforms are operating outside of a regulatory environment, posing a serious risk to consumers who may not realize that wagers placed on these illegal platforms offer no protection for their money or information. A prediction market wager is not an investment.” – Kris Gilman , Gaming Director, DCP. In another Cryptopolitan report, Kalshi encountered similar enforcement actions in other states last year, including Arizona, Illinois, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, Maryland, and Ohio. On April 3, Illinois casino authorities ordered Kalshi to stop offering sports betting prediction markets. Kalshi’s contracts, according to Illinois casino officials, amount to unlawful sports betting under state law. Arizona’s gambling authority joined the state-by-state campaign against prediction markets on May 22 in response to the event contracts of Kalshi and others for sports and other markets. Kalshi and Crypto.com received a cease-and-desist notice from the Arizona Department of Gaming (ADG). Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

57063958,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=892840,1768121123,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57063958.jpeg,"Federal, state scrutiny grows on crypto ATMs after $333M in scam losses",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/federal-state-actions-mounting-crypto-atms/,"Americans have now lost over $333 million to crypto ATM scams, and the FBI says $240 million of that vanished just in the first six months of 2025, which is double what people lost in H1 2024. Spokane Police Detective Tim Schwering has been dealing with this since 2023.“Cases started flowing my way where people were getting ripped off by cryptocurrency machines,” Tim said. The money was always gone in minutes, and would allegedly end up in China, Russia, Nigeria, or some other country where no one could get it back. “You couldn’t get to anyone or get the money back,” he said. He watched people’s entire savings disappear. Scams hit hard in local communities, seniors targeted first Tim said one man lost $900,000 using a crypto ATM down the street. At least two others lost everything and then ended their lives. Most of them were older, lonely, or scared. Scammers pretended to be lovers, government agents, or even IRS officers. They’d say someone was in trouble. Then they’d say the only way out was to deposit money ($40,000, maybe more) into a crypto ATM . That was it. When Tim saw how bad it was getting, he started visiting nursing homes and local community centers. He’d explain how these scams work and try to stop people from falling for them. “My job is to try to protect people, and it’s very frustrating,” he said. The scammers were always far away. “So, we could at least change policy,” he added. Spokane Councilman Paul Dillon picked it up from there. He tried for a state ban first. That didn’t go anywhere. “We wanted to see what levers we could pull locally,” Paul said. He pushed for a city-wide ban. “The compelling stories moved us into action,” he said. The council didn’t even argue. They passed it unanimously. The rule kicked in back in June, and shops were given a little time to get rid of the machines. Crypto ATM bans expand beyond Spokane as fraud spreads Spokane wasn’t the first. Stillwater, Minnesota had already passed a similar law. Paul said, “We’ve received no complaints about the removal.” Now he wants the state to try again next session, before the machines just start showing up in nearby towns. Tim says a federal ban would be better, but Paul doesn’t think that’ll happen anytime soon under President Trump’s current crypto policies. Spokane’s too close to Idaho anyway, just a 20-minute drive away. As long as states don’t act together, scammers can just move across borders. Meanwhile, other places like Arizona, Arkansas, Vermont, and St. Paul are looking at bans or tighter rules. And yes, a CNN report confirmed crypto ATMs are still popping up in Circle K stores across the U.S. Some crypto people aren’t happy. Alex Davis, who runs a blockchain company called Mavryk, says removing the machines won’t stop fraud. “Eliminating them may reduce certain fraud vectors, but it also removes one of the last public-access tools for financial privacy and cash-to-crypto conversion,” he said. Alex added that crypto ATMs still exist because regular banks don’t work for everyone. A lot of folks still use cash or have no bank access at all. Sure transaction fees are sky-high at 10 percent or more, but that’s the price they pay for fast, private access, said Alex. Jared Strasser, who helps run The Crypto Company, said these machines mostly serve a small group now. He said they used to be one of the only ways into crypto back in the day. That’s changed, but some people still need them. “That doesn’t eliminate the use case for others,” Jared said, “but it explains why these machines serve a narrower, more transactional audience.” They’re also perfect for scammers, because the money moves fast and can’t be undone. Lawyers say crypto ATMs in America a bigger banking problem Lev Breydo, a law professor at William & Mary, thinks the machines point to a deeper mess. “BTMs reflect the intersection of folks locked out of the mechanics of the financial system,” Lev said. He’s not wrong. People who don’t trust banks or can’t use them go to crypto. The U.S. is one of the few countries that let crypto ATMs thrive legally. 80 percent of all crypto ATMs on the planet are in America. That’s not because of innovation. That’s because the system’s broken. Lev said the U.S. let these machines plug into payday lenders, check-cashing shops, and money transmitters. They were never really integrated into banking, just bolted onto whatever was already there, which is why they’re everywhere. Jared said all bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. have to follow KYC and AML rules, checking who’s using them and report anything shady under the Bank Secrecy Act. But of course scammers still find ways in. Back in Spokane, Tim isn’t done. He still checks for crypto ATMs in local businesses. If he finds one, they get a citation. He said some victims still refuse to believe it’s a scam. One woman kept sending money to a man she thought loved her, even after her family begged her to stop. Tim traced it all to Nigeria. A year later, she had sent him $250,000. “Some people will continue throwing good money after bad,” he said. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The criminal, identified as Tianze Zhang, was arrested in Taiwan after attempting to flee the country by boat to the Philippines. According to authorities, the incident began on March 16, 2022, after a masked man broke into the home of Yuchen Shi while she was alone. The man was welding a knife, covering his face with a balaclava, ski goggles, and blue surgical gloves, threatening to harm her if she made a sound or alerted authorities. The criminal forced her to sit on a chair, zip-tied her to the chair, and issued more threats. He didn’t want cash or jewelry; instead, he wanted her to give up her digital assets . Taiwanese police arrest suspect linked to home invasion Throughout the ordeal, the masked man did not speak to his victim, but instead relied on an iPad, typing his demands in it and holding it up for Shi to read and comply. She eventually conceded to his request, logging into her wallet, and moving $3 million in digital assets into a wallet that belonged to the suspected criminal. After the transfer was complete, Shi mentioned that the man grabbed her phone and disappeared. The San Francisco police were alerted after the ordeal, with the department sending an inspector to the house. What started as a small home invasion soon ballooned into an international manhunt involving the SFPD’s burglary and CSI units as well as its federal liaison officers, private investigators, crypto analysts, the FBI, Interpol, and the Taiwanese authorities. It was the first high-profile “wrench attacks” in the country, and they wanted to see it to the end. Wrench attacks have been on the rise since the beginning of last year, with several incidents occurring across major cities around the world. It is a crime where attackers rely on physical intimidation or attacks to steal digital assets from their owners. In November 2025, San Francisco experienced another attack similar to the one that happened to Shi. A man posing as a delivery guy rang the doorbell, pulled a gun on the resident, and stole $11 million in digital assets. Police shed light on the incident In Shi’s case, newly obtained police documents shed light on the incident. The files detail how investigations chased the suspect halfway across the world in a pursuit that led to the arrest and repatriation of Tianze Zhang, her former personal assistant, in June 2022. A police report showed that a walk-through of the scene was done with Shi before the police recorded their interview with her. In addition, items used in the crime were also collected and swabbed for DNA. Officers were also able to obtain doorbell camera footage taken earlier that day of the suspect at Shi’s door. The perpetrator was seen wearing a balaclava and ski goggles, but investigators were unable to reveal who was behind the mask. Shi then resorted to telling friends about the robbery and sharing the image of the man at the door. One such person was Zhang, whom she considered her friend. Zhang told her that he was soon heading to Taiwan to work on a film. Shi eventually hired a private investigator, a move that eventually paid off. The investigator, Carlos Jackson, obtained video taken by the neighbor’s security camera, which appeared to have captured someone walking in the area around the time the incident had occurred. Days later, Shi told the police she had identified the man in her neighbor’s video as Zhang. She mentioned that she had met him in 2021 through a friend and paid him in crypto. Police then used cellphone data in the next step of their investigation, with the data placing Zhang near the scene of the crime when it occurred. Police documents showed that his phone pinged near Shi’s home before and on the day of the attack. Shi employed several blockchain security firms that traced how the funds moved from her wallet and ended up in Zhang’s wallet. In addition, Zhang boarded a plane to Taiwan a day after the robbery occurred. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The Rails Are Being Built,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-zoom-out-the-rails-are-being-built/,"A recent post by crypto commentator X Finance Bull has brought attention to a development that may carry long-term significance for the XRP Ledger. Rather than focusing on price movements or promotional announcements, the commentary highlights a reported collaboration between Evernorth and Doppler Finance that centers on institutional-grade infrastructure. The emphasis is placed on foundational systems rather than public-facing initiatives, suggesting that the activity underway is intended to support future large-scale financial use rather than immediate visibility. BOOM! Evernorth (backed by Ripple + SBI) teams up with Doppler to design institutional liquidity infra on $XRP Ledger This is not marketing. This is back-end system plumbing Banks won't announce when they flip. They’ll just flip $XRP holders, zoom out. The rails are being… pic.twitter.com/yU9NtNvB03 — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 9, 2026 Details of the Evernorth–Doppler Collaboration According to the information shared, Evernorth, described as an XRP-focused digital asset treasury company backed by Ripple and SBI Holdings , has entered into a strategic relationship with Doppler Finance. Doppler is characterized as an infrastructure provider operating within the XRP Ledger ecosystem , with a focus on institutional use cases. The collaboration is reportedly aimed at designing and piloting liquidity and treasury frameworks suitable for institutional participants on the XRP Ledger. The attached image accompanying the post references a January 8, 2026 announcement outlining the intent to explore institutional liquidity and treasury operations directly on the XRP Ledger. The language used in that announcement emphasizes backend design and pilot programs, reinforcing the view that this effort is concentrated on system architecture rather than marketing initiatives. Focus on Backend Financial Infrastructure X Finance Bull’s commentary underscores that the development should be understood as technical and structural in nature. The assertion is that institutions do not typically publicize internal system transitions in advance. Instead, infrastructure is built, tested, and integrated quietly before any observable change occurs at the operational level. In this context, the Evernorth–Doppler effort is framed as part of preparatory work that could enable banks and other large financial entities to utilize XRP Ledger-based systems without public signaling. This perspective aligns with the notion that institutional adoption often depends on reliable liquidity management, treasury tooling, and on-chain infrastructure that meets operational and compliance standards. The collaboration is therefore directly presented as addressing these requirements. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Broader Implications for the XRP Ledger The post further suggests that XRP holders should view this development from a long-term standpoint. Rather than interpreting progress through short-term announcements or retail-focused narratives, the emphasis is placed on the gradual construction of financial rails. The integration of a major XRP treasury company with a core infrastructure provider is portrayed as evidence that institutional pathways are being established. While no timelines or specific institutional users are disclosed, the reported collaboration reinforces the idea that the XRP Ledger continues to be positioned for institutional-grade financial activity . If such infrastructure is successfully deployed, it could support a range of treasury and liquidity operations without requiring public fanfare. Overall, the information shared by X Finance Bull presents the Evernorth–Doppler relationship as a structural development that may only become visible once institutions begin using the systems already put in place.

The decline so far, however, mirrors the period leading up to its 2025 rally, which reclaimed its 2021 highs, according to Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan. Speaking in a video uploaded Saturday to YouTube, he stated, “Ethereum is actually way down, this would argue against us falling too much further. This is kind of reminiscent of what we saw before Ethereum went on its major run last year.” To make matters better, macro-level crypto market data are stabilizing too, with investor pessimism reaching a level historically associated with upward momentum. Social sentiment is said to be a contrarian signal, and similar trends have helped drive major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, to massive rallies in the past. Quinlivan says Ethereum is now recognized as the second top cryptocurrency In late August last year, Ether returned to its 2021 record high of $4,878, marking an almost 70% increase from its low of $1,472 on April 9, according to CoinMarketCap. Quinlivan noted that Ether’s price surged right when many traders were beginning to dismiss the token. Currently, Ether has retreated 36% from its August peak, trading at $3,089, after a $19 billion crypto sell-off on October 10 caused a market-wide downtrend. Despite the significant drop in just a few months, investors aren’t as doubtful about Ethereum’s upside as they were at the start of 2025. He remarked, “I wouldn’t say that is happening now. Ethereum is kind of back to being an expected number two market cap for a lot of people.” Similarly, Coinbase Asset Management president Anthony Bassili also previously told reporters he’s pleased to see Ethereum regain its proper ranking. He explained that there is now a broad consensus among investors that a first portfolio should start with Bitcoin, then include Ethereum. Traders believe Ethereum could surpass $5000 in 2026 Quinlivan remains hopeful, stating that the Ethereum network is expected to grow sharply in the coming months, particularly with an increase in staking demand. It seems he isn’t the only one who’s optimistic — on Kalshi, traders assign a 59% chance that Ethereum will exceed $4,250 in 2026, and 49% believe it could surpass $4,500. Additionally, crypto-focused platform Polymarket is also wagering on prices far above current levels, with over 40% of traders betting Ethereum will hit $5,000 in 2026 and 22% predicting it will exceed $6,000. While prices of $7,500, $8,000, and $10,000 are still considered long shots, traders are still placing bets on them. About 7% of traders are betting on a price over $10,000. The Ethereum Foundation also said at the end of the year that the Ethereum network cemented its role as the secure backbone of our digital civilization, consolidating its fundamentals for 2026. Crypto market sentiment is down to “Fear” levels Overall, the crypto market sentiment is on a downturn, oscillating between “Fear” and “Extreme Fear” since early November. On Sunday, the Index posted 29, indicating “Fear.” Investors nonetheless still prefer Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies, with the Altcoin Season Index scoring BTC sentiment at 34 out of 100. But judging from the 90-day action of the top 100 altcoins versus Bitcoin, the index flipped between “Bitcoin Season” and “Altcoin Season” measures. Early in the year, however, some analysts have already cautioned traders to expect a downturn for Bitcoin. Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant , warned that the biggest crypto asset may remain in a consolidation phase through the first quarter of 2026. Investment in Bitcoin, he said, had slowed as investors turned their attention to equities and metals, such as gold and silver. Veteran trader Peter Brandt and Fidelity macro research director Jurrien Timmer also suggested Bitcoin could revisit the $60,000–$65,000 range this year.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin and Ether ETFs saw nearly $750 million in outflows during the first full week of 2026. Bitcoin funds led the decline despite a strong inflow at the start of the week. XRP and Solana ETFs bucked the trend, attracting fresh capital as investors rotated into altcoin funds. At the same time, newer funds tied to XRP and Solana moved in the opposite direction, drawing fresh capital and posting stronger trading activity. Bitcoin and Ether ETFs See $750M Outflows Despite Strong Week Start Data from SoSoValue shows spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs recorded combined net outflows of $749.6 million between January 6 and January 9. Bitcoin funds accounted for the bulk of the decline, shedding $681 million after four straight days of redemptions. The slide came despite a strong start to the week , when Bitcoin ETFs attracted nearly $700 million in inflows on January 5, the only positive session during the period. Selling pressure intensified midweek. Outflows on January 7 alone reached $486.1 million, marking the largest single-day drawdown of the week.

The 12 approved funds now hold roughly $116.9 billion in net assets, equivalent to about 6.5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Since their launch in January 2024, cumulative net inflows still exceed $56 billion. Spot Ether ETFs followed a similar pattern, though on a smaller scale. The group ended the week with $68.6 million in net outflows after strong inflows earlier in the period were reversed by heavy selling over the final three trading days. BlackRock’s ETHA led outflows, followed by Grayscale’s ETHE. The nine Ether ETFs currently manage $18.7 billion in assets, representing just over 5% of Ether’s market value. XRP ETFs Buck Market Pullback With Record Volume and Fresh Inflows While investors trimmed exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies, appetite for altcoin-linked ETFs showed signs of growth. Spot XRP ETFs recorded $38.1 million in net inflows during the week and reached their highest weekly trading volume since launch at $219 million. The surge points to rising institutional engagement as the products gain traction following their debut in late 2025. Canary Capital’s XRPC remains the largest XRP fund by assets, followed closely by offerings from Bitwise and Franklin Templeton. Collectively, XRP ETFs have accumulated more than $1.2 billion in net inflows, with total assets approaching $1.5 billion. Solana ETFs also attracted fresh capital, taking in $41.1 million over the same period. Bitwise’s BSOL continues to dominate the category, holding a commanding lead over rival products as investors selectively rotate into alternative crypto exposures.

XRP Whales Accumulate Early,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-under-0-1-for-q1-2026-xrp-whales-accumulate-early/,"Investors who are looking at the best crypto below $0.1 by the first quarter of 2026 are beginning to forsake older large-cap coins. Most people are keeping an eye on earlier presale initiatives and new crypto protocols at lesser valuations and reduced entrance charges. This has already attracted attention of some XRP whales known to venture into cycles prior to the general market movement. The recent growth has led to their recent accumulation, raising the question whether a new undervalued crypto will soon lead to a similar early growth seen by Ripple (XRP). The project that receives a significant portion of this hype is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto lending protocol whose investor base is constantly increasing and its presale is actively sold. Ripple (XRP) Ripple (XRP) is a somewhat recognized cryptocurrency with its market guiding back and its broad community around the world. The XRP price is now trading at an approximate of $2.10 dollars and has a market capitalization of about $130 billion. The early move saw a great spike in XRP in the past cycles and rewarded numerous early adopters in its initial bull run. This formed the basis of the XRP whale community that is still in existence. There is, however, mixed feeling among analysts as regards to the next crypto cycle of XRP. Others predict a low upside because of legal certainty and growing institutional applications. Some are of the opinion that XRP might not be able to achieve substantial multiplier returns on its present value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new crypto developing decentralized finance lending protocol that is on the verge of its mainnet launch. It presents a dual lending facility which gives credence to Peer to Contract and to Peer to Peer markets. The Peer to Contract model uses shared liquidity pools where users lend to each other and earn APY as the borrowing demand rises, whilst the borrower takes a loan out of the pool of liquidity. Lending and borrowing are also facilitated by the Peer-to-Peer market except that there is no shared pool, lenders and borrowers pair up. Interest rate, type of collateral and terms of repayment are some of the loan terms that can be tailored between the two parties. In order to make the system secure, collateral assures the loan and loan to value regulations. In case of the decrease of the collateral value to levels of safety, there are liquidation events that safeguard lenders and maintain network solvency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in its active presale, and it has already created serious demands among the early entrants. The sale is organized in different stages with increasing token prices so that the early purchasers can attain lower starting points prior to release and exchange listings. Tokens have kept selling out phase after phase and this demand has earned MUTM to rise by 300% ($0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.04 in Phase 7) as yet. The presale has already sold over 18,800 holders and raised over $19.7M, with 825M MUTM having been sold out of the presale total. This funding precedes the launch of the V1 protocol, which leaves Mutuum Finance with a large user base and treasury prior to launch. The Reason MUTM Might Take The Early XRP Track Analysts indicate a number of reasons why MUTM will experience a similar path to XRP in the initial stages. The first one is valuation. XRP began as a low valued asset experiencing a large quantity of supply and a defined story. MUTM comes in at a comparable price with a specified application. The second reason is utility. XRP presented an evident role in payments and transfers. MUTM brings the reality of utility in the practice of lending and extending credits. This utility generates protocol demand and not just speculative trading. Utility has been found to be a major determinant of long term performance of the altcoins. The third reason is timing. XRP experienced its initial boom prior to its entry into large exchanges. MUTM is still in the presale and is yet to be launched in open markets. Analysts say that this enables early buyers to position ahead of the price discovery in the launch. Phase 7 Selling Out Fast Recently, MUTM is in Phase 7 of the presale. The tokens in this stage have been selling at a fast rate with few of them left. The rise in demand has been explained by the impending release of the V1 protocol, and the growing awareness of whale wallets and retail investors. The 24 hour leaderboard attests to the new inflows and regular purchasing activity. The security audit by Halborn is another key reason that supports the use of confidence. Halborn is a reputable blockchain security company, which has audited major projects in the sector. In the case of a lending protocol, security is of great significance because of collateral management, liquidation code and pool insurance. The Halborn review indicates that the protocol has been externally verified prior to its launching. This, according to the analysts, is capable of supporting the inflows of liquidity once the protocol has been switched on and users have started embedding money or collateral. As the presale continues to gain momentum, and Phase 7 on its way to a sellout, numerous investors now consider MUTM one of the best cryptos below $0.1 by Q2 2026.

The billionaire revealed plans to introduce a new algorithm that will include the code governing which posts and ads users see, with the launch set for just seven days away. Musk added on X, “This will happen every four weeks, along with detailed developer notes to help you understand what has changed.” xAI set to implement several changes on X The executive’s sudden announcement sparked debates among individuals, prompting reports to reach out to Musk for clarity on this update. However, when asked why he chose to make the algorithm’s implementation open source, he declined to respond. Sources close to the situation, who wished to remain anonymous due to the confidential nature of the matter, alleged that Musk and his firm have a record of engaging in numerous disagreements with regulators over which content should or should not be displayed to users. This disagreement arose when several X users began to raise complaints, claiming that the social media platform had deprioritized posts from the accounts they followed. Responding to these allegations, Musk noted in October that this issue was a result of a bug discovered in the “For You” algorithm. Afterwards, he declared that the firm would address the issue as soon as possible. Meanwhile, reports emphasized that, apart from xAI , the company behind the social media platform X, which seeks to introduce a new algorithm for X, also aims to integrate more advanced AI capabilities into its platform’s recommendation system. This integration is set to widely utilize Grok, a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by xAI. Notably, this is not the first time Musk has announced updates to X’s algorithms, vowing to make them public. Reports revealed that he had made such pledges earlier but failed to deliver on this implementation. For instance, Musk made a similar pledge in September, but the implementation had lacked consistency, sparking discussion among individuals. To address these debates, the owner of X claimed that they had decided to first focus on integrating the platform’s recommendation engine with advanced AI and would publicly provide access to the source code of its algorithm later. At this time, Musk pledged that they would do so about every two weeks. While users awaited the billionaire to fulfill his promise, Musk released an announcement in October informing them that the alterations they observed in their feeds did not result from the doings of specific individuals who attempted to change the normal operation on the platform, but resulted from the heightened popularity of Grok and other AI tools among people. Following this declaration, Musk noted that xAI intended to assign Grok the role of assessing all the posts shared on X daily. Based on his argument, this move is essential as it would enable Grok to display to users posts that are likely to draw their attention, thereby improving the quality of their feed. The owner of X also told users to expect the implementation of new features by November. However, global regulators disapproved of Grok’s ability to develop images due to the escalation of pictures generated by AI with sexual content on X. Several regulators raise concerns about Musk’s Grok Following global regulators’ accusations against Grok, it released a statement to users on Friday, January 9, demanding a paid subscription to grant full access to image generation and editing tools. Notably, these features were initially freely accessible to users, though they were subjected to daily restrictions. Meanwhile, after a thorough investigation, Indonesian regulators hindered their citizens’ access to Grok. These regulators confirmed the claims on Grok about sexual content to be true. Following this news, Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, released a statement this week urging Musk and his team to take note of this finding and fix the problem as soon as possible. Elizabeth Kendall, a British politician serving as Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, also commented on the situation. She cautioned that the government might decide to take Indonesia’s lead and ban its citizens from accessing Grok if Musk and his team fail to adhere to the UK rules.

The feat means the model is the only Korean presence in a ranking dominated by models developed by companies in the United States and China. In a statement, LG mentioned that its latest AI model delivered the strongest performance among five teams in a government-led AI foundational model competition. The model achieved remarkable feats, topping 10 of 13 benchmark tests with an average score of 72. Internationally, the AI model ranked seventh on the Intelligence Index compiled by Artificial Analysis, making it the only Korean model to enter the top 10. China led with six models , while the US boasted three models. Z.AI’s GLM-4.7 took the first position. LG’s foundational model ranks seventh in global rankings LG released its foundational model as an open-weight on Hugging Face and saw it climb to second place on the platform’s global model trend chart. This suggested a strong interest from international leaders. LG mentioned that it is ready to roll out free API access to K-Exaone through January 28. This will allow developers and firms to use the model without any cost during the initial rollout period. Epoch AI, a US-based nonprofit, also hailed the model. The platform added the model to its list of notable AI models. LG AI research now has five models on the list, making it the Korean company with the most. “We established the development plan according to the time and infrastructure we were given, and we developed the first-phase K-Exaone using about half the data we have,” said Lee Jin-sik, head of Exaone Lab at LG AI Research. According to LG, the model is the brainchild of five years of in-house research and signals Korea’s entry into the global race for frontier-class AI systems. The division of LG mentioned that instead of relying on only scale, it redesigned the architecture to boost performance while reducing training and operating costs. K-Exaone uses a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with 236 billion parameters, with about 23 billion parameters activated per inference. The K-Exaone model beats other models in several parameters The model uses its core technology, hybrid attention, to enhance its ability to focus on important information during data processing while reducing requirements and computational load by 70% compared to the previous models. The tokenizer was also upgraded by expanding its training vocabulary to 150,000 words. In addition, it often optimizes frequently used word combinations, improving the ability to process documents 1.3 times. In addition, the adoption of multi-token prediction boosted inference speed by 150%, improving overall efficiency. K-Exaone is designed to maximize efficiency while reducing costs, allowing it to run on A100-class GPUs rather than requiring the most expensive infrastructure,” an LG AI Research official said. “This makes frontier-level AI more accessible to companies with limited computing resources and helps broaden Korea’s AI ecosystem.” Aside from memorization, K-Exaone is trained to focus on improving its reasoning and problem-solving capabilities. LG explained that during its pre-training stage, the model was exposed to thinking trajectory data that shows how problems are solved and not just the final answer. Safety and compliance were also other priorities for the model. LG mentioned that it carried out data compliance reviews across training datasets, removing materials with potential copyright issues. The company runs an internal AI ethics committee that carries out risk assessment across four categories, including social safety, Korea-specific considerations, future risks, and universal human values. Under KGC-Safety, the benchmark developed by LG AI research for safety in Korea, K-Exaone scored an average of 97.38 across four categories. It outperformed OpenAI ’s GPT-OSS-120B model and Alibaba’s Qwen-3-235B model.

But PayPal just kept crashing. On January 9, it dropped another 1%, closing at $57.66. And this wasn’t a one-day thing. It’s been stuck in the dirt for months. At the same time, insiders sold PYPL in Q4 2025 and none of them bought while short sellers made millions of dollars off PayPal, per data from InvestingPro. Downgrades pile up for PayPal’s stock while retail investors loses hope The hate online for PayPal has been nonstop. One trader on Reddit said they were down $20,000 and called it a “garbage stock,” just as Reddit sentiment score hit 12 out of 100, which frankly, that’s rock bottom. Another post blew up with 210 upvotes and 103 comments of people basically holding a support group for their losses. The most viral post came from someone with $100,000 in the stock who wrote, “I’m down 20k on this garbage stock. Should I just sell everything and buy SPY puts? This thing is never going back up.” That guy was using 326% leverage, and the title of the post reads:- “PayPal lose, going to yolo everything. The thing is, PayPal actually beat earnings eight out of the last nine quarters, but nobody cares since the stock keeps crashing, now down by 38% from $93.03, which was already far from its $231.38 high in 2021. The stock is now near its 52-week low of $55.72. Wall Street is tired too, as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan , Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America have all downgraded PYPL going into 2026. PayPal crashed 20% in the 2018 dip, 31% in the Covid crash, and then crashed over 83% when inflation hit. It’s been nothing but pain. And even now, it trades at 10 times forward earnings with 31% quarterly earnings growth, and the market still shrugs. Jefferies isn’t feeling it either. They kept a Hold rating and slapped on a $60 target. Right now, it trades around $58.42. That’s barely above the bottom. They also warned about Germany, where PayPal gets about 20% of its branded payment volume and 25% of transaction margin dollars. Sales there are slowing down. They’re now calling for just 2% TPV growth, down from 5% last quarter. Even with a P/E of 11.78 and a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, nobody’s buying the story. Price targets are all over the place, from $51 to $120, and earnings drop in 35 days. Other Wall Street analysts are divided on where PayPal goes next. Of the 44 analysts covering PayPal, 20 rate it Buy, 20 rate it Hold, and four rate it Sell, according to FactSet.

The focus is shifting away from hype-driven launches and toward projects that are building real systems before going live. In this environment, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly being viewed as a serious crypto investment for those aiming to position themselves ahead of the next market expansion. Strong Presale Traction With a fixed total supply of just 4 billion tokens, the presale is already showing strong traction. Across all phases, the project has raised approximately $19.70 million so far, signaling growing investor confidence. The token is currently priced at $0.04, while more than 18,800 holders have already secured their positions through earlier rounds. Demand is clearly building in the current phase as well, with 5% of the 180 million tokens allocated to this stage already sold, indicating accelerating interest as supply continues to tighten. There has been a significant update for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), as MUTM tokens can now be purchased using a card with no purchase limits. This removes friction for new participants and allows broader market access, strengthening demand at a critical stage of the presale. It is important to highlight that the presale is all legitimate, as the team has been active since early 2025 and has consistently followed its roadmap while achieving key milestones on schedule. Timely delivery, an upcoming launch of a fully functional protocol, and steady organic community growth all reinforce the project’s credibility. These factors clearly distinguish it from the typical rug-pull schemes that are unfortunately common in today’s crypto arena, positioning the project as a serious, long-term venture rather than a speculative risk. What Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Building? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed around a dual lending structure that aims to serve different types of users within decentralized finance. Its Peer-to-Contract model allows users to lock stablecoins such as USDT into smart contract-backed liquidity pools. This system is built to deliver automated passive income in a secure and efficient way, without manual management. Alongside this, the Peer-to-Peer model enables direct lending agreements between individuals without intermediaries. This structure supports customized loan terms and enhanced privacy, which appeals to users who value control and confidentiality. Together, these two models create multiple yield pathways that attract diverse investors and strengthen platform activity from launch. Recent protocol updates have shown that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building well ahead of its launch timeline. As of November 24, 2025, front-end data testing has been fully completed, ensuring accurate balances, positions, and market statistics from day one. The ELK monitoring system is already live, giving the team real-time visibility into logs, performance, and system health. This level of infrastructure readiness is rarely seen during presale stages. The full staking workflow has also been implemented and tested, covering staking, unstaking, and reward tracking through automated deployment scripts designed for secure rollouts. Ongoing smart contract audit improvements, advanced admin dashboards, and extensive performance testing underline the project’s focus on reliability and long-term stability. At a time when many presales launch with unfinished products, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a utility-driven protocol that is actively being refined before going live. Roadmap Execution, Simultaneous Launch Strategy and MUTM Buybacks Roadmap execution further strengthens this outlook. Phase 1 of the roadmap is fully completed, and more than half of Phase 2 has already been achieved. The remaining objectives in Phase 2 include implementation of advanced features, risk parameters, and advanced analytics tools. The whitepaper has also been updated to reflect protocol progress and recent developments, reinforcing transparency and credibility. A major driver could be the expected simultaneous platform launch and token listing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to introduce its lending and borrowing modules at the same time as the token becomes tradable. This synchronized rollout is expected to create immediate engagement, as users will be able to interact with live products from day one. Such readiness often aligns with Tier-1 and Tier-2 exchange listing requirements, increasing visibility and trading activity once listed. Another defining element is the dividend mechanism and buy-back pressure built into the protocol. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is structured to generate revenue from borrowing fees and platform activity. A portion of this revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, which will then be distributed to users staking their mtTokens. This design rewards long-term participation while introducing sustained demand through consistent buybacks. Finally, as the presale advances and remaining tokens become harder to secure, attention is expected to intensify. Those positions now align with a project that is building first and marketing later, a pattern that often defines standout performers in the next market cycle. For investors focused on entering before broader exposure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be a compelling choice before January 2026 arrives.

57065480,https://timestabloid.com/?p=94658,1768125730,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s XRP Price If XRP Reaches Ethereum’s Market Cap Today,https://timestabloid.com/heres-xrp-price-if-xrp-reaches-ethereums-market-cap-today/,"A recent post by crypto enthusiast Bird presents a valuation scenario that reframes how XRP’s price can be viewed relative to other major digital assets. Instead of focusing on short-term price movements or speculative trading activity, the post centers on a direct comparison between XRP and Ethereum based strictly on market capitalization. XRP at Ethereum’s Market Cap The images attached to the post illustrate that if XRP were assigned the same market capitalization as Ethereum today, its price would exceed six dollars per token. The calculation places XRP near $6.17, representing a three times increase from its trading level at the time of the post. The visuals also show that XRP’s existing market capitalization is significantly lower than Ethereum’s. It sits at roughly one-third of Ethereum’s total valuation. XRP would be over $6 at today’s Ethereum market cap. This will happen very soon. pic.twitter.com/pjmvFEA8tC — Bird (@Bird_XRPL) January 10, 2026 This comparison is presented as a mathematical outcome rather than a speculative estimate. It assumes no change to XRP’s circulating supply and relies solely on Ethereum’s current market capitalization figures. From this standpoint, the projected price is not based on hypothetical token burns or structural changes, but on a direct alignment of total market value between the two assets. Community Responses Reflect Mixed Sentiment The post generated contrasting reactions from other market participants. One commenter suggested that if XRP were to surpass Ethereum in market capitalization, it could lead market participants to reassess long-held assumptions about the digital asset hierarchy, including discussions surrounding Bitcoin’s dominance. Another response was dismissive, arguing that XRP is unlikely to experience such appreciation and questioning the relevance of market cap comparisons altogether. These reactions highlight the divide between those who view relative valuation as a meaningful indicator and those who remain skeptical of XRP’s upside potential. Factors Supporting a Bullish XRP Outlook Supporters of the valuation comparison often point to several underlying developments. XRP’s design for fast and cost-efficient value transfer continues to position it as a settlement-focused digital asset rather than a general-purpose smart contract platform. Ongoing expansion of the XRP Ledger’s functionality, particularly in areas such as tokenization and institutional-grade infrastructure, is frequently cited as a potential demand driver. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory developments also remain central to the outlook, as increased clarity could encourage broader participation from financial institutions. In addition, growing interest in blockchain-based payment and liquidity solutions may favor assets optimized for high-volume transactions. Valuation Illustration Rather Than Certainty While the post states that XRP will soon reach Ethereum’s market capitalization, the underlying message remains tied to valuation comparison rather than a guaranteed outcome. The six-dollar price level serves to demonstrate how market capitalization differences translate directly into price disparities. Whether that gap narrows will depend on adoption trends, regulatory progress, and market conditions, but the comparison itself offers a clear view of where XRP currently stands relative to Ethereum.
