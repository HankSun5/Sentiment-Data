Speaking at Ripple Apex, he claims the once-gimmick has become more than a meme coin , distancing itself from what he generalized as “get-rich-quick rug pulls” to become “part of the ecosystem. It plays a role.” Citing Elon Musk’s continued endorsement, Garlinghouse said Musk “willed Dogecoin into so much liquidity that it’s not going away.” “I used to speak not so kindly about Dogecoin… was created as a joke, right?” ~ #Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse pic.twitter.com/pEB91t3KiP — The Crypto Times (@CryptoTimes_io) June 12, 2025 While he did not entertain a partnership, the concession marks a notable shift for a figure long-positioned on the institutional end of the spectrum—opening the door for institutional acceptance. With rising speculation around Dogecoin ETF approval, Garlinghouse’s comments may be seen as early validation, giving it more credit in the “best crypto to buy” conversation. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Could Institutions Boost DOGE? Even without a Ripple collaboration, Dogecoin may be on the breakout path, following a massive 4-year cup-and-handle pattern. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle pattern confluence zone. Source: TradingView, Binance. DOGE is currently consolidating within the descending channel forming the handle, but a fast approaching confluence zone could see a breakout unfold in the coming weeks. Key support from the 0.236 Fib level and the historic support trendline that has underpinned every major DOGE bottom since September is set to intersect with the channel’s resistance. The historic support that has marked DOGE bottoms since September could push a breakout as it intersects with the channel’s upper resistance, aligned with support from the 0.236 Fibbonnaci level. A confirmed breakout would set a technical target around $0.75—a staggering 300% gain from current levels in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. The upcoming June 15 deadline for a US spot Dogecoin ETF decision could bring the catalyst Dogecoin needs, opening the doors to institutional inflows if approved. #Dogecoin awaits eagerly for SEC ETF rulings in June. Approval odds near 80%. pic.twitter.com/nD3d0bvkmF — dogegod (@_dogegod_) June 12, 2025 Momentum indicators also point to retail inflows. The RSI has stabilized at 45 after dipping below the neutral zone, and the MACD is tightening, hinting at a potential crossover that could shift sentiment. While the setup isn’t screaming bullish yet, it’s also far from bearish. This fragile balance suggests that any uptick in volume or sentiment could tip the scales. If historic support becomes an accumulation base, DOGE could finally break the handle structure and resume its long-term uptrend. Bitcoin Could Have the Edge, With Some Help Those who jumped to speculative plays like Dogecoin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.1 million in its second presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 648% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

Knot’s assessment, delivered during his final address as FSB Chair at a Financial Stability Conference in Madrid, showed how barriers for retail crypto access have “dropped significantly,” particularly through the introduction of crypto ETFs and stablecoin issuers’ substantial Treasury holdings. His warning comes as the crypto ecosystem’s links with traditional finance continue expanding. Stablecoins settled $27.6 trillion in transactions during Q1 2025 alone , doubling Visa’s entire 2023 settlement volume. Stablecoin Transactions Vs Visa Payments Q1 Source: Bitwise The FSB Chair emphasized that while crypto doesn’t yet pose systemic risk, recent developments suggest authorities must monitor this “fast-growing market” more closely as it approaches mainstream financial integration. Institutional Infrastructure Races to Meet Demand The institutional embrace of crypto infrastructure has accelerated dramatically, with major financial players already positioning themselves for widespread adoption. A June 2 report by Cryptonews shows that UK-listed IG Group has become the first London Stock Exchange company to offer retail crypto trading . Retail clients can buy and sell 38 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, through a partnership with digital asset platform Uphold. IG Group will become the first company on the London Stock Exchange to allow retail investors to trade cryptos, including BTC, ETH, and XRP. #Bitcoin #XRP https://t.co/MImNzg9rAX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 Managing Director Michael Healy described customer demand as “ reaching a tipping point ,” positioning the FTSE 250 firm as a trusted alternative to existing crypto services. Most recently, Stripe’s aggressive crypto expansion further exemplifies this institutional momentum, with the payments giant acquiring crypto wallet infrastructure startup Privy following its $1.1 billion purchase of stablecoin platform Bridge. Privy powers over 75 million accounts across more than 1,000 teams while facilitating billions in transaction volume. It allows companies to integrate crypto wallets directly into their platforms without traditional friction. @stripe acquires crypto wallet infrastructure startup @privy_io in undisclosed deal, marking its second major crypto acquisition following the $1.1 billion Bridge purchase as stablecoins settle record $27.6 trillion in Q1 2025. https://t.co/TeTdIVgt0V — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 This acquisition allows Stripe to offer comprehensive crypto infrastructure spanning wallet creation, stablecoin payments, and fiat integration through a unified platform. This addresses growing business needs, as over 81% of crypto-aware small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) express interest in stablecoin adoption . Government-Led Digital Asset Integration Gains Momentum Government initiatives are also accelerating crypto mainstream adoption through direct blockchain-based investment products. In May, Thailand’s Ministry of Finance announced it would launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens within two months. Thailand is set to launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens, marking a step toward financial inclusivity for retail investors. #Thailand #SEC https://t.co/2akullmpsP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 These tokens would allow retail investors to purchase government bonds via blockchain-based “G-tokens” with a minimum investment threshold of just $3. Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira emphasized the initiative’s goal of broadening access to government-backed investments, particularly as commercial banks offer only 1.25% on 12-month fixed deposits. Similarly, China’s Zhejiang Province has integrated digital yuan pilots into its “first-launch economy” strategy, testing the central bank digital currency in retail debut scenarios through the “Digital Yuan + First-Launch” initiative. This represents a strategic shift from public services to consumer transactions, incorporating the currency within broader economic programs rather than treating it as a standalone technology. The approach addresses public hesitation by linking digital payments to familiar retail experiences like store launches and branded spaces. The UK government is simultaneously tightening oversight while expanding access. Starting in January 2026, crypto firms will be required to collect detailed customer information on every trade. The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting 2026. #UK #Crypto https://t.co/tHJKf7rEE5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 18, 2025 The new HMRC rules mandate that platforms record full names, addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction, including cryptocurrency type and amount transferred, is also logged. Non-compliance penalties can reach up to £300 per user. These developments suggest the crypto industry has indeed reached the tipping point Knot identified, with traditional financial barriers increasingly dissolving as digital assets integrate into mainstream economic systems.

That’s the mood across the altcoin landscape in June 2025. While Aptos (APT) surged 4% following a high-volume breakout, Cosmos (ATOM) is facing mounting skepticism over its long-touted role in blockchain interoperability. A recent analysis raised eyebrows about whether Cosmos’ interchain vision can actually deliver the seamless multi-chain world it claims to power. In contrast, a rising project, Qubetics ($TICS), is now drawing serious attention not because of grand narratives, but because of grounded application, precision engineering, and one of the most actively participated crypto presales of the year. Qubetics is building tools for the real-world financial system that legacy chains failed to support. Through its tokenized marketplace for real-world assets (RWA), this Web3 aggregator is stepping into a sector that’s gaining both institutional interest and retail curiosity. Unlike Cosmos, which is now being challenged to prove scalability beyond concept, Qubetics is showcasing scalable utility already in motion. At this critical market pivot, it’s positioning itself not only as a strong contender—but arguably the next bull run crypto leader with actual use cases and measurable ROI potential. Qubetics’ Real-World Asset Marketplace Could Power the Next Bull Run Crypto Cycle In a market where speculation still drives headlines, Qubetics’ tokenized marketplace offers something tangible. It’s the core application behind its Web3 aggregator model, designed to digitize and fractionalize real-world assets—everything from real estate to fine art and small business revenue contracts. The appeal? It connects traditional assets to a blockchain-native world while solving issues of liquidity, transparency, and cross-chain settlement. Think of a small business in Chicago wanting to raise capital without giving up equity. With Qubetics, it can tokenize future receivables or product revenues and offer them to a global pool of supporters—all settled across interoperable chains and tracked immutably. Or consider a Dubai-based property developer seeking fractional investment without regulatory friction. Qubetics turns its real estate assets into tokens accessible to compliant participants from Europe to Southeast Asia—each transaction secured by smart contracts with built-in revenue-sharing models. And it doesn’t stop with institutions. Individual community members looking to diversify their crypto portfolios with real-world exposure can do so seamlessly. This level of on-chain integration, backed by a secure RWA marketplace, makes Qubetics not just a tech novelty but a full-fledged bridge between DeFi and TradFi. As the infrastructure matures, so too does Qubetics’ role in driving the next bull run crypto cycle forward—not through hype, but through adoption. Qubetics Presale: Structuring ROI Around the Next Bull Run Crypto Surge Currently in Stage 37, the Qubetics presale is entering a zone of rapid momentum. With a token price of $0.3370, the project has raised over $17.9 million, distributing 515 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,900 wallets. Only 10 million tokens remain at this price before the next pricing tier begins—and ultimately, before the presale closes altogether. At that point, $TICS becomes a market-listed asset, exposed to volatility, competition, and demand mechanics beyond current presale economics. Now take a real-world example: A $7,000 buy-in at today’s rate delivers 20,772 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s a 197% return. At $5, it becomes $103,860. And if $TICS reaches $10 or $15, the same stake transforms into $207,720 or $311,580 respectively. Even modest entry points matter. A $100 purchase, for instance, secures 296 tokens, which at $10 delivers nearly $3,000 in value. This dynamic—paired with a total supply reduced from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and 38.55% allocated to the public—cements Qubetics’ credibility as one of the best crypto pre sale opportunities in the current cycle. With only one more presale tier likely before its mainnet launch in Q2 2025, $TICS now presents an entry window that’s quickly narrowing. The structure, transparency, and timing of the Qubetics presale set it apart as a clear contender among the next bull run crypto selections—especially for those who value clarity over chaos. Cosmos Faces Increasing Criticism Over Interoperability and Scaling Promises Cosmos has long touted its “Internet of Blockchains” vision, aiming to unify decentralized ecosystems through modular chains and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. But a recent analysis from Blockchain Magazine questions whether Cosmos can scale that vision in 2025, calling out its architectural limitations and lack of enterprise traction. Key concerns include Cosmos’ reliance on hub-and-zone architecture, which critics argue introduces latency and doesn’t support high-frequency microtransactions efficiently. More so, the interchain model, while conceptually clean, has yet to demonstrate seamless multi-chain operations at scale in real-world commercial settings. The report questions whether Cosmos has become more of a developer’s sandbox than a go-to infrastructure for cross-chain consumer applications. Yet despite these critiques, Cosmos still holds relevance—especially for smaller networks seeking independence with modular governance. However, as the next cycle favors real-world integrations, protocols like Qubetics—which already offer on-chain asset management and Web3 infrastructure convergence—may increasingly pull attention and capital. While Cosmos deserves credit for pioneering blockchain interoperability discussions, its current scrutiny puts its placement in the next bull run crypto class at risk unless significant architectural upgrades are made. Aptos Sees 4% Jump as Technical Breakout Signals Bullish Continuation In contrast to Cosmos’ technical headwinds, Aptos (APT) is showing signs of renewed strength. As reported by CoinDesk on June 10, APT rallied by 4% following a technical breakout that occurred on high trading volume. Analysts attribute this movement to a strong reversal pattern that saw the asset reclaim support zones previously seen in Q1, bolstered by increasing participation from spot buyers. The uptick was also notable for its context. While many Layer 1s are experiencing stagnation, Aptos is finding fresh footing among traders seeking responsive price movements. The chart setup now points to a potential short-term push beyond resistance levels, which could trigger follow-through buying and improved sentiment around the project. Whether this turns into long-term momentum remains to be seen. However, in the context of short-term trading, Aptos’ performance places it among the more agile contenders. With technical strength returning and broader Layer 1 rotation continuing, Aptos is earning a spot among the next bull run crypto assets to watch—particularly for market participants focused on volatility-driven growth. Conclusion: Three Chains, Three Paths to the Next Bull Run Crypto Class The altcoin space in mid-2025 is a study in contrasts. Cosmos, once the interoperability poster child, now faces hard questions about scale and commercial viability. Aptos, on the other hand, is showing signs of technical life, surging on high volume and bullish patterns. And then there’s Qubetics—emerging not from hype, but from a structured presale, a fully integrated real-world asset platform, and a clear mainnet roadmap that signals readiness, not just potential. For those navigating the complexity of the current market and searching for the next bull run crypto, this trio presents distinct propositions. But among them, Qubetics stands out—not just for its upside, but for its tangible utility, economic design, and strategic timing. As more early adopters gravitate toward transparency, usability, and secure token mechanics, Qubetics has already made its case to be the best crypto presale of the year—and possibly the defining Layer 1 of the next growth phase. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What is the next bull run crypto to watch in 2025? Qubetics, Aptos, and Cosmos are key altcoins, but Qubetics is gaining traction due to its RWA marketplace and presale performance. Why is Qubetics considered a strong next bull run crypto pick? It combines Web3 aggregation with a tokenized asset platform and a tightly structured presale nearing completion. Is Aptos showing signs of a bullish reversal? Yes, Aptos rallied 4% following a high-volume breakout, suggesting renewed short-term bullish momentum.

Nocut News reported that the Daegu District Court Criminal Division upheld all but one of the original verdicts and sentences. A 43-year-old ringleader is facing up to three years in prison. Kimchi Premium: Appeal Unsuccessful The judge did, however, overturn another of the traders’ verdicts. In the original trial, this individual (name withheld for legal reasons) was given an 18-month suspended jail term. However, the Presiding Judge Oh Deok-sik ruled on June 12 that this sentence was “overly lenient,” instead sending this trader to prison for 18 months. The traders were all found guilty of violations of the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information and the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act. The court heard evidence that the group illegally smuggled hundreds of billions of won worth of foreign currency into the country by reselling cryptoassets they had purchased in Japan. Prosecutors explained that the group worked in conjunction with a group of Japanese investors. Together, they concocted a carefully planned bid to exploit the kimchi premium . At the time, Bitcoin (BTC) prices were significantly higher in South Korea. Demand was growing as trading volumes on domestic crypto exchanges spiked. Prosecutors said the group illegally smuggled about 400 billion won ($296 million) worth of foreign currency across international borders. The overseas investors paid the group approximately 27 billion won (almost $20 million) for its services. The kimchi premium as calculated by Scolkg/Cryprice at the time of writing. (Source: Scolkg/Cryprice) Traders Deny Wrongdoing The defendants denied all the charges. They claimed the transactions could not be classified as “capital transactions,” as they involved crypto, not cash. As such, these deals were not subject to standard declaration laws. However, the appellate court rejected these claims. The judge ruled that the defendants “took advantage of the price differences between countries for virtual assets to export foreign currency and obtain commission fees.” The judge added that the original sentence “appears to be appropriate.” Justice Oh added that the court had seen “no other evidence that would require a change in sentence.” Education Ministry accused of shielding group tied to after-school certification scandal https://t.co/Z2fVGqwR8X — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) June 11, 2025 However, in the case of the trader who was jailed instead of receiving a suspended term, the court explained that while this individual only received just over $4,000 in “commission fees,” the nature of this individual’s crime was grave. The court heard that this trader held an important role in the business community and used shell companies to perpetrate the crime.

However, trading volume over the past 24 hours tells a different story. Spot market volume for $GRASS has surged by over 55% in the last 24 hours, with CoinGlass data revealing that derivative market volume has also jumped by over 95% during the same period.

Examining funding rates in the derivative market, as of June 12, rates have shifted from negative to positive, typically indicating bullish market sentiment. A positive funding rate in derivatives markets means long position holders pay short position holders. This occurs when the derivative contract price exceeds the underlying asset’s spot price. All these factors point to strategic whale activity, especially if volume returns to the market. With $GRASS still down over 55% from its all-time high of $3.90, whales purchasing current dips are positioned for potential gains exceeding 125% if the DePIN token reclaims its November 2024 peaks. Technical Analysis: $1.56 Make-or-Break Level Could Trigger Major Rally The GRASS/USDT daily chart shows the asset in a corrective phase following an impulsive five-wave Elliott structure, with wave (4) likely complete and price currently consolidating. The SMA (9) at $1.9442 acts as dynamic resistance, and the price is currently trading below it, around $1.72, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. Source: TradingView Despite the pullback, a visible demand zone around $1.56–$1.68 provides support. If this zone holds, we could witness a reversal toward marked resistance levels. The first upside target is $2.24–$2.34, and with building momentum, the price could advance toward target 2, which is $2.52–$2.62. A break above this level would allow a move to retest December’s high at $3.686, with the green-shaded zone projecting bullish continuation toward $3.67. Overall, the price maintains a higher low structure, suggesting the broader trend could remain bullish if the current support zone holds. A breakdown below $1.56 would invalidate this scenario and shift sentiment bearish.

The company submitted an S-3ASR registration statement , enabling the resale of up to 58,699,760 shares related to its private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing. The Thursday filing allows more than 100 shareholders in the PIPE round to sell their shares, effectively flooding the market and triggering a post-close sell-off, Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, a publicly-traded firm that's pursuing crypto reserve strategy centered on bitcoin BTC, explained in an X post and an interview with CoinDesk. The company raised $450 million earlier this month through a PIPE round from a wide range of investors, including ConsenSys, Galaxy, and Pantera Capital, to acquire ETH for its treasury. Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin also joined the firm as board chairman. However, there may be a larger strategy behind the latest move. Allen said in an X post that he thinks the company may have quietly raised up to $1 billion to buy more ETH using an at-the-market (ATM) offering that was previously announced in a May 30 SEC filing . ""If they played cards right, they would expect a surprise PR tomorrow with $1B of ETH purchases, which could light the match to reignite the stock,"" he said.

Speaking at a White House event Thursday, Trump delivered his harshest criticism of Powell’s monetary policy approach, claiming that lowering rates by just one percentage point could save the United States $300 billion annually, while a two-point reduction would generate $600 billion in savings. Why Trump Wants to ‘Force Something’ Trump’s latest verbal assault marks the third time in two days that his administration has publicly targeted Powell. It follows similar criticisms from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Vice President JD Vance, who called the Fed’s stance “monetary malpractice.” The president has been saying this for a while, but it's even more clear: the refusal by the Fed to cut rates is monetary malpractice. https://t.co/HqUjWxwcHs — JD Vance (@JDVance) June 11, 2025 The coordinated pressure campaign came from the administration’s growing impatience with the central bank’s independence, particularly as Trump faces re-election pressures and seeks to demonstrate economic leadership. Despite repeatedly calling Powell “Too Late” and questioning why firing him would be controversial, Trump stopped short of threatening termination, instead ominously suggesting he “may have to force something” if rate cuts don’t materialize soon. The timing of Trump’s criticism appears strategic, coming as recent economic indicators show inflation cooling and energy prices declining due to increased domestic drilling under his “drill, baby, drill” energy policy. US Inflation Rate Source: TradingEconomics Powell’s current term as Fed chair expires in May 2026, and Trump has hinted that an announcement regarding his nominee for the next Fed chair could come soon. Harvard legal experts suggest that while Trump may have constitutional authority to remove Powell, such a move would likely trigger severe market volatility and undermine the Fed’s credibility as an inflation fighter, potentially causing long-term interest rates to spike even if short-term rates were cut. Presidential Pressure Campaign Intensifies Fed Independence Debate The escalating confrontation between Trump and Powell is a fundamental clash over Federal Reserve independence with deep constitutional and economic implications. Trump’s frustration stems from his belief that the current interest rate environment unnecessarily burdens federal borrowing costs, particularly as the government faces mounting short-term debt obligations approved during the Biden administration. Europe Rate Cuts Source: European Central Bank The president argued that Europe has implemented ten rate cuts while the Fed has delivered none, despite similar economic conditions and falling inflation metrics. Legal scholars say that while the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 allows governors to be removed “for cause,” the Supreme Court’s recent decisions have gradually eroded the traditional “for cause” protections that independent agencies have enjoyed for 85 years. Harvard Law School’s Daniel Tarullo, a former Fed Board member, suggests that three conservative justices have hinted at potentially treating the Federal Reserve differently from other agencies, possibly creating a carve-out based on the central bank’s historical precedent dating back to the First and Second Banks of the United States. However, market dynamics may provide Powell with more protection than legal statutes, as any attempt to remove the Fed chair would likely trigger immediate and severe market reactions that would prove counterproductive to Trump’s economic objectives. The anticipated market volatility is a powerful disincentive, particularly given that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has focused on maintaining stable 10-year Treasury rates, which are key for economic investment decisions. Recent economic indicators have strengthened Trump’s argument for immediate monetary easing. Inflation data show continued price stability and energy costs declining due to expanded domestic oil production. The favorable Producer Price Index reading in May has calmed fears about tariff-induced inflation spikes, emboldening the administration to intensify pressure on the Fed while markets increasingly price in potential rate cuts later this year.

The product, called the Coinbase One Card, was announced during the company’s State of Crypto Summit in New York, where CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that only US-based Coinbase One subscribers will have access. The cashback rate starts at 2%, and the more crypto a user holds on Coinbase, the higher the percentage climbs. The card reportedly runs on the American Express network, and comes with travel perks, purchase protections, and limited-time offers. The physical card itself is metal and engraved with part of the Bitcoin genesis block. According to Yahoo Finance, Brian said, “We’re excited to bring more utility to everyday spending. Why shouldn’t you earn 4% on your checking account?” Coinbase offers basic tier membership to unlock access The company is also rolling out a Basic tier for Coinbase One to make the new card available at a lower cost. For $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, users can unlock access to the Coinbase One Card without additional fees. That same tier offers zero trading fees on up to $500 per month, 4.5% APY on the first $10,000 of USDC, and up to $1,000 in account protection in case of unauthorized access. Since Coinbase One launched in 2023, its membership base has allegedly reached almost one million people, all of whom use the service for crypto trading, staking, and reward benefits. Brian said the Basic tier is designed to reach a wider audience, including those who are just getting started. Brian says bitcoin could replace dollar if debt crisis worsens During the Summit, Brian was asked about the future of Bitcoin and whether it could become the world’s reserve currency. “If the debt situation doesn’t get fixed, I do think that eventually Bitcoin will have to become the reserve currency—for better or worse,” he said. He blamed growing US debt and deficit spending, warning that without urgent action from Congress, the global financial system could shift away from the US dollar. “It’s not going to be the Chinese RMB,” Brian said. “They have their own debt problems.” He said rising national debt and Bitcoin’s all-time highs aren’t a coincidence. He added that in history, once a country decouples its currency from hard assets, inflation eventually follows. He cited 150% to 200% debt-to-GDP ratios as danger zones and said, “It’s like the frog slowly getting cooked.” Brian expressed support for current bipartisan crypto legislation in Congress, praising the Trump administration for its stance. He also said the Stablecoin Act, the Clarity Act, and the Genius Act should be passed before Congress leaves for summer recess. “We need to stick the landing,” he said. “The president wants those bills signed into law by August.” When asked if recent tax legislation could be the trigger for a financial crisis, Brian replied, “I’m reading both sides on this. I don’t know enough to say for sure, to be honest.” He suggested a follow-up bill might be necessary to address discretionary spending and prevent further economic fallout. He also revealed a partnership with Shopify that enables merchants to accept USDC payments directly. Alongside the AMEX-backed One Card, Coinbase now has a debit card through Visa, too. Source: Coinbase “We’re not trying to fight Visa and AMEX,” Brian said. “We’re working with them. But crypto is making people question the margins.” He added that the smarter card networks are already working on stablecoin strategies to avoid being left behind. On the topic of Circle, issuer of USDC, Brian confirmed Coinbase still holds equity in the company. “We’re the largest distribution partner for USDC,” he said. Their agreement is “substantial,” and Brian believes the market isn’t fully pricing that into Coinbase’s stock. When asked if he’d ever consider acquiring Circle, Brian said, “We’d always consider it, but it takes two parties.” He closed the interview by responding to a warning from CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who reminded crypto investors that regulation is coming. Brian agreed. “There are no free rides,” he said. “Regulation will be a huge boon. We’re actively working all over DC to get it done.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Bitcoin|Coinbase,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-12 23:53:06

Since the given estimates for liquidations are based on publicly available data, they may not reflect the true magnitude of market liquidations.

In other news, outgoing chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) sounded the alarm on the systemic risks posed by crypto’s deepening integration with traditional finance. Good as the market have been, whales have began mooving their money. If you’ve absorbed enough crypto content, you probably already know just how much power whales have when it comes to moving prices. According to data from Santiment, with crypto markets ranging, the importance of where whales are moving their money is at a premium. On-chain data shows a whale on Binance was liquidated on a $201M BTC/USDT long position in a single order. Bitcoin whale liquidation in real time on Binance Exchanges like Bybit, OKX and Binance saw the biggest hits, with Binance alone accounting for nearly $258.79 million in liquidations. The liquidations largely hit major tokens, with bitcoin leading the pack at over $308 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. Bitcoin markets steer profits On the other hand, Bitcoin’s several breakouts past $110,000 this week have pushed bullish market sentiment to a seven-month high. The sentiment was last seen during US President Donald Trump’s election win. As of June 11, there are 2.12 positive Bitcoin comments for every negative comment on social media, crypto analytics platform Santiment said in a June 11 X post. During this cycle, retail interest in Bitcoin has been subdued, with the price increases largely credited to institutional and nation-state adoption. An optimistic change in retail sentiment may serve as an extra advantage for Bitcoin. On June 11, Santiment data recorded 504.54 positive sentiment comments regarding Bitcoin, contrasted with 237.71 negative comments, resulting in a ratio of 2.12. Santiment monitors Bitcoin market sentiment across platforms such as X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, Bitcoin Talk, and Farcaster. 😍 With Bitcoin teasing its $112K all-time high the past couple days, retail has gotten bullish.

This growing focus on long-term strength links directly to Hyperliquid price movement, where momentum is already picking up speed. A new exchange listing has lifted HYPE’s value, and charts are signaling a possible trend shift. Though both assets are gaining traction for separate reasons, BlockDAG (BDAG) is setting a new direction entirely. Over 1.5 million individuals are currently mining BDAG through the X1 Miner App, eliminating the need for hardware or setup. Mining is now as easy as using a smartphone, and with a low presale price still available and future value projections reaching $5, attention is rising fast. Cardano Price Prediction Suggests Breakout Potential Cardano price prediction is becoming more prominent due to increased institutional inflows, strong technical signs, and ADA regaining a 1% share of the total crypto market. Market watchers are closely monitoring ADA as it approaches the important Fibonacci golden pocket zone, which is typically seen as a signal for upcoming price movement. ADA’s behavior resembles Bitcoin’s early bull cycle stages, indicating the potential for fresh growth. Should this trend continue, Cardano price prediction could see targets surpassing $1.00, supported by accumulation trends and renewed support from both retail and larger buyers. Hyperliquid Price Movement Accelerates With Binance US Listing Boost Hyperliquid price movement has picked up after Binance US shared plans to list HYPE, driving a sharp 15% rise in a single day. Currently at $37.77, HYPE has jumped 81% in the past month. Analysts are noticing a rounding bottom pattern forming on the charts, a sign of possible continuation. If HYPE breaks beyond the $39 neckline, it might head toward the $50 level. This increased activity in the Hyperliquid price movement is further supported by higher futures open interest and robust trading volume. These signs point to a wider shift in DeFi user sentiment as engagement increases. BlockDAG App Transforms Phone Usage Into Daily Mining Activity BlockDAG is changing how people get involved with mining by making the process user-friendly. More than 1.5 million people are mining BDAG coins each day through the X1 Miner App , removing the need for costly equipment or tech skills. Mining becomes a simple daily task, where people use just their phones to earn. The app allows users to tap a lightning icon once a day to mine up to 20 BDAG. It avoids battery drain, heat issues, or complex setups. There’s also a leaderboard and referral feature that boosts mining rates, helping the user base grow quickly. BlockDAG’s presale is also gaining strong attention. The project has raised $297 million and sold 22.4 billion coins so far. Starting at $0.001, the price has already increased by 2,660% to its current level in batch 29. A limited-time offer still allows purchases at $0.0018. This rare pricing period has increased activity, as many believe BDAG could reach $5. With this traction and simple app-based mining, many consider BDAG the best crypto to buy now. To Wrap Up! Cardano price prediction remains a key topic as ADA moves toward a critical resistance range, backed by solid indicators and a rising market share. Hyperliquid price movement brings different momentum after a listing-led rally, with eyes on its ability to continue upward. But in terms of user involvement and ease of entry, BlockDAG stands apart. More than 1.5 million users are already mining BDAG with their smartphones, and with the presale price of $0.0018 still available for a limited time, attention continues to grow. As $5 predictions emerge, BlockDAG is not just gaining traction; it’s seen by many as the best crypto to buy now while this pricing window remains open.

CNBC reports that in a note to clients, Wells Fargo automotive and mobility analyst Colin Langan says that Tesla’s core auto business continues to weaken, which could weigh down on the company’s stock. “ While ‘order’ pricing on the website appears stable over the [last 12 months], aggressive financing promotions continue to act as price cuts. Risk to Q2 margin remains given lower leverage.” The bank is giving Tesla an underweight rating and a $120 price target, which means that the company’s shares could drop by 61% from Monday’s closing price of $308.58. The bank’s bearish forecast comes even as investors anticipate the company’s robotaxi launch in Austin today. The vehicles are set to provide on-demand transportation without human drivers. Lanang says that potential tailwinds, including Tesla’s work on autonomous driving, are not enough to offset weak automotive numbers. “Most investor attention is directed at the June 12th Austin Robotaxi deployment. We doubt the likely limited debut will be enough to overshadow the poor fundamentals.” Tesla’s global deliveries are down 23% year over year amid steeper competition in China. TSLA has already dropped by more than 22% in 2025. In June alone, the stock slumped by nearly 10%.

(NYSE: GME) has announced the pricing of its upsized sale of convertible senior notes due 2032. The established gaming retailer up-scaled its sale of notes from $1.75 billion, announced earlier this week, to about $2.25 billion. The company also announced that initial purchasers of the notes will be given an option to purchase an additional $450 million within a 13-day period. As a result, GameStop has estimated to raise up to $2.68 billion after the sale of notes is closed June 17, 2025. Could GameStop Be Preparing for More Bitcoin Purchases? The company indicated that the funds will be used to make strategic acquisitions and investments, which aligns with its long-term goal. As Coinpedia previously reported , GameStop has already disclosed holding around 4,710 Bitcoins, which were purchased during the first quarter of 2025. “GameStop intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions,” the announcement noted . The company has been betting on an imminent parabolic rally of Bitcoin in the long haul, fueled by clear crypto regulatory frameworks in the United States. Furthermore, more companies have followed in the footsteps of Strategy in implementing a BTC treasury management plan to hedge against inflation. At the time of this writing, around 228 entities, led by publicly traded companies, have adopted a BTC treasury management plan. Consequently, the supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to exponentially decline, thus further exacerbating the existing supply vs demand shock.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 00:02:31

That marks a $33 billion increase so far this year, a 17% rise, driven by renewed crypto trading activity, growing use in payments, and increased regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump. Source: CryptoQuant . USDT and USDC Lead $33B Market Cap Jump According to the report, Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC continue to lead the market. USDT now holds a $155 billion market cap, up $18 billion year-to-date. USDC has gained $17 billion, climbing to a record high of $61 billion, an increase of 39% since January. On centralized exchanges, stablecoin reserves are also surging. The total value of ERC-20 stablecoins held on exchanges has reached $50 billion. Stablecoins are booming again. Market cap hit a record $228B, up $33B (+17%) in 2025. Driven by rising trading activity, growing payment use, and clearer U.S. regulation under Trump. pic.twitter.com/76zKj49UWB — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 12, 2025 USDC reserves in particular have grown 1.6 times in 2025 alone, now totaling around $8 billion. This influx supports deeper liquidity for crypto markets. The report also noted that stablecoins are bouncing back in the yield-bearing segment. These are stablecoins that pay interest to holders, often used in DeFi. The value of staked stablecoins has reached $6.9 billion, up 28% since late May. Most of that growth has come from rising demand for sUSDe and sUSDs, which gained $1.23 billion and $700 million in market cap, respectively. A recent report from on-chain data platforms Artemis and Dune shows broader user adoption. According to the report, titled “The State of Stablecoins 2025,” active stablecoin wallets rose from 19.6 million to 30 million over the past year, a 53% increase. The report said the data “suggests wider user engagement” and pointed to stablecoins becoming a key part of digital finance. It also noted that stablecoins are increasingly used in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and NFTs. “Stablecoins have emerged as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto,” it said, “and are becoming a core piece of payment and settlement infrastructure.” This surge in usage is also supported by the rise in real-world payment activity. Data from Artemis shows $94.2 billion in stablecoin transactions were settled between January 2023 and February 2025. Business-to-business (B2B) payments made up the largest chunk, reaching an annual run rate of $36 billion. Card-linked payments using stablecoins crossed $13 billion in volume. Stablecoin Legislation Gains Ground as Tech and Finance Giants Pile In Increased demand has also come alongside progress on the regulatory front. For example, the U.S. Senate advanced the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” or GENIUS Act this week. Backed by President Trump, the bill is designed to create a federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins. The legislation would require stablecoins to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or highly liquid assets. It would also mandate annual audits for issuers with over $50 billion in market cap, and include requirements for foreign issuers. The U.S. Senate Set for Historic Stablecoin Showdown as GENIUS Act nears final vote. #Stablecoins #GeniusAct https://t.co/ZJ59XzuQcn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 The Senate voted 68-30 to invoke cloture on the bill , clearing the way for final debate and vote. “This did not happen by accident,” said Senator Tim Scott, one of the bill’s co-sponsors. “To those who said Washington could not act… let’s prove them wrong.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent backed the legislation during a Wednesday Senate hearing. He said stablecoins could play a major role in expanding the use of the U.S. dollar globally. “I think $2 trillion is a very reasonable number,” Bessent said, referring to an estimate that the stablecoin market could exceed that level by 2028. “I could see it greatly exceeding that.” BREAKING – U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent: – Stablecoin regulations backed by U.S. Treasuries will expand global USD usage – We could see stablecoin demand exceed $2 TRILLION This is massive for crypto.

His statement centers on Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, whom he believes is preparing several initiatives that could significantly impact the token’s trajectory. Developer Anticipated to Reveal Major Plans In a recent post titled Reality Check, Delgado hinted that Kusama has multiple strategic developments in progress, though not yet disclosed publicly. While specifics remain unclear, Delgado expressed confidence that these efforts could reshape Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and attract renewed investor interest. He also referenced the popular hashtag #1CentDreamSHIB , reaffirming the longstanding goal within the Shiba Inu community to eventually push SHIB’s price to $0.01. According to Delgado, the upcoming initiatives, once unveiled, could substantially increase the token’s demand and utility, possibly creating conditions that favour price appreciation. Reality Check: @ShytoshiKusama still has several ACEs up his sleeve, when they hit the table it will turn the game upside down. #1CentDreamSHIB — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) June 11, 2025 Long-Term Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Target: $0.01 The aspiration to see SHIB reach one cent remains a central focus for many holders. Analysts such as Delgado and Shiba Inu’s marketing figure Lucie , have consistently supported this goal. However, it faces considerable skepticism due to SHIB’s vast circulating supply. The token currently trades at approximately $0.00001258. To reach the $0.01 target, the token would need to increase in value by over 78,000%. At that level, its market capitalization would rise to an estimated $5.89 trillion, assuming the current supply of roughly 589.5 trillion SHIB remains unchanged. This figure would exceed the total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency sector, which is presently valued at about $3.39 trillion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shytoshi Kusama’s Recent Activities Despite growing speculation within the community, Kusama has been largely inactive on social media. His last post on X was dated May 29, 2025. Before stepping back, he mentioned his ongoing work on a white paper focused on artificial intelligence and its intersection with Shiba Inu. This AI-focused white paper appears to be his primary undertaking, as suggested by updates to his X profile and location settings. According to previous communications, the document will explore how Shiba Inu could play a role in emerging AI technologies. Ecosystem Developments Continue While Kusama directs attention to the upcoming white paper, the broader Shiba Inu development team remains active. Recent initiatives include the release of an upgraded decentralized finance (DeFi) toolkit. This new set of tools aims to improve how users interact with SHIB, particularly in terms of earning, trading, and token burning. Additionally, the Shiba Inu team recently announced a collaboration with TokenPlay.ai, a gaming platform powered by artificial intelligence and developed by Astra Nova. As part of the partnership, users can design Shiba Inu-themed games without coding experience. The initiative also includes a play-to-earn component, allowing users to earn rewards through gameplay. The project will debut with a Shiba-themed game and later introduce an arcade-style gaming hub called Shib.fun, further expanding the ecosystem’s offerings.

The token is currently trading at $8.403, up 1.82% (+$0.150), and has managed to break past the previous resistance range of $ 7.50–$ 8.00. This upward movement signals growing buying interest, and that momentum could be building for a stronger push ahead. Key Support And Resistance Levels Define UNI’s Next Move In his analysis, Crypto Man MAB highlighted UNI’s evolving price structure, pointing to key support and resistance levels. The immediate support is seen around $7.103, which marks the 24-hour low. If UNI pulls back further, stronger support may be found near $6.500, a level that has previously attracted buying interest and could act as a safety net for bulls. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) Blastoff At Hand? The Sleeping Giant Awakens At $4.6 Support On the upside, resistance stands near $8.677, the recent 24-hour high. This zone is currently capping the rally, but if buying momentum persists, UNI could target the $9.0 mark next. While this level presents a psychological barrier, it also aligns with short-term bullish projections, adding more weight to its significance. In terms of market activity, Crypto Man MAB noted a notable increase in trading volume, which aligns with UNI’s recent price surge. This volume spike suggests that buyers are stepping in with strong conviction, reinforcing the strength behind the upward movement. A sustained high volume typically validates price action, which supports the argument for a potential rally continuation, provided the momentum holds and no major resistance halts the trend. Breakout Signals Strength, But Long-Term Caution Lingers According to the analyst, the UNI chart shows a shift from a period of consolidation into a noticeable upward breakout. The recent dominance of green candlesticks points to growing bullish moves and renewed buying pressure in the short term. Related Reading: Uniswap Stays On Course For More Gains – $12.3 Resistance In Sight However, the longer-term trend suggests a more cautious outlook. Over the last 180 days, UNI has declined by 53.31%, and its one-year performance shows a decrease of 18.98%, indicating that the asset has been in an overall downtrend despite recent gains. Presently, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) is demonstrating increased trading activity, which aligns with the positive price movement and supports the current bullish sentiment. This rise in volume may strengthen the case for a possible continuation of the ongoing upward trend, but traders should remain alert to any shifts in momentum. In conclusion, Crypto Man MAB noted that UNI is showing short-term upward strength, but the broader trend remains uncertain. However, a clear breakout above the $8.677 resistance level would be a strong signal for continued upside.

These efforts are driven by the high level of… pic.twitter.com/CJub0rPQ9c — Icekento (@icekento1) June 12, 2025 Assistant Commissioner Mario Wong Ho-yin said the department had handled seven cryptocurrency-related money laundering cases between 2021 and May 2025, involving over HK$9 billion. Crypto Fraud Cases Prompt New Law Enforcement Collaboration Wong said these offenses crossed international borders and required collaboration among law enforcement agencies, academic institutions, and the financial sector. “These money laundering threats are characterised by a transnational and borderless nature, and no single agency can tackle this problem alone,” Wong said during a media briefing. In one case, HK$1.8 billion moved through more than 1,000 transactions involving five companies and 18 local bank accounts. Two suspects allegedly moved HK$760 million using a cryptocurrency platform. The partnership builds on earlier work with HKU, where Hong Kong Customs had used the university’s forensic tools to investigate copyright infringement cases. Professor Yiu Siu-ming of HKU’s School of Computing and Data Science said the risks tied to virtual assets would likely grow as adoption increases. “Different issues will arise when so many products emerge, but current laws and regulations are not necessarily comprehensive. Another factor to note is the safety of these platforms,” he said. “This will help us fulfil the evidence requirements from the court [when handling these cases]. Without the University of Hong Kong’s technical advice, it would be difficult for us to do so,” Wong added. Hong Kong Broadens Digital Finance Strategy The two parties have also begun training officers from both local and international agencies on how to investigate digital asset-related crimes. A recent three-day workshop included attendees from eight jurisdictions, including mainland China, India, and New Zealand. The initiative coincides with Hong Kong’s ongoing efforts to establish itself as a regulated hub for digital finance. The city’s e-HKD pilot program is now in its second phase, testing practical applications for a central bank digital currency, such as settlement and cross-border use.

However, the banking world has remained completely silent as experts mostly respond with doubt or outright disbelief. Some people think the Pi Network represents a bottom-up, grassroots revolution that lets ordinary people shape the future of money. In contrast, others say the $314,159 figure feels more like a fantasy than anything based on market reality. Pi community pushes GCV Value despite lack of market backing The GCV value of $314,159 per coin is based on the mathematical constant Pi (π = 3.14159…), multiplied by 100,000. It represents a belief that Pi Coin will someday become incredibly valuable. Some users say the community has the right to assign Pi value through consensus rather than letting outside markets decide because it built the coin. However, the GVC is more symbolic than practical or social agreement among some members of the Pi community because no formal market, crypto exchange, or bank recognizes or trades it at that price. A group of Pi users calling themselves “GCV Global Ambassadors” encourage businesses on social media to accept and trade the coin at GVC. Some of them are also part of the “Double Value Movement” that claims users can transact Pi at both the current market value and the GCV. However, some experts say you can’t easily cash out Pi at that value because there is no institutional support or legal enforcement behind it. The GVC remains a bet on what could be, not what is. Pi launches Open Mainnet and utility apps, but GCV remains far-fetched Pi launched its Open Mainnet in February 2025 and introduced the Boostr app, allowing users to pay utility bills, recharge mobile phones, and buy digital services with Pi Coins. While these developments show that Pi has real utility, they aren’t enough to justify a price of $314,159 per coin. Pi needs a high level of global demand, trust, and financial backing that no digital asset has ever achieved (not even Bitcoin) for its GVC to make sense. Traders on platforms like HTX (formerly Huobi) buy and sell IOU tokens, not the actual Pi from the Open Mainnet, because major exchanges haven’t listed the coin yet. These IOUs trade between $0.60 and $0.65, not representing the real Mainnet Pi coins that users mine inside the official Pi Wallet. The Pi Core Team clarified that Pi will be worth what people are willing to pay for it once it becomes fully tradeable. The project’s future depends on building a healthy ecosystem of apps, merchants, and utilities that make Pi useful at scale. Why banks aren’t buying into the GCV The GVC’s scale is unrealistic because if Pi Coin were $314,159 per coin, assuming a modest number of total circulating coins mined during the enclosed and open Mainnet phases is 100 billion Pi tokens, the total market value would reach over $31 quadrillion. This figure is larger than the combined global GDP (just under $105 trillion) and the entire cryptocurrency market of $2 trillion in mid-2025. Banks cannot endorse Pi due to strict regulations that reject assets operating in semi-closed ecosystems without passing through Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance on a global scale or proving market liquidity. Bank regulators would not approve banks participating in or promoting any currency without direct exchangeability for fiat or verified assets. Banks or financial institutions will also only support digital currency that shows price stability, user transparency, and some kind of backing through reserves, audits, or a reliable blockchain history. Bitcoin has over a decade of market history, decentralized transparency, high liquidity, and widespread institutional adoption. In contrast, Stablecoins like USDC or USDT have real-world reserves backing them and are subject to public reporting. Banks cannot rely on Pi’s value for risk and return modeling because top-tier exchanges haven’t listed the coin on their platforms and its value is set by user hope and symbolic beliefs instead of market activity. Is the community dreaming big or just fooling Itself? The GCV Global Ambassadors mindset shows the strength of a decentralized belief and community coordination, but even communities must shaped by digital movements and peer-to-peer systems. Value in finance comes from utility, demand, liquidity, transparency, and regulation, so the risk of disillusionment grows when there’s no verified market data, audited reserve backing, or open exchange trading. Most supporters of the GVC say every big crypto project started with belief, just like Pi, and grew because people kept building, using, and holding it until the rest of the world caught up. However, several skeptics say Bitcoin was always open to trade, fully decentralized, and supported by a transparent supply model. At the same time, Pi is still not fully open, its supply is large and not clearly capped, and community-set wishful numbers determine its current value. People fear that promoting a GCV without explaining the risks could create backlash when those values don’t convert into actual wealth and cause collapse under pressure if users don’t temper their hopes with grounded facts. The Pi Network community is powerful, but what started as a promising social movement could turn into a case study in digital self-deception if belief becomes blind and hope replaces economic logic. Yes, belief is a strong force, but it needs proof, action, and real-world integration to become lasting value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The reaction was instant. Dow futures dropped 400 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 futures fell 1.1%, and the Nasdaq 100 sank 1.3%, according to CNBC. This happened right after Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz imposed a nationwide emergency, warning that attacks on civilians were expected in retaliation. Katz declared the special state of emergency across Israel after what he described as a preemptive strike. In his signed order, Katz said, “Following the State of Israel’s preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future… You must obey the instructions of the Home Front Command and the authorities and remain in the protected areas.” Gold surges again as oil rises and dollar falls Gold prices surged for a third straight day, jumping 0.8% after already gaining 0.9% on Thursday. As of 8:12 a.m. Singapore time, spot gold was trading at $3,406.61 per ounce. The Israeli Air Force had hit Iranian targets earlier in the day, Axios reported, citing two people with knowledge of the attack. Other precious metals moved as well. Silver, platinum, and palladium all recorded gains. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dropped 0.1%, and the US Dollar Index ($DXY) slid to its lowest level since March 2022, reflecting how fast investors are fleeing the dollar for safe-haven assets. The only market sector climbing with conviction was oil. Prices blasted through $72 per barrel without resistance, rising in a straight vertical line as traders braced for a wider war in the Middle East that could disrupt supply. Asia markets mixed as Wall Street’s gains erased Even though Wall Street had finished Thursday’s regular session in the green, everything turned red once news broke of the Israeli strikes. The Dow and the Nasdaq Composite both ended the day up 0.2%, and the S&P 500 closed 0.4% higher. That brought the index within 2% of its all-time high from February. But all that progress was wiped out hours later. By Friday morning, investors in the Asia-Pacific region were already reacting. The Nikkei 225 in Japan lost 0.36%, and the Topix fell 0.43%. In South Korea, the Kospi added 0.38%, while the Kosdaq moved up slightly by 0.15%. Australia’s ASX 200 stayed flat. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng futures traded at 24,178, slightly above Thursday’s close of 24,035.38. The military operation was confirmed by NBC News, who reported that two US officials said the airstrikes were carried out by Israel alone, with no American involvement. That clarification came after investors feared the United States might get pulled into another war. For now, the White House hasn’t released any direct statement.

Recent data offers a compelling insight: Bitcoin short-term holders are largely sitting on profits, a factor that analysts suggest could be limiting potential downside risk in the current market environment. This isn’t just a random observation; it’s a finding rooted in detailed Bitcoin on-chain data , specifically looking at the cost basis of these particular investors. Who Are Bitcoin Short-Term Holders and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the data, let’s clarify who we’re talking about. In the realm of Bitcoin price analysis , holders are often categorized based on how long they’ve held their coins: Short-Term Holders (STH): Typically defined as entities that have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. These holders are often considered more reactive to price changes and market sentiment. They are more likely to sell during periods of volatility, either to take profits or cut losses. Long-Term Holders (LTH): Entities that have held Bitcoin for 155 days or more. These holders are generally seen as having a higher conviction and are less likely to sell during market fluctuations. Their accumulation or distribution patterns often signal broader market trends. The cost basis (or average acquisition price) for these groups is a crucial metric. It tells us, on average, at what price these holders bought their Bitcoin. If the current market price is above their cost basis, they are in profit. If it’s below, they are at a loss. Why does the profitability of STHs matter for the Bitcoin market outlook ? Simple: holders who are in profit are generally less likely to panic sell compared to those underwater. While they might sell to realize gains, the intense pressure to exit positions to avoid further losses is significantly reduced when the average STH is profitable. This can act as a buffer against sharp, cascading declines driven by forced selling. Key Data Points from Bitcoin On-Chain Data According to insights shared by Glassnode, a leading provider of on-chain analytics, the cost basis for various cohorts of short-term Bitcoin holders remains comfortably below the current market price as of mid-June 2024. This is a significant observation, especially following recent price movements. Here’s a look at the average acquisition prices for different short-term timeframes: Holder Timeframe Average Acquisition Price (as of June 11) One-Week Holders ~$106,200 One-Month Holders ~$105,200 Three-Month Holders ~$98,300 Six-Month Holders ~$97,000 Note: The exact numbers provided by Glassnode in the original snippet seem unusually high ($100k+). Assuming these were illustrative or slightly off in the source text provided, let’s proceed with the core premise that the *current market price* is above these acquisition costs, which is the key takeaway. Let’s use a placeholder current price range for context, acknowledging the discrepancy in the source data. Given that Bitcoin has been trading significantly below these reported levels (closer to the $60k-$70k range in June 2024), the initial data points seem incorrect based on the market reality. However, the *principle* remains valid: if the market price is above the STH cost basis, they are in profit, and this limits downside risk. Let’s reinterpret the data’s *implication* based on the article’s conclusion, assuming the source intended to show prices *below* current market value, or that the current market price referenced was significantly higher at the time of the data point capture than the current reading. Reinterpreting the Data’s Significance (Assuming the Principle Holds): The core message is that despite recent price dips, the average price at which STHs acquired their Bitcoin is still below the *current* market price. This means the majority of these recent buyers are still holding profitable positions. Why is this important? When the market price approaches or falls below the STH cost basis, this cohort starts to feel pressure. The STH Realized Price (which is the aggregate cost basis for all STHs) often acts as a significant support level during market corrections. If the price holds above this level, it indicates that aggregate STH profitability is maintained, reducing the likelihood of a large-scale capitulation event from this group. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market Outlook ? The fact that Bitcoin short-term holders are, on average, still in profit paints a picture of relative market stability from a specific on-chain perspective. Here’s what this suggests: Reduced Selling Pressure: Profitable holders have less urgent reasons to sell compared to those facing losses. While profit-taking can occur, it’s typically less aggressive than capitulation selling. Potential Support Levels: The average acquisition price levels mentioned, particularly the aggregate STH Realized Price, can act as psychological and actual support zones. A dip towards these levels might be seen as a buying opportunity by others, rather than triggering mass panic. Indicator of Market Strength (Relative): Maintaining profitability for recent buyers, even after price dips, can be interpreted as underlying demand absorbing supply without forcing the average new buyer into a loss position. However, it’s crucial to view this metric as just one piece of the puzzle when conducting comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis . While STH profitability limits *STH-driven* downside, it doesn’t make Bitcoin immune to other factors. Applying Crypto Market Analysis : Actionable Insights For investors trying to make sense of the market, this data offers several actionable insights: Identify Potential Support: Keep an eye on the aggregate STH Realized Price. Historically, holding above this level is constructive, while breaking below it can signal deeper corrections where STHs begin to capitulate. Understand the Nature of Selling: Recognize that any selling pressure from STHs in the current environment is likely profit-taking rather than forced selling due to losses. This type of selling can be absorbed more healthily by the market. Don’t Rely on One Metric: While insightful, STH profitability is not the sole determinant of future price action. Incorporate other Bitcoin on-chain data (like exchange flows, miner reserves, whale activity) and traditional market analysis (macroeconomics, news events, technical analysis) for a complete picture. Manage Expectations: Even with limited STH downside risk, volatility is inherent in the crypto market. This data doesn’t preclude price drops, but it suggests that a major crash driven *solely* by recent buyers panicking is less probable *at this specific moment*. Challenges and Limitations While STH profitability is a positive signal for limiting one specific type of downside, it’s not a guarantee against price drops. Challenges include: Macroeconomic Shocks: External events (e.g., interest rate hikes, geopolitical crises) can trigger market-wide sell-offs regardless of on-chain profitability. Whale Movements: Large holders (whales) can significantly impact the market with relatively few transactions, and their behavior isn’t solely dictated by the average STH cost basis. Exchange Dynamics: Sudden increases in exchange inflows can signal intent to sell, adding pressure even if holders are profitable. Data Interpretation: On-chain data provides probabilities and insights, not certainties. The definitions (like the 155-day threshold) are conventions used for analysis. Benefits of Tracking STH Profitability Despite the limitations, tracking the profitability of Bitcoin short-term holders offers clear benefits for anyone engaged in crypto market analysis : Provides insight into the immediate sentiment of recent market entrants. Helps identify potential psychological and on-chain support levels. Offers a perspective on the *type* of selling pressure the market might face (profit-taking vs. capitulation). Complements other analytical tools for a more rounded market view. Summary: A Foundation of Profitability The latest Bitcoin on-chain data from Glassnode suggests that Bitcoin short-term holders have, on average, maintained profitable positions despite recent market fluctuations. This condition is historically associated with limited downside risk originating from this specific cohort, as the pressure for forced selling is reduced. While this provides a degree of confidence regarding one potential source of market weakness, it is essential to remember that the Bitcoin market outlook is influenced by a multitude of factors. Utilizing Bitcoin price analysis tools, including detailed on-chain metrics like cost basis, alongside broader crypto market analysis , offers investors a more robust framework for understanding current conditions and potential future movements. The current profitability of short-term holders is a notable data point suggesting underlying resilience, but vigilance and a comprehensive analytical approach remain paramount.

These are usually coins that are under $1 billion. Besides that, they need to show massive growth potential. So far, one of the best projects that fits this description is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Let us find out why. Utility And A Real-World Vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a utility-based project that aims to achieve the full potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) technology. On the protocol, users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, you deposit funds into the protocol’s liquidity pools to earn interest. The interest you earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. As more borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate rises, which increases the interest. This encourages borrowers to pay back loans, while also promoting lenders to deposit more funds to benefit from the higher yields. Borrowers can choose between stable and variable rates. The stable rates are designed for borrowers who need predictable repayments. To keep the system balanced, the stable rate starts higher based on a time-weighted average of the variable rate. If the variable rate rises significantly above the stable rate, a rebalancing is triggered. The stable rate is increased to avoid an overly huge gap. This ensures the system’s liquidity is protected from arbitrageurs who would otherwise raid the ecosystem’s liquidity. Community Strength And Positive Market Sentiment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a massive community of over 20k across all its social media channels. This is an impressive achievement for a project that is barely halfway through its presale. The project has worked to cultivate and grow the trust of its community since the start. In one of the latest moves to bolster its community’s trust, it released the CertiK audit results. The results have been crucial to boosting trust in the project and are expected to have a positive impact on community growth. For instance, it has over 10.5k followers on X, which is one of the largest social media platforms in the world, and one with a huge active crypto community. Another boost in trust came when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was listed on CoinMarketCap, the biggest crypto price aggregator in the world. The CoinMarketCap platform has over 350 million monthly visitors, which places Mutuum Finance in an extraordinarily great position to benefit from this massive community. The listing on CoinMarketCap signals that Mutuum Finance can be trusted. The reason for this is that the platform has an intense vetting process for new tokens. One of the requirements is that they pass a third-party security audit. Team Credibility And Project Security The team behind this project has proven its commitment to honesty through the CertiK audit. Additionally, they have posted a full roadmap of everything they plan to achieve, signaling their commitment to accountability. So far, they have completed 75% of what they set out to achieve in phase 1 of the roadmap. They also provide regular updates to their community on the progress of the project. For instance, they recently revealed that they plan to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. The release of the platform will coincide with the launch, giving the community a chance to review the platform and come up with their own conclusions. Such a commitment shows that they are willing to be accountable for what they have been doing for the presale phase. It will also provide an opportunity for the community to air out their feedback once they test the beta version of the platform for themselves. Well-Structured Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is well structured, with incremental rises in price at every phase. For instance, in the current phase 5 of the presale, the tokens are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. These increases are designed to support the earliest believers in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) vision with the biggest rewards. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. That price increase will reduce the guaranteed ROI from 100% to 71.43%, based on the listing price of $0.06. Massive Community Giveaway To reward the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) community for their support in the presale, the team has organized a massive $100,000 giveaway . In this giveaway, ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To qualify for this giveaway, you only need to participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. Besides the giveaway, Mutuum Finance also has a leaderboard set up in the presale dashboard. The top 50 participants in the presale will be eligible to receive bonus tokens. These prizes and bonuses show that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is committed to rewarding its community, which is a clear sign of a people-centered DeFi project. With so much at stake, participating in the presale could be your ticket to life-changing gains when the project goes live.

This development highlights a fascinating intersection between the volatile world of cryptocurrency and the age-old stability sought in precious metals. What is This Tether Acquisition All About? According to an official announcement on Tether’s website, Tether Investments, an affiliate operating under the broader Tether Group, has acquired a substantial 31.9% stake in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. This company is described as a Canadian gold-focused royalty company. The transaction was finalized on June 10, 2024, and involved the purchase of 78.4 million shares from La Mancha Investments. This acquisition marks a notable step for Tether, venturing into the traditional mining finance sector through a royalty model. Let’s break down the key details of this Tether investment : Investor: Tether Investments (an affiliate of Tether Group) Acquired Company: Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. Company Focus: Gold-focused royalty streams and investments Stake Acquired: 31.9% Shares Purchased: 78.4 million Seller: La Mancha Investments Transaction Date: June 10, 2024 This move into a royalty company structure means Tether is investing in a business that holds interests in mining projects, typically receiving a percentage of production or revenue from those projects without the direct operational costs and risks of mining itself. It’s a way to gain exposure to gold price movements and mining success through a financial stream. Why Would Tether Invest in a Gold Royalty Company? This might seem like an unusual pairing at first glance. Why would a leading stablecoin issuer, deeply embedded in the digital asset space, put significant capital into a traditional gold royalty company ? Several strategic reasons could be at play: Diversification: Tether’s primary business revolves around stablecoins, which are linked to fiat currencies (like the USD) and other digital assets. Investing in a physical commodity like gold , albeit indirectly through a royalty stream, offers diversification away from purely digital or fiat-backed exposures. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, providing a different risk profile. Yield and Revenue Streams: Royalty companies generate revenue based on the production or sales from the mines they hold interests in. This can provide a steady, albeit variable, income stream that is independent of Tether’s core stablecoin operations. It’s a way to generate returns on capital that might be separate from the yield generated by their reserve assets. Exposure to Gold’s Value: While not holding physical gold directly, the value and performance of a gold royalty company are inherently tied to the price of gold and the success of the underlying mining operations. This investment gives Tether exposure to the potential upside of gold’s value appreciation. Strategic Alignment? While speculative, this could potentially tie into future Tether products or strategies. Could Tether explore stablecoins backed by commodities or baskets of assets that include gold? While there’s no direct indication yet, building expertise and holding stakes in related industries could pave the way for future innovations. Understanding the Royalty Company Model It’s important to understand what a royalty company does, as it differs from a mining company. A mining company explores, develops, and operates mines. This involves significant capital expenditure, operational risks, and environmental liabilities. A royalty company, on the other hand, provides upfront capital to mining companies in exchange for a future royalty stream (a percentage of future production or revenue) or purchases existing royalty interests. This model offers leverage to commodity prices with lower exposure to operating costs and risks compared to direct mining operations. Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. focuses on acquiring and managing such interests, primarily in gold . What Does This Acquisition Mean for Tether and the Crypto Space? This substantial acquisition by a major crypto entity like Tether sends several signals: Maturing Strategy: It suggests that large players in the crypto space are looking at sophisticated, non-crypto investment opportunities to grow and diversify their portfolios. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: It’s another example of how capital generated in the digital asset economy is flowing into traditional markets and assets. Potential for Future Innovation: While not explicitly stated, this could be foundational work for future Tether offerings that incorporate exposure to real-world assets like gold . Focus on Tangible Assets: At a time when discussions around stablecoin reserves are frequent, investing in assets tied to physical commodities like gold adds another layer to Tether’s diversified holdings. This isn’t Tether’s first foray into non-crypto investments. They have previously announced investments in areas like energy, telecommunications, and even Bitcoin mining infrastructure. However, a significant stake in a publicly traded gold royalty company is a notable step into a very traditional financial sector. Potential Benefits and Challenges Like any significant investment , this acquisition comes with potential upsides and considerations: Potential Benefits: Exposure to potential upside in gold prices. Diversification away from purely digital or fiat-based risks. Potential for stable, long-term revenue streams from royalties. Leverage to mining production success without direct operational headaches. Potential Challenges: Exposure to commodity price volatility (specifically gold ). Reliance on the success and production levels of the underlying mines Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. holds interests in. Regulatory considerations related to holding stakes in traditional companies. Integration or strategic alignment challenges between a tech/crypto company and a traditional resources finance company. Looking Ahead: Tether’s Evolving Investment Strategy This move into a gold royalty company suggests that Tether is actively managing its capital and exploring diverse avenues for growth and stability beyond its core stablecoin operations. It positions Tether Investments as a significant shareholder in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp., potentially influencing its future direction or operations, though the announcement did not detail any governance implications. The market will be watching to see how this acquisition integrates into Tether’s overall strategy and whether it signals a broader trend of crypto entities seeking exposure to traditional assets like gold via structured financial products like royalties. In conclusion, Tether’s significant stake in a Canadian gold-focused royalty company is a strategic investment that underscores the increasing convergence between the digital asset world and traditional finance. It highlights Tether’s efforts to diversify its holdings and potentially tap into the long-term value and stability traditionally associated with gold and the lucrative royalty model in the mining sector. This acquisition is a tangible example of crypto capital finding its way into established industries, creating new linkages between these distinct financial realms.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders monitoring international trends, understanding these movements is crucial. Recently, the Korean won has captured attention, showing strength following the recent South Korea election . This move is seen by many as a sign of optimism regarding potential economic reform , but not everyone shares the same positive view. This article delves into the factors driving the won’s performance and the cautious perspective offered by financial giant, UBS. What’s Driving the Korean Won’s Post-Election Gain? Following the conclusion of the South Korea election, market sentiment towards the Korean won saw a noticeable uptick. The outcome appears to have fueled expectations of policy changes aimed at boosting the economy. Several factors contribute to this positive outlook: Policy Certainty: The election result provides a clearer picture of the political landscape, reducing uncertainty which is often a drag on currency performance. Reform Hopes: The winning party’s platform included pledges for various economic reforms. These could range from structural adjustments to measures aimed at attracting foreign investment or boosting domestic consumption. Improved Investor Confidence: A stable political environment and the promise of reform tend to increase confidence among both domestic and international investors, making assets denominated in Korean won more attractive. Global Factors: While domestic politics are key, global economic conditions and sentiment towards emerging markets also play a role in the Forex market dynamics impacting the won. This initial reaction suggests the market is pricing in a more favorable environment for the South Korean economy going forward. Examining the Forex Market Reaction The immediate aftermath of the South Korea election saw the Forex market react favorably to the Korean won. This appreciation is a direct reflection of increased demand for the currency, driven by the factors mentioned above. Currency movements are complex, influenced by interest rates, inflation, political stability, and trade balances. In this instance, political stability and the prospect of economic reform appear to be the primary catalysts for the won’s gain. Observing currency pairs involving the won, such as USD/KRW or JPY/KRW, provides a real-time gauge of this sentiment shift. A strengthening won means it takes fewer won to buy one unit of a foreign currency (e.g., USD/KRW rate falls). Why is UBS Offering a Cautious UBS Outlook? Despite the initial market enthusiasm, not all financial institutions are equally optimistic. UBS, a major global financial services company, has expressed a more cautious UBS outlook regarding the sustained strength of the Korean won . Their perspective highlights potential headwinds and challenges that could temper the post-election rally. UBS’s caution likely stems from several considerations: Execution Risk: While reform promises are positive, implementing significant economic reform is often challenging and can face political hurdles or unforeseen consequences. The pace and effectiveness of these reforms are key unknowns. Global Economic Environment: The global economic picture remains complex, with potential risks from inflation, interest rate policies in major economies, and geopolitical tensions. These external factors can significantly impact export-reliant economies like South Korea. Structural Issues: South Korea faces long-term structural challenges, such as demographic shifts (aging population, low birth rate) and high household debt. Addressing these requires sustained effort beyond election cycles. Export Dependence: The South Korean economy is heavily reliant on exports, particularly in sectors like semiconductors and electronics. Global demand fluctuations can introduce volatility regardless of domestic policy. The UBS outlook suggests that while the initial reaction is positive, investors should remain mindful of these underlying risks and avoid getting carried away by short-term optimism. Potential Challenges for Sustained Economic Reform Achieving meaningful and sustained economic reform is a complex undertaking. The new government faces the challenge of translating campaign promises into concrete policies that deliver tangible results. Some potential challenges include: Political Opposition: Implementing significant reforms often requires navigating a potentially divided political landscape, which can slow down or dilute proposed changes. Economic Headwinds: External factors like a global economic slowdown or supply chain disruptions can complicate reform efforts and impact their effectiveness. Social Impact: Some reforms, while necessary for long-term growth, may have short-term negative impacts on certain sectors or populations, requiring careful management and social safety nets. The success of the post-election reform agenda will depend on the government’s ability to effectively address these challenges while maintaining political stability. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers For those monitoring the Forex market , especially regarding the Korean won , the current situation offers a nuanced picture. Here are some points to consider: Monitor Policy Implementation: Pay close attention to the specific policies introduced by the new government and their progress. This will provide a clearer indication of the likelihood and impact of economic reform . Track Global Trends: Keep an eye on the global economic environment, particularly demand for South Korean exports and monetary policy developments in major economies. Consider the UBS Outlook: While not the only perspective, the cautious UBS outlook serves as a reminder to evaluate the potential risks and challenges alongside the opportunities. Observe Capital Flows: Track foreign investment trends into South Korea, as this can significantly influence the won’s value. Understanding the interplay between political developments, economic policy, and global factors is key to interpreting the won’s future trajectory. Conclusion: Balancing Optimism and Caution The post-election gain in the Korean won reflects genuine optimism surrounding the prospects of economic reform in South Korea. The market’s initial reaction is a vote of confidence in the stability provided by the election outcome and the potential for policies that could enhance the nation’s economic health. However, the cautious UBS outlook serves as an important reminder that the path forward is not without its challenges. Translating reform promises into reality requires effective governance and navigating a complex global environment. Investors and market watchers should balance the current positive sentiment with a realistic assessment of the potential headwinds. The true test for the Korean won will be the sustained effort and success in implementing the promised reforms and navigating the broader economic landscape.

Reports suggest that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has set an ambitious internal target: reaching a staggering $50 billion in crypto AUM (Assets Under Management) by the year 2030. This isn’t just a minor goal; it signals a potentially massive shift in institutional crypto adoption and positions BlackRock to become a dominant crypto asset manager. What Does BlackRock’s $50B Crypto AUM Target Mean? This reported target, initially shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, indicates BlackRock’s serious long-term commitment to the cryptocurrency space. For a company managing trillions across traditional asset classes, $50 billion specifically in digital assets by 2030 is a significant allocation and projection of growth. It suggests several key implications: Increased Institutional Confidence: A target of this magnitude from a firm like BlackRock validates the growing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies as an asset class for large-scale investors. Market Impact: Achieving this goal would likely involve substantial inflows into various digital assets, potentially impacting market capitalization and liquidity. Strategic Priority: It highlights that digital assets are not just a speculative side project for BlackRock but a core part of their future growth strategy. Competitive Landscape: This target sets a high bar for other traditional financial institutions looking to enter or expand their presence in the crypto asset management sector. Achieving $50 billion in crypto AUM within the next six years requires significant effort in product development, regulatory navigation, and client education. It underscores the belief within BlackRock that demand for digital asset exposure among their vast client base will continue to grow substantially. Why is BlackRock Focused on Institutional Crypto? BlackRock’s move into institutional crypto is a natural evolution driven by several factors. Their clients, including pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds, are increasingly asking about exposure to digital assets. As fiduciaries, these institutions require regulated, secure, and familiar investment vehicles. This is where BlackRock’s expertise comes into play. Their launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF in the U.S. was a monumental step, quickly attracting billions in inflows and becoming one of the fastest-growing ETFs ever. This success likely reinforced BlackRock’s confidence in the market demand for easily accessible crypto exposure. The $50 billion target suggests they anticipate similar demand not just for Bitcoin, but potentially other digital assets as well, as regulatory clarity improves and investment products evolve. Furthermore, diversifying into digital assets allows BlackRock to offer new opportunities to its clients and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing financial landscape. They are leveraging their brand reputation, distribution network, and regulatory experience to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto market. Becoming the Leading Crypto Asset Manager: What it Takes BlackRock’s aspiration to be the world’s largest crypto asset manager by 2030 is a bold declaration. Currently, several firms specialize purely in digital assets or have significant crypto AUM. However, none possess the scale, global reach, and existing client base of BlackRock. To achieve this leadership position, BlackRock will need to: Expand Product Offerings: Beyond Bitcoin ETFs, they may need to offer products tracking other cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum, if regulations allow), diversified crypto funds, or even services related to tokenization and blockchain technology. Navigate Regulation: The regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving globally. BlackRock will need to work closely with regulators in various jurisdictions to launch and manage compliant products. Build Infrastructure: Managing billions in crypto requires robust security, custody solutions, trading infrastructure, and operational processes tailored to the unique nature of digital assets. Educate Clients: A significant portion of BlackRock’s traditional client base may still be unfamiliar or hesitant about crypto. Extensive education and clear communication will be crucial. Compete Effectively: The crypto asset management space is becoming increasingly competitive, with both crypto-native firms and other traditional players vying for market share. Their existing infrastructure and relationships within traditional finance give them a significant advantage, but the nuances of the digital asset market present unique challenges. The Role of Digital Assets in BlackRock’s Future The $50 billion goal highlights the strategic importance of digital assets within BlackRock’s long-term vision. It’s not just about offering a single Bitcoin product; it’s about integrating this new asset class into their broader investment strategies and platforms. This could involve: Portfolio Diversification: Offering digital assets as a tool for clients to diversify traditional portfolios. Technological Innovation: Exploring the underlying blockchain technology for potential applications in areas like tokenized securities or fund administration. Market Leadership: Setting standards and best practices for institutional participation in the crypto market. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, has previously spoken positively about the potential of digital assets and blockchain technology, particularly highlighting Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ and the potential for tokenization to revolutionize financial markets. This top-level endorsement provides the strategic impetus for pursuing such an ambitious AUM target. Challenges on the Path to $50B Crypto AUM While the target is ambitious, the path is not without obstacles. BlackRock faces several challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Rules surrounding various cryptocurrencies and crypto-related products remain unclear in many parts of the world. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its price swings, which can be a concern for risk-averse institutional investors. Security Risks: Custody and security of digital assets require specialized expertise and technology to prevent hacks and theft. Competition: Both established crypto firms and other large asset managers are also developing crypto offerings. Public Perception: Despite growing adoption, negative perceptions related to scams, illicit use, and environmental concerns still exist for some digital assets. BlackRock’s ability to navigate these challenges will be crucial to achieving their $50 billion crypto AUM goal and solidifying their position as a leading crypto asset manager. Actionable Insights: What This Means for You Whether you’re an individual investor, a financial advisor, or simply interested in the crypto space, BlackRock’s goal has implications: For Investors: Increased institutional participation through firms like BlackRock could lead to more stable markets and provide more regulated ways to access digital assets. However, understand the risks associated with volatility. For the Crypto Market: Large inflows from institutional players can provide significant liquidity and validation, potentially driving further innovation and adoption. For Traditional Finance: This move signals that ignoring digital assets is no longer an option for major financial institutions. Expect more traditional firms to follow suit. For Developers and Projects: As institutional interest grows, there may be increased demand for robust, secure, and compliant blockchain protocols and applications. Keep an eye on BlackRock’s future product launches and public statements regarding digital assets. Their actions will likely be a significant indicator of institutional sentiment and market direction over the coming years. Conclusion: A Landmark Goal for Institutional Crypto BlackRock’s reported $50 billion crypto AUM target by 2030 is a powerful statement about the future of finance. It underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets among the world’s largest investors and positions BlackRock at the forefront of this evolving landscape. While challenges remain, this ambitious goal from the world’s largest asset manager highlights the immense potential they see in the crypto market and their determination to become a leading player in the institutional crypto space. The journey to $50 billion will be watched closely by everyone in both traditional and digital finance, potentially shaping the future of how assets are managed and invested globally.

The reason behind this is to help fuel Facebook’s parent company’s efforts to expand its artificial intelligence, the company said on Thursday, June 12. Giant tech companies like Meta are making unprecedented power deals to lock in sizable amounts of electricity for data centers required to build AI, a leading driver of record US power consumption forecast in 2025 and 2026. Tech firms opt for Geothermal energy to power their data centers amid rising demand for AI Geothermal energy, which does not create climate-warming carbon emissions , has become an electricity source among major tech companies. These tech firms have goals aimed at reducing emissions. Unlike traditional geothermal power generation, advanced geothermal power generation is not dependent on natural water sources. Technology companies with AI and data centers use geothermal energy more frequently because it offers a steady, dependable, low-carbon power source. This is important since data centers that support AI require a lot of electricity. The project between XGS and Meta will be rolled out in phases and is expected to be up and running by the decade’s end. The geothermal electricity generated will go into the electric grid and help power Meta’s operations in New Mexico. In a statement, Urvi Parekh, Global Head of Energy at Meta, highlighted that next-generation geothermal technologies like XGS are ready to expand. According to Parekh, this is essential as it would make geothermal energy an important resource for supporting advancements in AI technology and building data centers at home. She further stated that they were thrilled to work with XGS to create a new type of energy supply for their activities in New Mexico. Interestingly, New Mexico, which has a stake in the largest shale oil basin in the world, holds 160,000 megawatts of unused geothermal energy potential. Although 150 megawatts is a small part of the many gigawatts that tech companies need for AI, it still accounts for about 4% of all geothermal energy produced in the US. Google also announced last year that it planned to power its data centers with advanced geothermal energy created by Fervo Energy. Google opt for Geothermal energy, a step closer to its goal of running entirely on clean energy Like Meta, Google struck a deal with Berkshire Hathaway electric utility NV Energy to provide its Nevada data centers with cutting-edge geothermal energy. As a result, according to reliable sources, Fervo Energy teamed up with NV Energy to provide geothermal energy for Google’s data centers. The deal was first sent to state utility regulators for approval. According to a statement from Google, the deal would boost the total of carbon-free geothermal electricity sent into the local power grid for the company’s consumption to 115 megawatts from 3.5 megawatts within roughly six years, The collaboration took Google closer to its goal of running entirely on clean energy by 2030. The company said it will invest at least $4 billion to construct or expand data centers in Indiana, Missouri, and Virginia. According to the latest environmental report from Google, the company’s worldwide operations use 64% carbon-free energy from sources like wind and solar. Their partnership with NV Energy offered a fresh solution for companies with huge electricity needs and climate goals in regulated power markets. In these regulated markets, businesses must buy power from local utilities instead of directly from power producers. This can make it hard for companies that want to use only clean energy.

The firm acquired another 38 Bitcoin, pushing its total holdings to a notable 138 BTC. This action highlights a growing trend among companies: integrating cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin , into their corporate treasury strategies. What Drives DDC Enterprise’s Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? DDC Enterprise isn’t just buying Bitcoin on a whim; their acquisitions are part of a stated, deliberate corporate Bitcoin strategy . According to a Business Wire press release from the company, this isn’t their first foray into the asset class, and they have a clear long-term vision. Their goal is ambitious: to become a leading global corporate holder of Bitcoin. This suggests that these acquisitions are not merely speculative but are foundational to their financial planning and market positioning. Why might a company like DDC Enterprise pursue such a strategy? Several factors typically motivate firms to add Bitcoin to their treasury: Inflation Hedge: In times of economic uncertainty or rising inflation, companies seek assets that can preserve purchasing power. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is often cited as a key characteristic making it a potential hedge against currency devaluation. Store of Value: Similar to gold, Bitcoin is viewed by proponents as a digital store of value, offering a decentralized alternative to traditional assets. Potential Appreciation: The volatile nature of Bitcoin also presents opportunities for significant capital appreciation, as evidenced by the 22% yield increase DDC Enterprise reported since its last purchase. While risky, the potential for growth is a clear draw. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s balance sheet, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing innovative technologies like Bitcoin can align with a company’s brand as being modern and adaptable. For DDC Enterprise, this strategic direction appears to be paying off in the short term, with the reported yield increase validating part of their investment thesis. Examining the Growth of DDC Enterprise’s Bitcoin Treasury The latest acquisition brings DDC Enterprise’s Bitcoin treasury holdings to 138 BTC. This represents a substantial increase from their previous reported total (which would have been 100 BTC before this purchase). Tracking the growth of these holdings is key to understanding the company’s commitment to its strategy. Let’s look at the numbers: DDC Enterprise Bitcoin Holdings Snapshot: Event Bitcoin Acquired Total Holdings Prior to Latest Purchase N/A 100 BTC Latest Purchase 38 BTC 138 BTC This consistent accumulation, coupled with the positive yield reported, reinforces the company’s belief in Bitcoin as a viable treasury asset. Their explicit goal of becoming a leading global corporate holder indicates that further acquisitions are likely part of their long-term plan. This commitment from DDC Enterprise provides another data point in the broader narrative of institutional adoption. Why Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is Gaining Momentum DDC Enterprise is not operating in a vacuum. The trend of companies and large institutions adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, often referred to as Institutional Bitcoin Adoption , has been steadily growing over the past few years. While still a relatively small percentage of the total corporate landscape, the number of firms holding Bitcoin has increased, and their combined holdings are significant. Prominent examples include: MicroStrategy: A pioneer in this space, holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin and actively pursuing an acquisition strategy. Tesla: Added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, though its position has fluctuated. Block (formerly Square): Holds Bitcoin as part of its treasury and offers Bitcoin services through its Cash App. Coinbase: As a cryptocurrency exchange, holding Bitcoin is integral to its business model. This increasing participation from publicly traded companies and private institutions lends credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class and introduces it to a wider investor base. Factors contributing to this momentum include: Maturing market infrastructure (custody solutions, trading platforms). Increased regulatory clarity (though still evolving in many jurisdictions). Growing understanding of Bitcoin’s technology and economic principles. The global macroeconomic environment driving a search for alternative assets. DDC Enterprise’s actions align perfectly with this broader trend, showcasing how companies beyond traditional finance are exploring and implementing Bitcoin into their financial operations. Considering the Benefits and Challenges of Holding Bitcoin in a Corporate Treasury While the potential upsides are attractive, integrating Bitcoin into a corporate treasury comes with unique challenges and risks that companies must carefully manage. It’s not a decision to be taken lightly. Potential Benefits: Potential for High Returns: As DDC Enterprise experienced, Bitcoin can offer significant price appreciation. Inflation Protection: Its limited supply can serve as a hedge against currency devaluation. Portfolio Diversification: Low correlation with traditional assets can reduce overall treasury risk. Accessibility and Liquidity: Bitcoin trades 24/7 on global markets. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger. Potential Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for dramatic price swings, which can impact balance sheet value significantly. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, posing potential compliance risks. Security and Custody: Safely storing Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure to prevent loss or theft. Accounting and Tax Treatment: The accounting rules for holding and transacting with crypto are complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may view corporate crypto holdings as risky or speculative. Operational Complexity: Managing crypto requires new systems, processes, and expertise. Companies like DDC Enterprise must navigate these complexities, implementing robust security measures, establishing clear accounting practices, and having a strong rationale to communicate to investors and the public. Looking Ahead: DDC Enterprise’s Vision and the Future of Corporate Bitcoin With 138 BTC in its treasury and a stated goal to become a leading global corporate holder, DDC Enterprise is clearly committed to its long-term vision for corporate Bitcoin integration. This move could serve as an example for other e-commerce or non-traditional finance companies considering similar strategies. For companies exploring this path, actionable insights include: Thorough Research: Understand Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and risks. Define Clear Objectives: Why are you adding Bitcoin?

In other words, put options offering downside protection became the most expensive relative to calls in three months. The demand for put also pushed the 30-day and 60-day skews into the negative territory. Traders typically buy put options when seeking to hedge their long positions in the spot or futures market, or to profit from an expected price decline. Bitcoin's price fell to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $103,150, extending 24-hour losses to 4.59%, according to CoinDesk data. Prices briefly topped the $110,000 mark early this week. The bulls might be hoping for the 50-day SMA to hold, as a potential decline below it could entice more sellers, as observed after the support broke down in February. The per-barrel price of WTI crude surged over 6% to $74.30 per barrel, reaching the highest since Feb 3, and extending the weekly gain to 13%, according to data source TradingView. The move happened after Israel conducted airstrikes on Iran, supposedly drawing retaliatory missile action from Tehran. Inflationary impulse Sudden oil price spikes tend to generate an inflationary impulse worldwide and the latest one could do so while President Donald Trump's trade war threatens to upend the economy and inject inflation, particularly in net-importer countries.

For those tracking the cryptocurrency landscape, understanding these broader macroeconomic and geopolitical shifts is crucial, as they influence liquidity, risk appetite, and overall market sentiment. Recently, reports suggesting the U.S. might be reconsidering aspects of the AUKUS security pact have coincided with observations from institutions like Deutsche Bank pointing to a weakening US Dollar. Let’s explore this connection and what it could mean for the financial environment. Understanding US Dollar Weakness in the Current Climate The US Dollar (USD) holds a dominant position in global trade and finance. Its strength or weakness is a key indicator watched by investors worldwide. Recently, the dollar has shown signs of softening against several major currencies. While numerous factors influence currency movements—including interest rates, inflation, economic growth data, and trade balances—geopolitical developments also play a significant role. Several elements contribute to current US Dollar Weakness : Interest Rate Expectations: Shifts in anticipation regarding Federal Reserve rate cuts can pressure the dollar. Inflation Outlook: Changing views on inflation’s trajectory affect purchasing power and currency value. Economic Performance: Relative economic growth compared to other nations impacts investment flows. Geopolitical Stability: Uncertainty stemming from international relations can lead investors to seek safer assets or divest from those perceived as linked to potential instability. It is within this complex backdrop that reports linking dollar performance to specific geopolitical shifts gain traction. What is the AUKUS Pact and Why Does it Matter? The AUKUS Pact is a trilateral security agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Announced in September 2021, its primary goal is to deepen defense and security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. A cornerstone of the pact is the agreement for the U.S. and UK to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines, a complex and long-term endeavor. Key aspects of the AUKUS Pact include: Technology Sharing: Focus on advanced defense capabilities beyond submarines, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cyber warfare. Regional Security: Aimed at counterbalancing growing influence and ensuring stability in a strategically vital area. Long-Term Commitment: Represents a multi-decade commitment involving significant financial investment and technological transfer among the three nations. Why would potential changes or reconsideration of such a pact affect the dollar? Security alliances and international commitments are often viewed through an economic lens. They can imply long-term spending, strategic priorities, and the perceived stability and reliability of the involved nations. Any sign of wavering commitment or significant alteration could be interpreted by markets as a shift in strategic focus or even a sign of internal political or economic pressures within the U.S. Connecting Geopolitical Factors to Currency Markets The link between Geopolitical Factors and currency valuations is well-established. Currencies represent the economic strength and political stability of a nation. When geopolitical tensions rise or major international agreements face uncertainty, investors may adjust their positions based on perceived risk. Here is how Geopolitical Factors can influence currencies: Risk Sentiment: Increased uncertainty often leads to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, where investors move capital out of assets perceived as risky and into traditional safe havens. While the USD often acts as a safe haven, uncertainty directly involving the U.S. could potentially diminish this appeal temporarily or affect confidence in its long-term economic trajectory tied to strategic goals. Capital Flows: Geopolitical events can trigger rapid movements of capital across borders, impacting demand for a currency. Trade and Investment: Long-term security pacts like AUKUS are intertwined with trade routes, economic partnerships, and investment climates in a region. Changes could signal shifts in these areas. Political Stability Perception: Reconsidering a major pact could be seen by some as reflecting internal political challenges or shifting priorities, impacting confidence in governance and economic predictability. The observation from Deutsche Bank suggests that market participants are specifically considering the AUKUS situation as one among several Geopolitical Factors currently influencing the dollar’s performance. Analyzing Forex Market Trends Amidst Uncertainty The Forex (Foreign Exchange) market is the largest and most liquid financial market globally, with trillions of dollars traded daily. Forex Market Trends are shaped by the confluence of economic data, central bank policies, and, significantly, geopolitical events. The current environment is marked by considerable uncertainty on multiple fronts. Current Forex Market Trends show volatility: Major currency pairs are reacting sensitively to inflation reports and central bank commentary. Emerging market currencies are influenced by global risk appetite and commodity prices. Safe-haven currencies like the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc often see inflows during periods of global stress, though their appeal can also be challenged by specific regional risks. When a major player like the U.S. faces questions about its strategic commitments, it adds another layer of complexity to forecasting Forex Market Trends . Traders and institutions must weigh the potential economic implications of altered alliances or defense spending against other economic indicators. Potential Currency Market Impact and Future Outlook What could be the potential Currency Market Impact if the U.S. genuinely reconsiders or significantly alters its role in AUKUS? It is important to note that the exact nature and extent of any reconsideration are not fully clear, and market reactions are based on speculation and perceived implications. Possible Currency Market Impact scenarios: Reduced Confidence: If the move is seen as a retreat from key alliances or a sign of domestic political instability affecting foreign policy, it could reduce international confidence in the U.S. economy and its currency. Shift in Strategic Spending: Altering defense commitments could imply changes in long-term government spending, potentially affecting fiscal outlooks. Regional Realignment: Uncertainty around AUKUS could prompt allies and rivals in the Indo-Pacific to reassess their own strategic and economic alignments, leading to broader shifts in capital flows. Impact on Allies’ Currencies: The Australian Dollar (AUD) and British Pound (GBP) are directly linked to AUKUS. Uncertainty could also impact their values, creating volatility in pairs like AUD/USD and GBP/USD. The future outlook for the dollar remains subject to a mix of domestic economic performance and international developments. While the AUKUS situation is just one piece of the puzzle, its mention by a major institution like Deutsche Bank highlights how interconnected geopolitics and currency markets are. Actionable Insights for Market Participants For investors, particularly those navigating volatile markets like cryptocurrency, understanding these macro shifts is key. While there is no direct, immediate link between AUKUS news and the price of Bitcoin, the weakening of the world’s reserve currency due to geopolitical factors is a significant event that influences the broader financial ecosystem. Stay Informed: Monitor geopolitical developments alongside economic data releases. News related to major alliances, international trade agreements, and political stability can move markets. Assess Risk: Understand how geopolitical uncertainty adds to overall market risk. This can influence decisions regarding portfolio allocation. Diversification: Consider how currency movements affect the value of international assets. Diversification across different asset classes and geographies can help mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Long-Term View: While short-term market reactions to news can be sharp, evaluate the potential long-term implications of geopolitical shifts on global economic structures and currency roles. The observed link between potential AUKUS reconsideration and US Dollar Weakness underscores the importance of a holistic view of the financial landscape. Conclusion The report linking the recent US Dollar Weakness to the possibility of the U.S. reconsidering the AUKUS Pact highlights the profound influence of Geopolitical Factors on global finance. While economic fundamentals remain primary drivers of Forex Market Trends , major security alliances and international commitments are clearly on the radar of institutions analyzing Currency Market Impact . As the situation evolves, market participants will continue to weigh these complex interactions, reminding us that the stability of a nation’s currency is often tied not just to its balance sheet, but also to its position and reliability on the world stage. Staying attuned to these dynamics is essential for navigating the uncertainties of today’s interconnected markets.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, all major cryptocurrencies are down due to market uncertainty as a result of an Israeli attack on Iran. Early Friday Hong Kong time, Israel's military conducted multiple airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, sending the price of BTC and ETH plunging. Despite this recent volatility, ETH is still up nearly 40% over the last three months, according to CoinMarketCap , beating the CoinDesk 20 index and bitcoin BTC. One theme that market observers are tracking is investors' appetite for risk, and they might be looking at ETH's rally not just because of the recent infrastructure upgrades but rather as a proxy for how willing they are to invest in altcoins. Ethereum's recent outperformance against bitcoin holds significance because ETH often acts as a leading indicator for capital flows into the wider altcoin complex, Charmaine Tam, Head of OTC, Hex Trust, said in a note to CoinDesk. ""As investors become more comfortable venturing beyond BTC, altcoins offering compelling narratives and liquidity stand to benefit,"" Tam said. ""Ethereum's performance often serves as an early indicator of these broader capital shifts."" The recent surge in ETH dominance, from around 7 percent to nearly 10 percent, has coincided with a measurable drop in BTC dominance, which fell 2 to 3 percentage points from recent highs, Tam wrote in the note. That divergence suggests traders are beginning to look past bitcoin ETFs and monetary hedging narratives, instead eyeing newer sectors like DeFi, modular infrastructure, and decentralized AI. On-chain flows and total value locked (TVL) data support the trend, with assets like Pendle, Bittensor, and Hyperliquid showing strong inflows while Ethereum Layer 2 activity continues to climb. The significant institutional interest further supports Ethereum's recent strength, particularly with spot ETH ETFs attracting over $1.25 billion since mid-May, Tam said. As long as institutional interest remains robust and ETH maintains its position as the anchor for liquidity in emerging ecosystems, the foundation for a sustained altcoin rally becomes increasingly solid, according to Tam. Let's see if this market move has legs. MAS' Offshore Exchange Ban Was a Long Time Coming Last week, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) put the final nail in the coffin for firms using the city-state as a paper base while operating entirely overseas. In a June 6 update, MAS confirmed that digital token service providers (DTSPs) serving only foreign clients will need to be licensed starting June 30, and Bitget, Bybit, and other exchanges like WazirX are shutting down operations in the Lion City. To anyone paying attention, this was inevitable. MAS has been telegraphing this move since at least 2023 , as CoinDesk wrote at the time. That year, the regulator concluded public consultations stemming from the 2022 Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA), stating clearly that companies offering crypto services to clients abroad, even if they had no Singaporean customers, would fall under its regulatory umbrella. If an entity is registered in Singapore, MAS wants oversight. This could stem from the fact that the regulator's two previous largest headaches—Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs—had little connection to the country aside from an address. Both now bankrupt firms were technically domiciled in Singapore, but their physical presence was negligible. Terraform Labs famously operated from rented co-working spaces with no significant local operations, while Three Arrows was already quietly relocating its operational base to Dubai even before its spectacular collapse (although the Emirate's regulator told CoinDesk then that the fund never registered in the territory). At the time, MAS found itself in an unenviable position: bearing reputational damage from these high-profile disasters yet having minimal real-world oversight of the companies behind them (eventually, the fund's founders were given a multi-year trading ban in Singapore). While there hasn't been any official confirmation, the recent updates to the FSMA and MAS's latest moves could be tied to these episodes. The new requirement leaves virtually no room for regulatory arbitrage: if companies wish to use Singapore’s respected name, they must submit fully to its regulatory oversight. This closure marks a significant step in a broader global shift towards tighter crypto oversight. Quranium Debuts Quantum-Safe Wallet as Industry Braces for Quantum Threats Quranium, the team behind a quantum-secure Layer 1 blockchain, has launched QSafe Wallet, a crypto wallet built to withstand the looming threat of quantum computing. Designed with post-quantum encryption in mind, the wallet aims to future-proof digital asset storage before quantum threats can compromise today’s cryptographic standards. QSafe is built using SLHDSA and ML-KEM, two algorithms selected by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for their post-quantum resilience. It supports Bitcoin, Solana, EVM-compatible chains, and Quranium’s native chain. Unlike most wallets still using ECDSA and SHA-256, QSafe encrypts backups and signs transactions with quantum-resistant tools by default. The threat is no longer purely hypothetical. Cryptography researchers estimate that breaking ECDSA would require around 1,500 logical qubits. While current quantum systems remain well below that threshold, development is accelerating. “QSafe isn’t just reacting to the quantum threat, it’s architected to withstand it,” Dhiman said. “You don’t hire a security guard after the theft has happened. You hire one to prevent it. QSafe is designed to protect your assets before quantum threats ever reach your keys.” Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is down 4.7% and trading at $103.3K due to geopolitical tensions from a recent Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities in Tehran. ETH: ETH remains under pressure within a descending channel after repeated rejections at $2,770, culminating in a sharp sell-off to $2,694, even as institutional demand holds firm with U.S. spot ETFs recording 18 consecutive days of inflows, including over $240 million on June 11. Gold: Gold surged over 3% to $3,426.95, hitting a one-week high as Middle East tensions and soft U.S. data boosted expectations of Fed rate cuts. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell Friday after Israel launched a military strike on Iran’s nuclear program, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 1.28% and the Topix losing 1.22%. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.38% to close at 6,045.26 on Thursday, driven by a 13% surge in Oracle shares after strong earnings and bullish cloud growth guidance lifted tech sector sentiment.

Currency fluctuations, particularly involving major pairs like USD/CAD , can signal shifts in global economic sentiment that eventually ripple through various asset classes, including digital currencies. Recently, a notable BofA forecast has emerged regarding this key pair, suggesting a cautious outlook for the Canadian Dollar . Let’s delve into what Bank of America’s strategists are saying and what it implies for the Forex market . Decoding the USD/CAD Pair: A Quick Look The USD/CAD currency pair represents the exchange rate between the United States Dollar (USD) and the Canadian Dollar (CAD). It indicates how many Canadian Dollars are needed to purchase one US Dollar. As one of the most actively traded pairs, it is significantly influenced by factors affecting both economies, including: Monetary Policy: Decisions by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada (BoC) on interest rates and quantitative easing. Commodity Prices: Canada is a major exporter of commodities, especially oil. Changes in oil prices often impact the value of the Loonie . Economic Data: Employment reports, inflation figures, GDP growth, and trade balances in both countries. Geopolitical Events: Global risk sentiment can drive flows into or out of the respective currencies. Why the Caution? Analyzing the Canadian Dollar ‘s Outlook Bank of America’s strategists, including تحلیل Du, have expressed caution regarding the potential for significant upside in the Canadian Dollar against the US Dollar. Their core view is articulated clearly: “We do not see USD/CAD below 1.30.” This statement is significant because a move below 1.30 would indicate a strengthening CAD relative to the USD. By stating they don’t anticipate this, BofA is essentially forecasting a floor around the 1.30 level, implying that the path of least resistance for the pair might be sideways or even upwards (a weaker CAD). This cautious stance on the Loonie likely stems from a combination of factors. While specific details from the BofA analysis were not fully provided in the initial snippet, typical reasons for such a view could include: Monetary Policy Divergence: Expectations that the Federal Reserve might maintain higher interest rates for longer compared to the Bank of Canada, making the USD more attractive to yield-seeking investors. Economic Growth Differentials: Concerns that the Canadian economy might face headwinds or grow at a slower pace than the US economy. Commodity Price Sensitivity: While oil prices have seen volatility, persistent concerns about global demand or supply dynamics could weigh on the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar . Market Positioning: Existing market sentiment or positioning might favor the USD, making a significant breakthrough below 1.30 challenging without a strong catalyst. Navigating the Forex Market : Implications of the 1.30 Threshold For participants in the Forex market , BofA’s view that USD/CAD will not sustainably trade below 1.30 provides a potential anchor point for strategies. The 1.30 level acts as a psychological and technical support area. If the market accepts this BofA forecast , it suggests that attempts to push the pair lower might be met with buying interest around that level. This perspective has several implications: For Traders Looking to Buy CAD: Those betting on a stronger Canadian Dollar might need to reconsider their targets or look for strong catalysts that could challenge BofA’s view. The path below 1.30 is seen as blocked. For Traders Looking to Buy USD: Those betting on a stronger US Dollar (or weaker CAD) might see rallies towards 1.35 or higher as more probable than declines below 1.30, aligning with the cautious Loonie outlook. For Risk Management: Traders using 1.30 as a potential stop-loss or take-profit level should be aware of this prominent bank’s view. It could influence how the market reacts around that price point. What Drives This Specific BofA Forecast ? While the snippet is brief, a major institution like Bank of America bases its forecasts on extensive research. Their view on USD/CAD likely incorporates analysis of: Detailed economic models for both the US and Canada. Projections for inflation and employment in both nations. Anticipated actions by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada. Analysis of global demand and supply dynamics for key Canadian exports like oil. Assessment of investor sentiment and capital flows. The specific mention of not seeing the pair below 1.30 suggests a strong conviction based on their internal models and expectations for these underlying drivers. It implies that, in their assessment, the factors supporting the US Dollar’s strength relative to the Canadian Dollar are expected to persist or outweigh factors that would strengthen the Loonie significantly. Actionable Insights for Traders: Responding to the USD/CAD Forecast Given this BofA forecast , how might a trader approach the Forex market , specifically the USD/CAD pair? Here are some considerations: Identify Key Levels: Recognize 1.30 as a significant potential support level according to BofA. Also, identify potential resistance levels above the current price. Watch Economic Data: Pay close attention to economic releases from both the US and Canada. Strong US data or weak Canadian data could reinforce BofA’s view, while the opposite could challenge it. Monitor Central Bank Commentary: Statements from the Fed and BoC officials regarding future monetary policy intentions are crucial. Any hawkish surprises from the BoC or dovish surprises from the Fed could shift the dynamics. Observe Oil Prices: Given the CAD’s link to commodities, significant moves in oil prices warrant attention. However, BofA’s view suggests that even favorable commodity prices might not be enough to push USD/CAD sustainably below 1.30 in their estimation. Consider Alternative Scenarios: While BofA has a clear view, the Forex market is unpredictable. Think about what kind of events (e.g., a major shift in global risk sentiment, unexpected policy moves) could cause USD/CAD to break below 1.30 despite this forecast. Manage Risk: Always use appropriate risk management techniques, such as setting stop-losses, regardless of expert forecasts. No forecast is guaranteed. Potential Challenges to the BofA Forecast While a major bank’s forecast carries weight, it’s important to remember that markets are dynamic. What could potentially challenge BofA’s view that USD/CAD stays above 1.30? A faster pace of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve than currently anticipated. Unexpected strength in the Canadian economy, leading the Bank of Canada to become more hawkish. A significant and sustained rally in commodity prices, particularly oil. A broad weakening of the US Dollar due to global factors or a shift in risk appetite favoring non-USD assets. Geopolitical developments that disproportionately benefit the Canadian Dollar . These factors represent potential catalysts that traders should monitor as they evaluate the validity and potential duration of BofA’s cautious outlook on the Loonie . Conclusion: What Does This Mean for the Forex Market ? Bank of America’s clear stance that they do not foresee USD/CAD trading below 1.30 underscores a prevailing caution regarding the near-term upside potential of the Canadian Dollar against the US Dollar. This BofA forecast suggests that the 1.30 level could act as a significant floor, influencing trading strategies and risk assessments in the Forex market . While forecasts are not guarantees, the view from a major institution like BofA provides a key data point for traders and investors navigating the complexities of currency movements. Understanding the underlying reasons behind this outlook – likely related to monetary policy expectations, economic fundamentals, and commodity price sensitivity – is essential for anyone trading or investing in this pair. As always, market participants should combine expert analysis with their own research and risk management practices.

This marked the first time a publicly listed company had taken a position in the Hyperliquid protocol. Hyperliquid Gets Institutional Nod as Tony G Co-Investment Buys In According to the press release , the acquisition was executed through WonderFi Technologies, a Canadian digital asset platform. It comes amid Hyperliquid’s rise in market share and token value. From a price of $1 at launch in late 2024, $HYPE has surged to over $42 within a year. With this purchase, Tony G Co-Investment becomes the largest known $HYPE holder among publicly listed firms. “This acquisition reflects our strategic commitment to supporting digital infrastructure that is driving the next wave of innovation,” said Matt Zahab, CEO of Tony G Co-Investment Holdings. “Hyperliquid represents one of the most exciting developments in decentralized trading infrastructure.” he added. Zahab, who took over as CEO on June 8, brings marketing and media experience, including his role as host of the Cryptonews Podcast . He replaces Ron Akram, who stepped down as director earlier this month. Gediminas Klepackas, formerly interim CEO, has been named Chief Operating Officer. The firm made headlines in 2022 when it sold its stake in News 3.0, the parent company of Cryptonews.com, netting $2 million in crypto payments during a period when DeFi markets were reeling from the FTX collapse. The $HYPE acquisition draws parallels to another Tony G-backed venture, Sol Strategies . The publicly traded company began accumulating a large position in SOL in 2019 and has since become heavily invested in the Solana ecosystem. Tony G now serves as chairman and holds 36.8 percent of the company’s shares. In 2024, he helped secure a CA$10 million revolving credit facility , which contributed to a 12 percent surge in the company’s stock price on the announcement day. Under his leadership, Sol Strategies used the credit facility to expand its Solana holdings. Currently, the firm holds more than CA$48 million in crypto assets, primarily in SOL and SUI. Despite reporting a net loss of CA$4.8 million in the second quarter of 2025, the company saw its staking and validation revenue increases year over year, rising from just CA$67,000 to CA$2.54 million. While Hyperliquid does not belong to the Solana ecosystem, observers have begun to ask whether Tony G is applying the same strategy. With Sol Strategies focused on consolidating SOL, this latest move into $HYPE suggests a similar long-term vision, albeit on a different blockchain. $HYPE Rallies Toward $50 as Influencer Buzz and Listing Rumors Push Token Higher Hyperliquid’s trading volume reached $248 billion in May , an 843 percent increase compared to the same period last year.

A major initiative is underway that could see one of the world’s first large-scale corporate XRP Treasury funds established. Singapore-based Trident Digital Tech Holdings has announced ambitious plans to raise up to $500 million specifically for this purpose. This isn’t just about buying digital tokens; it’s a strategic maneuver aimed at integrating deeply with the Ripple ecosystem and exploring new frontiers in digital asset management. What is a Corporate XRP Treasury and Why is it Significant? Traditionally, corporate treasuries manage a company’s financial assets, focusing on liquidity, capital preservation, and investment returns, typically using fiat currencies and traditional instruments. A corporate XRP Treasury , however, signifies a strategic allocation of company funds into the digital asset XRP. The significance of Trident Digital’s plan lies in its scale and specific focus. While some companies hold Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets, a dedicated $500 million fund explicitly for XRP, designed for active participation like staking and ecosystem collaboration, represents a pioneering approach. It signals a growing institutional interest not just in holding digital assets but in leveraging their unique functionalities within specific blockchain networks like Ripple’s. Diving Deeper into Trident Digital ‘s Ambitious Plan The entity behind this initiative is Trident Digital Tech Holdings, headquartered in Singapore, a jurisdiction increasingly known as a hub for fintech and digital asset innovation. Their proposal to raise up to $500 million is substantial and points towards a serious long-term commitment to the XRP ledger and the broader digital asset market. According to reports, the raised capital will be allocated primarily to three key areas: Acquiring XRP Tokens: Building a significant reserve of XRP as the foundational asset of the treasury. Deploying Staking Mechanisms: Participating in activities that can potentially generate yield on the acquired XRP, such as through delegation or other validation processes if applicable to future XRP Ledger developments or related networks. Collaborating within the Ripple Ecosystem: Engaging with projects, platforms, and initiatives built on or connected to the Ripple network, potentially exploring use cases like payments, tokenization, or DeFi. This multi-faceted approach suggests that Trident Digital views XRP not just as a speculative asset but as a utility-rich digital currency with potential for active yield generation and strategic partnerships within its native environment. Exploring the Potential of This Large-Scale XRP Investment Why would a firm undertake such a significant XRP investment ? The rationale likely involves several factors: Belief in XRP’s Utility: XRP was designed for fast, low-cost global payments, a utility that continues to be relevant in an increasingly connected world. Ripple’s Network and Partnerships: Ripple Labs has established numerous partnerships with financial institutions and payment providers globally, creating a network effect that could benefit XRP. Potential for Yield: While native XRP Ledger staking is different from proof-of-stake, opportunities exist through related platforms or future protocol upgrades that could allow the treasury to earn passive income. Market Position: Acquiring a large volume of XRP could position Trident Digital as a significant holder and participant in the ecosystem. However, like any large-scale digital asset holding, this XRP investment comes with inherent risks, including market volatility, regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP’s classification in various jurisdictions, and technical risks associated with digital asset management. How Does This Initiative Impact the Broader Ripple Ecosystem ? A $500 million fund dedicated to acquiring XRP and engaging with the Ripple ecosystem could have several positive implications: Increased Liquidity: A large treasury actively participating could add significant liquidity to the XRP market. Potential for New Use Cases: Trident Digital’s collaboration within the ecosystem could lead to the development or adoption of new applications leveraging the XRP Ledger. Institutional Validation: A substantial commitment like this from a firm like Trident Digital lends further credibility to the XRP Ledger and its associated technologies in the eyes of other potential institutional players. Support for Development: Engagement and potential investment in ecosystem projects could foster innovation and growth within the Ripple network. The Ripple ecosystem is constantly evolving, with developments in areas like On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and tokenization. A large, dedicated fund could accelerate participation and development in these areas. Understanding the Trend: Why Companies Are Building a Crypto Treasury Trident Digital’s plan is part of a broader trend where companies are exploring or actively building a crypto treasury . While Bitcoin has been the most common asset for corporate treasuries (e.g., MicroStrategy), firms are starting to look at other digital assets for diversification, specific utility, or yield opportunities. The motivations for holding a crypto treasury can vary: Motivation Description Relevance to XRP Treasury Inflation Hedge Holding scarce digital assets to potentially preserve value against inflation. Less direct for XRP compared to Bitcoin, but still a potential diversification play. Investment/Growth Allocating capital to digital assets with high growth potential. Primary driver for a fund like Trident Digital’s. Utility/Operations Using the digital asset for specific business operations (e.g., payments, accessing services). Highly relevant for XRP, designed for payments and ecosystem interaction. Yield Generation Earning returns through staking, lending, or other DeFi activities. Explicit goal for Trident Digital’s plan. Balance Sheet Diversification Adding a new asset class uncorrelated with traditional assets. A common benefit of holding digital assets. Building a crypto treasury requires careful consideration of custody solutions, accounting treatment, tax implications, and regulatory compliance – complex factors that Trident Digital will need to navigate. What Are the Key Considerations and Challenges Ahead? While the announcement is exciting, the plan is scheduled to roll out in the second half of 2025. This timeline is subject to significant external factors: Market Conditions: The overall state of the cryptocurrency market will heavily influence the feasibility and strategy of acquiring $500 million worth of XRP. Regulatory Conditions: The regulatory landscape for XRP and digital assets is still evolving globally. Clarity and favorable regulations, particularly in key markets, will be crucial. The ongoing legal status of XRP in the United States remains a significant factor. Funding Success: Trident Digital must successfully raise the $500 million from investors. Potential challenges include: Executing large-scale XRP acquisitions without causing significant market impact. Implementing secure and efficient staking or yield-generating strategies. Navigating the technical and legal complexities of active participation in the Ripple ecosystem. Managing volatility and potential drawdowns in the value of the treasury assets. Compelling Summary Trident Digital’s plan to launch a $500 million corporate XRP Treasury marks a significant step for both the company and the broader digital asset space. It highlights growing institutional confidence in specific digital assets like XRP and the potential for corporate treasuries to move beyond traditional fiat holdings. By focusing on acquisition, staking, and active participation in the Ripple ecosystem , Trident Digital aims to create a dynamic crypto treasury that not only holds value but also generates yield and fosters innovation. While the initiative faces market and regulatory hurdles ahead of its planned H2 2025 rollout, its successful execution could serve as a blueprint for future large-scale XRP investment and corporate engagement with blockchain networks.

Crypto lending platform Maple Finance has announced a strategic partnership with Lido , the leading liquid staking provider. This collaboration introduces a novel offering: stablecoin credit lines specifically designed for institutions, collateralized by stETH , Lido’s popular liquid staking token. This move is a direct response to the growing demand from institutional players who hold staked Ethereum (ETH) but require access to flexible capital without disrupting their staking positions. By leveraging stETH , institutions can now unlock liquidity from their staked assets, offering a compelling alternative to traditional financing or the need to unstake their ETH, which would mean losing staking rewards and potentially facing unbonding periods. Understanding the Core: What is stETH and Why Does it Matter for Institutions? Before diving into the specifics of the Maple-Lido partnership, it’s essential to understand stETH and the concept of liquid staking. When users stake ETH on the Ethereum network (specifically for the Beacon Chain and now the fully operational proof-of-stake chain), their ETH becomes locked. While locked, it earns staking rewards, contributing to network security. However, accessing that capital requires ‘unstaking,’ which can involve waiting periods. Liquid staking protocols like Lido solve this by issuing a liquid token, like stETH , to represent the staked ETH plus earned rewards. Holders of stETH can trade it, transfer it, or use it in other DeFi protocols while their underlying ETH remains staked and earning rewards. This ‘liquidity’ is incredibly valuable, especially for institutions that need the flexibility to manage their capital actively. For institutions, holding large amounts of staked ETH represents a significant asset on their balance sheet. However, if that capital is locked, it limits their ability to use it for operational expenses, trading strategies, or other investment opportunities. stETH provides a way to retain the staking yield while also having an asset that *can* be used elsewhere in the crypto ecosystem. This is where the demand for Crypto Lending solutions collateralized by stETH arises. Maple Finance and Lido: A Powerful Partnership for Institutional DeFi The collaboration between Maple Finance and Lido is a natural fit. Lido is the dominant player in the liquid staking space, with a large amount of staked ETH represented by stETH . Maple Finance specializes in providing undercollateralized and overcollateralized Crypto Lending solutions, particularly tailored for institutional and corporate borrowers. Their platform allows for curated lending pools managed by experienced credit delegates. This partnership leverages the strengths of both protocols: Lido’s stETH: Provides the high-quality, yield-bearing collateral asset that institutions already hold. Maple Finance’s Infrastructure: Offers the regulated, compliant framework and lending pool structure needed to provide credit lines to institutions. The new credit lines will allow verified institutional borrowers on Maple Finance to deposit their stETH as collateral and borrow stablecoins like USDC. This means an institution can keep its ETH staked via Lido, continue earning staking yield on its stETH holdings, and simultaneously access stablecoin liquidity for its operational or trading needs. What are the Benefits of stETH-Backed Crypto Lending for Institutions? This new offering presents several compelling advantages for institutional participants in the crypto market: 1. Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Institutions no longer face the dilemma of choosing between staking yield and liquidity. They can have both. By using stETH as collateral, their staked ETH remains productive while they access necessary capital. 2. Continued Staking Yield: Borrowers continue to earn the underlying ETH staking rewards on the stETH they’ve deposited as collateral. This yield can potentially offset some of the borrowing costs, making the credit line more attractive. 3. Access to Stablecoin Liquidity: Stablecoins like USDC are crucial for various activities, including paying expenses, executing trading strategies, or managing short-term liabilities. These credit lines provide a direct, efficient way to obtain this liquidity using a major crypto asset they already hold. 4. Participation in Institutional DeFi: This product is a prime example of how Institutional DeFi is evolving to meet specific, sophisticated financial needs. It allows institutions to engage with decentralized finance protocols in a structured, familiar way (a credit line). 5. Mitigation of Opportunity Cost: Without this option, institutions needing liquidity might have to unstake ETH (losing yield and facing delays) or sell assets. Using a stETH -backed credit line avoids these opportunity costs. 6. Flexible Funding: Credit lines offer flexibility compared to term loans. Institutions can draw funds as needed up to their limit and repay when convenient, providing better treasury management capabilities. Exploring Potential Challenges and Risks While the benefits are significant, it’s crucial to consider the potential challenges and risks associated with Crypto Lending, especially when using liquid staking tokens as collateral: 1. stETH Depeg Risk: Although stETH is designed to trade close to the price of ETH, it is not a 1:1 peg maintained by an oracle. Market conditions can cause stETH to trade at a discount or premium to ETH. A significant depeg downwards could impact the collateral value and potentially lead to liquidation risks. 2. Liquidation Risk: Like any collateralized loan, if the value of the deposited stETH falls below a certain threshold relative to the borrowed stablecoins, the collateral could be liquidated to cover the loan. Market volatility in the price of ETH (and thus stETH ) is a primary driver of this risk. 3. Smart Contract Risk: Both Maple Finance and Lido operate on smart contracts. While audited, smart contracts are not immune to bugs or exploits, which could potentially affect the deposited collateral or the lending pool. 4. Protocol Risk: Beyond smart contracts, there’s risk associated with the governance and operation of the Maple Finance and Lido protocols themselves. Changes in protocol parameters or unforeseen issues could arise. 5. Credit Delegate Risk (on Maple): Maple’s model relies on Credit Delegates who manage the lending pools and assess borrower creditworthiness. While institutions are involved, the performance of the pool depends on the delegate’s decisions and the overall health of the borrower portfolio. 6. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for Crypto Lending and Institutional DeFi is still evolving. Future regulations could impact the viability or structure of such offerings. Institutions considering these credit lines must perform thorough due diligence on the risks, the specific terms of the lending pool on Maple Finance , and the stability of the stETH peg. How the stETH-Backed Credit Line Mechanism Works While the specifics of each lending pool on Maple Finance can vary, the general mechanism for these stETH -backed credit lines works as follows: Borrower Qualification: An institution undergoes a vetting process by a Credit Delegate on the Maple Finance platform to be approved as a borrower. Pool Access: The institution accesses a specific lending pool on Maple Finance designed for stETH collateral. These pools are funded by lenders (potentially other institutions or accredited investors). Collateral Deposit: The institution deposits a certain amount of stETH into the smart contract managing the lending pool as collateral. Credit Line Access: Based on the value of the deposited stETH and the pool’s collateralization ratio requirements (e.g., 120-150%), the institution is granted access to a stablecoin credit line. Drawing Funds: The institution can draw stablecoins (like USDC) from the credit line up to the approved limit. Interest Accrual: Interest accrues on the drawn amount based on the terms of the lending pool. The institution continues to earn staking rewards on their deposited stETH during this time. Monitoring and Liquidation: The value of the stETH collateral is continuously monitored relative to the outstanding stablecoin debt. If the collateralization ratio falls below a liquidation threshold, a portion of the stETH collateral may be automatically sold on the market to repay the stablecoin debt and restore the ratio. Repayment: The institution repays the borrowed stablecoins plus accrued interest. Collateral Withdrawal: Once the loan is fully repaid, the institution can withdraw their deposited stETH . This structured approach, facilitated by Maple Finance ‘s institutional focus and Lido ‘s dominant stETH asset, provides a robust framework for Crypto Lending within the Institutional DeFi space. The Growing Landscape of Institutional DeFi and Liquid Staking The partnership between Maple Finance and Lido is not happening in a vacuum. It’s indicative of a broader trend: institutions are increasingly comfortable exploring and utilizing decentralized finance primitives, provided they meet certain standards of compliance, security, and risk management. Liquid staking, particularly through established players like Lido and assets like stETH , has become a cornerstone of institutional crypto strategies due to its combination of yield and potential liquidity. This development validates the demand for financial products built around liquid staking tokens. It signals that institutions are moving beyond simply holding or staking crypto to actively using these assets within DeFi protocols for sophisticated financial operations like obtaining leverage or managing working capital. The success of these stETH -backed credit lines on Maple Finance could pave the way for similar offerings using other liquid staking derivatives or other yield-bearing assets, further expanding the possibilities within Institutional DeFi and Crypto Lending. Key Takeaways for Readers Maple Finance and Lido have launched stablecoin credit lines for institutions using stETH as collateral. This allows institutions holding staked ETH (via stETH ) to access liquidity without unstaking, preserving staking yield. The offering enhances capital efficiency and provides flexible stablecoin access for institutional operations and trading. It represents a significant step forward for Institutional DeFi, adapting decentralized protocols for traditional financial needs. Potential risks include stETH depeg, liquidation risk, and smart contract vulnerabilities, requiring careful due diligence. The partnership highlights the increasing importance of liquid staking assets like stETH in enabling sophisticated Crypto Lending strategies for large players. Conclusion The collaboration between Maple Finance and Lido to offer stETH -backed stablecoin credit lines for institutions is a landmark event in the evolution of Institutional DeFi. By providing a compliant and structured way for institutions to leverage their liquid staked ETH holdings, this partnership unlocks significant capital efficiency and flexibility. It underscores the growing maturity of the decentralized finance space and its increasing ability to cater to the complex requirements of traditional financial players.

Tron Sharpe Ratio Is Still Significantly Below Overheating Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Sharpe Ratio of Tron. The “Sharpe Ratio” refers to an indicator that compares the returns of an asset against the risk associated with it. The numerator in the ratio, the ‘returns’ portion, is defined as the difference between the average return of the coin and the risk-free return (that is, the theoretical return involved with an asset carrying zero risk) over a given period. The denominator, the ‘risk’ part, is the asset’s standard deviation of returns over the same window (in other words, its volatility). Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the cryptocurrency is printing returns that outweigh its risk. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the asset’s performance has been lackluster compared to its volatility. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Tron Sharpe Ratio over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron Sharpe Ratio fell below the 1 level earlier, but its value has since returned above the mark. According to the quant, the metric being above the level has historically accompanied bullish price action. An extremely high value, however, has proven to be an overheating signal, with the asset tending to arrive at a top. “Whenever the Adjusted Sharpe Ratio climbs above 40, it often signals a market that’s overheating,” explains the analyst. “In the past, readings over 40 have lined up well with local tops.” So far since its return above 1, the Tron Sharpe Ratio has only managed to reach a high of 8.3, which is clearly significantly below this cutoff. This trend could mean that TRX hasn’t been too overheated. “With TRX’s Sharpe Ratio still far from historical peaks, the data suggests there’s plenty of upside room for a potential bull run in 2025,” says the quant. It now remains to be seen how the coin will develop in the near future, given this pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum To $3,400?

This collaboration focused on achieving crosschain delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement, a critical function for the future of digital assets and asset tokenization. What Happened: The Chainlink, JPMorgan, and Ondo Finance Collaboration The core of this groundbreaking test involved settling a transaction across two distinct networks: a permissioned network representing traditional finance infrastructure (JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments) and a public testnet representing decentralized finance (Ondo Chain testnet). The goal was to demonstrate that assets and payments could be exchanged simultaneously and securely between these disparate environments. This wasn’t just a theoretical exercise. It was a practical demonstration of how tokenized assets, potentially held on a public blockchain or a DeFi-centric network like Ondo Chain, could be exchanged for tokenized payments or stablecoins residing on a permissioned, institutional-grade network like Kinexys, all in a single, atomic transaction. Why is Crosschain DvP Important? Delivery versus Payment (DvP) is a standard settlement mechanism in traditional financial markets. It ensures that the delivery of securities (like stocks or bonds) only occurs if the corresponding payment is received, and vice-versa. This eliminates settlement risk, which is the risk that one party delivers their asset but does not receive the payment, or vice versa. In the world of blockchain and tokenized assets, enabling DvP settlement across different networks (crosschain) is crucial for several reasons: Risk Reduction: Eliminates the need for trust between parties settling on different chains. No party is exposed to the risk of losing their asset or payment without receiving the other side of the trade. Increased Efficiency: Automates the settlement process, potentially reducing time and costs compared to traditional methods which often involve multiple intermediaries and manual steps. Enabling Liquidity: Allows assets residing on one chain to be easily and safely traded for payments or assets on another chain, improving overall market liquidity. Supporting Asset Tokenization: Provides a secure and reliable method for settling trades of tokenized real-world assets (like real estate, equities, or bonds) against digital currencies or stablecoins held on different platforms. JPMorgan’s Role: Kinexys and Traditional Finance Integration JPMorgan, a global leader in financial services, is actively exploring the potential of blockchain technology through initiatives like Onyx and its Kinexys platform. Kinexys Digital Payments represents JPMorgan’s infrastructure for wholesale payments using distributed ledger technology. Their participation in this test highlights the growing interest from major financial institutions in leveraging blockchain for core functions like payments and settlements. JPMorgan’s involvement underscores the critical need for interoperability between the highly regulated, permissioned environments favored by traditional finance and the more open, public blockchain networks where many digital assets and potential innovations reside. This test shows a practical pathway for bridging this gap, allowing institutional liquidity and assets within systems like Kinexys to interact safely with the broader digital asset ecosystem. Ondo Finance: Bridging the Gap with DeFi and Asset Tokenization Ondo Finance is a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, particularly focused on bringing traditional financial assets and structures onto the blockchain. They specialize in creating tokenized financial products, aiming to bridge the gap between institutional finance and DeFi protocols. The Ondo Chain testnet served as the public network in this collaboration, representing the environment where tokenized assets could potentially reside. Ondo Finance’s participation is vital as they represent the side of the equation focused on creating and managing tokenized assets and interacting with public blockchain infrastructure. Their expertise in tokenization and DeFi protocols complements JPMorgan’s traditional finance strength, making this a powerful partnership for demonstrating the potential of crosschain settlements for tokenized real-world assets. Chainlink’s Contribution: Powering Interoperability At the heart of enabling the communication and coordination between JPMorgan’s permissioned Kinexys network and the Ondo Chain testnet was Chainlink’s technology. Specifically, the test utilized Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and its Runtime Environment (CRE). Chainlink CCIP is designed to provide a secure and reliable way for applications and token transfers to move across different blockchain networks. The Runtime Environment allows for complex computations and logic to be executed off-chain in a verifiable manner, which is crucial for coordinating actions like a DvP settlement across disparate systems that cannot directly communicate. Chainlink acted as the crucial middleware, enabling the atomic swap logic – ensuring that the ‘delivery’ on one network and the ‘payment’ on the other network happened simultaneously or not at all. This capability is fundamental for building robust crosschain financial applications and is a core reason why Chainlink is seen as vital infrastructure for the future of finance. Benefits of This Breakthrough This successful test opens the door to numerous potential benefits for the financial industry and the broader digital asset ecosystem: Enhanced Efficiency: Streamlines settlement processes, reducing time from days to potentially minutes or seconds. Reduced Counterparty Risk: The atomic nature of DvP eliminates the risk of one party failing to deliver after the other has performed their part. Increased Liquidity: Makes it easier to trade assets across different platforms and networks, boosting market depth. New Financial Products: Enables the creation of innovative financial instruments and markets involving tokenized assets settled crosschain. Improved Capital Utilization: Faster settlement frees up capital that would otherwise be tied up in lengthy settlement cycles. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Provides a practical blueprint for how traditional financial institutions can safely interact with public blockchain networks and tokenized assets. Challenges and the Road Ahead While this test is a significant success, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain before crosschain DvP settlement becomes commonplace in mainstream finance. These include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets and crosschain transactions is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Scalability: Ensuring these systems can handle the volume and speed required for global financial markets. Security: Maintaining high levels of security when interacting across different network architectures. Standardization: Developing common standards and protocols for tokenized assets and crosschain communication. Integration Complexity: Integrating these new technologies with existing legacy financial systems. Despite these hurdles, the successful collaboration between Chainlink, JPMorgan, and Ondo Finance demonstrates that the core technological challenges of crosschain DvP are being addressed. This test moves the industry closer to a future where tokenized assets can be freely and safely exchanged across diverse digital platforms. What Does This Mean for Asset Tokenization? Asset tokenization, the process of issuing digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of real-world assets, is widely seen as a major trend for the coming years. However, for tokenization to reach its full potential, the ability to trade and settle these tokenized assets efficiently and securely is paramount. The Chainlink, JPMorgan, and Ondo Finance test is a crucial piece of the puzzle for asset tokenization. By demonstrating secure crosschain DvP, they are building the necessary infrastructure layer that allows tokenized assets held on one type of network (e.g., a public chain for liquidity and transparency) to be seamlessly settled against payments or other assets on a different type of network (e.g., a permissioned network for institutional control and privacy). This unlocks the potential for a much wider range of participants and assets to enter the tokenized ecosystem. Summary: A Glimpse into the Future of Finance The successful crosschain DvP settlement test involving Chainlink, JPMorgan, and Ondo Finance is more than just a technical achievement; it’s a powerful proof of concept for the future of finance. By effectively bridging a traditional finance network with a public testnet using Chainlink’s interoperability solutions, these entities have demonstrated a viable path for secure, efficient, and risk-mitigated settlement of digital assets across different blockchain environments. This collaboration significantly advances the capabilities required for widespread asset tokenization and paves the way for a more interconnected and efficient global financial system.

A significant stride in this evolution is the recent launch of Morpho V2 , the latest iteration of the innovative crypto lending protocol. What Makes Morpho V2 a Game Changer for Crypto Lending? Morpho has always aimed to optimize capital efficiency in lending markets. With Morpho V2 , the protocol takes a monumental leap forward, particularly addressing the sophisticated needs of institutional participants and advanced DeFi users. Announced via their official channels, V2 introduces several key features designed to redefine the lending landscape: Intent-Based Architecture: Moving beyond traditional order books or fixed pool mechanics, V2 utilizes an intent-based system. This allows lenders and borrowers to express their specific desired terms. Customizable Loan Terms: A major highlight is the ability to negotiate and establish fixed-rate, fixed-term loans with highly customizable parameters. This is a stark contrast to the variable rates and open-ended terms typical of many existing DeFi protocols. Off-Pool Liquidity Structures: V2 enables direct, peer-to-peer (P2P) matching between specific lenders and borrowers, facilitating large, bespoke transactions without relying solely on the shared liquidity pools of integrated protocols like Aave or Compound (which Morpho historically optimized). Cross-Chain Functionality: Expanding beyond a single blockchain, V2 introduces capabilities for cross-chain lending , allowing users to interact and transact across different networks, significantly increasing market reach and flexibility. These features collectively position Morpho V2 as a protocol capable of handling more complex and tailored financial arrangements, bridging the gap between traditional finance expectations and decentralized possibilities. Why is Customizable Terms Lending Crucial for Institutional DeFi? While retail users have embraced the flexibility of variable-rate, open-term DeFi loans , institutional players often require the predictability and structure found in traditional finance. Fixed rates and fixed terms provide certainty regarding interest payments and repayment schedules, which is essential for balance sheet management, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance. Furthermore, the ability to customize terms allows institutions to negotiate specific loan-to-value ratios, collateral types, and liquidation parameters that align with their internal risk frameworks. This level of control and predictability offered by Morpho V2 is a significant draw for institutions looking to engage with decentralized finance in a structured manner. How Does Off-Pool Liquidity Enhance Efficiency? Traditional DeFi lending protocols aggregate liquidity into large pools. While efficient for small, standardized transactions, this can present challenges for large, specific deals. Morpho V2 ‘s off-pool or peer-to-peer matching mechanism allows for direct negotiation and execution between two parties. This direct approach can lead to: Potentially better rates negotiated directly between parties. Execution of large trades that might otherwise cause significant price impact in a pool. Greater privacy for specific, large-scale transactions. Tailored collateral arrangements outside of standard pool parameters. This architecture complements the existing pool optimization features, offering a dual approach to crypto lending on the Morpho protocol. Exploring the Potential of Cross-Chain Lending with Morpho V2 The fragmented nature of the blockchain ecosystem is a major hurdle for seamless interaction and liquidity flow. Cross-chain lending capabilities in Morpho V2 aim to break down these silos. Imagine a scenario where a user holds assets on Ethereum but wants to borrow against them to deploy capital on a different chain, say Polygon or Arbitrum, without having to bridge assets first (which can incur costs and risks). V2’s architecture is designed to facilitate such interactions, potentially unlocking vast amounts of previously isolated liquidity and creating a more interconnected DeFi landscape. This feature is particularly exciting for institutional DeFi strategies that might involve managing assets and positions across multiple networks. Addressing the Demands of Institutional DeFi Participants The stated goal of Morpho V2 is clearly aligned with attracting and serving institutional participants. These entities require robust infrastructure, predictable terms, efficient execution for large volumes, and increasingly, the ability to operate across different blockchain environments. By offering customizable, fixed-term DeFi loans and efficient off-pool liquidity, Morpho is building the necessary rails for institutions to confidently enter and scale their activities within the decentralized space. This could lead to significant growth in total value locked (TVL) and trading volume on the protocol, further maturing the DeFi ecosystem as a whole. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the features of Morpho V2 are promising, launching such a sophisticated protocol is not without its challenges. Ensuring robust security for cross-chain interactions, managing the complexity of customizable terms in a decentralized environment, and achieving widespread adoption among diverse institutional players will be key hurdles to overcome. The success of V2 will depend on user experience, integration with other DeFi primitives, and continued innovation in addressing the unique requirements of its target audience. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Crypto Lending The launch of Morpho V2 represents a significant evolutionary step for the crypto lending sector and the broader institutional DeFi movement. By introducing an intent-based system, customizable fixed-term loans, off-pool liquidity, and cross-chain lending capabilities, Morpho is directly addressing the needs of sophisticated users and institutions seeking greater predictability, efficiency, and flexibility in decentralized finance. This could pave the way for larger capital inflows and more complex financial strategies to be executed on-chain, pushing DeFi closer to mainstream institutional adoption.

In a new joint filing, both Ripple and the SEC have asked a Manhattan District Court to lift an existing order against Ripple and release $125 million currently held in an escrow account. Here’s what they’re proposing: Out of the $125 million, $50 million would be paid to the SEC as a penalty, while the remaining amount would be returned to Ripple. This move is part of a bigger effort to settle their nearly five-year legal fight, avoid more court appeals, and close this chapter for good. A Quick Recap of the Case: The case began in December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple, claiming the company had illegally sold XRP as an unregistered security. Over the years, the case saw several rulings, including a partial win for Ripple in July 2023. The court later ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million fine and placed an injunction on the company to stop it from violating securities laws. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The parties have renewed their request for an indicative ruling. pic.twitter.com/8uESP4eWa1 — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 12, 2025 Both sides filed appeals after the judgment, keeping the legal fight alive. However, recent talks between Ripple and the SEC led to a settlement agreement. To move forward with this, they need the court’s approval to dissolve the previous orders and distribute the escrowed money as agreed. Why the Change Now? The SEC and Ripple explained in their filing that “exceptional circumstances” now exist that make it reasonable to adjust the earlier court judgment. They argue that settling the case would save both government and company resources, avoid drawn-out appeals, and bring closure to a case that’s been closely followed by the crypto industry. On the flip side, the SEC has recently been closing several other crypto-related cases as it updates its approach to digital asset regulation. This move in the Ripple case fits into that trend. What’s Next? The court still needs to respond to this joint request. If the judge agrees, Ripple will pay $50 million to the SEC, keep the rest of the money, and both sides will drop their appeals — officially ending one of the highest-profile legal battles in the crypto world.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 02:39:08

For those invested in or simply curious about cryptocurrencies, recent statements from prominent political figures carry significant weight. A notable development involves former U.S. President Donald Trump and his remarks regarding the future of Trump crypto policy. What Did Trump Say About Trump Crypto? During the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, Donald Trump made a noteworthy declaration. He indicated that efforts would be directed towards establishing regulatory frameworks for the crypto market. The key takeaway from his statement was the emphasis on creating frameworks that are both clear and simple . This pledge is significant because the current regulatory environment in the United States is often perceived as fragmented and complex. Different agencies hold varying views and jurisdictions over different aspects of the crypto space, leading to uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Trump’s stated goal is to simplify this landscape. His motivation, as articulated at the summit, is ambitious: to help America secure a dominant position in the future of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This suggests a strategic view where clear regulation is not seen as a hindrance, but rather as a tool to foster growth and innovation within the U.S., positioning it as a global leader in the digital asset space. Why Does Crypto Regulation Matter Now? The call for crypto regulation is not new, but it has gained increasing urgency. The cryptocurrency market has grown exponentially, attracting millions of participants and trillions of dollars in value. With this growth comes a greater need for structure and oversight to address various concerns: Investor Protection: Clear rules can help safeguard individuals from fraud, scams, and market manipulation. Market Integrity: Regulation can establish standards for exchanges and platforms, promoting fair and transparent trading. Financial Stability: As crypto becomes more interconnected with traditional finance, regulators are keen to understand and mitigate potential systemic risks. Innovation and Adoption: Ironically, clear rules can foster innovation by providing legal certainty for businesses, encouraging investment and development within the sector. Combating Illicit Activity: Regulation is crucial for preventing the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and other illegal purposes. The lack of a unified approach in the U.S. has led some companies to consider or move operations overseas, seeking clearer guidelines. This is the context in which Trump’s pledge for ‘clear and simple’ frameworks resonates with many in the industry. How Can US Crypto Policy Foster Dominance? The idea that US crypto policy can be a catalyst for global dominance might seem counterintuitive to those who view regulation purely as restrictive. However, a well-designed regulatory framework can provide several advantages: Attracting Capital: Institutional investors and large corporations often require regulatory clarity before committing significant capital to the crypto space. Clear rules can unlock vast pools of investment. Encouraging Talent and Businesses: Startups and established tech companies are more likely to build and operate in a jurisdiction where the rules of engagement are clear and predictable. Driving Innovation: Certainty allows innovators to focus on building new products and services rather than navigating legal ambiguities. Establishing Global Standards: By developing effective frameworks, the U.S. can influence how other countries approach crypto regulation, setting international benchmarks. Consumer Confidence: Increased trust and confidence among the general public, knowing there are safeguards in place, can accelerate mainstream adoption. Trump’s vision appears to be centered on leveraging these potential benefits. By providing a predictable legal and operational environment, the U.S. could become the preferred hub for crypto innovation, investment, and talent, thereby achieving a dominant position. What are the Challenges in Crafting Bitcoin Regulation? While the goal of clear and simple Bitcoin regulation (and crypto regulation generally) is widely supported by the industry, the path to achieving it is fraught with challenges. Crafting effective rules for a rapidly evolving, decentralized technology is inherently complex. Defining Assets: A fundamental challenge is classifying various digital assets. Are they securities, commodities, currencies, or something else entirely? Different classifications fall under the purview of different regulators (like the SEC or CFTC), leading to jurisdictional battles. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Regulators must find a delicate balance between protecting consumers and investors without stifling the very innovation that makes the technology promising. Overly strict rules could drive activity underground or overseas. Technological Complexity: Understanding the nuances of blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other emerging areas requires significant expertise from policymakers and regulators. Political Divisions: There are differing views on crypto regulation within the U.S. government, often along partisan lines, making it difficult to pass comprehensive legislation. Global Coordination: Crypto is a global phenomenon. U.S. regulation needs to consider international implications and ideally coordinate with other major economies to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Overcoming these hurdles requires collaboration between policymakers, regulators, and industry experts. The ‘simple’ aspect of Trump’s pledge is particularly challenging given the technical and legal complexities involved. Navigating the Future: Insights for the Crypto Market Frameworks The announcement from the Coinbase summit signals a potential shift in the political discourse around crypto, at least from one major political figure. For participants in the crypto market frameworks are a critical factor influencing future growth and stability. Key Takeaways and Insights: Political Attention is Growing: The fact that a former President is speaking about crypto regulation at a major industry event highlights the increasing political relevance of the sector. This suggests that crypto policy will likely be a topic in future elections and legislative discussions. Industry Advocacy is Impactful: Events like the Coinbase summit provide platforms for industry leaders to engage directly with policymakers and candidates, influencing their understanding and stance on crypto. Clarity is the Core Demand: Regardless of the specific rules, the industry’s primary request is for clarity and predictability. This enables long-term planning, investment, and growth. Dominance as a Policy Goal: Framing crypto regulation as a means to achieve U.S. dominance could resonate with a broader political audience, potentially building consensus for action. The Devil is in the Details: While the pledge for ‘clear and simple’ frameworks is positive on the surface, the actual impact will depend entirely on the specifics of any proposed or enacted legislation. For investors and businesses, staying informed about legislative proposals, regulatory actions from agencies like the SEC and CFTC, and the ongoing political debate will be crucial. The path to comprehensive, clear, and simple U.S. crypto regulation is likely to be a long and complex one, but Trump’s recent comments indicate that it remains a significant point of discussion at the highest levels. Summary: A Pledge for Clarity in the Digital Frontier Donald Trump’s recent statement at the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit marks a significant moment in the ongoing conversation about how the United States will regulate digital assets. By pledging to work towards clear and simple regulatory frameworks, he has aligned himself with a key demand of the crypto industry. The stated goal is ambitious: to leverage regulation not as a barrier, but as a pathway for America to dominate the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. While the challenges of crafting such frameworks are substantial, involving complex technical, legal, and political hurdles, the explicit mention of simplicity and global dominance as objectives highlights a potential strategic shift. The coming months and years will reveal whether this pledge translates into concrete policy that provides the certainty the industry craves, ultimately shaping America’s role in the global digital economy.

This isn’t just a simple wrapped token; Polygon is leveraging Wormhole’s innovative Native Token Transfers (NTT) framework to achieve this, a move poised to unlock new levels of Cross-chain Transfer capabilities and enhance overall Blockchain Interoperability . Understanding the Significance: Why Polygon POL on Solana Matters The Polygon POL token is the native asset of the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem, designed to power various functions across Polygon’s interconnected network of chains, including staking, governance, and transaction fees. Bringing this core asset natively to Solana is a strategic decision with several key implications: Expanding Reach: It allows POL holders and users on Solana to interact with the token within the Solana ecosystem. Unified Experience: Unlike traditional wrapped tokens which can suffer from liquidity fragmentation and loss of native properties, NTT aims to keep the token ‘native’ wherever it resides. Setting a Precedent: This deployment serves as a powerful example of how truly native cross-chain interactions can function, potentially paving the way for other assets. Historically, moving tokens between different blockchains has often involved ‘wrapping’ – creating a synthetic version of the token on the destination chain. While functional, this approach adds layers of complexity and potential points of failure. The NTT framework offers a more elegant solution. How Wormhole NTT Powers This Seamless Cross-chain Transfer At the heart of this integration is the Wormhole NTT framework. Wormhole is a leading interoperability protocol that facilitates communication and value transfer between various blockchains. The NTT framework is a specialized standard built on Wormhole that allows tokens to retain their ‘native’ characteristics even when transferred across chains. Think of it less like creating a copy and more like moving the original token’s representation. When a user transfers POL from Polygon to Solana using the NTT bridge, the tokens are locked on the source chain (Polygon), and an equivalent amount of ‘native’ POL is minted or unlocked on the destination chain (Solana). The key is that the token on Solana behaves like the original POL, maintaining its core functionalities and potentially benefiting from future upgrades or features of the original token contract. Key aspects of Wormhole NTT: Native Properties: Tokens transferred via NTT can potentially participate in staking, governance, and other chain-specific functions on the destination chain, assuming the necessary infrastructure is in place. Simplified Development: For developers, NTT provides a standardized way to handle cross-chain token logic. Enhanced Security: Leveraging Wormhole’s established security model for cross-chain messaging. This framework is crucial for realizing the vision of a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem, where assets can flow freely and retain their utility regardless of the chain they reside on. The Impact on Solana and the Broader Ecosystem The arrival of Polygon POL on Solana via Wormhole NTT has exciting implications for both ecosystems and the wider world of DeFi and dApps. For Solana, it means: Increased Asset Diversity: Adding a major ecosystem token like POL directly to Solana provides users with more options. Potential for New dApp Integrations: Developers on Solana can now potentially integrate native POL into their applications, opening up new use cases. Boosting Cross-Chain Activity: This landmark integration encourages more users and projects to explore interactions between Polygon and Solana. For Polygon, it means expanding the utility and reach of its native token to one of the largest and most active blockchain networks outside of the EVM ecosystem. This cross-pollination of assets and users is vital for fostering a truly decentralized and interoperable Web3. This move significantly contributes to the ongoing effort to improve Blockchain Interoperability . As more protocols adopt standards like Wormhole NTT, the barriers between different blockchain networks will continue to dissolve, leading to a more fluid and user-friendly experience for everyone. Boosting Blockchain Interoperability: What Comes Next? The deployment of Polygon POL on Solana is more than just a technical achievement; it’s a statement about the future direction of blockchain technology. The demand for seamless Cross-chain Transfer is undeniable as users and developers operate across multiple networks to find the best performance, lowest costs, and most innovative applications. While exciting, the path to perfect interoperability isn’t without its challenges. Security remains paramount, as cross-chain bridges are often targets for exploits. The complexity of managing liquidity and state across multiple chains also requires robust technical solutions. However, the adoption of frameworks like Wormhole NTT by major players like Polygon and Solana signals a strong commitment to overcoming these hurdles. We can anticipate seeing more native assets making cross-chain journeys, enabling a future where a user might stake POL on Solana, use SOL in a Polygon-based DeFi protocol, or participate in governance for a protocol whose tokens live on several chains simultaneously. Actionable Insights for Users and Developers: Users: Keep an eye on wallets and dApps on Solana that begin to support native POL. Understand the process for transferring POL between Polygon and Solana using the Wormhole bridge when it goes live for users. Developers: Explore the Wormhole NTT documentation to understand how to integrate native cross-chain assets like POL into your Solana or Polygon applications. Consider how seamless cross-chain asset availability could enhance your dApp’s functionality and reach. Conclusion: A New Era for Polygon POL and Solana Polygon’s decision to bring its Polygon POL token to Solana using the Wormhole NTT framework marks a significant milestone. It’s a powerful demonstration of how technical innovation can break down blockchain silos, enabling truly native Cross-chain Transfer and pushing the boundaries of Blockchain Interoperability . This collaboration between two major ecosystems, facilitated by Wormhole, is a positive step towards a more connected, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized future.

Recently, the spotlight has been firmly on former U.S. President Donald Trump and his persistent views on the direction of monetary policy, particularly concerning the Federal Reserve and its leadership under Jerome Powell . For anyone tracking the pulse of the US economy and its potential ripple effects on global markets, including the fascinating world of cryptocurrencies, understanding this dynamic is crucial. Why Does Trump Fed Pressure Continue on Interest Rates ? Donald Trump has consistently voiced his opinion that the Federal Reserve should lower interest rates . His rationale often centers on stimulating economic growth, making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, and potentially reducing the cost of servicing the national debt. While president, he frequently criticized the Fed’s decisions, arguing that higher rates were hindering the economy and making the U.S. less competitive globally. Even out of office, this stance hasn’t changed. He continues to advocate for rate cuts, viewing them as a key lever to boost economic activity. His recent comments reiterated this long-held belief. He stated clearly his desire for lower rates, emphasizing that they are ‘needed’. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a direct expression of a policy preference that could have significant implications if he were to return to office. The call for rate cuts is often framed by Trump as a necessary step to unleash the full potential of the US economy , suggesting that current monetary policy is overly restrictive. What is the Role of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell ? The Federal Reserve , often called the Fed, serves as the central bank of the United States. Its primary mandates, set by Congress, are to promote maximum employment, stable prices (controlling inflation), and moderate long-term interest rates . The Fed achieves these goals primarily through setting the federal funds rate, which influences borrowing costs throughout the economy. A cornerstone of the Fed’s effectiveness is its independence from political pressure. This independence is intended to allow the Fed to make monetary policy decisions based purely on economic data and its mandates, rather than short-term political goals. Jerome Powell , as the current Chair, is the public face and key decision-maker (along with the Federal Open Market Committee – FOMC) for the Fed’s policies. Trump’s public calls for rate cuts, while not legally binding, are seen by many as an attempt to exert political pressure on an independent institution. During his presidency, this dynamic created tension, as the Fed under Powell continued to make decisions based on its assessment of economic conditions, sometimes in direct contrast to Trump’s wishes. How Do Interest Rates Impact the US Economy and Beyond? Changes in interest rates have profound effects on the US economy and, by extension, global markets, including asset classes like cryptocurrencies. Here’s a breakdown: Borrowing Costs: Lower rates make it cheaper for businesses to invest and expand, and for consumers to buy homes, cars, and other goods on credit. Higher rates do the opposite. Inflation: Lower rates can stimulate spending, potentially leading to higher inflation. Higher rates can cool down an overheated economy and help control price increases. Savings and Investment: Lower rates reduce returns on savings accounts and bonds, potentially pushing investors towards riskier assets in search of higher yields. Higher rates make saving more attractive and can draw money away from riskier investments. Currency Value: Interest rate differentials between countries can affect currency exchange rates, impacting trade. Asset Prices: Lower rates generally support higher valuations for stocks and real estate as future earnings are discounted at a lower rate. They can also make alternative assets like gold and potentially cryptocurrencies more appealing compared to traditional low-yield investments. For the crypto market, lower interest rates are often seen as a positive catalyst. When traditional investments offer low returns, and borrowing is cheap, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to riskier, high-growth potential assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, rising rates can increase the appeal of safer assets and increase the cost of capital, potentially leading to outflows from speculative markets. What’s Next in the Trump Fed Dynamic? Trump’s recent statement that he would ‘not fire’ Jerome Powell , while still insisting on rate cuts, is notable. During his presidency, there was speculation about whether he had the authority or the inclination to remove the Fed Chair, a move that would have been unprecedented and severely damaging to the Fed’s perceived independence. His current position suggests a focus on influencing policy rather than outright removing the head of the institution, though the pressure remains. The future of interest rates will depend on economic data – inflation, employment, and growth figures – and the Fed’s assessment of these factors. The Fed under Jerome Powell has indicated it will be guided by the data in deciding when and if to cut rates. Political commentary, while prominent, is officially external to the Fed’s decision-making process. The ongoing dialogue, or rather, the public difference in opinion between a former (and potentially future) president and the head of the central bank highlights the delicate balance between political leadership and monetary policy independence. Market watchers, particularly those in the crypto space, will continue to monitor these developments closely, as the direction of interest rates set by the Federal Reserve significantly influences the broader financial landscape and investor sentiment.

Meanwhile, XRP support levels between $2.10 and $2.15 have held firm, with traders eyeing a possible inverse head-and-shoulders rally setup. But while these top assets battle key chart levels and regulation delays, a new player is gaining momentum where it really counts, functionality. Meet Unstaked, a project flipping the script on AI crypto. With more than 1 billion tokens sold, a $0.1819 launch target, and a projected 3000x ROI, Unstaked is setting the stage for something big. If you’re searching for the best crypto coin to buy with real-world utility and massive upside, this could be your signal. Unstaked: AI Agents That Work, and Pay Unstaked isn’t just dropping a token, it’s launching a full-blown AI infrastructure for crypto users who want more than hype. Built around automated AI agents that run your social presence, manage community tasks, and log every interaction on-chain, the platform is giving regular users the tools big companies pay thousands for. And now, it’s offering early access at one of the most watched presale price points in the market. Currently in stage 20, Unstaked’s presale is priced at $0.011397. With over 1 billion tokens sold and nearly $9.7 million raised, this isn’t a low-effort launch. What’s driving interest is the simple value proposition, deploy AI agents that actually do work. These agents are fully customizable, run 24/7, and cost as little as $10–$25 per month. That’s pennies compared to the cost of a human support team. The project also rewards agent owners through performance-based $UNSD token incentives. All agent activity is logged on-chain, and rewards are tied directly to actual engagement. This turns Unstaked into more than a tool, it becomes a potential income stream. For users looking for the best crypto coin to buy, that combination of utility and upside is hard to beat. With a projected launch price of $0.1819, early buyers are looking at a possible 3000x ROI. If Unstaked sticks the landing post-launch and AI agents deliver results, this could be one of the few crypto platforms where the product, and not just the chart, generates real, compounding value. It might just be the best crypto coin to buy before AI goes mainstream in Web3. Cardano (ADA ETF approval) Could Change the Game All eyes are on Cardano (ADA ETF approval) after the SEC officially acknowledged Grayscale’s spot ETF application back in February 2025. The decision was recently delayed again, with a final deadline now set for October 22. Currently trading around $0.67, ADA still sits far below its all-time high of over $3. But if the ETF gets the green light, especially during a strong market upswing, analysts say a move to $1.20–$1.50 could play out fast. ETF approvals have shown real impact before. Bitcoin jumped from $45K to $65K after its ETF went live. Ethereum followed with a rally from $2,900 to nearly $4,100. If Cardano (ADA ETF approval) follows the same pattern, a surge back toward $2 isn’t out of reach. With institutional investors watching closely, this could be the turning point for ADA after years of sideways price action. Approval or not, the dates, July 15 and October 22, are now circled on every serious trader’s calendar. XRP Support Levels Hold Steady, But For How Long? XRP support levels between $2.10 and $2.15 have held strong over the past few sessions, giving traders a key range to work with. A bounce from this zone has already played out, but if XRP breaks below it, downside targets at $2.05 and even $2.00 could come into play. A dip under $2.00 might shift momentum fast, especially if broader market sentiment weakens. Technically, traders are watching a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern forming on the daily chart. For this bullish setup to play out, XRP needs to push through resistance zones at $2.33, $2.44, and the key golden pocket between $2.56 and $2.62. A confirmed move above that range could set up a strong push toward new highs. But as always, nothing is confirmed until price acts. While XRP support levels are doing their job for now, the next few weeks will reveal whether buyers are ready to drive the next leg up, or if profit-takers hit the brakes. Summing Up With Cardano (ADA ETF approval) likely coming to a head by October and XRP support levels holding firm above $2.10, both assets are at key turning points. Traders are watching closely, but the spotlight is starting to shift toward projects with real-world use cases. That’s where Unstaked is turning heads. With over 1 billion tokens sold, a 3000x ROI projected, and AI agents built for performance, not just automation, it’s hitting all the right marks. The current price in stage 20 is just $0.011397, making now the time to look closely. From agent-powered growth to real on-chain engagement rewards, Unstaked is showing why it could be the best crypto coin to buy before launch day. As crypto shifts from speculation to real utility, Unstaked is ready to lead. If you’re looking beyond charts and into what’s next, this might just be your move.

33767162,[object Object],1749783639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Cardano Dev Firm Fast-Tracks Starstream Rollout: Why It Matters,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-dev-firm-fast-tracks-starstream-rollout/,"Sebastien Guillemot, co-founder of Paima Studios and dcSpark, jolted the Cardano developer community on X this afternoon with a terse progress report: “We’re up to 3 full-time developers working on Starstream (on top of myself)… We’re accelerating development to bring it to mainnet faster given all the interest.” The message, though only two sentences long, signals a meaningful resource shift inside the still-nascent Starstream working group and suggests that Cardano’s first zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) may appear on mainnet sooner than previously expected. No target block height or hard launch window has been released, but the acceleration comes barely five weeks after founder Charles Hoskinson publicly supported the working group, calling the project “a core component of Cardano’s future.” Why Starstream Matters For Cardano Starstream matters because it tackles the single most common criticism of Cardano’s extended-UTXO ledger: the difficulty of building stateful, privacy-preserving applications without fracturing logic across dozens of validator scripts. In Cardano’s eUTXO model every piece of contract state lives inside its own unspent output, a design that grants parallelism and determinism but complicates long-running workflows and advanced cryptography. Research groups inside IOG have explored adding recursive SNARKs to Plutus , yet a production implementation has remained elusive. Starstream’s answer is to step outside Plutus entirely and embed a coroutine-oriented zkVM that compiles to WebAssembly, executes off-chain, and seals each state transition inside a succinct proof verified on-chain by a lightweight Plutus wrapper. “Starstream is a chain-agnostic, UTXO-based, zero-knowledge virtual machine that re-imagines smart-contract execution using coroutines as its foundational primitive,” notes the original technical overview published on Cardano Explorer in late April. Coroutines give developers something they have never had: a single, linear program that can pause mid-execution, emit a UTXO that holds both data and the exact byte-code position, and later resume when a new transaction spends that output. A yield point in Starstream therefore becomes a cryptographically secured checkpoint; when the program wakes up, it needs only prove—rather than re-execute—the suspended segment. The result is a state machine that preserves UTXO determinism while natively supporting multi-step workflows such as auctions, lending loops or on-chain games, all without shared-state contention. Notably, Cardano has historically proceeded through carefully staged hard-fork combinator events by Hoskinson-led Input Output (IOG); Starstream, by contrast, is being built as an opt-in execution layer that can be grafted onto Cardano without a network-wide fork, making its path to mainnet limited chiefly by audit, peer review and tooling.

For companies selling software, one significant hurdle has always been the lengthy and repetitive process of convincing potential customers that their product meets stringent security and compliance standards. This isn’t just a minor step; it can add weeks, or even months, to a sales cycle. Imagine explaining your entire security posture repeatedly to dozens, sometimes hundreds, of different prospects. This is the challenge that Conveyor set out to solve using advanced AI automation . The Painful Reality of Vendor Security Reviews Before a company buys new software, especially for critical functions, they need assurance that it won’t introduce security risks. This leads to detailed vendor security reviews. Software vendors receive lengthy questionnaires covering everything from data encryption and access controls to compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Answering these questions accurately requires deep knowledge and significant time investment from security, compliance, and sales teams. Chas Ballew, co-founder of Aptible, a hosting platform for healthcare companies, experienced this pain firsthand. He saw his customers repeatedly explaining their security practices. “What we saw was that every time one of our customers was trying to close a deal, they would have to explain all of their security and compliance practices over and over again to their customer,” Ballew noted. This manual process wasn’t just slow; it was a major bottleneck delaying sales and even contract renewals. Recognizing this widespread inefficiency, Ballew founded Conveyor in 2021 with the mission to automate this specific, tedious workflow. Conveyor’s AI Automation Solution The timing for Conveyor was opportune. Shortly after its launch, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, signaling a new era for AI capabilities. Conveyor quickly integrated this powerful technology to power its platform. The core idea is simple yet revolutionary: use AI to automatically complete those painful security questionnaires. Conveyor’s AI agent is trained on a company’s existing security documentation, policies, and previous questionnaire responses. When a new questionnaire arrives, the AI can analyze the questions and pull relevant, accurate information from the company’s knowledge base to generate responses. This significantly reduces the manual effort required. According to Conveyor, their AI agent can autonomously and accurately fill out over 90% of customer security questions. Think about the time savings! What used to take weeks of back-and-forth can now be completed in a fraction of the time, freeing up valuable security and sales resources. Why are companies embracing this? As Ballew puts it, the work is “very redundant and repetitive.” Companies “don’t feel it creates a ton of value, so they’re very happy for AI to fill out compliance forms.” It’s a perfect use case for AI automation – taking over tasks that humans find monotonous but are essential for doing business. Expanding Horizons: Revolutionizing RFP Automation Building on its success in automating security reviews, Conveyor is now tackling another time-consuming sales hurdle: Requests for Proposals (RFPs). RFPs are common, especially in large enterprise deals and public sector contracts. They require detailed responses covering not just security but also product features, pricing, implementation plans, and company background. The process of responding to RFPs is similar to security questionnaires in its repetitive nature, often pulling information from existing documents and requiring coordination across multiple departments. By applying their AI automation technology to RFPs, Conveyor aims to streamline this process as well. This expansion into RFP automation is a strategic move. It opens up Conveyor’s market beyond just tech companies focused on security compliance to a wider range of industries that frequently deal with RFPs. This broader appeal is expected to attract new customers and make the company more attractive to investors. Enterprise AI Adoption and Proven Success While some enterprises remain cautious about deploying new AI software, Conveyor’s value proposition is clear and tangible: saving time and accelerating revenue. This has led to rapid adoption among prominent companies. Conveyor proudly states it was the first AI vendor to be fully deployed in production environments at major companies like Zendesk, Atlassian, and Qualtrics. Their customer base also includes other well-known names such as Workday, Netflix, and Zapier, alongside over 400 other companies. This widespread adoption among large, security-conscious organizations demonstrates a significant level of trust in Conveyor’s technology and its ability to handle sensitive information securely while delivering tangible business benefits. It’s a strong signal for the growing acceptance of enterprise AI solutions for specific, high-value use cases. Fueling Growth Through Startup Funding The success in automating security reviews and the promising expansion into RFP automation have not gone unnoticed by the investment community. Conveyor recently secured a significant financial boost to fuel its continued growth. The startup announced a $20 million Series B funding round. This round was led by SignalFire, a prominent venture capital firm, with participation from Oregon Venture Fund and Cervin Ventures. This substantial injection of startup funding will enable Conveyor to further develop its AI capabilities, expand its product offerings (like RFP automation), hire more talent, and reach a wider customer base. This funding round validates Conveyor’s approach and its potential to become a leader in the sales and security automation space. It highlights investor confidence in the market need for AI-driven solutions that directly impact revenue cycles and operational efficiency. Addressing Challenges and Looking Ahead While the benefits of automating sensitive processes like security reviews and RFPs with AI are clear, it’s crucial to address the inherent challenges, particularly around data security and privacy. Companies are sharing highly confidential information about their internal security practices and business operations. Conveyor understands this critical concern. “We keep everything very secure, very isolated for each customer, which is very important,” Ballew emphasized. “Companies want to make sure that their confidential data is only used to process their information and it’s not exposed or mixed in with anyone else’s data.” Implementing robust guardrails and ensuring strict data isolation are non-negotiable for a platform handling such sensitive inputs. Conveyor isn’t the only company working in this area; competitors like Loopio, Responsive, and Rohirrim are also developing software for RFPs and security questions. However, Conveyor’s early focus on AI-powered automation for the security review piece, and its proven traction with major enterprises, position it strongly in the market. Conclusion: AI’s Impact on Business Efficiency Conveyor’s story is a compelling example of how specialized AI automation can solve real-world business problems that humans find tedious and time-consuming. By targeting the repetitive yet critical tasks of vendor security reviews and RFP responses, Conveyor is enabling sales teams to close deals faster and allowing security professionals to focus on higher-value work. Their success in securing significant startup funding and gaining traction with major enterprises underscores the growing demand for intelligent automation solutions that directly impact a company’s bottom line. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more applications like Conveyor that streamline complex business processes, ultimately making companies more efficient and agile.

Along with this, they’ve asked for the $125 million civil penalty currently held in escrow to be released. According to the proposal, $50 million would go to the SEC, while the remaining $75 million would be returned to Ripple. This move is part of both parties’ efforts to settle the long-running case, avoid further court battles, and close pending appeals. In their new court filing, both Ripple and the SEC argued that “exceptional circumstances” now exist that justify changing Judge Torres’s earlier decision. These include a settlement between the two sides, recent shifts in the SEC’s crypto policy, and a mutual desire to avoid dragging the case on any longer. Attorney Expresses Doubt However, this request comes just after Judge Torres denied a similar proposal in May. Legal expert Fred Rispoli shared his doubts about the new filing. He explained that the previous denial showed the judge was clearly frustrated and expected a stronger, more detailed motion this time. According to Rispoli, instead of addressing the SEC’s failures in regulating crypto and offering a sincere apology from Ripple, the new filing only briefly mentioned other case dismissals and a small note about the SEC’s crypto task force.

He called this one of the few missteps by Ripple’s legal team and warned that Judge Torres might once again reject it. Still, Rispoli remains hopeful that the judge might be ready to wrap up the case. Even if the injunction stays in place, Ripple can continue selling XRP to institutions, though not in the same way as before 2018. While some cautious firms might stay away, those open to innovation could still move forward.

A new report from Coinbase Research offers a compelling glimpse into what could drive the next major move for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. They’re setting their sights on the second half of 2025, predicting a significant Bitcoin rally fueled by a confluence of powerful economic and regulatory forces in the United States. What is Driving Coinbase Research’s Optimism for Bitcoin? The core of the Coinbase Research report points to several key factors converging in late 2025 that could create a highly favorable environment for Bitcoin. It’s not just one thing, but a combination of macro-economic shifts and structural improvements within the crypto landscape. According to their analysis, the primary catalysts include: Improved U.S. Economic Growth: A strengthening economy often correlates with increased investor confidence and willingness to allocate capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Expected Federal Reserve Rate Cuts: Lower interest rates typically make traditional savings less attractive and can push investors towards assets with higher growth potential. This can increase liquidity in the market, some of which may flow into Bitcoin. Progress on U.S. Crypto Regulation: Clarity from lawmakers removes uncertainty, potentially paving the way for broader institutional and corporate adoption. These elements, particularly the anticipated progress on US crypto regulation , are seen as significant tailwinds that could propel Bitcoin forward. How Will US Economic Growth Fuel the Crypto Market Outlook? A robust U.S. economy generally means higher employment, increased consumer spending, and stronger corporate profits. This environment often leads to a ‘risk-on’ sentiment among investors. When people feel more secure financially and see potential for growth, they are more likely to invest in assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Bitcoin, having matured significantly since its early days, is increasingly viewed by some as a digital store of value and a potential hedge against inflation, making it an attractive option in a growing economy. Furthermore, economic growth can boost the balance sheets of corporations and institutions, freeing up capital that could be allocated to new asset classes, including digital assets, further enhancing the positive crypto market outlook . The Impact of Fed Rate Cuts on Bitcoin Price Prediction Interest rates set by the Federal Reserve play a crucial role in the broader financial markets. When the Fed raises rates, it increases the cost of borrowing and can slow down the economy, often making safer assets like bonds more appealing relative to risk assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies. Conversely, when the Fed cuts rates, it lowers borrowing costs, stimulates economic activity, and can decrease the appeal of lower-yielding safe assets. This can lead investors to seek higher returns elsewhere, potentially driving capital into assets like Bitcoin. The expectation of rate cuts in 2025, as highlighted by Coinbase Research , is therefore a significant factor in their optimistic Bitcoin price prediction . Is US Crypto Regulation Finally Bringing Clarity? One of the biggest hurdles for mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially among large institutions, has been the lack of clear and consistent regulation in the United States. Uncertainty creates risk, making many traditional financial players hesitant to fully engage with the crypto space. Reports mentioning potential progress on legislation, such as the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts (though specifics and timelines can be complex and subject to change), signal a potential shift towards a more defined regulatory framework. Regulatory clarity can: Benefit of Regulatory Clarity Impact on Crypto Increased Investor Confidence Attracts both retail and institutional investors Reduced Legal Uncertainty Encourages businesses to build and operate in the crypto space Easier Integration with Traditional Finance Facilitates the creation of regulated products and services (like ETFs) Improved Market Integrity Helps combat illicit activity and scams, making the market safer This progress on US crypto regulation is a critical piece of the puzzle for the long-term growth and stability of the market, and a key reason behind Coinbase’s positive forecast. Beyond Macro: Corporate Adoption and Structural Tailwinds While macroeconomics and regulation are significant external drivers, the Coinbase Research report also points to structural shifts within the industry itself. There’s a growing trend of corporations exploring and adopting blockchain technology and digital assets for various use cases, from treasury management to supply chain finance. This increasing corporate adoption signals a maturing ecosystem and creates consistent demand. Furthermore, infrastructure for institutional participation (custody solutions, trading platforms, etc.) continues to improve, making it easier and safer for large players to enter the market. These underlying trends contribute to the positive long-term crypto market outlook . Bitcoin vs. Altcoins: Who Benefits Most? The report, as noted by CoinDesk, draws a distinction between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market in terms of how they might react to these tailwinds. While Bitcoin is expected to benefit significantly from the macro-economic improvements and regulatory clarity due to its status as the largest, most recognized, and increasingly institutionally-accepted digital asset, altcoins may face a different path. Altcoins often require specific catalysts for major price movements, such as: Successful protocol upgrades (like Ethereum’s transitions) Specific ETF approvals for that asset Major developments or adoption within their specific ecosystem Significant technological breakthroughs Without these individual drivers, many altcoins might lag behind Bitcoin, which is seen as more directly benefiting from the broad inflow of capital driven by macro and regulatory shifts. This highlights a potential divergence in performance within the crypto market. What Are the Potential Challenges or Risks? While the outlook presented by Coinbase Research is optimistic, it’s crucial to consider potential headwinds. The path to 2025 is not without risks. These could include: Unexpected economic downturns or recessions Delays or setbacks in passing US crypto regulation Geopolitical events that disrupt global markets Internal crypto market issues, such as major exchange failures or security breaches Changes in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy plans Investors should always be aware that the crypto market is inherently volatile and subject to rapid changes based on a wide range of factors. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Potential Bitcoin Rally Based on the Coinbase Research perspective, what might this mean for those interested in the market? It suggests that the period leading up to and including the second half of 2025 could be particularly interesting for Bitcoin. While this is not financial advice, understanding the potential drivers – U.S. economic health, Fed policy, and regulatory progress – is key. For those considering their strategy, it might involve: Staying informed about economic indicators and Fed announcements. Monitoring legislative developments regarding US crypto regulation . Considering Bitcoin’s position within a diversified portfolio, given its potential drivers differ somewhat from many altcoins. Recognizing that market timing is difficult and forecasts are subject to change. The Bitcoin price prediction offered by Coinbase Research is a forecast based on current information and trends, providing a framework for understanding potential future market movements.

This latest movement places the asset 4.1% below its all-time high of over $111,000 recorded last month. Despite the short-term dip, some analysts see familiar signs in derivatives data that could point to the next phase of market movement. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Calm Rally Could Be a Setup for a Massive Breakout, Analyst Reveals Funding Rate Rebounds Signal Potential Upside for Bitcoin According to recent insights shared by on-chain analyst “nino” on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin may be repeating a funding rate pattern that has historically led to price rebounds. The data shows the asset’s funding rate briefly dipping into negative territory before beginning to reverse, a pattern that has aligned with price recoveries earlier in the year. Nino’s analysis suggests this reversal, particularly the 72-hour moving averages exiting the oversold zone and producing a yellow-blue-black signal formation, could indicate a potential round of short position liquidations. The funding rate, still below levels typically associated with excessive bullish sentiment, may also imply that traders have yet to become overconfident, leaving room for additional upside without immediate overheating in derivatives markets. Nino’s observation focuses on market structure and derivative sentiment, highlighting how positioning in perpetual futures markets could precede notable spot price moves. In particular, when funding rates turn negative and then begin to climb, they often reflect the unwinding of overly bearish bets by traders who shorted BTC at high leverage. As these traders are forced to close positions, the resulting buy pressure can act as a short-term catalyst. This setup has played out multiple times earlier in 2025, and the current conditions suggest it may be occurring again. By keeping track of moving averages and sentiment zones, traders may interpret these signals as part of a broader cyclical trend. Binance Volume Share Signals Key Trends in Market Liquidity Separately, another analyst from CryptoQuant, Burak Kesmeci, addressed structural shifts in spot trading liquidity, particularly Binance’s share of global trading volume. Kesmeci emphasized that Binance’s dominance remains an important barometer of institutional participation and overall market health. He explained that an increase in Binance’s spot volume share is often associated with higher liquidity and smoother price discovery. Conversely, if Binance were to fall below a 30% volume threshold, it could signal a move toward more “fragmented liquidity” across exchanges such as Coinbase or Upbit. Such shifts could lead to more volatility and less predictable trading behavior.

This legislation, designed to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, has garnered significant attention as it nears potential passage . The announcement followed a procedural vote for the GENIUS Stablecoin Act carried out by the US Senate on Thursday, June 12, which might lead to fresh crypto regulation. The bill seeks to introduce a regulatory landscape for stablecoins to the crypto space, a milestone for the growing industry as trading and on-chain activity are expected to rise. John Thune believes the GENIUS Act will make crypto a common part of daily life Addressing the Senate floor on Wednesday, Majority Leader John Thune called for members of Congress to vote to pass the bill. The action doubles down on many of US President Donald Trump’s talking points regarding digital assets, such as how the legislation will help bring the US to the crypto capital of the world. In a 68-30 vote, the US Senate voted to advance the GENIUS Act. This took place more than a month after it was introduced. Several senators, including Democrats, voted to invoke cloture for the bill, putting it on the path for debate and a full floor vote before potentially moving it on to the House of Representatives for further discussion. Thune highlighted that they aim to make cryptocurrency a common part of everyday life, and the GENIUS Act will assist them in achieving that. He further stated that Congress had more work to do on digital assets, referring to a separate market structure bill working its way through the House. Regarding the bill mentioned by Thune, two House committees voted on Tuesday to move forward with the CLARITY Act, clearing the way for a full floor vote soon. Analysts have pointed out the US could become a leader in regulating digital currencies worldwide if the law passes. Based on their argument, this important federal guideline might set new standards for regulators checking other cryptocurrencies. Senator Elizabeth Warren calls for the Senate to stop Trump’s corruption Despite the celebration behind getting the GENIUS Act through the final approval, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts took to the Senate floor to say there were “serious issues” with the GENIUS Act. Warren raised concerns tha t th e chamber did not tackle the issue by not voting on some bipartisan changes. She also echoed questions from many Democrats about Trump’s links to his family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial and accusations that supporters who hold his meme coin will be treated to dinner and have access to the president. Warren stated that Trump’s crypto business allows him to easily trade presidential favors like tariff breaks, pardons, and government jobs for hundreds of millions, maybe even billions, from foreign countries, wealthy individuals, and big companies. Therefore, according to her, by approving the GENIUS Act, the Senate will support this corruption and help it grow. Warren added that the GENIUS Act has many gaps and lacks strong protection, consumer protection security, and financial health. While many Democrats voted to invoke cloture, some still ask Republicans to consider amending the GENIUS Act. Still, it is unclear whether the bill will have the support in the chamber, where Republicans have a slim majority, to pass. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

One of the world’s largest e-commerce platforms is dipping its toes further into the world of digital currencies. We’re talking about Shopify, and they’re about to make paying with stablecoins a reality for many merchants and customers. What’s the Big News About Shopify USDC Payments ? According to reports citing Fortune and Wu Blockchain, Shopify is gearing up to launch a pilot program that will allow select merchants in the United States and Europe to accept payments using the USDC stablecoin. This isn’t just a theoretical concept; the pilot is slated to begin surprisingly soon, starting in late June of this year. Here are the core details of this upcoming pilot: What: Piloting the acceptance of USDC stablecoin payments. When: Starting late June this year. Where: Initially for select merchants in the U.S. and Europe. How: Developed in collaboration with Coinbase and integrated using Stripe’s payment infrastructure. On What Network: The protocol is built on Coinbase’s Base network, a Layer 2 solution. Key Feature: Designed to support features like refunds and chargebacks, crucial for e-commerce. Merchant Choice: This payment option will be entirely optional for participating merchants. This move signals a growing interest from major platforms in integrating digital assets into mainstream commerce, specifically focusing on the stability offered by stablecoins like USDC. Why USDC Stablecoin ? Understanding the Choice You might wonder why Shopify would choose a stablecoin like USDC over, say, Bitcoin or Ethereum. The answer lies in the fundamental nature of stablecoins. Unlike more volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a traditional fiat currency like the US dollar (as is the case with USDC, which aims for a 1:1 peg). This stability is absolutely critical for commercial transactions. Imagine buying a product online. You want the price you see at checkout to be the price you pay, without worrying if the value of your payment token will drop significantly in the minutes or hours it takes to process the transaction. Stablecoins eliminate this volatility risk for both the merchant and the customer at the point of sale. USDC, specifically, is one of the largest and most widely recognized regulated stablecoins, managed by Circle and Coinbase. Its reputation and widespread adoption make it a logical choice for a major e-commerce platform looking to experiment with crypto payments while minimizing volatility concerns. The Power Duo: Coinbase Stripe Partnership Explained This initiative isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s a collaborative effort involving significant players in both the crypto and traditional finance/payment sectors: Coinbase: As a major cryptocurrency exchange and technology provider, Coinbase’s involvement is multifaceted. They co-manage USDC and have been instrumental in developing the underlying protocol for these payments. Crucially, the system is built on Base, Coinbase’s own Ethereum Layer 2 network. Building on Base likely offers advantages in terms of speed and lower transaction costs compared to transacting directly on the main Ethereum network, which is vital for high-volume e-commerce. Stripe: Stripe is a global leader in online payment processing. Their integration here is key to making this pilot functional within the existing e-commerce framework. Stripe provides the necessary infrastructure to handle the payment flow, potentially managing the conversion, settlement, and crucial features like facilitating refunds and chargebacks – aspects that are standard in traditional commerce but can be complex with native crypto transactions. Their expertise bridges the gap between the crypto payment rail and the merchant’s need for reliable financial operations. This partnership leverages the strengths of each company: Coinbase’s crypto expertise and network technology (Base), Stripe’s robust payment processing capabilities, and Shopify’s massive merchant base. How Does This Boost E-commerce Crypto Adoption ? A move like this from a platform as large and influential as Shopify has the potential to significantly impact the adoption of crypto payments in online retail. Here’s why: Normalization: When a mainstream platform like Shopify offers a crypto payment option, it helps normalize the idea of using digital assets for everyday purchases. It moves crypto beyond speculation and into practical utility. Merchant Access: Shopify provides tools and services to millions of businesses worldwide. Making it easy for these merchants to accept USDC removes a major barrier to entry for crypto payments. Merchants don’t need deep technical crypto knowledge; they can potentially opt-in through their familiar Shopify dashboard. Customer Access: For customers who hold USDC or other cryptocurrencies (which can be easily converted to USDC), this provides a direct way to spend those assets within the vast Shopify ecosystem. Infrastructure Development: The development of a payment protocol specifically designed for e-commerce, including features like refunds and chargebacks on a Layer 2 network like Base, builds crucial infrastructure needed for scaling crypto payments. While starting with a pilot, a successful rollout could pave the way for wider availability across Shopify’s platform, exposing millions of merchants and hundreds of millions of customers to crypto payments. Navigating Crypto Payments Shopify : Benefits and Considerations For merchants considering opting into this pilot (or a future wider release), there are several potential benefits, but also important points to consider. Potential Benefits for Merchants: Access to a New Customer Base: Tap into the growing number of individuals holding stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. Potentially Lower Transaction Fees: Crypto transaction fees, especially on Layer 2 networks like Base, can sometimes be lower than traditional credit card processing fees, though the overall cost structure (including any conversion fees handled by the processor) needs to be evaluated. Faster Settlement? Depending on the exact implementation, crypto settlements can sometimes be faster than traditional banking channels, improving cash flow. Reduced Chargeback Risk? While the protocol supports chargebacks, the nature of blockchain transactions can potentially reduce certain types of fraudulent chargebacks compared to traditional methods, though this depends heavily on the integration details. Innovation and Brand Image: Position the business as forward-thinking and innovative by offering modern payment options. Optionality: Merchants aren’t forced to accept USDC; it’s an additional tool they can offer alongside existing payment methods. Considerations for Merchants: Operational Complexity: While the integration aims to be seamless, merchants need to understand how these payments will appear in their systems, how refunds work, and how settlement happens. Tax Implications: Accepting crypto payments has tax implications that merchants must understand and manage according to their local regulations. Customer Support: Be prepared to handle customer inquiries about paying with USDC. Market Demand: Assess if their target customer base is likely to use this payment method. For customers, the main benefit is having an additional, potentially convenient way to spend their digital assets on a platform they already use extensively. What This Means for the Future The Shopify USDC pilot is more than just a small experiment; it’s a strong signal about the direction of e-commerce and payments. It suggests that major platforms see stablecoins as a viable, less volatile entry point for integrating crypto into mainstream commerce. If successful, this pilot could lead to a wider rollout on Shopify, potentially inspiring other large e-commerce platforms to explore similar integrations. This could significantly accelerate the adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets for everyday transactions, blurring the lines between traditional finance and the crypto economy. The focus on Base also highlights the growing importance of Layer 2 scaling solutions for making blockchain transactions fast and cheap enough for high-frequency activities like online shopping. Summary Shopify is launching an exciting pilot program in late June, enabling select U.S. and European merchants to accept USDC payments. This initiative, developed with Coinbase and integrated via Stripe on the Base network, is a significant step towards mainstream e-commerce crypto adoption. By leveraging the stability of USDC and the infrastructure of its partners, Shopify is exploring a future where paying with digital assets is as common as using a credit card. While initially a pilot, its success could unlock new opportunities for merchants and customers alike, marking a pivotal moment in the integration of crypto into global commerce.

Adding her voice to the discussion, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has issued a notable warning regarding the potential impact on US inflation . According to reports citing CNBC via the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, Yellen suggested that policies involving substantial tariffs, as proposed by former President Trump, could realistically push the year-on-year inflation rate up to 3%. Why Are Comments from Janet Yellen Significant? Janet Yellen is a highly respected figure in the economic world, having served not only as U.S. Treasury Secretary but also as the Chair of the Federal Reserve. Her insights carry significant weight due to her extensive experience at the highest levels of economic policy-making. When she speaks about potential economic outcomes, particularly concerning crucial metrics like inflation, markets and analysts pay close attention. Her perspective offers a view grounded in deep understanding of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and international trade dynamics. Therefore, her warning about the inflationary potential of Trump tariffs is not merely political commentary but an assessment based on economic principles and potential real-world consequences. Understanding the Proposed Trump Tariffs and Their Mechanism During his previous term and in recent public statements, Donald Trump has advocated for imposing broad tariffs on imported goods, sometimes suggesting universal tariffs or specific high tariffs on goods from countries like China. The core idea behind tariffs is to make imported goods more expensive relative to domestically produced goods, aiming to protect or stimulate domestic industries. However, the economic mechanism by which tariffs can fuel US inflation is relatively straightforward: Increased Import Costs: Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. When these taxes are applied, the cost for importers rises. Pass-Through to Consumers: Importers and retailers typically pass these increased costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices for goods sold in the United States. Reduced Competition: By making imports more expensive, tariffs can reduce foreign competition, potentially allowing domestic producers to also raise their prices without losing market share. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, potentially leading to inefficiencies and higher costs in sourcing components or finished goods. This direct and indirect pressure on prices is what leads economists like Yellen to predict an uptick in inflation. How Could Tariffs Push US Inflation Towards 3%? A 3% inflation rate, while not historically unprecedented, represents a level that the Federal Reserve and policymakers generally aim to avoid exceeding consistently. The Federal Reserve’s target is typically around 2%. Yellen’s projection suggests that the scale and scope of the proposed Trump tariffs could be significant enough to move the needle on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by a full percentage point or more from current levels or baseline projections. Consider the volume of goods imported into the U.S. A broad tariff applied across a wide range of products – from consumer electronics and apparel to industrial components and raw materials – would impact the cost basis for a vast segment of the economy. Even if only a portion of the tariff cost is passed onto consumers, the cumulative effect across numerous goods could be substantial enough to influence the overall inflation rate significantly. Furthermore, the uncertainty and potential for retaliatory tariffs from other countries could exacerbate the situation, leading to further price volatility and supply chain issues, adding more upward pressure on prices. Exploring the Broader Economic Impact The economic impact of rising inflation, particularly if driven by tariffs, extends beyond just higher prices for consumers. Here are some potential consequences: Reduced Consumer Purchasing Power: When prices rise faster than wages, consumers can buy less with their money, potentially leading to a slowdown in consumer spending, a major driver of the U.S. economy. Increased Business Costs: Businesses face higher costs for imported inputs, which can squeeze profit margins or force them to raise their own prices, contributing further to inflation. Monetary Policy Response: Persistent inflation can pressure the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates or even hike them further to cool down the economy. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing investment and economic growth. Trade Relations: Imposing tariffs often leads to retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, harming U.S. exporters and potentially disrupting international trade flows. This complex web of effects highlights why economists view tariff-driven inflation with concern, as it can create headwinds for overall economic health. Potential Implications for the Crypto Market The potential for rising US inflation and its broader economic impact is highly relevant for participants in the crypto market . Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as a potential hedge against inflation due to their decentralized nature and finite supply, contrasting with fiat currencies that can be subject to inflationary pressures from government policies. If inflation were to rise significantly towards or above 3% due to tariffs or other factors, some investors might increasingly look to assets perceived as stores of value outside the traditional financial system. This narrative could potentially increase interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, the relationship is complex. Higher inflation could also lead to the Federal Reserve maintaining or increasing interest rates, which can make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Furthermore, a general economic slowdown caused by inflation and trade tensions could negatively impact investor sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Actionable Insight: For crypto market participants, Yellen’s warning serves as a reminder to monitor macroeconomic indicators like inflation closely. Understanding the potential economic consequences of proposed policies like tariffs can help inform investment strategies and risk assessments. Challenges and Uncertainties Predicting the exact impact of tariffs is challenging. The final inflation figure would depend on numerous factors, including the specific design and scope of the tariffs, the response of domestic and international businesses, the reaction of consumers, and the overall state of the global economy at the time. Yellen’s 3% figure is a projection based on current understanding and historical precedents, but actual outcomes can vary. Another challenge is distinguishing tariff-driven inflation from other inflationary pressures that might be present in the economy. However, a broad tariff implementation would likely be a significant and identifiable contributor. Conclusion: A Warning Worth Heeding Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s warning that Trump tariffs could elevate US inflation to 3% underscores the potential economic consequences of protectionist trade policies. While tariffs aim to support domestic industries, economists widely agree that they can lead to higher costs for consumers and businesses, contributing to inflationary pressures and potentially broader negative economic impact . For those involved in the crypto market , these macroeconomic shifts are crucial to watch, as they can influence market dynamics and investment narratives. The discussion around tariffs and inflation is far from over, and Yellen’s comments add a significant voice to the debate, highlighting a potential challenge that policymakers and the public may need to confront.

With the Trump administration pushing to make the US the ‘crypto capital of the planet,’ racing to bring stablecoins to the masses, regulatory clarity appears imminent – but the real question is whether this political momentum will elevate stablecoins as transformative financial infrastructure or merely solidify them as casino chips for traders in a speculative market. The paradox of today’s stablecoins Stablecoins were meant to bridge crypto and TradFi (traditional finance), yet they remain largely confined to intra-crypto trading. They were originally envisioned as frictionless, programmable dollars that could flow across the globe in seconds. Yet, in practice, they have largely been used to arbitrage, speculate and navigate exchange inefficiencies. High-profile failures like TerraUSD’s algorithmic collapse, depegging events from USDC and Tether and ongoing concerns over opaque reserves expose a paradox that today’s stablecoins mimic the structural fragilities of the very financial systems they were meant to disrupt. While fiat-backed models may command the security of treasuries or bank deposits, they introduce counterparty risk, being repackaged under the label of innovation. In effect, most stablecoins don’t remove risk but rebrand it. Political opportunism The push for a stablecoin bill by August 2025 by Trump could bring much-needed legal certainty. But if legislation is shaped by industry lobbying and political self-interest, such as the Trump-linked stablecoin venture being formed, it risks enabling another cycle of light-touch regulation and insider enrichment. The Terra disaster proved that without robust safeguards, stablecoins remain a ticking time bomb. Could this open the door to regulatory arbitrage, where rules are written to favor a few powerful players while smaller or more ethical projects are sidelined? Addressing the lip service A common talking point in crypto circles is that stablecoins can ‘bank the unbanked.’ Yet, to date, access to stablecoins often requires an existing relationship with crypto exchanges, fiat on-ramps and a level of digital literacy far beyond the reach of the underserved. In practice, they serve the overbanked: traders, institutions and whales. True financial inclusion requires the right infrastructure, like AI-powered wallets that automate hedging, not just dollar-pegged tokens. Stablecoins as a new form of value With a lack of clear reserve requirements or public audits, and an unclear path to adoption for those most in need, it’s important to ask whether the US should prop up legacy models or incentivize stablecoins that actually power the next economy. The future lies in stablecoins that are intelligent, AI-backed, transparent and tied to real productive assets like AI compute power, tokenized research and development or DeFi lending markets. To achieve this, policymakers must mandate real-time, on-chain PoRs (proof of reserves) as opposed to self-reported audits, reward stablecoins that enable real-world use cases (payments, AI services, DeFi) over pure speculation and promote overcollateralized models that eliminate single points of failure. The Trump administration’s crypto push is neither inherently good nor bad. It’s a test of whether the industry can mature beyond short-term profiteering. Stablecoins won’t revolutionize finance by mimicking dollars but by creating new forms of value. We shouldn’t be asking if Trump’s policies will give stablecoins a boost. We should start analyzing whether builders and regulators will demand a system that’s transparent, resilient and truly innovative.

The U.S. began evacuations from Iraq amid fears of escalating regional conflict. Crypto markets turned risk-off, with Ethereum and XRP also posting sharp losses. Bitcoin fell sharply late Thursday, sliding over 4% to $103,556 following Israeli airstrikes on Iran that intensified already fragile Middle East tensions. The drop from a 24-hour high of $108,500 came as investors reacted to the prospect of a broader geopolitical crisis, triggering a retreat from risk assets. The sharp sell-off led to the liquidation of $427 million in long positions in the past 24 hours. Israeli officials confirmed the airstrikes targeted military infrastructure near Tehran and Tabriz, describing the action as a preemptive measure in response to Iran’s nuclear threat. Bitcoin Drops as Israel’s Attack on Iran Could Continue for Days Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the operation a necessary step to “remove this threat,” adding it would continue “as many days as it takes.” Iran has yet to issue an official response, but state media reported explosions and airspace closures. Meanwhile, the U.S. began pulling diplomats from Iraq and offered voluntary evacuations to military families in neighboring countries. The State Department also issued warnings for American citizens to leave Iraq, citing regional instability. In Washington, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel acted unilaterally but had informed the U.S. beforehand. Former Trump advisor Steve Witkoff noted that nuclear negotiations with Iran are still on the table, though risks of escalation remain. Historically, Bitcoin has shown sensitivity to geopolitical unrest, often falling as traders reduce exposure to volatile assets. While the crypto asset is seen by some as a long-term hedge, its short-term price often mirrors broader risk sentiment. Ethereum followed the downward trend, slipping below $2,500, while XRP retreated to $2.10, adding to the market-wide pressure. Bitcoin Struggles to Hold $104K Amid Tensions Bitcoin is trading at $103,990 at the time of writing, showing signs of stabilization after a sharp 4% drop triggered by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Price briefly dipped below $103,000 following Israeli airstrikes on Iran but has since bounced modestly. On the 2-hour chart, BTC remains under pressure, with Bollinger Bands widening and price hugging the lower band—a sign of increased volatility and bearish momentum. Bitcoin Just Lost Its Breakout — Here’s the Support Level That Matters Now Why this report matters Bitcoin’s breakout above $106,000 didn’t hold, and that could mean more than just a failed rally. Ethereum’s funding rate has quietly collapsed, even as open interest surged… pic.twitter.com/7XH0NMaK7I — 10x Research (@10x_Research) June 13, 2025 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 25.51, deep in oversold territory, indicating potential for a short-term relief bounce. However, MACD values remain heavily negative (-438.59 MACD line), suggesting bearish momentum is still dominant. Zooming into the 30-minute timeframe, price is struggling to reclaim the $105,000 zone. RSI stands at 32.30, also near oversold levels, while MACD shows downward expansion, further reinforcing downside risk if support fails. Bollinger Bands on this timeframe show a bearish squeeze breaking to the downside. The 1-minute chart reflects short-term recovery attempts, with RSI bouncing to 66.49 and MACD crossing bullishly. Still, this minor uptick is not yet confirmed by higher timeframes, suggesting caution is warranted. Key levels to watch include immediate support at $102,533 and resistance at $105,693. A close above $105,000 could ease selling pressure, but failure to reclaim it may open the door to further losses toward $100K. For now, sentiment remains risk-off, and BTC bulls must defend current levels to avoid deeper correction.

Recently, the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert, reported a notable ETH transfer . A substantial amount of 86,430 ETH, originating from an address labeled as ‘unknown wallet,’ made its way to a platform associated with Liquid staking . Valued at approximately $237 million at the time of the transfer, this move is far from ordinary. Such a significant sum changing hands, especially from an unidentified source to a specific type of destination like liquid staking, prompts questions and speculation within the crypto community. What Exactly Happened with This Large Crypto Transfer? According to the alert disseminated by Whale Alert, the core details of the event are straightforward: Amount: 86,430 ETH Source: An address identified as ‘unknown wallet’ Destination: A platform categorized under ‘Liquid Stake’ Approximate Value: $237 million While large transactions are common on the Ethereum network, the combination of the amount, the unknown source, and the specific destination makes this large crypto transfer particularly noteworthy. It suggests a deliberate strategic decision by the holder of these assets. Why Does an Ethereum Whale Moving ETH Matter? When we talk about an Ethereum whale , we’re referring to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of ETH. These whales often have the potential to influence market dynamics simply through their buying, selling, or moving of assets. Tracking their movements can offer insights, although it’s crucial not to overinterpret single events. The movement of 86,430 ETH by an Ethereum whale to a staking platform, rather than an exchange or another private wallet, signals a potential shift in strategy. It suggests a long-term perspective focused on earning yield rather than immediate trading or selling. Exploring the Destination: What is Liquid Staking? The destination of this massive ETH transfer was a ‘Liquid Stake’ platform. But what does that mean? Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with the Merge. Under PoS, users can ‘stake’ their ETH to help secure the network and earn rewards. However, traditional staking often involves locking up ETH, making it inaccessible for other uses. Liquid staking solutions were developed to address this. They allow users to stake their ETH and, in return, receive a liquid token (like stETH, rETH, etc.) that represents their staked ETH plus earned rewards. This liquid token can then be used in other DeFi protocols, traded, or sold, providing flexibility that traditional staking lacks. The appeal of Liquid staking lies in offering the benefits of staking rewards while maintaining access to capital. This flexibility is particularly attractive to large holders or institutions who might want to earn yield without sacrificing the ability to participate in other decentralized finance activities or react to market changes. The Implications for ETH Staking and the Ecosystem This significant ETH transfer contributes directly to the total amount of ETH staked on the network. As more ETH is staked, it further strengthens the network’s security and decentralization (assuming stakes are distributed across validators and platforms). The fact that an Ethereum whale chose a Liquid staking route highlights the growing maturity and trust in these decentralized protocols. It underscores the increasing demand for yield-generating opportunities within the Ethereum ecosystem that also offer liquidity. Benefits highlighted by this move towards ETH staking via liquid platforms include: Yield Generation: Earning passive income on dormant ETH holdings. Capital Efficiency: Using the liquid staking derivative token in DeFi for lending, borrowing, or trading. Accessibility: Easier entry into staking compared to running a solo validator (which requires 32 ETH and technical know-how). However, it’s also important to consider the potential challenges and risks associated with Liquid staking : Smart Contract Risk: Vulnerabilities in the liquid staking protocol’s code could lead to loss of funds. Depeg Risk: The liquid staking token could trade below the value of the underlying ETH. Centralization Concerns: If a single liquid staking protocol gains too much dominance, it could introduce centralization risks to the network. This large crypto transfer serves as a real-world example of how significant players are navigating these considerations, opting for the benefits of liquid staking despite the inherent risks. Who Was This Unknown Wallet? The identity behind the ‘unknown wallet’ remains a mystery. It could be an early adopter, an institutional investor, a fund, or even a service moving assets internally before staking. Without further on-chain analysis or external information, it’s impossible to say definitively. What we can infer is that this entity holds a substantial amount of capital and is making calculated moves within the Ethereum ecosystem, focusing on yield through ETH staking via a liquid solution. Actionable Insights from the ETH Transfer For regular participants in the crypto market, what can be learned from this event? Whale Movements Offer Clues, Not Commands: While tracking large transactions can be insightful regarding potential trends (like the adoption of liquid staking), they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Understand Staking Options: If you hold ETH, research the different ways to stake, including solo staking, pool staking, and Liquid staking , to understand the trade-offs between yield, liquidity, and risk. Risk Assessment is Key: Any participation in DeFi, including liquid staking, carries risks. Understand the specific risks of the platform or protocol you interact with. The Ecosystem is Evolving: This large crypto transfer highlights the continuous development and adoption of new financial primitives like liquid staking within Ethereum. Staying informed about these developments is crucial. Concluding Thoughts: A Strategic Move in the Staking Landscape The movement of 86,430 ETH from an unknown wallet to a Liquid staking platform is more than just a large number; it’s a signal. It underscores the increasing importance of yield generation for significant ETH holders and the growing preference for solutions that offer both staking rewards and liquidity. While the identity of the Ethereum whale behind this move remains obscured, their action clearly points towards a strategic decision to integrate yield farming into their holding strategy, further solidifying the role of ETH staking , particularly liquid solutions, in the broader crypto landscape.

The XRP Treasury is set to launch in the second half of 2025, with Chaince Securities LLC named as its strategic advisor. The $500M Game Plan – Staking, DeFi Partnerships & 2025 Launch According to the press release , the initiative will focus on building long-term reserves of XRP, earning yield through staking, and actively working within the Ripple ecosystem. The company also plans to partner with key DeFi projects to strengthen its role in the Web3 space. Funds will be raised through equity sales, strategic deals, and structured financing. It is already in talks with crypto foundations and investors to secure strong partnerships and favorable XRP terms. Trident (TDTH) shares dropped over 30% on Thursday and are now down more than 95% in the past year. XRP has also dipped over 5% today, currently trading at $2.12. Trident CEO Soon Huat Lim views blockchain as a game-changer for global finance, and said that this move shows how public companies can play a meaningful, responsible role in shaping the world of DeFi. “We see digital assets as key enablers in the evolution of the global financial landscape. This initiative reflects our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology for capital allocation and cross-border value transfer,” he said.

SHIB is barely clinging to support, with analysts watching for a breakdown, while Pi is inching up but still miles from a real rebound. Both are stuck in neutral, waiting for that next big move. Then there’s BlockDAG , breaking every norm before even launching. Over 1.5 million people are already mining BDAG through the X1 app daily. That’s not future hype; that’s real-time traction. Most projects dream of this kind of growth years after going live. BlockDAG is doing it first. The X1 app has turned phones into powerhouses, building a global base from the ground up. While others slow down, BlockDAG is racing ahead, and it’s easy to see why many think this is the next altcoin ready to erupt. 1.5M Users & Counting: BlockDAG Redefines Adoption! BlockDAG is flipping the script on what it means to build hype in crypto. While most projects throw around big claims with nothing to show for it, BlockDAG is doing the opposite, gaining serious traction before even going live. Its X1 Miner app already has over 1.5 million people mining BDAG from their phones daily. That’s a level of activity many well-known coins didn’t see until years after launch. What’s wild is this isn’t even the final stage, this is still the warm-up. BlockDAG is building from the ground up with actual daily engagement, not empty buzz. The X1 app is free to use, easy to get started with, and has already grown into something bigger than just a mining tool. It’s created a global network of users actively participating and fueling momentum long before the official rollout. That kind of early traction is rare. Most projects chase growth after launch. BlockDAG is pulling in millions before even opening the gates, and that says a lot. Right now, it’s in Batch 29, with BDAG priced at just $0.0018. But this low price doesn’t stick around for long. On June 13, it jumps to $0.0276, and the eventual listing price is pegged at $0.05. That’s a massive window of opportunity for anyone who gets in before the climb. With over $298 million already raised and 22.3 billion coins claimed, BlockDAG isn’t waiting to prove itself; it’s already proving it, one miner at a time. Shiba Inu’s Whale Exit Raises Red Flags for Price Stability Shiba Inu is feeling the pressure after a major pullback in whale activity. Big holders slashed their transactions by 84% in just four days, dropping from 24.3 trillion SHIB on June 5 to only 3.83 trillion by June 9. That kind of sharp decline has spelled trouble in the past, often signaling a price slide not far behind. To make matters worse, whales have recently pulled out around 262 billion SHIB, suggesting growing hesitation among the biggest players. Even with all this, SHIB is still clinging to support near $0.0000119. But that level is now under serious watch; if it cracks, some analysts believe another zero could creep into the price. Sentiment leans bearish at the moment, with a majority of traders betting on a drop. Unless something major turns the tide, SHIB might stay stuck in a tight range between $0.000010 and $0.000017. Right now, it’s a waiting game, and the pressure’s building. PI Price Stabilizes, But Community Patience Wears Thin Pi Network is trading around $0.641 after a modest 1% bump, but it’s still a long way off from its monthly peak, down nearly 40%. A recent 2 million PI transfer, likely a private deal between wallets, has caught some attention, with talk of potential institutional interest. Still, that hasn’t been enough to shift short-term sentiment, which remains cautious. A move back to $1.20 is seen as key to sparking real momentum. Within the community, opinions are split. Some are looking ahead to the June 28 “Pi Day 2” event, hoping it brings major news, maybe even exchange listings. But others are losing patience, especially those who’ve cleared KYC and are still waiting for their coins. Complaints about slowed mining and lack of visible updates haven’t helped either. For now, Pi is stuck in limbo. It’s holding steady, but unless something big drops soon, it may stay grounded instead of lifting off. Final Thoughts Shiba Inu is seeing a major slowdown in whale activity, casting doubt on its near-term momentum. Meanwhile, Pi Network is holding its ground but still struggling to recapture earlier highs, with attention now shifting to a possible update on June 28. Both seem stuck in pause mode, waiting for something to kickstart the action. BlockDAG isn’t waiting around. It’s already hitting serious benchmarks, with 1.5 million users mining through the X1 app every day, even before launch. That level of engagement is rare and speaks volumes about where this project is headed. The current price sits at just $0.0018 until June 13, after which it climbs sharply to $0.0276, with a launch target of $0.05. That’s a huge jump locked in for those getting in early. While others hope for a spark, BlockDAG is generating its own buzz, one phone, one miner, one day at a time.

The company has filed a Tesla lawsuit against a former engineer, alleging the theft of critical trade secrets related to its highly anticipated humanoid robotics program, Optimus . What are the Allegations Behind the Tesla Lawsuit? The lawsuit, which came to light recently, centers on accusations against Zhongjie “Jay” Li, a former engineer who worked on the Optimus project. According to the complaint, Li is alleged to have stolen confidential information concerning Tesla’s development of “advanced robotic hand sensors.” The company claims this proprietary information was then used to establish a competing enterprise. Key allegations detailed in the complaint include: Li downloaded confidential data related to Optimus onto two personal smartphones. During his final months at Tesla, Li allegedly researched “humanoid robotic hands” on his work computer. He also reportedly conducted internet searches regarding venture capital and startup funding sources while still employed at Tesla. The timeline presented in the lawsuit is striking: Li worked at Tesla from August 2022 to September 2024. The complaint states that Proception, the rival company, was incorporated less than a week after his departure from Tesla. Within just five months, Proception publicly claimed to have successfully built advanced humanoid robotic hands, which Tesla alleges bear a “striking resemblance” to the designs Li worked on while at the company. How Does This Relate to Trade Secret Theft and Robotics Startups? The core of the Tesla lawsuit is the accusation of trade secret theft . Trade secrets are confidential information that provides a business with a competitive edge. In the rapidly evolving field of robotics, particularly for complex systems like humanoid hands, the design and development details of sensors and mechanics can be highly valuable intellectual property. The lawsuit highlights the risks companies face when employees move to competing ventures, especially in cutting-edge sectors. Proception, described as a robotics startup backed by Y Combinator, aims to “revolutionize human-robot interaction by building the world’s most advanced humanoid hands.” Tesla’s legal action suggests a belief that Proception’s rapid progress was facilitated by the alleged misuse of Tesla’s confidential information. Challenges for Optimus and the Humanoid Robots Market The timing of this lawsuit adds another layer to the narrative surrounding Tesla’s Optimus program. The development of humanoid robots has proven to be a complex undertaking. Since unveiling the concept in 2021, Tesla has faced delays, with the initial target of introducing the bot in 2023 pushed back. Elon Musk most recently indicated sales might begin in 2026. Public demonstrations, like the “We, Robot” event in October 2024, have sometimes shown bots primarily controlled remotely, underscoring the ongoing development challenges. This legal dispute underscores the intense competition and high stakes involved in the race to develop viable humanoid robots . The potential for trade secret theft is a significant concern for companies investing heavily in R&D in this space. As more robotics startup companies emerge, leveraging advancements in AI and hardware, protecting intellectual property becomes paramount. Bitcoin World has reached out to both Proception and Tesla for comment on the lawsuit. Summary: Tesla has filed a significant lawsuit against a former engineer, alleging he stole trade secrets related to the Optimus humanoid robot’s hand sensors and used them to launch a rival robotics startup, Proception. The case highlights the challenges of protecting intellectual property in the competitive field of advanced robotics and adds another dimension to the ongoing development story of Tesla’s Optimus program.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana sink as Israel strikes Iran",https://crypto.news/crypto-market-bitcoin-down-israel-strikes-iran-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market plunged on Friday, June 13, as rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East rattled investors. Following news that Israel had launched a major military operation against Iran, digital assets tumbled sharply. The total crypto market capitalization dropped 7% over the past 24 hours to $3.3 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) declined around 5%, trading at $103,464 as of press time. Ethereum ( ETH ) fell 10% to $2,471, while Solana ( SOL ) dropped 11% to $141. XRP ( XRP ) and BNB ( BNB ) also lost ground, down 6% and 4% respectively. Data from CoinGlass shows that crypto liquidations surged 125% in a single day, reaching $1.2 billion. Open interest across crypto futures markets fell 9.7% to $142 billion, while the relative strength index sank to 28, indicating the market had entered oversold territory. Despite the selloff, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, compiled by software firm Alternative, remained in the “Greed” zone at 61, though down 10 points from the previous day. The drop in sentiment reflects investor uncertainty, as traders assess the risk of broader conflict.

According to a Reuters report , Israeli forces hit multiple high-value targets, including uranium enrichment facilities in Natanz, ballistic missile production sites, and the headquarters of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in Tehran. Iranian state media reported the death of General Hossein Salami and civilian casualties, including children. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes marked the beginning of “Operation Rising Lion,” a campaign aimed at neutralizing Iran’s nuclear threat. Israel has declared a state of emergency, closed its main airport, and raised air defenses in anticipation of retaliatory attacks. Iran has promised a “harsh response.” U.S. secretary of state Marco Rubio confirmed the United States was not involved in the strike, emphasizing that American priorities lie in protecting its forces in the region. Apart from cryptocurrencies, traditional financial markets bore the brunt as well. U.S. stock futures dropped 1.5% across major indexes, and European markets opened lower by a similar margin. Meanwhile, safe-haven assets surged slightly. Gold rose 0.75% to $3,428 per ounce, and the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.32%. Crude oil, often seen as a geopolitical risk proxy, surged about 10% to $74 per barrel, according to data from Market Watch. With tensions climbing and the potential for regional war rising, both crypto and global markets could see continued volatility. Risk appetite may weaken further, pushing capital into safer, more liquid assets until the situation stabilizes.

Here’s Why!,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-are-bitcoin-and-altcoins-down-today-heres-why/,"The post Why Are Bitcoin and Altcoins Down Today? Here’s Why! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The global crypto market just dropped by 5.66%, leaving many investors wondering what’s going on. Bitcoin, which was recently aiming for a breakout above $109,000, has dropped back to around $104,000. That’s a 3.6% decline in just 24 hours. And it’s not just Bitcoin—Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and even meme coins like Dogecoin have followed, falling anywhere between 6% to 15%. So, what’s behind this sudden crash? Fed Rate Cut Hopes Crushed The biggest reason seems to be new signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve. After the latest inflation data came out, showing core CPI still above expectations and producer prices rising, the chances of a rate cut in June have nearly vanished. According to Fed CME tools, the market now has a 97.4% chance that the Fed will not lower interest rates this month. That’s made investors nervous, and it’s showing in crypto prices. Bitcoin ETFs See Big Outflows Another major blow came from the spot Bitcoin ETFs. After several days of strong inflows, June 12 saw a sudden reversal, with $202 million flowing out . Leading the charge was Fidelity’s ETF alone saw a $197 million withdrawal, while ARK Invest’s ETF lost over $10 million. Surprisingly, BlackRock stayed flat with zero inflows or outflows. $1.15 Billion in Crypto Liquidations Leverage traders took a big hit. In the last 24 hours, over 247,000 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations hitting $1.15 billion . The largest single liquidation order was a $201 million long on Binance. If Bitcoin drops further to around $95,800, nearly $11.76 billion worth of long positions are at risk. That could trigger another wave of sell-offs. Technical Charts Hint More Pain Meanwhile, technically, indicators hint at more struggle for Bitcoin as charts show rejection near the $106K resistance zone. Meanwhile, the MACD is showing a slight bullish crossover, but the momentum is weakening. If Bitcoin fails to hold $104K , we could see a retest of $102K or even $100K soon. Altcoin Market Suffers Too Altcoins are taking a big hit, closely following Bitcoin’s downward trend. The Altseason Index has dropped to 16, showing that Bitcoin still holds market dominance. Among the biggest losers, Ethereum (ETH) fell by over 9.29% , now trading near $2,508. While XRP, Solana, and Cardano all saw major declines, with no signs of recovery just yet.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 04:21:00
