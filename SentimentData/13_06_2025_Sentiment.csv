Speaking at Ripple Apex, he claims the once-gimmick has become more than a meme coin , distancing itself from what he generalized as “get-rich-quick rug pulls” to become “part of the ecosystem. It plays a role.” Citing Elon Musk’s continued endorsement, Garlinghouse said Musk “willed Dogecoin into so much liquidity that it’s not going away.” “I used to speak not so kindly about Dogecoin… was created as a joke, right?” ~ #Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse pic.twitter.com/pEB91t3KiP — The Crypto Times (@CryptoTimes_io) June 12, 2025 While he did not entertain a partnership, the concession marks a notable shift for a figure long-positioned on the institutional end of the spectrum—opening the door for institutional acceptance. With rising speculation around Dogecoin ETF approval, Garlinghouse’s comments may be seen as early validation, giving it more credit in the “best crypto to buy” conversation. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Could Institutions Boost DOGE? Even without a Ripple collaboration, Dogecoin may be on the breakout path, following a massive 4-year cup-and-handle pattern. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle pattern confluence zone. Source: TradingView, Binance. DOGE is currently consolidating within the descending channel forming the handle, but a fast approaching confluence zone could see a breakout unfold in the coming weeks. Key support from the 0.236 Fib level and the historic support trendline that has underpinned every major DOGE bottom since September is set to intersect with the channel’s resistance. The historic support that has marked DOGE bottoms since September could push a breakout as it intersects with the channel’s upper resistance, aligned with support from the 0.236 Fibbonnaci level. A confirmed breakout would set a technical target around $0.75—a staggering 300% gain from current levels in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. The upcoming June 15 deadline for a US spot Dogecoin ETF decision could bring the catalyst Dogecoin needs, opening the doors to institutional inflows if approved. #Dogecoin awaits eagerly for SEC ETF rulings in June. Approval odds near 80%. pic.twitter.com/nD3d0bvkmF — dogegod (@_dogegod_) June 12, 2025 Momentum indicators also point to retail inflows. The RSI has stabilized at 45 after dipping below the neutral zone, and the MACD is tightening, hinting at a potential crossover that could shift sentiment. While the setup isn’t screaming bullish yet, it’s also far from bearish. This fragile balance suggests that any uptick in volume or sentiment could tip the scales. If historic support becomes an accumulation base, DOGE could finally break the handle structure and resume its long-term uptrend. Bitcoin Could Have the Edge, With Some Help Those who jumped to speculative plays like Dogecoin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.1 million in its second presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 648% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

Knot’s assessment, delivered during his final address as FSB Chair at a Financial Stability Conference in Madrid, showed how barriers for retail crypto access have “dropped significantly,” particularly through the introduction of crypto ETFs and stablecoin issuers’ substantial Treasury holdings. His warning comes as the crypto ecosystem’s links with traditional finance continue expanding. Stablecoins settled $27.6 trillion in transactions during Q1 2025 alone , doubling Visa’s entire 2023 settlement volume. Stablecoin Transactions Vs Visa Payments Q1 Source: Bitwise The FSB Chair emphasized that while crypto doesn’t yet pose systemic risk, recent developments suggest authorities must monitor this “fast-growing market” more closely as it approaches mainstream financial integration. Institutional Infrastructure Races to Meet Demand The institutional embrace of crypto infrastructure has accelerated dramatically, with major financial players already positioning themselves for widespread adoption. A June 2 report by Cryptonews shows that UK-listed IG Group has become the first London Stock Exchange company to offer retail crypto trading . Retail clients can buy and sell 38 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, through a partnership with digital asset platform Uphold. IG Group will become the first company on the London Stock Exchange to allow retail investors to trade cryptos, including BTC, ETH, and XRP. #Bitcoin #XRP https://t.co/MImNzg9rAX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 Managing Director Michael Healy described customer demand as “ reaching a tipping point ,” positioning the FTSE 250 firm as a trusted alternative to existing crypto services. Most recently, Stripe’s aggressive crypto expansion further exemplifies this institutional momentum, with the payments giant acquiring crypto wallet infrastructure startup Privy following its $1.1 billion purchase of stablecoin platform Bridge. Privy powers over 75 million accounts across more than 1,000 teams while facilitating billions in transaction volume. It allows companies to integrate crypto wallets directly into their platforms without traditional friction. @stripe acquires crypto wallet infrastructure startup @privy_io in undisclosed deal, marking its second major crypto acquisition following the $1.1 billion Bridge purchase as stablecoins settle record $27.6 trillion in Q1 2025. https://t.co/TeTdIVgt0V — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 This acquisition allows Stripe to offer comprehensive crypto infrastructure spanning wallet creation, stablecoin payments, and fiat integration through a unified platform. This addresses growing business needs, as over 81% of crypto-aware small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) express interest in stablecoin adoption . Government-Led Digital Asset Integration Gains Momentum Government initiatives are also accelerating crypto mainstream adoption through direct blockchain-based investment products. In May, Thailand’s Ministry of Finance announced it would launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens within two months. Thailand is set to launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens, marking a step toward financial inclusivity for retail investors. #Thailand #SEC https://t.co/2akullmpsP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 These tokens would allow retail investors to purchase government bonds via blockchain-based “G-tokens” with a minimum investment threshold of just $3. Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira emphasized the initiative’s goal of broadening access to government-backed investments, particularly as commercial banks offer only 1.25% on 12-month fixed deposits. Similarly, China’s Zhejiang Province has integrated digital yuan pilots into its “first-launch economy” strategy, testing the central bank digital currency in retail debut scenarios through the “Digital Yuan + First-Launch” initiative. This represents a strategic shift from public services to consumer transactions, incorporating the currency within broader economic programs rather than treating it as a standalone technology. The approach addresses public hesitation by linking digital payments to familiar retail experiences like store launches and branded spaces. The UK government is simultaneously tightening oversight while expanding access. Starting in January 2026, crypto firms will be required to collect detailed customer information on every trade. The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting 2026. #UK #Crypto https://t.co/tHJKf7rEE5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 18, 2025 The new HMRC rules mandate that platforms record full names, addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction, including cryptocurrency type and amount transferred, is also logged. Non-compliance penalties can reach up to £300 per user. These developments suggest the crypto industry has indeed reached the tipping point Knot identified, with traditional financial barriers increasingly dissolving as digital assets integrate into mainstream economic systems.

That’s the mood across the altcoin landscape in June 2025. While Aptos (APT) surged 4% following a high-volume breakout, Cosmos (ATOM) is facing mounting skepticism over its long-touted role in blockchain interoperability. A recent analysis raised eyebrows about whether Cosmos’ interchain vision can actually deliver the seamless multi-chain world it claims to power. In contrast, a rising project, Qubetics ($TICS), is now drawing serious attention not because of grand narratives, but because of grounded application, precision engineering, and one of the most actively participated crypto presales of the year. Qubetics is building tools for the real-world financial system that legacy chains failed to support. Through its tokenized marketplace for real-world assets (RWA), this Web3 aggregator is stepping into a sector that’s gaining both institutional interest and retail curiosity. Unlike Cosmos, which is now being challenged to prove scalability beyond concept, Qubetics is showcasing scalable utility already in motion. At this critical market pivot, it’s positioning itself not only as a strong contender—but arguably the next bull run crypto leader with actual use cases and measurable ROI potential. Qubetics’ Real-World Asset Marketplace Could Power the Next Bull Run Crypto Cycle In a market where speculation still drives headlines, Qubetics’ tokenized marketplace offers something tangible. It’s the core application behind its Web3 aggregator model, designed to digitize and fractionalize real-world assets—everything from real estate to fine art and small business revenue contracts. The appeal? It connects traditional assets to a blockchain-native world while solving issues of liquidity, transparency, and cross-chain settlement. Think of a small business in Chicago wanting to raise capital without giving up equity. With Qubetics, it can tokenize future receivables or product revenues and offer them to a global pool of supporters—all settled across interoperable chains and tracked immutably. Or consider a Dubai-based property developer seeking fractional investment without regulatory friction. Qubetics turns its real estate assets into tokens accessible to compliant participants from Europe to Southeast Asia—each transaction secured by smart contracts with built-in revenue-sharing models. And it doesn’t stop with institutions. Individual community members looking to diversify their crypto portfolios with real-world exposure can do so seamlessly. This level of on-chain integration, backed by a secure RWA marketplace, makes Qubetics not just a tech novelty but a full-fledged bridge between DeFi and TradFi. As the infrastructure matures, so too does Qubetics’ role in driving the next bull run crypto cycle forward—not through hype, but through adoption. Qubetics Presale: Structuring ROI Around the Next Bull Run Crypto Surge Currently in Stage 37, the Qubetics presale is entering a zone of rapid momentum. With a token price of $0.3370, the project has raised over $17.9 million, distributing 515 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,900 wallets. Only 10 million tokens remain at this price before the next pricing tier begins—and ultimately, before the presale closes altogether. At that point, $TICS becomes a market-listed asset, exposed to volatility, competition, and demand mechanics beyond current presale economics. Now take a real-world example: A $7,000 buy-in at today’s rate delivers 20,772 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s a 197% return. At $5, it becomes $103,860. And if $TICS reaches $10 or $15, the same stake transforms into $207,720 or $311,580 respectively. Even modest entry points matter. A $100 purchase, for instance, secures 296 tokens, which at $10 delivers nearly $3,000 in value. This dynamic—paired with a total supply reduced from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and 38.55% allocated to the public—cements Qubetics’ credibility as one of the best crypto pre sale opportunities in the current cycle. With only one more presale tier likely before its mainnet launch in Q2 2025, $TICS now presents an entry window that’s quickly narrowing. The structure, transparency, and timing of the Qubetics presale set it apart as a clear contender among the next bull run crypto selections—especially for those who value clarity over chaos. Cosmos Faces Increasing Criticism Over Interoperability and Scaling Promises Cosmos has long touted its “Internet of Blockchains” vision, aiming to unify decentralized ecosystems through modular chains and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. But a recent analysis from Blockchain Magazine questions whether Cosmos can scale that vision in 2025, calling out its architectural limitations and lack of enterprise traction. Key concerns include Cosmos’ reliance on hub-and-zone architecture, which critics argue introduces latency and doesn’t support high-frequency microtransactions efficiently. More so, the interchain model, while conceptually clean, has yet to demonstrate seamless multi-chain operations at scale in real-world commercial settings. The report questions whether Cosmos has become more of a developer’s sandbox than a go-to infrastructure for cross-chain consumer applications. Yet despite these critiques, Cosmos still holds relevance—especially for smaller networks seeking independence with modular governance. However, as the next cycle favors real-world integrations, protocols like Qubetics—which already offer on-chain asset management and Web3 infrastructure convergence—may increasingly pull attention and capital. While Cosmos deserves credit for pioneering blockchain interoperability discussions, its current scrutiny puts its placement in the next bull run crypto class at risk unless significant architectural upgrades are made. Aptos Sees 4% Jump as Technical Breakout Signals Bullish Continuation In contrast to Cosmos’ technical headwinds, Aptos (APT) is showing signs of renewed strength. As reported by CoinDesk on June 10, APT rallied by 4% following a technical breakout that occurred on high trading volume. Analysts attribute this movement to a strong reversal pattern that saw the asset reclaim support zones previously seen in Q1, bolstered by increasing participation from spot buyers. The uptick was also notable for its context. While many Layer 1s are experiencing stagnation, Aptos is finding fresh footing among traders seeking responsive price movements. The chart setup now points to a potential short-term push beyond resistance levels, which could trigger follow-through buying and improved sentiment around the project. Whether this turns into long-term momentum remains to be seen. However, in the context of short-term trading, Aptos’ performance places it among the more agile contenders. With technical strength returning and broader Layer 1 rotation continuing, Aptos is earning a spot among the next bull run crypto assets to watch—particularly for market participants focused on volatility-driven growth. Conclusion: Three Chains, Three Paths to the Next Bull Run Crypto Class The altcoin space in mid-2025 is a study in contrasts. Cosmos, once the interoperability poster child, now faces hard questions about scale and commercial viability. Aptos, on the other hand, is showing signs of technical life, surging on high volume and bullish patterns. And then there’s Qubetics—emerging not from hype, but from a structured presale, a fully integrated real-world asset platform, and a clear mainnet roadmap that signals readiness, not just potential. For those navigating the complexity of the current market and searching for the next bull run crypto, this trio presents distinct propositions. But among them, Qubetics stands out—not just for its upside, but for its tangible utility, economic design, and strategic timing. As more early adopters gravitate toward transparency, usability, and secure token mechanics, Qubetics has already made its case to be the best crypto presale of the year—and possibly the defining Layer 1 of the next growth phase. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What is the next bull run crypto to watch in 2025? Qubetics, Aptos, and Cosmos are key altcoins, but Qubetics is gaining traction due to its RWA marketplace and presale performance. Why is Qubetics considered a strong next bull run crypto pick? It combines Web3 aggregation with a tokenized asset platform and a tightly structured presale nearing completion. Is Aptos showing signs of a bullish reversal? Yes, Aptos rallied 4% following a high-volume breakout, suggesting renewed short-term bullish momentum.

Nocut News reported that the Daegu District Court Criminal Division upheld all but one of the original verdicts and sentences. A 43-year-old ringleader is facing up to three years in prison. Kimchi Premium: Appeal Unsuccessful The judge did, however, overturn another of the traders’ verdicts. In the original trial, this individual (name withheld for legal reasons) was given an 18-month suspended jail term. However, the Presiding Judge Oh Deok-sik ruled on June 12 that this sentence was “overly lenient,” instead sending this trader to prison for 18 months. The traders were all found guilty of violations of the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information and the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act. The court heard evidence that the group illegally smuggled hundreds of billions of won worth of foreign currency into the country by reselling cryptoassets they had purchased in Japan. Prosecutors explained that the group worked in conjunction with a group of Japanese investors. Together, they concocted a carefully planned bid to exploit the kimchi premium . At the time, Bitcoin (BTC) prices were significantly higher in South Korea. Demand was growing as trading volumes on domestic crypto exchanges spiked. Prosecutors said the group illegally smuggled about 400 billion won ($296 million) worth of foreign currency across international borders. The overseas investors paid the group approximately 27 billion won (almost $20 million) for its services. The kimchi premium as calculated by Scolkg/Cryprice at the time of writing. (Source: Scolkg/Cryprice) Traders Deny Wrongdoing The defendants denied all the charges. They claimed the transactions could not be classified as “capital transactions,” as they involved crypto, not cash. As such, these deals were not subject to standard declaration laws. However, the appellate court rejected these claims. The judge ruled that the defendants “took advantage of the price differences between countries for virtual assets to export foreign currency and obtain commission fees.” The judge added that the original sentence “appears to be appropriate.” Justice Oh added that the court had seen “no other evidence that would require a change in sentence.” Education Ministry accused of shielding group tied to after-school certification scandal https://t.co/Z2fVGqwR8X — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) June 11, 2025 However, in the case of the trader who was jailed instead of receiving a suspended term, the court explained that while this individual only received just over $4,000 in “commission fees,” the nature of this individual’s crime was grave. The court heard that this trader held an important role in the business community and used shell companies to perpetrate the crime.

However, trading volume over the past 24 hours tells a different story. Spot market volume for $GRASS has surged by over 55% in the last 24 hours, with CoinGlass data revealing that derivative market volume has also jumped by over 95% during the same period.

Examining funding rates in the derivative market, as of June 12, rates have shifted from negative to positive, typically indicating bullish market sentiment. A positive funding rate in derivatives markets means long position holders pay short position holders. This occurs when the derivative contract price exceeds the underlying asset’s spot price. All these factors point to strategic whale activity, especially if volume returns to the market. With $GRASS still down over 55% from its all-time high of $3.90, whales purchasing current dips are positioned for potential gains exceeding 125% if the DePIN token reclaims its November 2024 peaks. Technical Analysis: $1.56 Make-or-Break Level Could Trigger Major Rally The GRASS/USDT daily chart shows the asset in a corrective phase following an impulsive five-wave Elliott structure, with wave (4) likely complete and price currently consolidating. The SMA (9) at $1.9442 acts as dynamic resistance, and the price is currently trading below it, around $1.72, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. Source: TradingView Despite the pullback, a visible demand zone around $1.56–$1.68 provides support. If this zone holds, we could witness a reversal toward marked resistance levels. The first upside target is $2.24–$2.34, and with building momentum, the price could advance toward target 2, which is $2.52–$2.62. A break above this level would allow a move to retest December’s high at $3.686, with the green-shaded zone projecting bullish continuation toward $3.67. Overall, the price maintains a higher low structure, suggesting the broader trend could remain bullish if the current support zone holds. A breakdown below $1.56 would invalidate this scenario and shift sentiment bearish.

The company submitted an S-3ASR registration statement , enabling the resale of up to 58,699,760 shares related to its private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing. The Thursday filing allows more than 100 shareholders in the PIPE round to sell their shares, effectively flooding the market and triggering a post-close sell-off, Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, a publicly-traded firm that's pursuing crypto reserve strategy centered on bitcoin BTC, explained in an X post and an interview with CoinDesk. The company raised $450 million earlier this month through a PIPE round from a wide range of investors, including ConsenSys, Galaxy, and Pantera Capital, to acquire ETH for its treasury. Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin also joined the firm as board chairman. However, there may be a larger strategy behind the latest move. Allen said in an X post that he thinks the company may have quietly raised up to $1 billion to buy more ETH using an at-the-market (ATM) offering that was previously announced in a May 30 SEC filing . ""If they played cards right, they would expect a surprise PR tomorrow with $1B of ETH purchases, which could light the match to reignite the stock,"" he said.

Speaking at a White House event Thursday, Trump delivered his harshest criticism of Powell’s monetary policy approach, claiming that lowering rates by just one percentage point could save the United States $300 billion annually, while a two-point reduction would generate $600 billion in savings. Why Trump Wants to ‘Force Something’ Trump’s latest verbal assault marks the third time in two days that his administration has publicly targeted Powell. It follows similar criticisms from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Vice President JD Vance, who called the Fed’s stance “monetary malpractice.” The president has been saying this for a while, but it's even more clear: the refusal by the Fed to cut rates is monetary malpractice. https://t.co/HqUjWxwcHs — JD Vance (@JDVance) June 11, 2025 The coordinated pressure campaign came from the administration’s growing impatience with the central bank’s independence, particularly as Trump faces re-election pressures and seeks to demonstrate economic leadership. Despite repeatedly calling Powell “Too Late” and questioning why firing him would be controversial, Trump stopped short of threatening termination, instead ominously suggesting he “may have to force something” if rate cuts don’t materialize soon. The timing of Trump’s criticism appears strategic, coming as recent economic indicators show inflation cooling and energy prices declining due to increased domestic drilling under his “drill, baby, drill” energy policy. US Inflation Rate Source: TradingEconomics Powell’s current term as Fed chair expires in May 2026, and Trump has hinted that an announcement regarding his nominee for the next Fed chair could come soon. Harvard legal experts suggest that while Trump may have constitutional authority to remove Powell, such a move would likely trigger severe market volatility and undermine the Fed’s credibility as an inflation fighter, potentially causing long-term interest rates to spike even if short-term rates were cut. Presidential Pressure Campaign Intensifies Fed Independence Debate The escalating confrontation between Trump and Powell is a fundamental clash over Federal Reserve independence with deep constitutional and economic implications. Trump’s frustration stems from his belief that the current interest rate environment unnecessarily burdens federal borrowing costs, particularly as the government faces mounting short-term debt obligations approved during the Biden administration. Europe Rate Cuts Source: European Central Bank The president argued that Europe has implemented ten rate cuts while the Fed has delivered none, despite similar economic conditions and falling inflation metrics. Legal scholars say that while the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 allows governors to be removed “for cause,” the Supreme Court’s recent decisions have gradually eroded the traditional “for cause” protections that independent agencies have enjoyed for 85 years. Harvard Law School’s Daniel Tarullo, a former Fed Board member, suggests that three conservative justices have hinted at potentially treating the Federal Reserve differently from other agencies, possibly creating a carve-out based on the central bank’s historical precedent dating back to the First and Second Banks of the United States. However, market dynamics may provide Powell with more protection than legal statutes, as any attempt to remove the Fed chair would likely trigger immediate and severe market reactions that would prove counterproductive to Trump’s economic objectives. The anticipated market volatility is a powerful disincentive, particularly given that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has focused on maintaining stable 10-year Treasury rates, which are key for economic investment decisions. Recent economic indicators have strengthened Trump’s argument for immediate monetary easing. Inflation data show continued price stability and energy costs declining due to expanded domestic oil production. The favorable Producer Price Index reading in May has calmed fears about tariff-induced inflation spikes, emboldening the administration to intensify pressure on the Fed while markets increasingly price in potential rate cuts later this year.

The product, called the Coinbase One Card, was announced during the company’s State of Crypto Summit in New York, where CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that only US-based Coinbase One subscribers will have access. The cashback rate starts at 2%, and the more crypto a user holds on Coinbase, the higher the percentage climbs. The card reportedly runs on the American Express network, and comes with travel perks, purchase protections, and limited-time offers. The physical card itself is metal and engraved with part of the Bitcoin genesis block. According to Yahoo Finance, Brian said, “We’re excited to bring more utility to everyday spending. Why shouldn’t you earn 4% on your checking account?” Coinbase offers basic tier membership to unlock access The company is also rolling out a Basic tier for Coinbase One to make the new card available at a lower cost. For $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, users can unlock access to the Coinbase One Card without additional fees. That same tier offers zero trading fees on up to $500 per month, 4.5% APY on the first $10,000 of USDC, and up to $1,000 in account protection in case of unauthorized access. Since Coinbase One launched in 2023, its membership base has allegedly reached almost one million people, all of whom use the service for crypto trading, staking, and reward benefits. Brian said the Basic tier is designed to reach a wider audience, including those who are just getting started. Brian says bitcoin could replace dollar if debt crisis worsens During the Summit, Brian was asked about the future of Bitcoin and whether it could become the world’s reserve currency. “If the debt situation doesn’t get fixed, I do think that eventually Bitcoin will have to become the reserve currency—for better or worse,” he said. He blamed growing US debt and deficit spending, warning that without urgent action from Congress, the global financial system could shift away from the US dollar. “It’s not going to be the Chinese RMB,” Brian said. “They have their own debt problems.” He said rising national debt and Bitcoin’s all-time highs aren’t a coincidence. He added that in history, once a country decouples its currency from hard assets, inflation eventually follows. He cited 150% to 200% debt-to-GDP ratios as danger zones and said, “It’s like the frog slowly getting cooked.” Brian expressed support for current bipartisan crypto legislation in Congress, praising the Trump administration for its stance. He also said the Stablecoin Act, the Clarity Act, and the Genius Act should be passed before Congress leaves for summer recess. “We need to stick the landing,” he said. “The president wants those bills signed into law by August.” When asked if recent tax legislation could be the trigger for a financial crisis, Brian replied, “I’m reading both sides on this. I don’t know enough to say for sure, to be honest.” He suggested a follow-up bill might be necessary to address discretionary spending and prevent further economic fallout. He also revealed a partnership with Shopify that enables merchants to accept USDC payments directly. Alongside the AMEX-backed One Card, Coinbase now has a debit card through Visa, too. Source: Coinbase “We’re not trying to fight Visa and AMEX,” Brian said. “We’re working with them. But crypto is making people question the margins.” He added that the smarter card networks are already working on stablecoin strategies to avoid being left behind. On the topic of Circle, issuer of USDC, Brian confirmed Coinbase still holds equity in the company. “We’re the largest distribution partner for USDC,” he said. Their agreement is “substantial,” and Brian believes the market isn’t fully pricing that into Coinbase’s stock. When asked if he’d ever consider acquiring Circle, Brian said, “We’d always consider it, but it takes two parties.” He closed the interview by responding to a warning from CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who reminded crypto investors that regulation is coming. Brian agreed. “There are no free rides,” he said. “Regulation will be a huge boon. We’re actively working all over DC to get it done.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Bitcoin|Coinbase,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-12 23:53:06

Since the given estimates for liquidations are based on publicly available data, they may not reflect the true magnitude of market liquidations.

In other news, outgoing chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) sounded the alarm on the systemic risks posed by crypto’s deepening integration with traditional finance. Good as the market have been, whales have began mooving their money. If you’ve absorbed enough crypto content, you probably already know just how much power whales have when it comes to moving prices. According to data from Santiment, with crypto markets ranging, the importance of where whales are moving their money is at a premium. On-chain data shows a whale on Binance was liquidated on a $201M BTC/USDT long position in a single order. Bitcoin whale liquidation in real time on Binance Exchanges like Bybit, OKX and Binance saw the biggest hits, with Binance alone accounting for nearly $258.79 million in liquidations. The liquidations largely hit major tokens, with bitcoin leading the pack at over $308 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. Bitcoin markets steer profits On the other hand, Bitcoin’s several breakouts past $110,000 this week have pushed bullish market sentiment to a seven-month high. The sentiment was last seen during US President Donald Trump’s election win. As of June 11, there are 2.12 positive Bitcoin comments for every negative comment on social media, crypto analytics platform Santiment said in a June 11 X post. During this cycle, retail interest in Bitcoin has been subdued, with the price increases largely credited to institutional and nation-state adoption. An optimistic change in retail sentiment may serve as an extra advantage for Bitcoin. On June 11, Santiment data recorded 504.54 positive sentiment comments regarding Bitcoin, contrasted with 237.71 negative comments, resulting in a ratio of 2.12. Santiment monitors Bitcoin market sentiment across platforms such as X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, Bitcoin Talk, and Farcaster. 😍 With Bitcoin teasing its $112K all-time high the past couple days, retail has gotten bullish.

This growing focus on long-term strength links directly to Hyperliquid price movement, where momentum is already picking up speed. A new exchange listing has lifted HYPE’s value, and charts are signaling a possible trend shift. Though both assets are gaining traction for separate reasons, BlockDAG (BDAG) is setting a new direction entirely. Over 1.5 million individuals are currently mining BDAG through the X1 Miner App, eliminating the need for hardware or setup. Mining is now as easy as using a smartphone, and with a low presale price still available and future value projections reaching $5, attention is rising fast. Cardano Price Prediction Suggests Breakout Potential Cardano price prediction is becoming more prominent due to increased institutional inflows, strong technical signs, and ADA regaining a 1% share of the total crypto market. Market watchers are closely monitoring ADA as it approaches the important Fibonacci golden pocket zone, which is typically seen as a signal for upcoming price movement. ADA’s behavior resembles Bitcoin’s early bull cycle stages, indicating the potential for fresh growth. Should this trend continue, Cardano price prediction could see targets surpassing $1.00, supported by accumulation trends and renewed support from both retail and larger buyers. Hyperliquid Price Movement Accelerates With Binance US Listing Boost Hyperliquid price movement has picked up after Binance US shared plans to list HYPE, driving a sharp 15% rise in a single day. Currently at $37.77, HYPE has jumped 81% in the past month. Analysts are noticing a rounding bottom pattern forming on the charts, a sign of possible continuation. If HYPE breaks beyond the $39 neckline, it might head toward the $50 level. This increased activity in the Hyperliquid price movement is further supported by higher futures open interest and robust trading volume. These signs point to a wider shift in DeFi user sentiment as engagement increases. BlockDAG App Transforms Phone Usage Into Daily Mining Activity BlockDAG is changing how people get involved with mining by making the process user-friendly. More than 1.5 million people are mining BDAG coins each day through the X1 Miner App , removing the need for costly equipment or tech skills. Mining becomes a simple daily task, where people use just their phones to earn. The app allows users to tap a lightning icon once a day to mine up to 20 BDAG. It avoids battery drain, heat issues, or complex setups. There’s also a leaderboard and referral feature that boosts mining rates, helping the user base grow quickly. BlockDAG’s presale is also gaining strong attention. The project has raised $297 million and sold 22.4 billion coins so far. Starting at $0.001, the price has already increased by 2,660% to its current level in batch 29. A limited-time offer still allows purchases at $0.0018. This rare pricing period has increased activity, as many believe BDAG could reach $5. With this traction and simple app-based mining, many consider BDAG the best crypto to buy now. To Wrap Up! Cardano price prediction remains a key topic as ADA moves toward a critical resistance range, backed by solid indicators and a rising market share. Hyperliquid price movement brings different momentum after a listing-led rally, with eyes on its ability to continue upward. But in terms of user involvement and ease of entry, BlockDAG stands apart. More than 1.5 million users are already mining BDAG with their smartphones, and with the presale price of $0.0018 still available for a limited time, attention continues to grow. As $5 predictions emerge, BlockDAG is not just gaining traction; it’s seen by many as the best crypto to buy now while this pricing window remains open.

CNBC reports that in a note to clients, Wells Fargo automotive and mobility analyst Colin Langan says that Tesla’s core auto business continues to weaken, which could weigh down on the company’s stock. “ While ‘order’ pricing on the website appears stable over the [last 12 months], aggressive financing promotions continue to act as price cuts. Risk to Q2 margin remains given lower leverage.” The bank is giving Tesla an underweight rating and a $120 price target, which means that the company’s shares could drop by 61% from Monday’s closing price of $308.58. The bank’s bearish forecast comes even as investors anticipate the company’s robotaxi launch in Austin today. The vehicles are set to provide on-demand transportation without human drivers. Lanang says that potential tailwinds, including Tesla’s work on autonomous driving, are not enough to offset weak automotive numbers. “Most investor attention is directed at the June 12th Austin Robotaxi deployment. We doubt the likely limited debut will be enough to overshadow the poor fundamentals.” Tesla’s global deliveries are down 23% year over year amid steeper competition in China. TSLA has already dropped by more than 22% in 2025. In June alone, the stock slumped by nearly 10%.

(NYSE: GME) has announced the pricing of its upsized sale of convertible senior notes due 2032. The established gaming retailer up-scaled its sale of notes from $1.75 billion, announced earlier this week, to about $2.25 billion. The company also announced that initial purchasers of the notes will be given an option to purchase an additional $450 million within a 13-day period. As a result, GameStop has estimated to raise up to $2.68 billion after the sale of notes is closed June 17, 2025. Could GameStop Be Preparing for More Bitcoin Purchases? The company indicated that the funds will be used to make strategic acquisitions and investments, which aligns with its long-term goal. As Coinpedia previously reported , GameStop has already disclosed holding around 4,710 Bitcoins, which were purchased during the first quarter of 2025. “GameStop intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions,” the announcement noted . The company has been betting on an imminent parabolic rally of Bitcoin in the long haul, fueled by clear crypto regulatory frameworks in the United States. Furthermore, more companies have followed in the footsteps of Strategy in implementing a BTC treasury management plan to hedge against inflation. At the time of this writing, around 228 entities, led by publicly traded companies, have adopted a BTC treasury management plan. Consequently, the supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to exponentially decline, thus further exacerbating the existing supply vs demand shock.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 00:02:31

That marks a $33 billion increase so far this year, a 17% rise, driven by renewed crypto trading activity, growing use in payments, and increased regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump. Source: CryptoQuant . USDT and USDC Lead $33B Market Cap Jump According to the report, Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC continue to lead the market. USDT now holds a $155 billion market cap, up $18 billion year-to-date. USDC has gained $17 billion, climbing to a record high of $61 billion, an increase of 39% since January. On centralized exchanges, stablecoin reserves are also surging. The total value of ERC-20 stablecoins held on exchanges has reached $50 billion. Stablecoins are booming again. Market cap hit a record $228B, up $33B (+17%) in 2025. Driven by rising trading activity, growing payment use, and clearer U.S. regulation under Trump. pic.twitter.com/76zKj49UWB — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 12, 2025 USDC reserves in particular have grown 1.6 times in 2025 alone, now totaling around $8 billion. This influx supports deeper liquidity for crypto markets. The report also noted that stablecoins are bouncing back in the yield-bearing segment. These are stablecoins that pay interest to holders, often used in DeFi. The value of staked stablecoins has reached $6.9 billion, up 28% since late May. Most of that growth has come from rising demand for sUSDe and sUSDs, which gained $1.23 billion and $700 million in market cap, respectively. A recent report from on-chain data platforms Artemis and Dune shows broader user adoption. According to the report, titled “The State of Stablecoins 2025,” active stablecoin wallets rose from 19.6 million to 30 million over the past year, a 53% increase. The report said the data “suggests wider user engagement” and pointed to stablecoins becoming a key part of digital finance. It also noted that stablecoins are increasingly used in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and NFTs. “Stablecoins have emerged as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto,” it said, “and are becoming a core piece of payment and settlement infrastructure.” This surge in usage is also supported by the rise in real-world payment activity. Data from Artemis shows $94.2 billion in stablecoin transactions were settled between January 2023 and February 2025. Business-to-business (B2B) payments made up the largest chunk, reaching an annual run rate of $36 billion. Card-linked payments using stablecoins crossed $13 billion in volume. Stablecoin Legislation Gains Ground as Tech and Finance Giants Pile In Increased demand has also come alongside progress on the regulatory front. For example, the U.S. Senate advanced the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” or GENIUS Act this week. Backed by President Trump, the bill is designed to create a federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins. The legislation would require stablecoins to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or highly liquid assets. It would also mandate annual audits for issuers with over $50 billion in market cap, and include requirements for foreign issuers. The U.S. Senate Set for Historic Stablecoin Showdown as GENIUS Act nears final vote. #Stablecoins #GeniusAct https://t.co/ZJ59XzuQcn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 The Senate voted 68-30 to invoke cloture on the bill , clearing the way for final debate and vote. “This did not happen by accident,” said Senator Tim Scott, one of the bill’s co-sponsors. “To those who said Washington could not act… let’s prove them wrong.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent backed the legislation during a Wednesday Senate hearing. He said stablecoins could play a major role in expanding the use of the U.S. dollar globally. “I think $2 trillion is a very reasonable number,” Bessent said, referring to an estimate that the stablecoin market could exceed that level by 2028. “I could see it greatly exceeding that.” BREAKING – U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent: – Stablecoin regulations backed by U.S. Treasuries will expand global USD usage – We could see stablecoin demand exceed $2 TRILLION This is massive for crypto.

His statement centers on Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, whom he believes is preparing several initiatives that could significantly impact the token’s trajectory. Developer Anticipated to Reveal Major Plans In a recent post titled Reality Check, Delgado hinted that Kusama has multiple strategic developments in progress, though not yet disclosed publicly. While specifics remain unclear, Delgado expressed confidence that these efforts could reshape Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and attract renewed investor interest. He also referenced the popular hashtag #1CentDreamSHIB , reaffirming the longstanding goal within the Shiba Inu community to eventually push SHIB’s price to $0.01. According to Delgado, the upcoming initiatives, once unveiled, could substantially increase the token’s demand and utility, possibly creating conditions that favour price appreciation. Reality Check: @ShytoshiKusama still has several ACEs up his sleeve, when they hit the table it will turn the game upside down. #1CentDreamSHIB — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) June 11, 2025 Long-Term Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Target: $0.01 The aspiration to see SHIB reach one cent remains a central focus for many holders. Analysts such as Delgado and Shiba Inu’s marketing figure Lucie , have consistently supported this goal. However, it faces considerable skepticism due to SHIB’s vast circulating supply. The token currently trades at approximately $0.00001258. To reach the $0.01 target, the token would need to increase in value by over 78,000%. At that level, its market capitalization would rise to an estimated $5.89 trillion, assuming the current supply of roughly 589.5 trillion SHIB remains unchanged. This figure would exceed the total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency sector, which is presently valued at about $3.39 trillion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shytoshi Kusama’s Recent Activities Despite growing speculation within the community, Kusama has been largely inactive on social media. His last post on X was dated May 29, 2025. Before stepping back, he mentioned his ongoing work on a white paper focused on artificial intelligence and its intersection with Shiba Inu. This AI-focused white paper appears to be his primary undertaking, as suggested by updates to his X profile and location settings. According to previous communications, the document will explore how Shiba Inu could play a role in emerging AI technologies. Ecosystem Developments Continue While Kusama directs attention to the upcoming white paper, the broader Shiba Inu development team remains active. Recent initiatives include the release of an upgraded decentralized finance (DeFi) toolkit. This new set of tools aims to improve how users interact with SHIB, particularly in terms of earning, trading, and token burning. Additionally, the Shiba Inu team recently announced a collaboration with TokenPlay.ai, a gaming platform powered by artificial intelligence and developed by Astra Nova. As part of the partnership, users can design Shiba Inu-themed games without coding experience. The initiative also includes a play-to-earn component, allowing users to earn rewards through gameplay. The project will debut with a Shiba-themed game and later introduce an arcade-style gaming hub called Shib.fun, further expanding the ecosystem’s offerings.

The token is currently trading at $8.403, up 1.82% (+$0.150), and has managed to break past the previous resistance range of $ 7.50–$ 8.00. This upward movement signals growing buying interest, and that momentum could be building for a stronger push ahead. Key Support And Resistance Levels Define UNI’s Next Move In his analysis, Crypto Man MAB highlighted UNI’s evolving price structure, pointing to key support and resistance levels. The immediate support is seen around $7.103, which marks the 24-hour low. If UNI pulls back further, stronger support may be found near $6.500, a level that has previously attracted buying interest and could act as a safety net for bulls. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) Blastoff At Hand? The Sleeping Giant Awakens At $4.6 Support On the upside, resistance stands near $8.677, the recent 24-hour high. This zone is currently capping the rally, but if buying momentum persists, UNI could target the $9.0 mark next. While this level presents a psychological barrier, it also aligns with short-term bullish projections, adding more weight to its significance. In terms of market activity, Crypto Man MAB noted a notable increase in trading volume, which aligns with UNI’s recent price surge. This volume spike suggests that buyers are stepping in with strong conviction, reinforcing the strength behind the upward movement. A sustained high volume typically validates price action, which supports the argument for a potential rally continuation, provided the momentum holds and no major resistance halts the trend. Breakout Signals Strength, But Long-Term Caution Lingers According to the analyst, the UNI chart shows a shift from a period of consolidation into a noticeable upward breakout. The recent dominance of green candlesticks points to growing bullish moves and renewed buying pressure in the short term. Related Reading: Uniswap Stays On Course For More Gains – $12.3 Resistance In Sight However, the longer-term trend suggests a more cautious outlook. Over the last 180 days, UNI has declined by 53.31%, and its one-year performance shows a decrease of 18.98%, indicating that the asset has been in an overall downtrend despite recent gains. Presently, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) is demonstrating increased trading activity, which aligns with the positive price movement and supports the current bullish sentiment. This rise in volume may strengthen the case for a possible continuation of the ongoing upward trend, but traders should remain alert to any shifts in momentum. In conclusion, Crypto Man MAB noted that UNI is showing short-term upward strength, but the broader trend remains uncertain. However, a clear breakout above the $8.677 resistance level would be a strong signal for continued upside.

These efforts are driven by the high level of… pic.twitter.com/CJub0rPQ9c — Icekento (@icekento1) June 12, 2025 Assistant Commissioner Mario Wong Ho-yin said the department had handled seven cryptocurrency-related money laundering cases between 2021 and May 2025, involving over HK$9 billion. Crypto Fraud Cases Prompt New Law Enforcement Collaboration Wong said these offenses crossed international borders and required collaboration among law enforcement agencies, academic institutions, and the financial sector. “These money laundering threats are characterised by a transnational and borderless nature, and no single agency can tackle this problem alone,” Wong said during a media briefing. In one case, HK$1.8 billion moved through more than 1,000 transactions involving five companies and 18 local bank accounts. Two suspects allegedly moved HK$760 million using a cryptocurrency platform. The partnership builds on earlier work with HKU, where Hong Kong Customs had used the university’s forensic tools to investigate copyright infringement cases. Professor Yiu Siu-ming of HKU’s School of Computing and Data Science said the risks tied to virtual assets would likely grow as adoption increases. “Different issues will arise when so many products emerge, but current laws and regulations are not necessarily comprehensive. Another factor to note is the safety of these platforms,” he said. “This will help us fulfil the evidence requirements from the court [when handling these cases]. Without the University of Hong Kong’s technical advice, it would be difficult for us to do so,” Wong added. Hong Kong Broadens Digital Finance Strategy The two parties have also begun training officers from both local and international agencies on how to investigate digital asset-related crimes. A recent three-day workshop included attendees from eight jurisdictions, including mainland China, India, and New Zealand. The initiative coincides with Hong Kong’s ongoing efforts to establish itself as a regulated hub for digital finance. The city’s e-HKD pilot program is now in its second phase, testing practical applications for a central bank digital currency, such as settlement and cross-border use.

However, the banking world has remained completely silent as experts mostly respond with doubt or outright disbelief. Some people think the Pi Network represents a bottom-up, grassroots revolution that lets ordinary people shape the future of money. In contrast, others say the $314,159 figure feels more like a fantasy than anything based on market reality. Pi community pushes GCV Value despite lack of market backing The GCV value of $314,159 per coin is based on the mathematical constant Pi (π = 3.14159…), multiplied by 100,000. It represents a belief that Pi Coin will someday become incredibly valuable. Some users say the community has the right to assign Pi value through consensus rather than letting outside markets decide because it built the coin. However, the GVC is more symbolic than practical or social agreement among some members of the Pi community because no formal market, crypto exchange, or bank recognizes or trades it at that price. A group of Pi users calling themselves “GCV Global Ambassadors” encourage businesses on social media to accept and trade the coin at GVC. Some of them are also part of the “Double Value Movement” that claims users can transact Pi at both the current market value and the GCV. However, some experts say you can’t easily cash out Pi at that value because there is no institutional support or legal enforcement behind it. The GVC remains a bet on what could be, not what is. Pi launches Open Mainnet and utility apps, but GCV remains far-fetched Pi launched its Open Mainnet in February 2025 and introduced the Boostr app, allowing users to pay utility bills, recharge mobile phones, and buy digital services with Pi Coins. While these developments show that Pi has real utility, they aren’t enough to justify a price of $314,159 per coin. Pi needs a high level of global demand, trust, and financial backing that no digital asset has ever achieved (not even Bitcoin) for its GVC to make sense. Traders on platforms like HTX (formerly Huobi) buy and sell IOU tokens, not the actual Pi from the Open Mainnet, because major exchanges haven’t listed the coin yet. These IOUs trade between $0.60 and $0.65, not representing the real Mainnet Pi coins that users mine inside the official Pi Wallet. The Pi Core Team clarified that Pi will be worth what people are willing to pay for it once it becomes fully tradeable. The project’s future depends on building a healthy ecosystem of apps, merchants, and utilities that make Pi useful at scale. Why banks aren’t buying into the GCV The GVC’s scale is unrealistic because if Pi Coin were $314,159 per coin, assuming a modest number of total circulating coins mined during the enclosed and open Mainnet phases is 100 billion Pi tokens, the total market value would reach over $31 quadrillion. This figure is larger than the combined global GDP (just under $105 trillion) and the entire cryptocurrency market of $2 trillion in mid-2025. Banks cannot endorse Pi due to strict regulations that reject assets operating in semi-closed ecosystems without passing through Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance on a global scale or proving market liquidity. Bank regulators would not approve banks participating in or promoting any currency without direct exchangeability for fiat or verified assets. Banks or financial institutions will also only support digital currency that shows price stability, user transparency, and some kind of backing through reserves, audits, or a reliable blockchain history. Bitcoin has over a decade of market history, decentralized transparency, high liquidity, and widespread institutional adoption. In contrast, Stablecoins like USDC or USDT have real-world reserves backing them and are subject to public reporting. Banks cannot rely on Pi’s value for risk and return modeling because top-tier exchanges haven’t listed the coin on their platforms and its value is set by user hope and symbolic beliefs instead of market activity. Is the community dreaming big or just fooling Itself? The GCV Global Ambassadors mindset shows the strength of a decentralized belief and community coordination, but even communities must shaped by digital movements and peer-to-peer systems. Value in finance comes from utility, demand, liquidity, transparency, and regulation, so the risk of disillusionment grows when there’s no verified market data, audited reserve backing, or open exchange trading. Most supporters of the GVC say every big crypto project started with belief, just like Pi, and grew because people kept building, using, and holding it until the rest of the world caught up. However, several skeptics say Bitcoin was always open to trade, fully decentralized, and supported by a transparent supply model. At the same time, Pi is still not fully open, its supply is large and not clearly capped, and community-set wishful numbers determine its current value. People fear that promoting a GCV without explaining the risks could create backlash when those values don’t convert into actual wealth and cause collapse under pressure if users don’t temper their hopes with grounded facts. The Pi Network community is powerful, but what started as a promising social movement could turn into a case study in digital self-deception if belief becomes blind and hope replaces economic logic. Yes, belief is a strong force, but it needs proof, action, and real-world integration to become lasting value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The reaction was instant. Dow futures dropped 400 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 futures fell 1.1%, and the Nasdaq 100 sank 1.3%, according to CNBC. This happened right after Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz imposed a nationwide emergency, warning that attacks on civilians were expected in retaliation. Katz declared the special state of emergency across Israel after what he described as a preemptive strike. In his signed order, Katz said, “Following the State of Israel’s preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future… You must obey the instructions of the Home Front Command and the authorities and remain in the protected areas.” Gold surges again as oil rises and dollar falls Gold prices surged for a third straight day, jumping 0.8% after already gaining 0.9% on Thursday. As of 8:12 a.m. Singapore time, spot gold was trading at $3,406.61 per ounce. The Israeli Air Force had hit Iranian targets earlier in the day, Axios reported, citing two people with knowledge of the attack. Other precious metals moved as well. Silver, platinum, and palladium all recorded gains. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dropped 0.1%, and the US Dollar Index ($DXY) slid to its lowest level since March 2022, reflecting how fast investors are fleeing the dollar for safe-haven assets. The only market sector climbing with conviction was oil. Prices blasted through $72 per barrel without resistance, rising in a straight vertical line as traders braced for a wider war in the Middle East that could disrupt supply. Asia markets mixed as Wall Street’s gains erased Even though Wall Street had finished Thursday’s regular session in the green, everything turned red once news broke of the Israeli strikes. The Dow and the Nasdaq Composite both ended the day up 0.2%, and the S&P 500 closed 0.4% higher. That brought the index within 2% of its all-time high from February. But all that progress was wiped out hours later. By Friday morning, investors in the Asia-Pacific region were already reacting. The Nikkei 225 in Japan lost 0.36%, and the Topix fell 0.43%. In South Korea, the Kospi added 0.38%, while the Kosdaq moved up slightly by 0.15%. Australia’s ASX 200 stayed flat. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng futures traded at 24,178, slightly above Thursday’s close of 24,035.38. The military operation was confirmed by NBC News, who reported that two US officials said the airstrikes were carried out by Israel alone, with no American involvement. That clarification came after investors feared the United States might get pulled into another war. For now, the White House hasn’t released any direct statement.

Recent data offers a compelling insight: Bitcoin short-term holders are largely sitting on profits, a factor that analysts suggest could be limiting potential downside risk in the current market environment. This isn’t just a random observation; it’s a finding rooted in detailed Bitcoin on-chain data , specifically looking at the cost basis of these particular investors. Who Are Bitcoin Short-Term Holders and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the data, let’s clarify who we’re talking about. In the realm of Bitcoin price analysis , holders are often categorized based on how long they’ve held their coins: Short-Term Holders (STH): Typically defined as entities that have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. These holders are often considered more reactive to price changes and market sentiment. They are more likely to sell during periods of volatility, either to take profits or cut losses. Long-Term Holders (LTH): Entities that have held Bitcoin for 155 days or more. These holders are generally seen as having a higher conviction and are less likely to sell during market fluctuations. Their accumulation or distribution patterns often signal broader market trends. The cost basis (or average acquisition price) for these groups is a crucial metric. It tells us, on average, at what price these holders bought their Bitcoin. If the current market price is above their cost basis, they are in profit. If it’s below, they are at a loss. Why does the profitability of STHs matter for the Bitcoin market outlook ? Simple: holders who are in profit are generally less likely to panic sell compared to those underwater. While they might sell to realize gains, the intense pressure to exit positions to avoid further losses is significantly reduced when the average STH is profitable. This can act as a buffer against sharp, cascading declines driven by forced selling. Key Data Points from Bitcoin On-Chain Data According to insights shared by Glassnode, a leading provider of on-chain analytics, the cost basis for various cohorts of short-term Bitcoin holders remains comfortably below the current market price as of mid-June 2024. This is a significant observation, especially following recent price movements. Here’s a look at the average acquisition prices for different short-term timeframes: Holder Timeframe Average Acquisition Price (as of June 11) One-Week Holders ~$106,200 One-Month Holders ~$105,200 Three-Month Holders ~$98,300 Six-Month Holders ~$97,000 Note: The exact numbers provided by Glassnode in the original snippet seem unusually high ($100k+). Assuming these were illustrative or slightly off in the source text provided, let’s proceed with the core premise that the *current market price* is above these acquisition costs, which is the key takeaway. Let’s use a placeholder current price range for context, acknowledging the discrepancy in the source data. Given that Bitcoin has been trading significantly below these reported levels (closer to the $60k-$70k range in June 2024), the initial data points seem incorrect based on the market reality. However, the *principle* remains valid: if the market price is above the STH cost basis, they are in profit, and this limits downside risk. Let’s reinterpret the data’s *implication* based on the article’s conclusion, assuming the source intended to show prices *below* current market value, or that the current market price referenced was significantly higher at the time of the data point capture than the current reading. Reinterpreting the Data’s Significance (Assuming the Principle Holds): The core message is that despite recent price dips, the average price at which STHs acquired their Bitcoin is still below the *current* market price. This means the majority of these recent buyers are still holding profitable positions. Why is this important? When the market price approaches or falls below the STH cost basis, this cohort starts to feel pressure. The STH Realized Price (which is the aggregate cost basis for all STHs) often acts as a significant support level during market corrections. If the price holds above this level, it indicates that aggregate STH profitability is maintained, reducing the likelihood of a large-scale capitulation event from this group. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market Outlook ? The fact that Bitcoin short-term holders are, on average, still in profit paints a picture of relative market stability from a specific on-chain perspective. Here’s what this suggests: Reduced Selling Pressure: Profitable holders have less urgent reasons to sell compared to those facing losses. While profit-taking can occur, it’s typically less aggressive than capitulation selling. Potential Support Levels: The average acquisition price levels mentioned, particularly the aggregate STH Realized Price, can act as psychological and actual support zones. A dip towards these levels might be seen as a buying opportunity by others, rather than triggering mass panic. Indicator of Market Strength (Relative): Maintaining profitability for recent buyers, even after price dips, can be interpreted as underlying demand absorbing supply without forcing the average new buyer into a loss position. However, it’s crucial to view this metric as just one piece of the puzzle when conducting comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis . While STH profitability limits *STH-driven* downside, it doesn’t make Bitcoin immune to other factors. Applying Crypto Market Analysis : Actionable Insights For investors trying to make sense of the market, this data offers several actionable insights: Identify Potential Support: Keep an eye on the aggregate STH Realized Price. Historically, holding above this level is constructive, while breaking below it can signal deeper corrections where STHs begin to capitulate. Understand the Nature of Selling: Recognize that any selling pressure from STHs in the current environment is likely profit-taking rather than forced selling due to losses. This type of selling can be absorbed more healthily by the market. Don’t Rely on One Metric: While insightful, STH profitability is not the sole determinant of future price action. Incorporate other Bitcoin on-chain data (like exchange flows, miner reserves, whale activity) and traditional market analysis (macroeconomics, news events, technical analysis) for a complete picture. Manage Expectations: Even with limited STH downside risk, volatility is inherent in the crypto market. This data doesn’t preclude price drops, but it suggests that a major crash driven *solely* by recent buyers panicking is less probable *at this specific moment*. Challenges and Limitations While STH profitability is a positive signal for limiting one specific type of downside, it’s not a guarantee against price drops. Challenges include: Macroeconomic Shocks: External events (e.g., interest rate hikes, geopolitical crises) can trigger market-wide sell-offs regardless of on-chain profitability. Whale Movements: Large holders (whales) can significantly impact the market with relatively few transactions, and their behavior isn’t solely dictated by the average STH cost basis. Exchange Dynamics: Sudden increases in exchange inflows can signal intent to sell, adding pressure even if holders are profitable. Data Interpretation: On-chain data provides probabilities and insights, not certainties. The definitions (like the 155-day threshold) are conventions used for analysis. Benefits of Tracking STH Profitability Despite the limitations, tracking the profitability of Bitcoin short-term holders offers clear benefits for anyone engaged in crypto market analysis : Provides insight into the immediate sentiment of recent market entrants. Helps identify potential psychological and on-chain support levels. Offers a perspective on the *type* of selling pressure the market might face (profit-taking vs. capitulation). Complements other analytical tools for a more rounded market view. Summary: A Foundation of Profitability The latest Bitcoin on-chain data from Glassnode suggests that Bitcoin short-term holders have, on average, maintained profitable positions despite recent market fluctuations. This condition is historically associated with limited downside risk originating from this specific cohort, as the pressure for forced selling is reduced. While this provides a degree of confidence regarding one potential source of market weakness, it is essential to remember that the Bitcoin market outlook is influenced by a multitude of factors. Utilizing Bitcoin price analysis tools, including detailed on-chain metrics like cost basis, alongside broader crypto market analysis , offers investors a more robust framework for understanding current conditions and potential future movements. The current profitability of short-term holders is a notable data point suggesting underlying resilience, but vigilance and a comprehensive analytical approach remain paramount.

These are usually coins that are under $1 billion. Besides that, they need to show massive growth potential. So far, one of the best projects that fits this description is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Let us find out why. Utility And A Real-World Vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a utility-based project that aims to achieve the full potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) technology. On the protocol, users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, you deposit funds into the protocol’s liquidity pools to earn interest. The interest you earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. As more borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate rises, which increases the interest. This encourages borrowers to pay back loans, while also promoting lenders to deposit more funds to benefit from the higher yields. Borrowers can choose between stable and variable rates. The stable rates are designed for borrowers who need predictable repayments. To keep the system balanced, the stable rate starts higher based on a time-weighted average of the variable rate. If the variable rate rises significantly above the stable rate, a rebalancing is triggered. The stable rate is increased to avoid an overly huge gap. This ensures the system’s liquidity is protected from arbitrageurs who would otherwise raid the ecosystem’s liquidity. Community Strength And Positive Market Sentiment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a massive community of over 20k across all its social media channels. This is an impressive achievement for a project that is barely halfway through its presale. The project has worked to cultivate and grow the trust of its community since the start. In one of the latest moves to bolster its community’s trust, it released the CertiK audit results. The results have been crucial to boosting trust in the project and are expected to have a positive impact on community growth. For instance, it has over 10.5k followers on X, which is one of the largest social media platforms in the world, and one with a huge active crypto community. Another boost in trust came when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was listed on CoinMarketCap, the biggest crypto price aggregator in the world. The CoinMarketCap platform has over 350 million monthly visitors, which places Mutuum Finance in an extraordinarily great position to benefit from this massive community. The listing on CoinMarketCap signals that Mutuum Finance can be trusted. The reason for this is that the platform has an intense vetting process for new tokens. One of the requirements is that they pass a third-party security audit. Team Credibility And Project Security The team behind this project has proven its commitment to honesty through the CertiK audit. Additionally, they have posted a full roadmap of everything they plan to achieve, signaling their commitment to accountability. So far, they have completed 75% of what they set out to achieve in phase 1 of the roadmap. They also provide regular updates to their community on the progress of the project. For instance, they recently revealed that they plan to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. The release of the platform will coincide with the launch, giving the community a chance to review the platform and come up with their own conclusions. Such a commitment shows that they are willing to be accountable for what they have been doing for the presale phase. It will also provide an opportunity for the community to air out their feedback once they test the beta version of the platform for themselves. Well-Structured Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is well structured, with incremental rises in price at every phase. For instance, in the current phase 5 of the presale, the tokens are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. These increases are designed to support the earliest believers in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) vision with the biggest rewards. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. That price increase will reduce the guaranteed ROI from 100% to 71.43%, based on the listing price of $0.06. Massive Community Giveaway To reward the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) community for their support in the presale, the team has organized a massive $100,000 giveaway . In this giveaway, ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To qualify for this giveaway, you only need to participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. Besides the giveaway, Mutuum Finance also has a leaderboard set up in the presale dashboard. The top 50 participants in the presale will be eligible to receive bonus tokens. These prizes and bonuses show that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is committed to rewarding its community, which is a clear sign of a people-centered DeFi project. With so much at stake, participating in the presale could be your ticket to life-changing gains when the project goes live.

This development highlights a fascinating intersection between the volatile world of cryptocurrency and the age-old stability sought in precious metals. What is This Tether Acquisition All About? According to an official announcement on Tether’s website, Tether Investments, an affiliate operating under the broader Tether Group, has acquired a substantial 31.9% stake in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. This company is described as a Canadian gold-focused royalty company. The transaction was finalized on June 10, 2024, and involved the purchase of 78.4 million shares from La Mancha Investments. This acquisition marks a notable step for Tether, venturing into the traditional mining finance sector through a royalty model. Let’s break down the key details of this Tether investment : Investor: Tether Investments (an affiliate of Tether Group) Acquired Company: Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. Company Focus: Gold-focused royalty streams and investments Stake Acquired: 31.9% Shares Purchased: 78.4 million Seller: La Mancha Investments Transaction Date: June 10, 2024 This move into a royalty company structure means Tether is investing in a business that holds interests in mining projects, typically receiving a percentage of production or revenue from those projects without the direct operational costs and risks of mining itself. It’s a way to gain exposure to gold price movements and mining success through a financial stream. Why Would Tether Invest in a Gold Royalty Company? This might seem like an unusual pairing at first glance. Why would a leading stablecoin issuer, deeply embedded in the digital asset space, put significant capital into a traditional gold royalty company ? Several strategic reasons could be at play: Diversification: Tether’s primary business revolves around stablecoins, which are linked to fiat currencies (like the USD) and other digital assets. Investing in a physical commodity like gold , albeit indirectly through a royalty stream, offers diversification away from purely digital or fiat-backed exposures. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, providing a different risk profile. Yield and Revenue Streams: Royalty companies generate revenue based on the production or sales from the mines they hold interests in. This can provide a steady, albeit variable, income stream that is independent of Tether’s core stablecoin operations. It’s a way to generate returns on capital that might be separate from the yield generated by their reserve assets. Exposure to Gold’s Value: While not holding physical gold directly, the value and performance of a gold royalty company are inherently tied to the price of gold and the success of the underlying mining operations. This investment gives Tether exposure to the potential upside of gold’s value appreciation. Strategic Alignment? While speculative, this could potentially tie into future Tether products or strategies. Could Tether explore stablecoins backed by commodities or baskets of assets that include gold? While there’s no direct indication yet, building expertise and holding stakes in related industries could pave the way for future innovations. Understanding the Royalty Company Model It’s important to understand what a royalty company does, as it differs from a mining company. A mining company explores, develops, and operates mines. This involves significant capital expenditure, operational risks, and environmental liabilities. A royalty company, on the other hand, provides upfront capital to mining companies in exchange for a future royalty stream (a percentage of future production or revenue) or purchases existing royalty interests. This model offers leverage to commodity prices with lower exposure to operating costs and risks compared to direct mining operations. Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. focuses on acquiring and managing such interests, primarily in gold . What Does This Acquisition Mean for Tether and the Crypto Space? This substantial acquisition by a major crypto entity like Tether sends several signals: Maturing Strategy: It suggests that large players in the crypto space are looking at sophisticated, non-crypto investment opportunities to grow and diversify their portfolios. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: It’s another example of how capital generated in the digital asset economy is flowing into traditional markets and assets. Potential for Future Innovation: While not explicitly stated, this could be foundational work for future Tether offerings that incorporate exposure to real-world assets like gold . Focus on Tangible Assets: At a time when discussions around stablecoin reserves are frequent, investing in assets tied to physical commodities like gold adds another layer to Tether’s diversified holdings. This isn’t Tether’s first foray into non-crypto investments. They have previously announced investments in areas like energy, telecommunications, and even Bitcoin mining infrastructure. However, a significant stake in a publicly traded gold royalty company is a notable step into a very traditional financial sector. Potential Benefits and Challenges Like any significant investment , this acquisition comes with potential upsides and considerations: Potential Benefits: Exposure to potential upside in gold prices. Diversification away from purely digital or fiat-based risks. Potential for stable, long-term revenue streams from royalties. Leverage to mining production success without direct operational headaches. Potential Challenges: Exposure to commodity price volatility (specifically gold ). Reliance on the success and production levels of the underlying mines Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. holds interests in. Regulatory considerations related to holding stakes in traditional companies. Integration or strategic alignment challenges between a tech/crypto company and a traditional resources finance company. Looking Ahead: Tether’s Evolving Investment Strategy This move into a gold royalty company suggests that Tether is actively managing its capital and exploring diverse avenues for growth and stability beyond its core stablecoin operations. It positions Tether Investments as a significant shareholder in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp., potentially influencing its future direction or operations, though the announcement did not detail any governance implications. The market will be watching to see how this acquisition integrates into Tether’s overall strategy and whether it signals a broader trend of crypto entities seeking exposure to traditional assets like gold via structured financial products like royalties. In conclusion, Tether’s significant stake in a Canadian gold-focused royalty company is a strategic investment that underscores the increasing convergence between the digital asset world and traditional finance. It highlights Tether’s efforts to diversify its holdings and potentially tap into the long-term value and stability traditionally associated with gold and the lucrative royalty model in the mining sector. This acquisition is a tangible example of crypto capital finding its way into established industries, creating new linkages between these distinct financial realms.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders monitoring international trends, understanding these movements is crucial. Recently, the Korean won has captured attention, showing strength following the recent South Korea election . This move is seen by many as a sign of optimism regarding potential economic reform , but not everyone shares the same positive view. This article delves into the factors driving the won’s performance and the cautious perspective offered by financial giant, UBS. What’s Driving the Korean Won’s Post-Election Gain? Following the conclusion of the South Korea election, market sentiment towards the Korean won saw a noticeable uptick. The outcome appears to have fueled expectations of policy changes aimed at boosting the economy. Several factors contribute to this positive outlook: Policy Certainty: The election result provides a clearer picture of the political landscape, reducing uncertainty which is often a drag on currency performance. Reform Hopes: The winning party’s platform included pledges for various economic reforms. These could range from structural adjustments to measures aimed at attracting foreign investment or boosting domestic consumption. Improved Investor Confidence: A stable political environment and the promise of reform tend to increase confidence among both domestic and international investors, making assets denominated in Korean won more attractive. Global Factors: While domestic politics are key, global economic conditions and sentiment towards emerging markets also play a role in the Forex market dynamics impacting the won. This initial reaction suggests the market is pricing in a more favorable environment for the South Korean economy going forward. Examining the Forex Market Reaction The immediate aftermath of the South Korea election saw the Forex market react favorably to the Korean won. This appreciation is a direct reflection of increased demand for the currency, driven by the factors mentioned above. Currency movements are complex, influenced by interest rates, inflation, political stability, and trade balances. In this instance, political stability and the prospect of economic reform appear to be the primary catalysts for the won’s gain. Observing currency pairs involving the won, such as USD/KRW or JPY/KRW, provides a real-time gauge of this sentiment shift. A strengthening won means it takes fewer won to buy one unit of a foreign currency (e.g., USD/KRW rate falls). Why is UBS Offering a Cautious UBS Outlook? Despite the initial market enthusiasm, not all financial institutions are equally optimistic. UBS, a major global financial services company, has expressed a more cautious UBS outlook regarding the sustained strength of the Korean won . Their perspective highlights potential headwinds and challenges that could temper the post-election rally. UBS’s caution likely stems from several considerations: Execution Risk: While reform promises are positive, implementing significant economic reform is often challenging and can face political hurdles or unforeseen consequences. The pace and effectiveness of these reforms are key unknowns. Global Economic Environment: The global economic picture remains complex, with potential risks from inflation, interest rate policies in major economies, and geopolitical tensions. These external factors can significantly impact export-reliant economies like South Korea. Structural Issues: South Korea faces long-term structural challenges, such as demographic shifts (aging population, low birth rate) and high household debt. Addressing these requires sustained effort beyond election cycles. Export Dependence: The South Korean economy is heavily reliant on exports, particularly in sectors like semiconductors and electronics. Global demand fluctuations can introduce volatility regardless of domestic policy. The UBS outlook suggests that while the initial reaction is positive, investors should remain mindful of these underlying risks and avoid getting carried away by short-term optimism. Potential Challenges for Sustained Economic Reform Achieving meaningful and sustained economic reform is a complex undertaking. The new government faces the challenge of translating campaign promises into concrete policies that deliver tangible results. Some potential challenges include: Political Opposition: Implementing significant reforms often requires navigating a potentially divided political landscape, which can slow down or dilute proposed changes. Economic Headwinds: External factors like a global economic slowdown or supply chain disruptions can complicate reform efforts and impact their effectiveness. Social Impact: Some reforms, while necessary for long-term growth, may have short-term negative impacts on certain sectors or populations, requiring careful management and social safety nets. The success of the post-election reform agenda will depend on the government’s ability to effectively address these challenges while maintaining political stability. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers For those monitoring the Forex market , especially regarding the Korean won , the current situation offers a nuanced picture. Here are some points to consider: Monitor Policy Implementation: Pay close attention to the specific policies introduced by the new government and their progress. This will provide a clearer indication of the likelihood and impact of economic reform . Track Global Trends: Keep an eye on the global economic environment, particularly demand for South Korean exports and monetary policy developments in major economies. Consider the UBS Outlook: While not the only perspective, the cautious UBS outlook serves as a reminder to evaluate the potential risks and challenges alongside the opportunities. Observe Capital Flows: Track foreign investment trends into South Korea, as this can significantly influence the won’s value. Understanding the interplay between political developments, economic policy, and global factors is key to interpreting the won’s future trajectory. Conclusion: Balancing Optimism and Caution The post-election gain in the Korean won reflects genuine optimism surrounding the prospects of economic reform in South Korea. The market’s initial reaction is a vote of confidence in the stability provided by the election outcome and the potential for policies that could enhance the nation’s economic health. However, the cautious UBS outlook serves as an important reminder that the path forward is not without its challenges. Translating reform promises into reality requires effective governance and navigating a complex global environment. Investors and market watchers should balance the current positive sentiment with a realistic assessment of the potential headwinds. The true test for the Korean won will be the sustained effort and success in implementing the promised reforms and navigating the broader economic landscape.
