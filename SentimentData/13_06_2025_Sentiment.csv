Speaking at Ripple Apex, he claims the once-gimmick has become more than a meme coin , distancing itself from what he generalized as “get-rich-quick rug pulls” to become “part of the ecosystem. It plays a role.” Citing Elon Musk’s continued endorsement, Garlinghouse said Musk “willed Dogecoin into so much liquidity that it’s not going away.” “I used to speak not so kindly about Dogecoin… was created as a joke, right?” ~ #Ripple CEO @bgarlinghouse pic.twitter.com/pEB91t3KiP — The Crypto Times (@CryptoTimes_io) June 12, 2025 While he did not entertain a partnership, the concession marks a notable shift for a figure long-positioned on the institutional end of the spectrum—opening the door for institutional acceptance. With rising speculation around Dogecoin ETF approval, Garlinghouse’s comments may be seen as early validation, giving it more credit in the “best crypto to buy” conversation. Dogecoin Price Analysis: Could Institutions Boost DOGE? Even without a Ripple collaboration, Dogecoin may be on the breakout path, following a massive 4-year cup-and-handle pattern. DOGE / USDT 1-week chart, cup-and-handle pattern confluence zone. Source: TradingView, Binance. DOGE is currently consolidating within the descending channel forming the handle, but a fast approaching confluence zone could see a breakout unfold in the coming weeks. Key support from the 0.236 Fib level and the historic support trendline that has underpinned every major DOGE bottom since September is set to intersect with the channel’s resistance. The historic support that has marked DOGE bottoms since September could push a breakout as it intersects with the channel’s upper resistance, aligned with support from the 0.236 Fibbonnaci level. A confirmed breakout would set a technical target around $0.75—a staggering 300% gain from current levels in line with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. The upcoming June 15 deadline for a US spot Dogecoin ETF decision could bring the catalyst Dogecoin needs, opening the doors to institutional inflows if approved. #Dogecoin awaits eagerly for SEC ETF rulings in June. Approval odds near 80%. pic.twitter.com/nD3d0bvkmF — dogegod (@_dogegod_) June 12, 2025 Momentum indicators also point to retail inflows. The RSI has stabilized at 45 after dipping below the neutral zone, and the MACD is tightening, hinting at a potential crossover that could shift sentiment. While the setup isn’t screaming bullish yet, it’s also far from bearish. This fragile balance suggests that any uptick in volume or sentiment could tip the scales. If historic support becomes an accumulation base, DOGE could finally break the handle structure and resume its long-term uptrend. Bitcoin Could Have the Edge, With Some Help Those who jumped to speculative plays like Dogecoin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.1 million in its second presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 648% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

Knot’s assessment, delivered during his final address as FSB Chair at a Financial Stability Conference in Madrid, showed how barriers for retail crypto access have “dropped significantly,” particularly through the introduction of crypto ETFs and stablecoin issuers’ substantial Treasury holdings. His warning comes as the crypto ecosystem’s links with traditional finance continue expanding. Stablecoins settled $27.6 trillion in transactions during Q1 2025 alone , doubling Visa’s entire 2023 settlement volume. Stablecoin Transactions Vs Visa Payments Q1 Source: Bitwise The FSB Chair emphasized that while crypto doesn’t yet pose systemic risk, recent developments suggest authorities must monitor this “fast-growing market” more closely as it approaches mainstream financial integration. Institutional Infrastructure Races to Meet Demand The institutional embrace of crypto infrastructure has accelerated dramatically, with major financial players already positioning themselves for widespread adoption. A June 2 report by Cryptonews shows that UK-listed IG Group has become the first London Stock Exchange company to offer retail crypto trading . Retail clients can buy and sell 38 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, through a partnership with digital asset platform Uphold. IG Group will become the first company on the London Stock Exchange to allow retail investors to trade cryptos, including BTC, ETH, and XRP. #Bitcoin #XRP https://t.co/MImNzg9rAX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 2, 2025 Managing Director Michael Healy described customer demand as “ reaching a tipping point ,” positioning the FTSE 250 firm as a trusted alternative to existing crypto services. Most recently, Stripe’s aggressive crypto expansion further exemplifies this institutional momentum, with the payments giant acquiring crypto wallet infrastructure startup Privy following its $1.1 billion purchase of stablecoin platform Bridge. Privy powers over 75 million accounts across more than 1,000 teams while facilitating billions in transaction volume. It allows companies to integrate crypto wallets directly into their platforms without traditional friction. @stripe acquires crypto wallet infrastructure startup @privy_io in undisclosed deal, marking its second major crypto acquisition following the $1.1 billion Bridge purchase as stablecoins settle record $27.6 trillion in Q1 2025. https://t.co/TeTdIVgt0V — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 This acquisition allows Stripe to offer comprehensive crypto infrastructure spanning wallet creation, stablecoin payments, and fiat integration through a unified platform. This addresses growing business needs, as over 81% of crypto-aware small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) express interest in stablecoin adoption . Government-Led Digital Asset Integration Gains Momentum Government initiatives are also accelerating crypto mainstream adoption through direct blockchain-based investment products. In May, Thailand’s Ministry of Finance announced it would launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens within two months. Thailand is set to launch $150 million worth of digital investment tokens, marking a step toward financial inclusivity for retail investors. #Thailand #SEC https://t.co/2akullmpsP — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 These tokens would allow retail investors to purchase government bonds via blockchain-based “G-tokens” with a minimum investment threshold of just $3. Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira emphasized the initiative’s goal of broadening access to government-backed investments, particularly as commercial banks offer only 1.25% on 12-month fixed deposits. Similarly, China’s Zhejiang Province has integrated digital yuan pilots into its “first-launch economy” strategy, testing the central bank digital currency in retail debut scenarios through the “Digital Yuan + First-Launch” initiative. This represents a strategic shift from public services to consumer transactions, incorporating the currency within broader economic programs rather than treating it as a standalone technology. The approach addresses public hesitation by linking digital payments to familiar retail experiences like store launches and branded spaces. The UK government is simultaneously tightening oversight while expanding access. Starting in January 2026, crypto firms will be required to collect detailed customer information on every trade. The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting 2026. #UK #Crypto https://t.co/tHJKf7rEE5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 18, 2025 The new HMRC rules mandate that platforms record full names, addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction, including cryptocurrency type and amount transferred, is also logged. Non-compliance penalties can reach up to £300 per user. These developments suggest the crypto industry has indeed reached the tipping point Knot identified, with traditional financial barriers increasingly dissolving as digital assets integrate into mainstream economic systems.

That’s the mood across the altcoin landscape in June 2025. While Aptos (APT) surged 4% following a high-volume breakout, Cosmos (ATOM) is facing mounting skepticism over its long-touted role in blockchain interoperability. A recent analysis raised eyebrows about whether Cosmos’ interchain vision can actually deliver the seamless multi-chain world it claims to power. In contrast, a rising project, Qubetics ($TICS), is now drawing serious attention not because of grand narratives, but because of grounded application, precision engineering, and one of the most actively participated crypto presales of the year. Qubetics is building tools for the real-world financial system that legacy chains failed to support. Through its tokenized marketplace for real-world assets (RWA), this Web3 aggregator is stepping into a sector that’s gaining both institutional interest and retail curiosity. Unlike Cosmos, which is now being challenged to prove scalability beyond concept, Qubetics is showcasing scalable utility already in motion. At this critical market pivot, it’s positioning itself not only as a strong contender—but arguably the next bull run crypto leader with actual use cases and measurable ROI potential. Qubetics’ Real-World Asset Marketplace Could Power the Next Bull Run Crypto Cycle In a market where speculation still drives headlines, Qubetics’ tokenized marketplace offers something tangible. It’s the core application behind its Web3 aggregator model, designed to digitize and fractionalize real-world assets—everything from real estate to fine art and small business revenue contracts. The appeal? It connects traditional assets to a blockchain-native world while solving issues of liquidity, transparency, and cross-chain settlement. Think of a small business in Chicago wanting to raise capital without giving up equity. With Qubetics, it can tokenize future receivables or product revenues and offer them to a global pool of supporters—all settled across interoperable chains and tracked immutably. Or consider a Dubai-based property developer seeking fractional investment without regulatory friction. Qubetics turns its real estate assets into tokens accessible to compliant participants from Europe to Southeast Asia—each transaction secured by smart contracts with built-in revenue-sharing models. And it doesn’t stop with institutions. Individual community members looking to diversify their crypto portfolios with real-world exposure can do so seamlessly. This level of on-chain integration, backed by a secure RWA marketplace, makes Qubetics not just a tech novelty but a full-fledged bridge between DeFi and TradFi. As the infrastructure matures, so too does Qubetics’ role in driving the next bull run crypto cycle forward—not through hype, but through adoption. Qubetics Presale: Structuring ROI Around the Next Bull Run Crypto Surge Currently in Stage 37, the Qubetics presale is entering a zone of rapid momentum. With a token price of $0.3370, the project has raised over $17.9 million, distributing 515 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,900 wallets. Only 10 million tokens remain at this price before the next pricing tier begins—and ultimately, before the presale closes altogether. At that point, $TICS becomes a market-listed asset, exposed to volatility, competition, and demand mechanics beyond current presale economics. Now take a real-world example: A $7,000 buy-in at today’s rate delivers 20,772 tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that’s a 197% return. At $5, it becomes $103,860. And if $TICS reaches $10 or $15, the same stake transforms into $207,720 or $311,580 respectively. Even modest entry points matter. A $100 purchase, for instance, secures 296 tokens, which at $10 delivers nearly $3,000 in value. This dynamic—paired with a total supply reduced from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and 38.55% allocated to the public—cements Qubetics’ credibility as one of the best crypto pre sale opportunities in the current cycle. With only one more presale tier likely before its mainnet launch in Q2 2025, $TICS now presents an entry window that’s quickly narrowing. The structure, transparency, and timing of the Qubetics presale set it apart as a clear contender among the next bull run crypto selections—especially for those who value clarity over chaos. Cosmos Faces Increasing Criticism Over Interoperability and Scaling Promises Cosmos has long touted its “Internet of Blockchains” vision, aiming to unify decentralized ecosystems through modular chains and the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. But a recent analysis from Blockchain Magazine questions whether Cosmos can scale that vision in 2025, calling out its architectural limitations and lack of enterprise traction. Key concerns include Cosmos’ reliance on hub-and-zone architecture, which critics argue introduces latency and doesn’t support high-frequency microtransactions efficiently. More so, the interchain model, while conceptually clean, has yet to demonstrate seamless multi-chain operations at scale in real-world commercial settings. The report questions whether Cosmos has become more of a developer’s sandbox than a go-to infrastructure for cross-chain consumer applications. Yet despite these critiques, Cosmos still holds relevance—especially for smaller networks seeking independence with modular governance. However, as the next cycle favors real-world integrations, protocols like Qubetics—which already offer on-chain asset management and Web3 infrastructure convergence—may increasingly pull attention and capital. While Cosmos deserves credit for pioneering blockchain interoperability discussions, its current scrutiny puts its placement in the next bull run crypto class at risk unless significant architectural upgrades are made. Aptos Sees 4% Jump as Technical Breakout Signals Bullish Continuation In contrast to Cosmos’ technical headwinds, Aptos (APT) is showing signs of renewed strength. As reported by CoinDesk on June 10, APT rallied by 4% following a technical breakout that occurred on high trading volume. Analysts attribute this movement to a strong reversal pattern that saw the asset reclaim support zones previously seen in Q1, bolstered by increasing participation from spot buyers. The uptick was also notable for its context. While many Layer 1s are experiencing stagnation, Aptos is finding fresh footing among traders seeking responsive price movements. The chart setup now points to a potential short-term push beyond resistance levels, which could trigger follow-through buying and improved sentiment around the project. Whether this turns into long-term momentum remains to be seen. However, in the context of short-term trading, Aptos’ performance places it among the more agile contenders. With technical strength returning and broader Layer 1 rotation continuing, Aptos is earning a spot among the next bull run crypto assets to watch—particularly for market participants focused on volatility-driven growth. Conclusion: Three Chains, Three Paths to the Next Bull Run Crypto Class The altcoin space in mid-2025 is a study in contrasts. Cosmos, once the interoperability poster child, now faces hard questions about scale and commercial viability. Aptos, on the other hand, is showing signs of technical life, surging on high volume and bullish patterns. And then there’s Qubetics—emerging not from hype, but from a structured presale, a fully integrated real-world asset platform, and a clear mainnet roadmap that signals readiness, not just potential. For those navigating the complexity of the current market and searching for the next bull run crypto, this trio presents distinct propositions. But among them, Qubetics stands out—not just for its upside, but for its tangible utility, economic design, and strategic timing. As more early adopters gravitate toward transparency, usability, and secure token mechanics, Qubetics has already made its case to be the best crypto presale of the year—and possibly the defining Layer 1 of the next growth phase. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics/ Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics/ FAQs What is the next bull run crypto to watch in 2025? Qubetics, Aptos, and Cosmos are key altcoins, but Qubetics is gaining traction due to its RWA marketplace and presale performance. Why is Qubetics considered a strong next bull run crypto pick? It combines Web3 aggregation with a tokenized asset platform and a tightly structured presale nearing completion. Is Aptos showing signs of a bullish reversal? Yes, Aptos rallied 4% following a high-volume breakout, suggesting renewed short-term bullish momentum.

Nocut News reported that the Daegu District Court Criminal Division upheld all but one of the original verdicts and sentences. A 43-year-old ringleader is facing up to three years in prison. Kimchi Premium: Appeal Unsuccessful The judge did, however, overturn another of the traders’ verdicts. In the original trial, this individual (name withheld for legal reasons) was given an 18-month suspended jail term. However, the Presiding Judge Oh Deok-sik ruled on June 12 that this sentence was “overly lenient,” instead sending this trader to prison for 18 months. The traders were all found guilty of violations of the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information and the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act. The court heard evidence that the group illegally smuggled hundreds of billions of won worth of foreign currency into the country by reselling cryptoassets they had purchased in Japan. Prosecutors explained that the group worked in conjunction with a group of Japanese investors. Together, they concocted a carefully planned bid to exploit the kimchi premium . At the time, Bitcoin (BTC) prices were significantly higher in South Korea. Demand was growing as trading volumes on domestic crypto exchanges spiked. Prosecutors said the group illegally smuggled about 400 billion won ($296 million) worth of foreign currency across international borders. The overseas investors paid the group approximately 27 billion won (almost $20 million) for its services. The kimchi premium as calculated by Scolkg/Cryprice at the time of writing. (Source: Scolkg/Cryprice) Traders Deny Wrongdoing The defendants denied all the charges. They claimed the transactions could not be classified as “capital transactions,” as they involved crypto, not cash. As such, these deals were not subject to standard declaration laws. However, the appellate court rejected these claims. The judge ruled that the defendants “took advantage of the price differences between countries for virtual assets to export foreign currency and obtain commission fees.” The judge added that the original sentence “appears to be appropriate.” Justice Oh added that the court had seen “no other evidence that would require a change in sentence.” Education Ministry accused of shielding group tied to after-school certification scandal https://t.co/Z2fVGqwR8X — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) June 11, 2025 However, in the case of the trader who was jailed instead of receiving a suspended term, the court explained that while this individual only received just over $4,000 in “commission fees,” the nature of this individual’s crime was grave. The court heard that this trader held an important role in the business community and used shell companies to perpetrate the crime.

However, trading volume over the past 24 hours tells a different story. Spot market volume for $GRASS has surged by over 55% in the last 24 hours, with CoinGlass data revealing that derivative market volume has also jumped by over 95% during the same period.

Examining funding rates in the derivative market, as of June 12, rates have shifted from negative to positive, typically indicating bullish market sentiment. A positive funding rate in derivatives markets means long position holders pay short position holders. This occurs when the derivative contract price exceeds the underlying asset’s spot price. All these factors point to strategic whale activity, especially if volume returns to the market. With $GRASS still down over 55% from its all-time high of $3.90, whales purchasing current dips are positioned for potential gains exceeding 125% if the DePIN token reclaims its November 2024 peaks. Technical Analysis: $1.56 Make-or-Break Level Could Trigger Major Rally The GRASS/USDT daily chart shows the asset in a corrective phase following an impulsive five-wave Elliott structure, with wave (4) likely complete and price currently consolidating. The SMA (9) at $1.9442 acts as dynamic resistance, and the price is currently trading below it, around $1.72, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. Source: TradingView Despite the pullback, a visible demand zone around $1.56–$1.68 provides support. If this zone holds, we could witness a reversal toward marked resistance levels. The first upside target is $2.24–$2.34, and with building momentum, the price could advance toward target 2, which is $2.52–$2.62. A break above this level would allow a move to retest December’s high at $3.686, with the green-shaded zone projecting bullish continuation toward $3.67. Overall, the price maintains a higher low structure, suggesting the broader trend could remain bullish if the current support zone holds. A breakdown below $1.56 would invalidate this scenario and shift sentiment bearish.

The company submitted an S-3ASR registration statement , enabling the resale of up to 58,699,760 shares related to its private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing. The Thursday filing allows more than 100 shareholders in the PIPE round to sell their shares, effectively flooding the market and triggering a post-close sell-off, Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, a publicly-traded firm that's pursuing crypto reserve strategy centered on bitcoin BTC, explained in an X post and an interview with CoinDesk. The company raised $450 million earlier this month through a PIPE round from a wide range of investors, including ConsenSys, Galaxy, and Pantera Capital, to acquire ETH for its treasury. Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin also joined the firm as board chairman. However, there may be a larger strategy behind the latest move. Allen said in an X post that he thinks the company may have quietly raised up to $1 billion to buy more ETH using an at-the-market (ATM) offering that was previously announced in a May 30 SEC filing . ""If they played cards right, they would expect a surprise PR tomorrow with $1B of ETH purchases, which could light the match to reignite the stock,"" he said.

Speaking at a White House event Thursday, Trump delivered his harshest criticism of Powell’s monetary policy approach, claiming that lowering rates by just one percentage point could save the United States $300 billion annually, while a two-point reduction would generate $600 billion in savings. Why Trump Wants to ‘Force Something’ Trump’s latest verbal assault marks the third time in two days that his administration has publicly targeted Powell. It follows similar criticisms from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Vice President JD Vance, who called the Fed’s stance “monetary malpractice.” The president has been saying this for a while, but it's even more clear: the refusal by the Fed to cut rates is monetary malpractice. https://t.co/HqUjWxwcHs — JD Vance (@JDVance) June 11, 2025 The coordinated pressure campaign came from the administration’s growing impatience with the central bank’s independence, particularly as Trump faces re-election pressures and seeks to demonstrate economic leadership. Despite repeatedly calling Powell “Too Late” and questioning why firing him would be controversial, Trump stopped short of threatening termination, instead ominously suggesting he “may have to force something” if rate cuts don’t materialize soon. The timing of Trump’s criticism appears strategic, coming as recent economic indicators show inflation cooling and energy prices declining due to increased domestic drilling under his “drill, baby, drill” energy policy. US Inflation Rate Source: TradingEconomics Powell’s current term as Fed chair expires in May 2026, and Trump has hinted that an announcement regarding his nominee for the next Fed chair could come soon. Harvard legal experts suggest that while Trump may have constitutional authority to remove Powell, such a move would likely trigger severe market volatility and undermine the Fed’s credibility as an inflation fighter, potentially causing long-term interest rates to spike even if short-term rates were cut. Presidential Pressure Campaign Intensifies Fed Independence Debate The escalating confrontation between Trump and Powell is a fundamental clash over Federal Reserve independence with deep constitutional and economic implications. Trump’s frustration stems from his belief that the current interest rate environment unnecessarily burdens federal borrowing costs, particularly as the government faces mounting short-term debt obligations approved during the Biden administration. Europe Rate Cuts Source: European Central Bank The president argued that Europe has implemented ten rate cuts while the Fed has delivered none, despite similar economic conditions and falling inflation metrics. Legal scholars say that while the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 allows governors to be removed “for cause,” the Supreme Court’s recent decisions have gradually eroded the traditional “for cause” protections that independent agencies have enjoyed for 85 years. Harvard Law School’s Daniel Tarullo, a former Fed Board member, suggests that three conservative justices have hinted at potentially treating the Federal Reserve differently from other agencies, possibly creating a carve-out based on the central bank’s historical precedent dating back to the First and Second Banks of the United States. However, market dynamics may provide Powell with more protection than legal statutes, as any attempt to remove the Fed chair would likely trigger immediate and severe market reactions that would prove counterproductive to Trump’s economic objectives. The anticipated market volatility is a powerful disincentive, particularly given that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has focused on maintaining stable 10-year Treasury rates, which are key for economic investment decisions. Recent economic indicators have strengthened Trump’s argument for immediate monetary easing. Inflation data show continued price stability and energy costs declining due to expanded domestic oil production. The favorable Producer Price Index reading in May has calmed fears about tariff-induced inflation spikes, emboldening the administration to intensify pressure on the Fed while markets increasingly price in potential rate cuts later this year.

The product, called the Coinbase One Card, was announced during the company’s State of Crypto Summit in New York, where CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that only US-based Coinbase One subscribers will have access. The cashback rate starts at 2%, and the more crypto a user holds on Coinbase, the higher the percentage climbs. The card reportedly runs on the American Express network, and comes with travel perks, purchase protections, and limited-time offers. The physical card itself is metal and engraved with part of the Bitcoin genesis block. According to Yahoo Finance, Brian said, “We’re excited to bring more utility to everyday spending. Why shouldn’t you earn 4% on your checking account?” Coinbase offers basic tier membership to unlock access The company is also rolling out a Basic tier for Coinbase One to make the new card available at a lower cost. For $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, users can unlock access to the Coinbase One Card without additional fees. That same tier offers zero trading fees on up to $500 per month, 4.5% APY on the first $10,000 of USDC, and up to $1,000 in account protection in case of unauthorized access. Since Coinbase One launched in 2023, its membership base has allegedly reached almost one million people, all of whom use the service for crypto trading, staking, and reward benefits. Brian said the Basic tier is designed to reach a wider audience, including those who are just getting started. Brian says bitcoin could replace dollar if debt crisis worsens During the Summit, Brian was asked about the future of Bitcoin and whether it could become the world’s reserve currency. “If the debt situation doesn’t get fixed, I do think that eventually Bitcoin will have to become the reserve currency—for better or worse,” he said. He blamed growing US debt and deficit spending, warning that without urgent action from Congress, the global financial system could shift away from the US dollar. “It’s not going to be the Chinese RMB,” Brian said. “They have their own debt problems.” He said rising national debt and Bitcoin’s all-time highs aren’t a coincidence. He added that in history, once a country decouples its currency from hard assets, inflation eventually follows. He cited 150% to 200% debt-to-GDP ratios as danger zones and said, “It’s like the frog slowly getting cooked.” Brian expressed support for current bipartisan crypto legislation in Congress, praising the Trump administration for its stance. He also said the Stablecoin Act, the Clarity Act, and the Genius Act should be passed before Congress leaves for summer recess. “We need to stick the landing,” he said. “The president wants those bills signed into law by August.” When asked if recent tax legislation could be the trigger for a financial crisis, Brian replied, “I’m reading both sides on this. I don’t know enough to say for sure, to be honest.” He suggested a follow-up bill might be necessary to address discretionary spending and prevent further economic fallout. He also revealed a partnership with Shopify that enables merchants to accept USDC payments directly. Alongside the AMEX-backed One Card, Coinbase now has a debit card through Visa, too. Source: Coinbase “We’re not trying to fight Visa and AMEX,” Brian said. “We’re working with them. But crypto is making people question the margins.” He added that the smarter card networks are already working on stablecoin strategies to avoid being left behind. On the topic of Circle, issuer of USDC, Brian confirmed Coinbase still holds equity in the company. “We’re the largest distribution partner for USDC,” he said. Their agreement is “substantial,” and Brian believes the market isn’t fully pricing that into Coinbase’s stock. When asked if he’d ever consider acquiring Circle, Brian said, “We’d always consider it, but it takes two parties.” He closed the interview by responding to a warning from CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham, who reminded crypto investors that regulation is coming. Brian agreed. “There are no free rides,” he said. “Regulation will be a huge boon. We’re actively working all over DC to get it done.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|Bitcoin|Coinbase,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-12 23:53:06

Since the given estimates for liquidations are based on publicly available data, they may not reflect the true magnitude of market liquidations.

In other news, outgoing chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) sounded the alarm on the systemic risks posed by crypto’s deepening integration with traditional finance. Good as the market have been, whales have began mooving their money. If you’ve absorbed enough crypto content, you probably already know just how much power whales have when it comes to moving prices. According to data from Santiment, with crypto markets ranging, the importance of where whales are moving their money is at a premium. On-chain data shows a whale on Binance was liquidated on a $201M BTC/USDT long position in a single order. Bitcoin whale liquidation in real time on Binance Exchanges like Bybit, OKX and Binance saw the biggest hits, with Binance alone accounting for nearly $258.79 million in liquidations. The liquidations largely hit major tokens, with bitcoin leading the pack at over $308 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data. Bitcoin markets steer profits On the other hand, Bitcoin’s several breakouts past $110,000 this week have pushed bullish market sentiment to a seven-month high. The sentiment was last seen during US President Donald Trump’s election win. As of June 11, there are 2.12 positive Bitcoin comments for every negative comment on social media, crypto analytics platform Santiment said in a June 11 X post. During this cycle, retail interest in Bitcoin has been subdued, with the price increases largely credited to institutional and nation-state adoption. An optimistic change in retail sentiment may serve as an extra advantage for Bitcoin. On June 11, Santiment data recorded 504.54 positive sentiment comments regarding Bitcoin, contrasted with 237.71 negative comments, resulting in a ratio of 2.12. Santiment monitors Bitcoin market sentiment across platforms such as X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, Bitcoin Talk, and Farcaster. 😍 With Bitcoin teasing its $112K all-time high the past couple days, retail has gotten bullish.

This growing focus on long-term strength links directly to Hyperliquid price movement, where momentum is already picking up speed. A new exchange listing has lifted HYPE’s value, and charts are signaling a possible trend shift. Though both assets are gaining traction for separate reasons, BlockDAG (BDAG) is setting a new direction entirely. Over 1.5 million individuals are currently mining BDAG through the X1 Miner App, eliminating the need for hardware or setup. Mining is now as easy as using a smartphone, and with a low presale price still available and future value projections reaching $5, attention is rising fast. Cardano Price Prediction Suggests Breakout Potential Cardano price prediction is becoming more prominent due to increased institutional inflows, strong technical signs, and ADA regaining a 1% share of the total crypto market. Market watchers are closely monitoring ADA as it approaches the important Fibonacci golden pocket zone, which is typically seen as a signal for upcoming price movement. ADA’s behavior resembles Bitcoin’s early bull cycle stages, indicating the potential for fresh growth. Should this trend continue, Cardano price prediction could see targets surpassing $1.00, supported by accumulation trends and renewed support from both retail and larger buyers. Hyperliquid Price Movement Accelerates With Binance US Listing Boost Hyperliquid price movement has picked up after Binance US shared plans to list HYPE, driving a sharp 15% rise in a single day. Currently at $37.77, HYPE has jumped 81% in the past month. Analysts are noticing a rounding bottom pattern forming on the charts, a sign of possible continuation. If HYPE breaks beyond the $39 neckline, it might head toward the $50 level. This increased activity in the Hyperliquid price movement is further supported by higher futures open interest and robust trading volume. These signs point to a wider shift in DeFi user sentiment as engagement increases. BlockDAG App Transforms Phone Usage Into Daily Mining Activity BlockDAG is changing how people get involved with mining by making the process user-friendly. More than 1.5 million people are mining BDAG coins each day through the X1 Miner App , removing the need for costly equipment or tech skills. Mining becomes a simple daily task, where people use just their phones to earn. The app allows users to tap a lightning icon once a day to mine up to 20 BDAG. It avoids battery drain, heat issues, or complex setups. There’s also a leaderboard and referral feature that boosts mining rates, helping the user base grow quickly. BlockDAG’s presale is also gaining strong attention. The project has raised $297 million and sold 22.4 billion coins so far. Starting at $0.001, the price has already increased by 2,660% to its current level in batch 29. A limited-time offer still allows purchases at $0.0018. This rare pricing period has increased activity, as many believe BDAG could reach $5. With this traction and simple app-based mining, many consider BDAG the best crypto to buy now. To Wrap Up! Cardano price prediction remains a key topic as ADA moves toward a critical resistance range, backed by solid indicators and a rising market share. Hyperliquid price movement brings different momentum after a listing-led rally, with eyes on its ability to continue upward. But in terms of user involvement and ease of entry, BlockDAG stands apart. More than 1.5 million users are already mining BDAG with their smartphones, and with the presale price of $0.0018 still available for a limited time, attention continues to grow. As $5 predictions emerge, BlockDAG is not just gaining traction; it’s seen by many as the best crypto to buy now while this pricing window remains open.

CNBC reports that in a note to clients, Wells Fargo automotive and mobility analyst Colin Langan says that Tesla’s core auto business continues to weaken, which could weigh down on the company’s stock. “ While ‘order’ pricing on the website appears stable over the [last 12 months], aggressive financing promotions continue to act as price cuts. Risk to Q2 margin remains given lower leverage.” The bank is giving Tesla an underweight rating and a $120 price target, which means that the company’s shares could drop by 61% from Monday’s closing price of $308.58. The bank’s bearish forecast comes even as investors anticipate the company’s robotaxi launch in Austin today. The vehicles are set to provide on-demand transportation without human drivers. Lanang says that potential tailwinds, including Tesla’s work on autonomous driving, are not enough to offset weak automotive numbers. “Most investor attention is directed at the June 12th Austin Robotaxi deployment. We doubt the likely limited debut will be enough to overshadow the poor fundamentals.” Tesla’s global deliveries are down 23% year over year amid steeper competition in China. TSLA has already dropped by more than 22% in 2025. In June alone, the stock slumped by nearly 10%.

(NYSE: GME) has announced the pricing of its upsized sale of convertible senior notes due 2032. The established gaming retailer up-scaled its sale of notes from $1.75 billion, announced earlier this week, to about $2.25 billion. The company also announced that initial purchasers of the notes will be given an option to purchase an additional $450 million within a 13-day period. As a result, GameStop has estimated to raise up to $2.68 billion after the sale of notes is closed June 17, 2025. Could GameStop Be Preparing for More Bitcoin Purchases? The company indicated that the funds will be used to make strategic acquisitions and investments, which aligns with its long-term goal. As Coinpedia previously reported , GameStop has already disclosed holding around 4,710 Bitcoins, which were purchased during the first quarter of 2025. “GameStop intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including making investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions,” the announcement noted . The company has been betting on an imminent parabolic rally of Bitcoin in the long haul, fueled by clear crypto regulatory frameworks in the United States. Furthermore, more companies have followed in the footsteps of Strategy in implementing a BTC treasury management plan to hedge against inflation. At the time of this writing, around 228 entities, led by publicly traded companies, have adopted a BTC treasury management plan. Consequently, the supply of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has continued to exponentially decline, thus further exacerbating the existing supply vs demand shock.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 00:02:31

That marks a $33 billion increase so far this year, a 17% rise, driven by renewed crypto trading activity, growing use in payments, and increased regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump. Source: CryptoQuant . USDT and USDC Lead $33B Market Cap Jump According to the report, Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC continue to lead the market. USDT now holds a $155 billion market cap, up $18 billion year-to-date. USDC has gained $17 billion, climbing to a record high of $61 billion, an increase of 39% since January. On centralized exchanges, stablecoin reserves are also surging. The total value of ERC-20 stablecoins held on exchanges has reached $50 billion. Stablecoins are booming again. Market cap hit a record $228B, up $33B (+17%) in 2025. Driven by rising trading activity, growing payment use, and clearer U.S. regulation under Trump. pic.twitter.com/76zKj49UWB — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 12, 2025 USDC reserves in particular have grown 1.6 times in 2025 alone, now totaling around $8 billion. This influx supports deeper liquidity for crypto markets. The report also noted that stablecoins are bouncing back in the yield-bearing segment. These are stablecoins that pay interest to holders, often used in DeFi. The value of staked stablecoins has reached $6.9 billion, up 28% since late May. Most of that growth has come from rising demand for sUSDe and sUSDs, which gained $1.23 billion and $700 million in market cap, respectively. A recent report from on-chain data platforms Artemis and Dune shows broader user adoption. According to the report, titled “The State of Stablecoins 2025,” active stablecoin wallets rose from 19.6 million to 30 million over the past year, a 53% increase. The report said the data “suggests wider user engagement” and pointed to stablecoins becoming a key part of digital finance. It also noted that stablecoins are increasingly used in decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and NFTs. “Stablecoins have emerged as a bridge between traditional finance and crypto,” it said, “and are becoming a core piece of payment and settlement infrastructure.” This surge in usage is also supported by the rise in real-world payment activity. Data from Artemis shows $94.2 billion in stablecoin transactions were settled between January 2023 and February 2025. Business-to-business (B2B) payments made up the largest chunk, reaching an annual run rate of $36 billion. Card-linked payments using stablecoins crossed $13 billion in volume. Stablecoin Legislation Gains Ground as Tech and Finance Giants Pile In Increased demand has also come alongside progress on the regulatory front. For example, the U.S. Senate advanced the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” or GENIUS Act this week. Backed by President Trump, the bill is designed to create a federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins. The legislation would require stablecoins to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or highly liquid assets. It would also mandate annual audits for issuers with over $50 billion in market cap, and include requirements for foreign issuers. The U.S. Senate Set for Historic Stablecoin Showdown as GENIUS Act nears final vote. #Stablecoins #GeniusAct https://t.co/ZJ59XzuQcn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 The Senate voted 68-30 to invoke cloture on the bill , clearing the way for final debate and vote. “This did not happen by accident,” said Senator Tim Scott, one of the bill’s co-sponsors. “To those who said Washington could not act… let’s prove them wrong.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent backed the legislation during a Wednesday Senate hearing. He said stablecoins could play a major role in expanding the use of the U.S. dollar globally. “I think $2 trillion is a very reasonable number,” Bessent said, referring to an estimate that the stablecoin market could exceed that level by 2028. “I could see it greatly exceeding that.” BREAKING – U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent: – Stablecoin regulations backed by U.S. Treasuries will expand global USD usage – We could see stablecoin demand exceed $2 TRILLION This is massive for crypto.

His statement centers on Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, whom he believes is preparing several initiatives that could significantly impact the token’s trajectory. Developer Anticipated to Reveal Major Plans In a recent post titled Reality Check, Delgado hinted that Kusama has multiple strategic developments in progress, though not yet disclosed publicly. While specifics remain unclear, Delgado expressed confidence that these efforts could reshape Shiba Inu’s ecosystem and attract renewed investor interest. He also referenced the popular hashtag #1CentDreamSHIB , reaffirming the longstanding goal within the Shiba Inu community to eventually push SHIB’s price to $0.01. According to Delgado, the upcoming initiatives, once unveiled, could substantially increase the token’s demand and utility, possibly creating conditions that favour price appreciation. Reality Check: @ShytoshiKusama still has several ACEs up his sleeve, when they hit the table it will turn the game upside down. #1CentDreamSHIB — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) June 11, 2025 Long-Term Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Target: $0.01 The aspiration to see SHIB reach one cent remains a central focus for many holders. Analysts such as Delgado and Shiba Inu’s marketing figure Lucie , have consistently supported this goal. However, it faces considerable skepticism due to SHIB’s vast circulating supply. The token currently trades at approximately $0.00001258. To reach the $0.01 target, the token would need to increase in value by over 78,000%. At that level, its market capitalization would rise to an estimated $5.89 trillion, assuming the current supply of roughly 589.5 trillion SHIB remains unchanged. This figure would exceed the total market capitalization of the entire cryptocurrency sector, which is presently valued at about $3.39 trillion. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Shytoshi Kusama’s Recent Activities Despite growing speculation within the community, Kusama has been largely inactive on social media. His last post on X was dated May 29, 2025. Before stepping back, he mentioned his ongoing work on a white paper focused on artificial intelligence and its intersection with Shiba Inu. This AI-focused white paper appears to be his primary undertaking, as suggested by updates to his X profile and location settings. According to previous communications, the document will explore how Shiba Inu could play a role in emerging AI technologies. Ecosystem Developments Continue While Kusama directs attention to the upcoming white paper, the broader Shiba Inu development team remains active. Recent initiatives include the release of an upgraded decentralized finance (DeFi) toolkit. This new set of tools aims to improve how users interact with SHIB, particularly in terms of earning, trading, and token burning. Additionally, the Shiba Inu team recently announced a collaboration with TokenPlay.ai, a gaming platform powered by artificial intelligence and developed by Astra Nova. As part of the partnership, users can design Shiba Inu-themed games without coding experience. The initiative also includes a play-to-earn component, allowing users to earn rewards through gameplay. The project will debut with a Shiba-themed game and later introduce an arcade-style gaming hub called Shib.fun, further expanding the ecosystem’s offerings.

The token is currently trading at $8.403, up 1.82% (+$0.150), and has managed to break past the previous resistance range of $ 7.50–$ 8.00. This upward movement signals growing buying interest, and that momentum could be building for a stronger push ahead. Key Support And Resistance Levels Define UNI’s Next Move In his analysis, Crypto Man MAB highlighted UNI’s evolving price structure, pointing to key support and resistance levels. The immediate support is seen around $7.103, which marks the 24-hour low. If UNI pulls back further, stronger support may be found near $6.500, a level that has previously attracted buying interest and could act as a safety net for bulls. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) Blastoff At Hand? The Sleeping Giant Awakens At $4.6 Support On the upside, resistance stands near $8.677, the recent 24-hour high. This zone is currently capping the rally, but if buying momentum persists, UNI could target the $9.0 mark next. While this level presents a psychological barrier, it also aligns with short-term bullish projections, adding more weight to its significance. In terms of market activity, Crypto Man MAB noted a notable increase in trading volume, which aligns with UNI’s recent price surge. This volume spike suggests that buyers are stepping in with strong conviction, reinforcing the strength behind the upward movement. A sustained high volume typically validates price action, which supports the argument for a potential rally continuation, provided the momentum holds and no major resistance halts the trend. Breakout Signals Strength, But Long-Term Caution Lingers According to the analyst, the UNI chart shows a shift from a period of consolidation into a noticeable upward breakout. The recent dominance of green candlesticks points to growing bullish moves and renewed buying pressure in the short term. Related Reading: Uniswap Stays On Course For More Gains – $12.3 Resistance In Sight However, the longer-term trend suggests a more cautious outlook. Over the last 180 days, UNI has declined by 53.31%, and its one-year performance shows a decrease of 18.98%, indicating that the asset has been in an overall downtrend despite recent gains. Presently, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) is demonstrating increased trading activity, which aligns with the positive price movement and supports the current bullish sentiment. This rise in volume may strengthen the case for a possible continuation of the ongoing upward trend, but traders should remain alert to any shifts in momentum. In conclusion, Crypto Man MAB noted that UNI is showing short-term upward strength, but the broader trend remains uncertain. However, a clear breakout above the $8.677 resistance level would be a strong signal for continued upside.

These efforts are driven by the high level of… pic.twitter.com/CJub0rPQ9c — Icekento (@icekento1) June 12, 2025 Assistant Commissioner Mario Wong Ho-yin said the department had handled seven cryptocurrency-related money laundering cases between 2021 and May 2025, involving over HK$9 billion. Crypto Fraud Cases Prompt New Law Enforcement Collaboration Wong said these offenses crossed international borders and required collaboration among law enforcement agencies, academic institutions, and the financial sector. “These money laundering threats are characterised by a transnational and borderless nature, and no single agency can tackle this problem alone,” Wong said during a media briefing. In one case, HK$1.8 billion moved through more than 1,000 transactions involving five companies and 18 local bank accounts. Two suspects allegedly moved HK$760 million using a cryptocurrency platform. The partnership builds on earlier work with HKU, where Hong Kong Customs had used the university’s forensic tools to investigate copyright infringement cases. Professor Yiu Siu-ming of HKU’s School of Computing and Data Science said the risks tied to virtual assets would likely grow as adoption increases. “Different issues will arise when so many products emerge, but current laws and regulations are not necessarily comprehensive. Another factor to note is the safety of these platforms,” he said. “This will help us fulfil the evidence requirements from the court [when handling these cases]. Without the University of Hong Kong’s technical advice, it would be difficult for us to do so,” Wong added. Hong Kong Broadens Digital Finance Strategy The two parties have also begun training officers from both local and international agencies on how to investigate digital asset-related crimes. A recent three-day workshop included attendees from eight jurisdictions, including mainland China, India, and New Zealand. The initiative coincides with Hong Kong’s ongoing efforts to establish itself as a regulated hub for digital finance. The city’s e-HKD pilot program is now in its second phase, testing practical applications for a central bank digital currency, such as settlement and cross-border use.

However, the banking world has remained completely silent as experts mostly respond with doubt or outright disbelief. Some people think the Pi Network represents a bottom-up, grassroots revolution that lets ordinary people shape the future of money. In contrast, others say the $314,159 figure feels more like a fantasy than anything based on market reality. Pi community pushes GCV Value despite lack of market backing The GCV value of $314,159 per coin is based on the mathematical constant Pi (π = 3.14159…), multiplied by 100,000. It represents a belief that Pi Coin will someday become incredibly valuable. Some users say the community has the right to assign Pi value through consensus rather than letting outside markets decide because it built the coin. However, the GVC is more symbolic than practical or social agreement among some members of the Pi community because no formal market, crypto exchange, or bank recognizes or trades it at that price. A group of Pi users calling themselves “GCV Global Ambassadors” encourage businesses on social media to accept and trade the coin at GVC. Some of them are also part of the “Double Value Movement” that claims users can transact Pi at both the current market value and the GCV. However, some experts say you can’t easily cash out Pi at that value because there is no institutional support or legal enforcement behind it. The GVC remains a bet on what could be, not what is. Pi launches Open Mainnet and utility apps, but GCV remains far-fetched Pi launched its Open Mainnet in February 2025 and introduced the Boostr app, allowing users to pay utility bills, recharge mobile phones, and buy digital services with Pi Coins. While these developments show that Pi has real utility, they aren’t enough to justify a price of $314,159 per coin. Pi needs a high level of global demand, trust, and financial backing that no digital asset has ever achieved (not even Bitcoin) for its GVC to make sense. Traders on platforms like HTX (formerly Huobi) buy and sell IOU tokens, not the actual Pi from the Open Mainnet, because major exchanges haven’t listed the coin yet. These IOUs trade between $0.60 and $0.65, not representing the real Mainnet Pi coins that users mine inside the official Pi Wallet. The Pi Core Team clarified that Pi will be worth what people are willing to pay for it once it becomes fully tradeable. The project’s future depends on building a healthy ecosystem of apps, merchants, and utilities that make Pi useful at scale. Why banks aren’t buying into the GCV The GVC’s scale is unrealistic because if Pi Coin were $314,159 per coin, assuming a modest number of total circulating coins mined during the enclosed and open Mainnet phases is 100 billion Pi tokens, the total market value would reach over $31 quadrillion. This figure is larger than the combined global GDP (just under $105 trillion) and the entire cryptocurrency market of $2 trillion in mid-2025. Banks cannot endorse Pi due to strict regulations that reject assets operating in semi-closed ecosystems without passing through Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance on a global scale or proving market liquidity. Bank regulators would not approve banks participating in or promoting any currency without direct exchangeability for fiat or verified assets. Banks or financial institutions will also only support digital currency that shows price stability, user transparency, and some kind of backing through reserves, audits, or a reliable blockchain history. Bitcoin has over a decade of market history, decentralized transparency, high liquidity, and widespread institutional adoption. In contrast, Stablecoins like USDC or USDT have real-world reserves backing them and are subject to public reporting. Banks cannot rely on Pi’s value for risk and return modeling because top-tier exchanges haven’t listed the coin on their platforms and its value is set by user hope and symbolic beliefs instead of market activity. Is the community dreaming big or just fooling Itself? The GCV Global Ambassadors mindset shows the strength of a decentralized belief and community coordination, but even communities must shaped by digital movements and peer-to-peer systems. Value in finance comes from utility, demand, liquidity, transparency, and regulation, so the risk of disillusionment grows when there’s no verified market data, audited reserve backing, or open exchange trading. Most supporters of the GVC say every big crypto project started with belief, just like Pi, and grew because people kept building, using, and holding it until the rest of the world caught up. However, several skeptics say Bitcoin was always open to trade, fully decentralized, and supported by a transparent supply model. At the same time, Pi is still not fully open, its supply is large and not clearly capped, and community-set wishful numbers determine its current value. People fear that promoting a GCV without explaining the risks could create backlash when those values don’t convert into actual wealth and cause collapse under pressure if users don’t temper their hopes with grounded facts. The Pi Network community is powerful, but what started as a promising social movement could turn into a case study in digital self-deception if belief becomes blind and hope replaces economic logic. Yes, belief is a strong force, but it needs proof, action, and real-world integration to become lasting value. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The reaction was instant. Dow futures dropped 400 points, or 0.9%, S&P 500 futures fell 1.1%, and the Nasdaq 100 sank 1.3%, according to CNBC. This happened right after Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz imposed a nationwide emergency, warning that attacks on civilians were expected in retaliation. Katz declared the special state of emergency across Israel after what he described as a preemptive strike. In his signed order, Katz said, “Following the State of Israel’s preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future… You must obey the instructions of the Home Front Command and the authorities and remain in the protected areas.” Gold surges again as oil rises and dollar falls Gold prices surged for a third straight day, jumping 0.8% after already gaining 0.9% on Thursday. As of 8:12 a.m. Singapore time, spot gold was trading at $3,406.61 per ounce. The Israeli Air Force had hit Iranian targets earlier in the day, Axios reported, citing two people with knowledge of the attack. Other precious metals moved as well. Silver, platinum, and palladium all recorded gains. Meanwhile, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dropped 0.1%, and the US Dollar Index ($DXY) slid to its lowest level since March 2022, reflecting how fast investors are fleeing the dollar for safe-haven assets. The only market sector climbing with conviction was oil. Prices blasted through $72 per barrel without resistance, rising in a straight vertical line as traders braced for a wider war in the Middle East that could disrupt supply. Asia markets mixed as Wall Street’s gains erased Even though Wall Street had finished Thursday’s regular session in the green, everything turned red once news broke of the Israeli strikes. The Dow and the Nasdaq Composite both ended the day up 0.2%, and the S&P 500 closed 0.4% higher. That brought the index within 2% of its all-time high from February. But all that progress was wiped out hours later. By Friday morning, investors in the Asia-Pacific region were already reacting. The Nikkei 225 in Japan lost 0.36%, and the Topix fell 0.43%. In South Korea, the Kospi added 0.38%, while the Kosdaq moved up slightly by 0.15%. Australia’s ASX 200 stayed flat. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng futures traded at 24,178, slightly above Thursday’s close of 24,035.38. The military operation was confirmed by NBC News, who reported that two US officials said the airstrikes were carried out by Israel alone, with no American involvement. That clarification came after investors feared the United States might get pulled into another war. For now, the White House hasn’t released any direct statement.

Recent data offers a compelling insight: Bitcoin short-term holders are largely sitting on profits, a factor that analysts suggest could be limiting potential downside risk in the current market environment. This isn’t just a random observation; it’s a finding rooted in detailed Bitcoin on-chain data , specifically looking at the cost basis of these particular investors. Who Are Bitcoin Short-Term Holders and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the data, let’s clarify who we’re talking about. In the realm of Bitcoin price analysis , holders are often categorized based on how long they’ve held their coins: Short-Term Holders (STH): Typically defined as entities that have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. These holders are often considered more reactive to price changes and market sentiment. They are more likely to sell during periods of volatility, either to take profits or cut losses. Long-Term Holders (LTH): Entities that have held Bitcoin for 155 days or more. These holders are generally seen as having a higher conviction and are less likely to sell during market fluctuations. Their accumulation or distribution patterns often signal broader market trends. The cost basis (or average acquisition price) for these groups is a crucial metric. It tells us, on average, at what price these holders bought their Bitcoin. If the current market price is above their cost basis, they are in profit. If it’s below, they are at a loss. Why does the profitability of STHs matter for the Bitcoin market outlook ? Simple: holders who are in profit are generally less likely to panic sell compared to those underwater. While they might sell to realize gains, the intense pressure to exit positions to avoid further losses is significantly reduced when the average STH is profitable. This can act as a buffer against sharp, cascading declines driven by forced selling. Key Data Points from Bitcoin On-Chain Data According to insights shared by Glassnode, a leading provider of on-chain analytics, the cost basis for various cohorts of short-term Bitcoin holders remains comfortably below the current market price as of mid-June 2024. This is a significant observation, especially following recent price movements. Here’s a look at the average acquisition prices for different short-term timeframes: Holder Timeframe Average Acquisition Price (as of June 11) One-Week Holders ~$106,200 One-Month Holders ~$105,200 Three-Month Holders ~$98,300 Six-Month Holders ~$97,000 Note: The exact numbers provided by Glassnode in the original snippet seem unusually high ($100k+). Assuming these were illustrative or slightly off in the source text provided, let’s proceed with the core premise that the *current market price* is above these acquisition costs, which is the key takeaway. Let’s use a placeholder current price range for context, acknowledging the discrepancy in the source data. Given that Bitcoin has been trading significantly below these reported levels (closer to the $60k-$70k range in June 2024), the initial data points seem incorrect based on the market reality. However, the *principle* remains valid: if the market price is above the STH cost basis, they are in profit, and this limits downside risk. Let’s reinterpret the data’s *implication* based on the article’s conclusion, assuming the source intended to show prices *below* current market value, or that the current market price referenced was significantly higher at the time of the data point capture than the current reading. Reinterpreting the Data’s Significance (Assuming the Principle Holds): The core message is that despite recent price dips, the average price at which STHs acquired their Bitcoin is still below the *current* market price. This means the majority of these recent buyers are still holding profitable positions. Why is this important? When the market price approaches or falls below the STH cost basis, this cohort starts to feel pressure. The STH Realized Price (which is the aggregate cost basis for all STHs) often acts as a significant support level during market corrections. If the price holds above this level, it indicates that aggregate STH profitability is maintained, reducing the likelihood of a large-scale capitulation event from this group. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market Outlook ? The fact that Bitcoin short-term holders are, on average, still in profit paints a picture of relative market stability from a specific on-chain perspective. Here’s what this suggests: Reduced Selling Pressure: Profitable holders have less urgent reasons to sell compared to those facing losses. While profit-taking can occur, it’s typically less aggressive than capitulation selling. Potential Support Levels: The average acquisition price levels mentioned, particularly the aggregate STH Realized Price, can act as psychological and actual support zones. A dip towards these levels might be seen as a buying opportunity by others, rather than triggering mass panic. Indicator of Market Strength (Relative): Maintaining profitability for recent buyers, even after price dips, can be interpreted as underlying demand absorbing supply without forcing the average new buyer into a loss position. However, it’s crucial to view this metric as just one piece of the puzzle when conducting comprehensive Bitcoin price analysis . While STH profitability limits *STH-driven* downside, it doesn’t make Bitcoin immune to other factors. Applying Crypto Market Analysis : Actionable Insights For investors trying to make sense of the market, this data offers several actionable insights: Identify Potential Support: Keep an eye on the aggregate STH Realized Price. Historically, holding above this level is constructive, while breaking below it can signal deeper corrections where STHs begin to capitulate. Understand the Nature of Selling: Recognize that any selling pressure from STHs in the current environment is likely profit-taking rather than forced selling due to losses. This type of selling can be absorbed more healthily by the market. Don’t Rely on One Metric: While insightful, STH profitability is not the sole determinant of future price action. Incorporate other Bitcoin on-chain data (like exchange flows, miner reserves, whale activity) and traditional market analysis (macroeconomics, news events, technical analysis) for a complete picture. Manage Expectations: Even with limited STH downside risk, volatility is inherent in the crypto market. This data doesn’t preclude price drops, but it suggests that a major crash driven *solely* by recent buyers panicking is less probable *at this specific moment*. Challenges and Limitations While STH profitability is a positive signal for limiting one specific type of downside, it’s not a guarantee against price drops. Challenges include: Macroeconomic Shocks: External events (e.g., interest rate hikes, geopolitical crises) can trigger market-wide sell-offs regardless of on-chain profitability. Whale Movements: Large holders (whales) can significantly impact the market with relatively few transactions, and their behavior isn’t solely dictated by the average STH cost basis. Exchange Dynamics: Sudden increases in exchange inflows can signal intent to sell, adding pressure even if holders are profitable. Data Interpretation: On-chain data provides probabilities and insights, not certainties. The definitions (like the 155-day threshold) are conventions used for analysis. Benefits of Tracking STH Profitability Despite the limitations, tracking the profitability of Bitcoin short-term holders offers clear benefits for anyone engaged in crypto market analysis : Provides insight into the immediate sentiment of recent market entrants. Helps identify potential psychological and on-chain support levels. Offers a perspective on the *type* of selling pressure the market might face (profit-taking vs. capitulation). Complements other analytical tools for a more rounded market view. Summary: A Foundation of Profitability The latest Bitcoin on-chain data from Glassnode suggests that Bitcoin short-term holders have, on average, maintained profitable positions despite recent market fluctuations. This condition is historically associated with limited downside risk originating from this specific cohort, as the pressure for forced selling is reduced. While this provides a degree of confidence regarding one potential source of market weakness, it is essential to remember that the Bitcoin market outlook is influenced by a multitude of factors. Utilizing Bitcoin price analysis tools, including detailed on-chain metrics like cost basis, alongside broader crypto market analysis , offers investors a more robust framework for understanding current conditions and potential future movements. The current profitability of short-term holders is a notable data point suggesting underlying resilience, but vigilance and a comprehensive analytical approach remain paramount.

These are usually coins that are under $1 billion. Besides that, they need to show massive growth potential. So far, one of the best projects that fits this description is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Let us find out why. Utility And A Real-World Vision Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a utility-based project that aims to achieve the full potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) technology. On the protocol, users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders, you deposit funds into the protocol’s liquidity pools to earn interest. The interest you earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. As more borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate rises, which increases the interest. This encourages borrowers to pay back loans, while also promoting lenders to deposit more funds to benefit from the higher yields. Borrowers can choose between stable and variable rates. The stable rates are designed for borrowers who need predictable repayments. To keep the system balanced, the stable rate starts higher based on a time-weighted average of the variable rate. If the variable rate rises significantly above the stable rate, a rebalancing is triggered. The stable rate is increased to avoid an overly huge gap. This ensures the system’s liquidity is protected from arbitrageurs who would otherwise raid the ecosystem’s liquidity. Community Strength And Positive Market Sentiment Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a massive community of over 20k across all its social media channels. This is an impressive achievement for a project that is barely halfway through its presale. The project has worked to cultivate and grow the trust of its community since the start. In one of the latest moves to bolster its community’s trust, it released the CertiK audit results. The results have been crucial to boosting trust in the project and are expected to have a positive impact on community growth. For instance, it has over 10.5k followers on X, which is one of the largest social media platforms in the world, and one with a huge active crypto community. Another boost in trust came when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) was listed on CoinMarketCap, the biggest crypto price aggregator in the world. The CoinMarketCap platform has over 350 million monthly visitors, which places Mutuum Finance in an extraordinarily great position to benefit from this massive community. The listing on CoinMarketCap signals that Mutuum Finance can be trusted. The reason for this is that the platform has an intense vetting process for new tokens. One of the requirements is that they pass a third-party security audit. Team Credibility And Project Security The team behind this project has proven its commitment to honesty through the CertiK audit. Additionally, they have posted a full roadmap of everything they plan to achieve, signaling their commitment to accountability. So far, they have completed 75% of what they set out to achieve in phase 1 of the roadmap. They also provide regular updates to their community on the progress of the project. For instance, they recently revealed that they plan to launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. The release of the platform will coincide with the launch, giving the community a chance to review the platform and come up with their own conclusions. Such a commitment shows that they are willing to be accountable for what they have been doing for the presale phase. It will also provide an opportunity for the community to air out their feedback once they test the beta version of the platform for themselves. Well-Structured Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is well structured, with incremental rises in price at every phase. For instance, in the current phase 5 of the presale, the tokens are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. These increases are designed to support the earliest believers in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) vision with the biggest rewards. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will increase by 16.67% to $0.035. That price increase will reduce the guaranteed ROI from 100% to 71.43%, based on the listing price of $0.06. Massive Community Giveaway To reward the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) community for their support in the presale, the team has organized a massive $100,000 giveaway . In this giveaway, ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. To qualify for this giveaway, you only need to participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. Besides the giveaway, Mutuum Finance also has a leaderboard set up in the presale dashboard. The top 50 participants in the presale will be eligible to receive bonus tokens. These prizes and bonuses show that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is committed to rewarding its community, which is a clear sign of a people-centered DeFi project. With so much at stake, participating in the presale could be your ticket to life-changing gains when the project goes live.

This development highlights a fascinating intersection between the volatile world of cryptocurrency and the age-old stability sought in precious metals. What is This Tether Acquisition All About? According to an official announcement on Tether’s website, Tether Investments, an affiliate operating under the broader Tether Group, has acquired a substantial 31.9% stake in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. This company is described as a Canadian gold-focused royalty company. The transaction was finalized on June 10, 2024, and involved the purchase of 78.4 million shares from La Mancha Investments. This acquisition marks a notable step for Tether, venturing into the traditional mining finance sector through a royalty model. Let’s break down the key details of this Tether investment : Investor: Tether Investments (an affiliate of Tether Group) Acquired Company: Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. Company Focus: Gold-focused royalty streams and investments Stake Acquired: 31.9% Shares Purchased: 78.4 million Seller: La Mancha Investments Transaction Date: June 10, 2024 This move into a royalty company structure means Tether is investing in a business that holds interests in mining projects, typically receiving a percentage of production or revenue from those projects without the direct operational costs and risks of mining itself. It’s a way to gain exposure to gold price movements and mining success through a financial stream. Why Would Tether Invest in a Gold Royalty Company? This might seem like an unusual pairing at first glance. Why would a leading stablecoin issuer, deeply embedded in the digital asset space, put significant capital into a traditional gold royalty company ? Several strategic reasons could be at play: Diversification: Tether’s primary business revolves around stablecoins, which are linked to fiat currencies (like the USD) and other digital assets. Investing in a physical commodity like gold , albeit indirectly through a royalty stream, offers diversification away from purely digital or fiat-backed exposures. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, providing a different risk profile. Yield and Revenue Streams: Royalty companies generate revenue based on the production or sales from the mines they hold interests in. This can provide a steady, albeit variable, income stream that is independent of Tether’s core stablecoin operations. It’s a way to generate returns on capital that might be separate from the yield generated by their reserve assets. Exposure to Gold’s Value: While not holding physical gold directly, the value and performance of a gold royalty company are inherently tied to the price of gold and the success of the underlying mining operations. This investment gives Tether exposure to the potential upside of gold’s value appreciation. Strategic Alignment? While speculative, this could potentially tie into future Tether products or strategies. Could Tether explore stablecoins backed by commodities or baskets of assets that include gold? While there’s no direct indication yet, building expertise and holding stakes in related industries could pave the way for future innovations. Understanding the Royalty Company Model It’s important to understand what a royalty company does, as it differs from a mining company. A mining company explores, develops, and operates mines. This involves significant capital expenditure, operational risks, and environmental liabilities. A royalty company, on the other hand, provides upfront capital to mining companies in exchange for a future royalty stream (a percentage of future production or revenue) or purchases existing royalty interests. This model offers leverage to commodity prices with lower exposure to operating costs and risks compared to direct mining operations. Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. focuses on acquiring and managing such interests, primarily in gold . What Does This Acquisition Mean for Tether and the Crypto Space? This substantial acquisition by a major crypto entity like Tether sends several signals: Maturing Strategy: It suggests that large players in the crypto space are looking at sophisticated, non-crypto investment opportunities to grow and diversify their portfolios. Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance: It’s another example of how capital generated in the digital asset economy is flowing into traditional markets and assets. Potential for Future Innovation: While not explicitly stated, this could be foundational work for future Tether offerings that incorporate exposure to real-world assets like gold . Focus on Tangible Assets: At a time when discussions around stablecoin reserves are frequent, investing in assets tied to physical commodities like gold adds another layer to Tether’s diversified holdings. This isn’t Tether’s first foray into non-crypto investments. They have previously announced investments in areas like energy, telecommunications, and even Bitcoin mining infrastructure. However, a significant stake in a publicly traded gold royalty company is a notable step into a very traditional financial sector. Potential Benefits and Challenges Like any significant investment , this acquisition comes with potential upsides and considerations: Potential Benefits: Exposure to potential upside in gold prices. Diversification away from purely digital or fiat-based risks. Potential for stable, long-term revenue streams from royalties. Leverage to mining production success without direct operational headaches. Potential Challenges: Exposure to commodity price volatility (specifically gold ). Reliance on the success and production levels of the underlying mines Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. holds interests in. Regulatory considerations related to holding stakes in traditional companies. Integration or strategic alignment challenges between a tech/crypto company and a traditional resources finance company. Looking Ahead: Tether’s Evolving Investment Strategy This move into a gold royalty company suggests that Tether is actively managing its capital and exploring diverse avenues for growth and stability beyond its core stablecoin operations. It positions Tether Investments as a significant shareholder in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp., potentially influencing its future direction or operations, though the announcement did not detail any governance implications. The market will be watching to see how this acquisition integrates into Tether’s overall strategy and whether it signals a broader trend of crypto entities seeking exposure to traditional assets like gold via structured financial products like royalties. In conclusion, Tether’s significant stake in a Canadian gold-focused royalty company is a strategic investment that underscores the increasing convergence between the digital asset world and traditional finance. It highlights Tether’s efforts to diversify its holdings and potentially tap into the long-term value and stability traditionally associated with gold and the lucrative royalty model in the mining sector. This acquisition is a tangible example of crypto capital finding its way into established industries, creating new linkages between these distinct financial realms.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traders monitoring international trends, understanding these movements is crucial. Recently, the Korean won has captured attention, showing strength following the recent South Korea election . This move is seen by many as a sign of optimism regarding potential economic reform , but not everyone shares the same positive view. This article delves into the factors driving the won’s performance and the cautious perspective offered by financial giant, UBS. What’s Driving the Korean Won’s Post-Election Gain? Following the conclusion of the South Korea election, market sentiment towards the Korean won saw a noticeable uptick. The outcome appears to have fueled expectations of policy changes aimed at boosting the economy. Several factors contribute to this positive outlook: Policy Certainty: The election result provides a clearer picture of the political landscape, reducing uncertainty which is often a drag on currency performance. Reform Hopes: The winning party’s platform included pledges for various economic reforms. These could range from structural adjustments to measures aimed at attracting foreign investment or boosting domestic consumption. Improved Investor Confidence: A stable political environment and the promise of reform tend to increase confidence among both domestic and international investors, making assets denominated in Korean won more attractive. Global Factors: While domestic politics are key, global economic conditions and sentiment towards emerging markets also play a role in the Forex market dynamics impacting the won. This initial reaction suggests the market is pricing in a more favorable environment for the South Korean economy going forward. Examining the Forex Market Reaction The immediate aftermath of the South Korea election saw the Forex market react favorably to the Korean won. This appreciation is a direct reflection of increased demand for the currency, driven by the factors mentioned above. Currency movements are complex, influenced by interest rates, inflation, political stability, and trade balances. In this instance, political stability and the prospect of economic reform appear to be the primary catalysts for the won’s gain. Observing currency pairs involving the won, such as USD/KRW or JPY/KRW, provides a real-time gauge of this sentiment shift. A strengthening won means it takes fewer won to buy one unit of a foreign currency (e.g., USD/KRW rate falls). Why is UBS Offering a Cautious UBS Outlook? Despite the initial market enthusiasm, not all financial institutions are equally optimistic. UBS, a major global financial services company, has expressed a more cautious UBS outlook regarding the sustained strength of the Korean won . Their perspective highlights potential headwinds and challenges that could temper the post-election rally. UBS’s caution likely stems from several considerations: Execution Risk: While reform promises are positive, implementing significant economic reform is often challenging and can face political hurdles or unforeseen consequences. The pace and effectiveness of these reforms are key unknowns. Global Economic Environment: The global economic picture remains complex, with potential risks from inflation, interest rate policies in major economies, and geopolitical tensions. These external factors can significantly impact export-reliant economies like South Korea. Structural Issues: South Korea faces long-term structural challenges, such as demographic shifts (aging population, low birth rate) and high household debt. Addressing these requires sustained effort beyond election cycles. Export Dependence: The South Korean economy is heavily reliant on exports, particularly in sectors like semiconductors and electronics. Global demand fluctuations can introduce volatility regardless of domestic policy. The UBS outlook suggests that while the initial reaction is positive, investors should remain mindful of these underlying risks and avoid getting carried away by short-term optimism. Potential Challenges for Sustained Economic Reform Achieving meaningful and sustained economic reform is a complex undertaking. The new government faces the challenge of translating campaign promises into concrete policies that deliver tangible results. Some potential challenges include: Political Opposition: Implementing significant reforms often requires navigating a potentially divided political landscape, which can slow down or dilute proposed changes. Economic Headwinds: External factors like a global economic slowdown or supply chain disruptions can complicate reform efforts and impact their effectiveness. Social Impact: Some reforms, while necessary for long-term growth, may have short-term negative impacts on certain sectors or populations, requiring careful management and social safety nets. The success of the post-election reform agenda will depend on the government’s ability to effectively address these challenges while maintaining political stability. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers For those monitoring the Forex market , especially regarding the Korean won , the current situation offers a nuanced picture. Here are some points to consider: Monitor Policy Implementation: Pay close attention to the specific policies introduced by the new government and their progress. This will provide a clearer indication of the likelihood and impact of economic reform . Track Global Trends: Keep an eye on the global economic environment, particularly demand for South Korean exports and monetary policy developments in major economies. Consider the UBS Outlook: While not the only perspective, the cautious UBS outlook serves as a reminder to evaluate the potential risks and challenges alongside the opportunities. Observe Capital Flows: Track foreign investment trends into South Korea, as this can significantly influence the won’s value. Understanding the interplay between political developments, economic policy, and global factors is key to interpreting the won’s future trajectory. Conclusion: Balancing Optimism and Caution The post-election gain in the Korean won reflects genuine optimism surrounding the prospects of economic reform in South Korea. The market’s initial reaction is a vote of confidence in the stability provided by the election outcome and the potential for policies that could enhance the nation’s economic health. However, the cautious UBS outlook serves as an important reminder that the path forward is not without its challenges. Translating reform promises into reality requires effective governance and navigating a complex global environment. Investors and market watchers should balance the current positive sentiment with a realistic assessment of the potential headwinds. The true test for the Korean won will be the sustained effort and success in implementing the promised reforms and navigating the broader economic landscape.

Reports suggest that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has set an ambitious internal target: reaching a staggering $50 billion in crypto AUM (Assets Under Management) by the year 2030. This isn’t just a minor goal; it signals a potentially massive shift in institutional crypto adoption and positions BlackRock to become a dominant crypto asset manager. What Does BlackRock’s $50B Crypto AUM Target Mean? This reported target, initially shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, indicates BlackRock’s serious long-term commitment to the cryptocurrency space. For a company managing trillions across traditional asset classes, $50 billion specifically in digital assets by 2030 is a significant allocation and projection of growth. It suggests several key implications: Increased Institutional Confidence: A target of this magnitude from a firm like BlackRock validates the growing legitimacy of cryptocurrencies as an asset class for large-scale investors. Market Impact: Achieving this goal would likely involve substantial inflows into various digital assets, potentially impacting market capitalization and liquidity. Strategic Priority: It highlights that digital assets are not just a speculative side project for BlackRock but a core part of their future growth strategy. Competitive Landscape: This target sets a high bar for other traditional financial institutions looking to enter or expand their presence in the crypto asset management sector. Achieving $50 billion in crypto AUM within the next six years requires significant effort in product development, regulatory navigation, and client education. It underscores the belief within BlackRock that demand for digital asset exposure among their vast client base will continue to grow substantially. Why is BlackRock Focused on Institutional Crypto? BlackRock’s move into institutional crypto is a natural evolution driven by several factors. Their clients, including pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds, are increasingly asking about exposure to digital assets. As fiduciaries, these institutions require regulated, secure, and familiar investment vehicles. This is where BlackRock’s expertise comes into play. Their launch of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF in the U.S. was a monumental step, quickly attracting billions in inflows and becoming one of the fastest-growing ETFs ever. This success likely reinforced BlackRock’s confidence in the market demand for easily accessible crypto exposure. The $50 billion target suggests they anticipate similar demand not just for Bitcoin, but potentially other digital assets as well, as regulatory clarity improves and investment products evolve. Furthermore, diversifying into digital assets allows BlackRock to offer new opportunities to its clients and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly changing financial landscape. They are leveraging their brand reputation, distribution network, and regulatory experience to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto market. Becoming the Leading Crypto Asset Manager: What it Takes BlackRock’s aspiration to be the world’s largest crypto asset manager by 2030 is a bold declaration. Currently, several firms specialize purely in digital assets or have significant crypto AUM. However, none possess the scale, global reach, and existing client base of BlackRock. To achieve this leadership position, BlackRock will need to: Expand Product Offerings: Beyond Bitcoin ETFs, they may need to offer products tracking other cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum, if regulations allow), diversified crypto funds, or even services related to tokenization and blockchain technology. Navigate Regulation: The regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving globally. BlackRock will need to work closely with regulators in various jurisdictions to launch and manage compliant products. Build Infrastructure: Managing billions in crypto requires robust security, custody solutions, trading infrastructure, and operational processes tailored to the unique nature of digital assets. Educate Clients: A significant portion of BlackRock’s traditional client base may still be unfamiliar or hesitant about crypto. Extensive education and clear communication will be crucial. Compete Effectively: The crypto asset management space is becoming increasingly competitive, with both crypto-native firms and other traditional players vying for market share. Their existing infrastructure and relationships within traditional finance give them a significant advantage, but the nuances of the digital asset market present unique challenges. The Role of Digital Assets in BlackRock’s Future The $50 billion goal highlights the strategic importance of digital assets within BlackRock’s long-term vision. It’s not just about offering a single Bitcoin product; it’s about integrating this new asset class into their broader investment strategies and platforms. This could involve: Portfolio Diversification: Offering digital assets as a tool for clients to diversify traditional portfolios. Technological Innovation: Exploring the underlying blockchain technology for potential applications in areas like tokenized securities or fund administration. Market Leadership: Setting standards and best practices for institutional participation in the crypto market. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, has previously spoken positively about the potential of digital assets and blockchain technology, particularly highlighting Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ and the potential for tokenization to revolutionize financial markets. This top-level endorsement provides the strategic impetus for pursuing such an ambitious AUM target. Challenges on the Path to $50B Crypto AUM While the target is ambitious, the path is not without obstacles. BlackRock faces several challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Rules surrounding various cryptocurrencies and crypto-related products remain unclear in many parts of the world. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its price swings, which can be a concern for risk-averse institutional investors. Security Risks: Custody and security of digital assets require specialized expertise and technology to prevent hacks and theft. Competition: Both established crypto firms and other large asset managers are also developing crypto offerings. Public Perception: Despite growing adoption, negative perceptions related to scams, illicit use, and environmental concerns still exist for some digital assets. BlackRock’s ability to navigate these challenges will be crucial to achieving their $50 billion crypto AUM goal and solidifying their position as a leading crypto asset manager. Actionable Insights: What This Means for You Whether you’re an individual investor, a financial advisor, or simply interested in the crypto space, BlackRock’s goal has implications: For Investors: Increased institutional participation through firms like BlackRock could lead to more stable markets and provide more regulated ways to access digital assets. However, understand the risks associated with volatility. For the Crypto Market: Large inflows from institutional players can provide significant liquidity and validation, potentially driving further innovation and adoption. For Traditional Finance: This move signals that ignoring digital assets is no longer an option for major financial institutions. Expect more traditional firms to follow suit. For Developers and Projects: As institutional interest grows, there may be increased demand for robust, secure, and compliant blockchain protocols and applications. Keep an eye on BlackRock’s future product launches and public statements regarding digital assets. Their actions will likely be a significant indicator of institutional sentiment and market direction over the coming years. Conclusion: A Landmark Goal for Institutional Crypto BlackRock’s reported $50 billion crypto AUM target by 2030 is a powerful statement about the future of finance. It underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets among the world’s largest investors and positions BlackRock at the forefront of this evolving landscape. While challenges remain, this ambitious goal from the world’s largest asset manager highlights the immense potential they see in the crypto market and their determination to become a leading player in the institutional crypto space. The journey to $50 billion will be watched closely by everyone in both traditional and digital finance, potentially shaping the future of how assets are managed and invested globally.

The reason behind this is to help fuel Facebook’s parent company’s efforts to expand its artificial intelligence, the company said on Thursday, June 12. Giant tech companies like Meta are making unprecedented power deals to lock in sizable amounts of electricity for data centers required to build AI, a leading driver of record US power consumption forecast in 2025 and 2026. Tech firms opt for Geothermal energy to power their data centers amid rising demand for AI Geothermal energy, which does not create climate-warming carbon emissions , has become an electricity source among major tech companies. These tech firms have goals aimed at reducing emissions. Unlike traditional geothermal power generation, advanced geothermal power generation is not dependent on natural water sources. Technology companies with AI and data centers use geothermal energy more frequently because it offers a steady, dependable, low-carbon power source. This is important since data centers that support AI require a lot of electricity. The project between XGS and Meta will be rolled out in phases and is expected to be up and running by the decade’s end. The geothermal electricity generated will go into the electric grid and help power Meta’s operations in New Mexico. In a statement, Urvi Parekh, Global Head of Energy at Meta, highlighted that next-generation geothermal technologies like XGS are ready to expand. According to Parekh, this is essential as it would make geothermal energy an important resource for supporting advancements in AI technology and building data centers at home. She further stated that they were thrilled to work with XGS to create a new type of energy supply for their activities in New Mexico. Interestingly, New Mexico, which has a stake in the largest shale oil basin in the world, holds 160,000 megawatts of unused geothermal energy potential. Although 150 megawatts is a small part of the many gigawatts that tech companies need for AI, it still accounts for about 4% of all geothermal energy produced in the US. Google also announced last year that it planned to power its data centers with advanced geothermal energy created by Fervo Energy. Google opt for Geothermal energy, a step closer to its goal of running entirely on clean energy Like Meta, Google struck a deal with Berkshire Hathaway electric utility NV Energy to provide its Nevada data centers with cutting-edge geothermal energy. As a result, according to reliable sources, Fervo Energy teamed up with NV Energy to provide geothermal energy for Google’s data centers. The deal was first sent to state utility regulators for approval. According to a statement from Google, the deal would boost the total of carbon-free geothermal electricity sent into the local power grid for the company’s consumption to 115 megawatts from 3.5 megawatts within roughly six years, The collaboration took Google closer to its goal of running entirely on clean energy by 2030. The company said it will invest at least $4 billion to construct or expand data centers in Indiana, Missouri, and Virginia. According to the latest environmental report from Google, the company’s worldwide operations use 64% carbon-free energy from sources like wind and solar. Their partnership with NV Energy offered a fresh solution for companies with huge electricity needs and climate goals in regulated power markets. In these regulated markets, businesses must buy power from local utilities instead of directly from power producers. This can make it hard for companies that want to use only clean energy.

The firm acquired another 38 Bitcoin, pushing its total holdings to a notable 138 BTC. This action highlights a growing trend among companies: integrating cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin , into their corporate treasury strategies. What Drives DDC Enterprise’s Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? DDC Enterprise isn’t just buying Bitcoin on a whim; their acquisitions are part of a stated, deliberate corporate Bitcoin strategy . According to a Business Wire press release from the company, this isn’t their first foray into the asset class, and they have a clear long-term vision. Their goal is ambitious: to become a leading global corporate holder of Bitcoin. This suggests that these acquisitions are not merely speculative but are foundational to their financial planning and market positioning. Why might a company like DDC Enterprise pursue such a strategy? Several factors typically motivate firms to add Bitcoin to their treasury: Inflation Hedge: In times of economic uncertainty or rising inflation, companies seek assets that can preserve purchasing power. Bitcoin’s fixed supply is often cited as a key characteristic making it a potential hedge against currency devaluation. Store of Value: Similar to gold, Bitcoin is viewed by proponents as a digital store of value, offering a decentralized alternative to traditional assets. Potential Appreciation: The volatile nature of Bitcoin also presents opportunities for significant capital appreciation, as evidenced by the 22% yield increase DDC Enterprise reported since its last purchase. While risky, the potential for growth is a clear draw. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s balance sheet, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing innovative technologies like Bitcoin can align with a company’s brand as being modern and adaptable. For DDC Enterprise, this strategic direction appears to be paying off in the short term, with the reported yield increase validating part of their investment thesis. Examining the Growth of DDC Enterprise’s Bitcoin Treasury The latest acquisition brings DDC Enterprise’s Bitcoin treasury holdings to 138 BTC. This represents a substantial increase from their previous reported total (which would have been 100 BTC before this purchase). Tracking the growth of these holdings is key to understanding the company’s commitment to its strategy. Let’s look at the numbers: DDC Enterprise Bitcoin Holdings Snapshot: Event Bitcoin Acquired Total Holdings Prior to Latest Purchase N/A 100 BTC Latest Purchase 38 BTC 138 BTC This consistent accumulation, coupled with the positive yield reported, reinforces the company’s belief in Bitcoin as a viable treasury asset. Their explicit goal of becoming a leading global corporate holder indicates that further acquisitions are likely part of their long-term plan. This commitment from DDC Enterprise provides another data point in the broader narrative of institutional adoption. Why Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is Gaining Momentum DDC Enterprise is not operating in a vacuum. The trend of companies and large institutions adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, often referred to as Institutional Bitcoin Adoption , has been steadily growing over the past few years. While still a relatively small percentage of the total corporate landscape, the number of firms holding Bitcoin has increased, and their combined holdings are significant. Prominent examples include: MicroStrategy: A pioneer in this space, holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin and actively pursuing an acquisition strategy. Tesla: Added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, though its position has fluctuated. Block (formerly Square): Holds Bitcoin as part of its treasury and offers Bitcoin services through its Cash App. Coinbase: As a cryptocurrency exchange, holding Bitcoin is integral to its business model. This increasing participation from publicly traded companies and private institutions lends credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class and introduces it to a wider investor base. Factors contributing to this momentum include: Maturing market infrastructure (custody solutions, trading platforms). Increased regulatory clarity (though still evolving in many jurisdictions). Growing understanding of Bitcoin’s technology and economic principles. The global macroeconomic environment driving a search for alternative assets. DDC Enterprise’s actions align perfectly with this broader trend, showcasing how companies beyond traditional finance are exploring and implementing Bitcoin into their financial operations. Considering the Benefits and Challenges of Holding Bitcoin in a Corporate Treasury While the potential upsides are attractive, integrating Bitcoin into a corporate treasury comes with unique challenges and risks that companies must carefully manage. It’s not a decision to be taken lightly. Potential Benefits: Potential for High Returns: As DDC Enterprise experienced, Bitcoin can offer significant price appreciation. Inflation Protection: Its limited supply can serve as a hedge against currency devaluation. Portfolio Diversification: Low correlation with traditional assets can reduce overall treasury risk. Accessibility and Liquidity: Bitcoin trades 24/7 on global markets. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger. Potential Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for dramatic price swings, which can impact balance sheet value significantly. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, posing potential compliance risks. Security and Custody: Safely storing Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure to prevent loss or theft. Accounting and Tax Treatment: The accounting rules for holding and transacting with crypto are complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may view corporate crypto holdings as risky or speculative. Operational Complexity: Managing crypto requires new systems, processes, and expertise. Companies like DDC Enterprise must navigate these complexities, implementing robust security measures, establishing clear accounting practices, and having a strong rationale to communicate to investors and the public. Looking Ahead: DDC Enterprise’s Vision and the Future of Corporate Bitcoin With 138 BTC in its treasury and a stated goal to become a leading global corporate holder, DDC Enterprise is clearly committed to its long-term vision for corporate Bitcoin integration. This move could serve as an example for other e-commerce or non-traditional finance companies considering similar strategies. For companies exploring this path, actionable insights include: Thorough Research: Understand Bitcoin’s technology, market dynamics, and risks. Define Clear Objectives: Why are you adding Bitcoin?

In other words, put options offering downside protection became the most expensive relative to calls in three months. The demand for put also pushed the 30-day and 60-day skews into the negative territory. Traders typically buy put options when seeking to hedge their long positions in the spot or futures market, or to profit from an expected price decline. Bitcoin's price fell to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $103,150, extending 24-hour losses to 4.59%, according to CoinDesk data. Prices briefly topped the $110,000 mark early this week. The bulls might be hoping for the 50-day SMA to hold, as a potential decline below it could entice more sellers, as observed after the support broke down in February. The per-barrel price of WTI crude surged over 6% to $74.30 per barrel, reaching the highest since Feb 3, and extending the weekly gain to 13%, according to data source TradingView. The move happened after Israel conducted airstrikes on Iran, supposedly drawing retaliatory missile action from Tehran. Inflationary impulse Sudden oil price spikes tend to generate an inflationary impulse worldwide and the latest one could do so while President Donald Trump's trade war threatens to upend the economy and inject inflation, particularly in net-importer countries.

For those tracking the cryptocurrency landscape, understanding these broader macroeconomic and geopolitical shifts is crucial, as they influence liquidity, risk appetite, and overall market sentiment. Recently, reports suggesting the U.S. might be reconsidering aspects of the AUKUS security pact have coincided with observations from institutions like Deutsche Bank pointing to a weakening US Dollar. Let’s explore this connection and what it could mean for the financial environment. Understanding US Dollar Weakness in the Current Climate The US Dollar (USD) holds a dominant position in global trade and finance. Its strength or weakness is a key indicator watched by investors worldwide. Recently, the dollar has shown signs of softening against several major currencies. While numerous factors influence currency movements—including interest rates, inflation, economic growth data, and trade balances—geopolitical developments also play a significant role. Several elements contribute to current US Dollar Weakness : Interest Rate Expectations: Shifts in anticipation regarding Federal Reserve rate cuts can pressure the dollar. Inflation Outlook: Changing views on inflation’s trajectory affect purchasing power and currency value. Economic Performance: Relative economic growth compared to other nations impacts investment flows. Geopolitical Stability: Uncertainty stemming from international relations can lead investors to seek safer assets or divest from those perceived as linked to potential instability. It is within this complex backdrop that reports linking dollar performance to specific geopolitical shifts gain traction. What is the AUKUS Pact and Why Does it Matter? The AUKUS Pact is a trilateral security agreement between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Announced in September 2021, its primary goal is to deepen defense and security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. A cornerstone of the pact is the agreement for the U.S. and UK to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines, a complex and long-term endeavor. Key aspects of the AUKUS Pact include: Technology Sharing: Focus on advanced defense capabilities beyond submarines, such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cyber warfare. Regional Security: Aimed at counterbalancing growing influence and ensuring stability in a strategically vital area. Long-Term Commitment: Represents a multi-decade commitment involving significant financial investment and technological transfer among the three nations. Why would potential changes or reconsideration of such a pact affect the dollar? Security alliances and international commitments are often viewed through an economic lens. They can imply long-term spending, strategic priorities, and the perceived stability and reliability of the involved nations. Any sign of wavering commitment or significant alteration could be interpreted by markets as a shift in strategic focus or even a sign of internal political or economic pressures within the U.S. Connecting Geopolitical Factors to Currency Markets The link between Geopolitical Factors and currency valuations is well-established. Currencies represent the economic strength and political stability of a nation. When geopolitical tensions rise or major international agreements face uncertainty, investors may adjust their positions based on perceived risk. Here is how Geopolitical Factors can influence currencies: Risk Sentiment: Increased uncertainty often leads to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, where investors move capital out of assets perceived as risky and into traditional safe havens. While the USD often acts as a safe haven, uncertainty directly involving the U.S. could potentially diminish this appeal temporarily or affect confidence in its long-term economic trajectory tied to strategic goals. Capital Flows: Geopolitical events can trigger rapid movements of capital across borders, impacting demand for a currency. Trade and Investment: Long-term security pacts like AUKUS are intertwined with trade routes, economic partnerships, and investment climates in a region. Changes could signal shifts in these areas. Political Stability Perception: Reconsidering a major pact could be seen by some as reflecting internal political challenges or shifting priorities, impacting confidence in governance and economic predictability. The observation from Deutsche Bank suggests that market participants are specifically considering the AUKUS situation as one among several Geopolitical Factors currently influencing the dollar’s performance. Analyzing Forex Market Trends Amidst Uncertainty The Forex (Foreign Exchange) market is the largest and most liquid financial market globally, with trillions of dollars traded daily. Forex Market Trends are shaped by the confluence of economic data, central bank policies, and, significantly, geopolitical events. The current environment is marked by considerable uncertainty on multiple fronts. Current Forex Market Trends show volatility: Major currency pairs are reacting sensitively to inflation reports and central bank commentary. Emerging market currencies are influenced by global risk appetite and commodity prices. Safe-haven currencies like the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc often see inflows during periods of global stress, though their appeal can also be challenged by specific regional risks. When a major player like the U.S. faces questions about its strategic commitments, it adds another layer of complexity to forecasting Forex Market Trends . Traders and institutions must weigh the potential economic implications of altered alliances or defense spending against other economic indicators. Potential Currency Market Impact and Future Outlook What could be the potential Currency Market Impact if the U.S. genuinely reconsiders or significantly alters its role in AUKUS? It is important to note that the exact nature and extent of any reconsideration are not fully clear, and market reactions are based on speculation and perceived implications. Possible Currency Market Impact scenarios: Reduced Confidence: If the move is seen as a retreat from key alliances or a sign of domestic political instability affecting foreign policy, it could reduce international confidence in the U.S. economy and its currency. Shift in Strategic Spending: Altering defense commitments could imply changes in long-term government spending, potentially affecting fiscal outlooks. Regional Realignment: Uncertainty around AUKUS could prompt allies and rivals in the Indo-Pacific to reassess their own strategic and economic alignments, leading to broader shifts in capital flows. Impact on Allies’ Currencies: The Australian Dollar (AUD) and British Pound (GBP) are directly linked to AUKUS. Uncertainty could also impact their values, creating volatility in pairs like AUD/USD and GBP/USD. The future outlook for the dollar remains subject to a mix of domestic economic performance and international developments. While the AUKUS situation is just one piece of the puzzle, its mention by a major institution like Deutsche Bank highlights how interconnected geopolitics and currency markets are. Actionable Insights for Market Participants For investors, particularly those navigating volatile markets like cryptocurrency, understanding these macro shifts is key. While there is no direct, immediate link between AUKUS news and the price of Bitcoin, the weakening of the world’s reserve currency due to geopolitical factors is a significant event that influences the broader financial ecosystem. Stay Informed: Monitor geopolitical developments alongside economic data releases. News related to major alliances, international trade agreements, and political stability can move markets. Assess Risk: Understand how geopolitical uncertainty adds to overall market risk. This can influence decisions regarding portfolio allocation. Diversification: Consider how currency movements affect the value of international assets. Diversification across different asset classes and geographies can help mitigate risks associated with single-currency exposure. Long-Term View: While short-term market reactions to news can be sharp, evaluate the potential long-term implications of geopolitical shifts on global economic structures and currency roles. The observed link between potential AUKUS reconsideration and US Dollar Weakness underscores the importance of a holistic view of the financial landscape. Conclusion The report linking the recent US Dollar Weakness to the possibility of the U.S. reconsidering the AUKUS Pact highlights the profound influence of Geopolitical Factors on global finance. While economic fundamentals remain primary drivers of Forex Market Trends , major security alliances and international commitments are clearly on the radar of institutions analyzing Currency Market Impact . As the situation evolves, market participants will continue to weigh these complex interactions, reminding us that the stability of a nation’s currency is often tied not just to its balance sheet, but also to its position and reliability on the world stage. Staying attuned to these dynamics is essential for navigating the uncertainties of today’s interconnected markets.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, all major cryptocurrencies are down due to market uncertainty as a result of an Israeli attack on Iran. Early Friday Hong Kong time, Israel's military conducted multiple airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, sending the price of BTC and ETH plunging. Despite this recent volatility, ETH is still up nearly 40% over the last three months, according to CoinMarketCap , beating the CoinDesk 20 index and bitcoin BTC. One theme that market observers are tracking is investors' appetite for risk, and they might be looking at ETH's rally not just because of the recent infrastructure upgrades but rather as a proxy for how willing they are to invest in altcoins. Ethereum's recent outperformance against bitcoin holds significance because ETH often acts as a leading indicator for capital flows into the wider altcoin complex, Charmaine Tam, Head of OTC, Hex Trust, said in a note to CoinDesk. ""As investors become more comfortable venturing beyond BTC, altcoins offering compelling narratives and liquidity stand to benefit,"" Tam said. ""Ethereum's performance often serves as an early indicator of these broader capital shifts."" The recent surge in ETH dominance, from around 7 percent to nearly 10 percent, has coincided with a measurable drop in BTC dominance, which fell 2 to 3 percentage points from recent highs, Tam wrote in the note. That divergence suggests traders are beginning to look past bitcoin ETFs and monetary hedging narratives, instead eyeing newer sectors like DeFi, modular infrastructure, and decentralized AI. On-chain flows and total value locked (TVL) data support the trend, with assets like Pendle, Bittensor, and Hyperliquid showing strong inflows while Ethereum Layer 2 activity continues to climb. The significant institutional interest further supports Ethereum's recent strength, particularly with spot ETH ETFs attracting over $1.25 billion since mid-May, Tam said. As long as institutional interest remains robust and ETH maintains its position as the anchor for liquidity in emerging ecosystems, the foundation for a sustained altcoin rally becomes increasingly solid, according to Tam. Let's see if this market move has legs. MAS' Offshore Exchange Ban Was a Long Time Coming Last week, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) put the final nail in the coffin for firms using the city-state as a paper base while operating entirely overseas. In a June 6 update, MAS confirmed that digital token service providers (DTSPs) serving only foreign clients will need to be licensed starting June 30, and Bitget, Bybit, and other exchanges like WazirX are shutting down operations in the Lion City. To anyone paying attention, this was inevitable. MAS has been telegraphing this move since at least 2023 , as CoinDesk wrote at the time. That year, the regulator concluded public consultations stemming from the 2022 Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA), stating clearly that companies offering crypto services to clients abroad, even if they had no Singaporean customers, would fall under its regulatory umbrella. If an entity is registered in Singapore, MAS wants oversight. This could stem from the fact that the regulator's two previous largest headaches—Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs—had little connection to the country aside from an address. Both now bankrupt firms were technically domiciled in Singapore, but their physical presence was negligible. Terraform Labs famously operated from rented co-working spaces with no significant local operations, while Three Arrows was already quietly relocating its operational base to Dubai even before its spectacular collapse (although the Emirate's regulator told CoinDesk then that the fund never registered in the territory). At the time, MAS found itself in an unenviable position: bearing reputational damage from these high-profile disasters yet having minimal real-world oversight of the companies behind them (eventually, the fund's founders were given a multi-year trading ban in Singapore). While there hasn't been any official confirmation, the recent updates to the FSMA and MAS's latest moves could be tied to these episodes. The new requirement leaves virtually no room for regulatory arbitrage: if companies wish to use Singapore’s respected name, they must submit fully to its regulatory oversight. This closure marks a significant step in a broader global shift towards tighter crypto oversight. Quranium Debuts Quantum-Safe Wallet as Industry Braces for Quantum Threats Quranium, the team behind a quantum-secure Layer 1 blockchain, has launched QSafe Wallet, a crypto wallet built to withstand the looming threat of quantum computing. Designed with post-quantum encryption in mind, the wallet aims to future-proof digital asset storage before quantum threats can compromise today’s cryptographic standards. QSafe is built using SLHDSA and ML-KEM, two algorithms selected by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for their post-quantum resilience. It supports Bitcoin, Solana, EVM-compatible chains, and Quranium’s native chain. Unlike most wallets still using ECDSA and SHA-256, QSafe encrypts backups and signs transactions with quantum-resistant tools by default. The threat is no longer purely hypothetical. Cryptography researchers estimate that breaking ECDSA would require around 1,500 logical qubits. While current quantum systems remain well below that threshold, development is accelerating. “QSafe isn’t just reacting to the quantum threat, it’s architected to withstand it,” Dhiman said. “You don’t hire a security guard after the theft has happened. You hire one to prevent it. QSafe is designed to protect your assets before quantum threats ever reach your keys.” Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin is down 4.7% and trading at $103.3K due to geopolitical tensions from a recent Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities in Tehran. ETH: ETH remains under pressure within a descending channel after repeated rejections at $2,770, culminating in a sharp sell-off to $2,694, even as institutional demand holds firm with U.S. spot ETFs recording 18 consecutive days of inflows, including over $240 million on June 11. Gold: Gold surged over 3% to $3,426.95, hitting a one-week high as Middle East tensions and soft U.S. data boosted expectations of Fed rate cuts. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell Friday after Israel launched a military strike on Iran’s nuclear program, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 1.28% and the Topix losing 1.22%. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.38% to close at 6,045.26 on Thursday, driven by a 13% surge in Oracle shares after strong earnings and bullish cloud growth guidance lifted tech sector sentiment.

Currency fluctuations, particularly involving major pairs like USD/CAD , can signal shifts in global economic sentiment that eventually ripple through various asset classes, including digital currencies. Recently, a notable BofA forecast has emerged regarding this key pair, suggesting a cautious outlook for the Canadian Dollar . Let’s delve into what Bank of America’s strategists are saying and what it implies for the Forex market . Decoding the USD/CAD Pair: A Quick Look The USD/CAD currency pair represents the exchange rate between the United States Dollar (USD) and the Canadian Dollar (CAD). It indicates how many Canadian Dollars are needed to purchase one US Dollar. As one of the most actively traded pairs, it is significantly influenced by factors affecting both economies, including: Monetary Policy: Decisions by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada (BoC) on interest rates and quantitative easing. Commodity Prices: Canada is a major exporter of commodities, especially oil. Changes in oil prices often impact the value of the Loonie . Economic Data: Employment reports, inflation figures, GDP growth, and trade balances in both countries. Geopolitical Events: Global risk sentiment can drive flows into or out of the respective currencies. Why the Caution? Analyzing the Canadian Dollar ‘s Outlook Bank of America’s strategists, including تحلیل Du, have expressed caution regarding the potential for significant upside in the Canadian Dollar against the US Dollar. Their core view is articulated clearly: “We do not see USD/CAD below 1.30.” This statement is significant because a move below 1.30 would indicate a strengthening CAD relative to the USD. By stating they don’t anticipate this, BofA is essentially forecasting a floor around the 1.30 level, implying that the path of least resistance for the pair might be sideways or even upwards (a weaker CAD). This cautious stance on the Loonie likely stems from a combination of factors. While specific details from the BofA analysis were not fully provided in the initial snippet, typical reasons for such a view could include: Monetary Policy Divergence: Expectations that the Federal Reserve might maintain higher interest rates for longer compared to the Bank of Canada, making the USD more attractive to yield-seeking investors. Economic Growth Differentials: Concerns that the Canadian economy might face headwinds or grow at a slower pace than the US economy. Commodity Price Sensitivity: While oil prices have seen volatility, persistent concerns about global demand or supply dynamics could weigh on the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar . Market Positioning: Existing market sentiment or positioning might favor the USD, making a significant breakthrough below 1.30 challenging without a strong catalyst. Navigating the Forex Market : Implications of the 1.30 Threshold For participants in the Forex market , BofA’s view that USD/CAD will not sustainably trade below 1.30 provides a potential anchor point for strategies. The 1.30 level acts as a psychological and technical support area. If the market accepts this BofA forecast , it suggests that attempts to push the pair lower might be met with buying interest around that level. This perspective has several implications: For Traders Looking to Buy CAD: Those betting on a stronger Canadian Dollar might need to reconsider their targets or look for strong catalysts that could challenge BofA’s view. The path below 1.30 is seen as blocked. For Traders Looking to Buy USD: Those betting on a stronger US Dollar (or weaker CAD) might see rallies towards 1.35 or higher as more probable than declines below 1.30, aligning with the cautious Loonie outlook. For Risk Management: Traders using 1.30 as a potential stop-loss or take-profit level should be aware of this prominent bank’s view. It could influence how the market reacts around that price point. What Drives This Specific BofA Forecast ? While the snippet is brief, a major institution like Bank of America bases its forecasts on extensive research. Their view on USD/CAD likely incorporates analysis of: Detailed economic models for both the US and Canada. Projections for inflation and employment in both nations. Anticipated actions by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada. Analysis of global demand and supply dynamics for key Canadian exports like oil. Assessment of investor sentiment and capital flows. The specific mention of not seeing the pair below 1.30 suggests a strong conviction based on their internal models and expectations for these underlying drivers. It implies that, in their assessment, the factors supporting the US Dollar’s strength relative to the Canadian Dollar are expected to persist or outweigh factors that would strengthen the Loonie significantly. Actionable Insights for Traders: Responding to the USD/CAD Forecast Given this BofA forecast , how might a trader approach the Forex market , specifically the USD/CAD pair? Here are some considerations: Identify Key Levels: Recognize 1.30 as a significant potential support level according to BofA. Also, identify potential resistance levels above the current price. Watch Economic Data: Pay close attention to economic releases from both the US and Canada. Strong US data or weak Canadian data could reinforce BofA’s view, while the opposite could challenge it. Monitor Central Bank Commentary: Statements from the Fed and BoC officials regarding future monetary policy intentions are crucial. Any hawkish surprises from the BoC or dovish surprises from the Fed could shift the dynamics. Observe Oil Prices: Given the CAD’s link to commodities, significant moves in oil prices warrant attention. However, BofA’s view suggests that even favorable commodity prices might not be enough to push USD/CAD sustainably below 1.30 in their estimation. Consider Alternative Scenarios: While BofA has a clear view, the Forex market is unpredictable. Think about what kind of events (e.g., a major shift in global risk sentiment, unexpected policy moves) could cause USD/CAD to break below 1.30 despite this forecast. Manage Risk: Always use appropriate risk management techniques, such as setting stop-losses, regardless of expert forecasts. No forecast is guaranteed. Potential Challenges to the BofA Forecast While a major bank’s forecast carries weight, it’s important to remember that markets are dynamic. What could potentially challenge BofA’s view that USD/CAD stays above 1.30? A faster pace of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve than currently anticipated. Unexpected strength in the Canadian economy, leading the Bank of Canada to become more hawkish. A significant and sustained rally in commodity prices, particularly oil. A broad weakening of the US Dollar due to global factors or a shift in risk appetite favoring non-USD assets. Geopolitical developments that disproportionately benefit the Canadian Dollar . These factors represent potential catalysts that traders should monitor as they evaluate the validity and potential duration of BofA’s cautious outlook on the Loonie . Conclusion: What Does This Mean for the Forex Market ? Bank of America’s clear stance that they do not foresee USD/CAD trading below 1.30 underscores a prevailing caution regarding the near-term upside potential of the Canadian Dollar against the US Dollar. This BofA forecast suggests that the 1.30 level could act as a significant floor, influencing trading strategies and risk assessments in the Forex market . While forecasts are not guarantees, the view from a major institution like BofA provides a key data point for traders and investors navigating the complexities of currency movements. Understanding the underlying reasons behind this outlook – likely related to monetary policy expectations, economic fundamentals, and commodity price sensitivity – is essential for anyone trading or investing in this pair. As always, market participants should combine expert analysis with their own research and risk management practices.

This marked the first time a publicly listed company had taken a position in the Hyperliquid protocol. Hyperliquid Gets Institutional Nod as Tony G Co-Investment Buys In According to the press release , the acquisition was executed through WonderFi Technologies, a Canadian digital asset platform. It comes amid Hyperliquid’s rise in market share and token value. From a price of $1 at launch in late 2024, $HYPE has surged to over $42 within a year. With this purchase, Tony G Co-Investment becomes the largest known $HYPE holder among publicly listed firms. “This acquisition reflects our strategic commitment to supporting digital infrastructure that is driving the next wave of innovation,” said Matt Zahab, CEO of Tony G Co-Investment Holdings. “Hyperliquid represents one of the most exciting developments in decentralized trading infrastructure.” he added. Zahab, who took over as CEO on June 8, brings marketing and media experience, including his role as host of the Cryptonews Podcast . He replaces Ron Akram, who stepped down as director earlier this month. Gediminas Klepackas, formerly interim CEO, has been named Chief Operating Officer. The firm made headlines in 2022 when it sold its stake in News 3.0, the parent company of Cryptonews.com, netting $2 million in crypto payments during a period when DeFi markets were reeling from the FTX collapse. The $HYPE acquisition draws parallels to another Tony G-backed venture, Sol Strategies . The publicly traded company began accumulating a large position in SOL in 2019 and has since become heavily invested in the Solana ecosystem. Tony G now serves as chairman and holds 36.8 percent of the company’s shares. In 2024, he helped secure a CA$10 million revolving credit facility , which contributed to a 12 percent surge in the company’s stock price on the announcement day. Under his leadership, Sol Strategies used the credit facility to expand its Solana holdings. Currently, the firm holds more than CA$48 million in crypto assets, primarily in SOL and SUI. Despite reporting a net loss of CA$4.8 million in the second quarter of 2025, the company saw its staking and validation revenue increases year over year, rising from just CA$67,000 to CA$2.54 million. While Hyperliquid does not belong to the Solana ecosystem, observers have begun to ask whether Tony G is applying the same strategy. With Sol Strategies focused on consolidating SOL, this latest move into $HYPE suggests a similar long-term vision, albeit on a different blockchain. $HYPE Rallies Toward $50 as Influencer Buzz and Listing Rumors Push Token Higher Hyperliquid’s trading volume reached $248 billion in May , an 843 percent increase compared to the same period last year.

A major initiative is underway that could see one of the world’s first large-scale corporate XRP Treasury funds established. Singapore-based Trident Digital Tech Holdings has announced ambitious plans to raise up to $500 million specifically for this purpose. This isn’t just about buying digital tokens; it’s a strategic maneuver aimed at integrating deeply with the Ripple ecosystem and exploring new frontiers in digital asset management. What is a Corporate XRP Treasury and Why is it Significant? Traditionally, corporate treasuries manage a company’s financial assets, focusing on liquidity, capital preservation, and investment returns, typically using fiat currencies and traditional instruments. A corporate XRP Treasury , however, signifies a strategic allocation of company funds into the digital asset XRP. The significance of Trident Digital’s plan lies in its scale and specific focus. While some companies hold Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets, a dedicated $500 million fund explicitly for XRP, designed for active participation like staking and ecosystem collaboration, represents a pioneering approach. It signals a growing institutional interest not just in holding digital assets but in leveraging their unique functionalities within specific blockchain networks like Ripple’s. Diving Deeper into Trident Digital ‘s Ambitious Plan The entity behind this initiative is Trident Digital Tech Holdings, headquartered in Singapore, a jurisdiction increasingly known as a hub for fintech and digital asset innovation. Their proposal to raise up to $500 million is substantial and points towards a serious long-term commitment to the XRP ledger and the broader digital asset market. According to reports, the raised capital will be allocated primarily to three key areas: Acquiring XRP Tokens: Building a significant reserve of XRP as the foundational asset of the treasury. Deploying Staking Mechanisms: Participating in activities that can potentially generate yield on the acquired XRP, such as through delegation or other validation processes if applicable to future XRP Ledger developments or related networks. Collaborating within the Ripple Ecosystem: Engaging with projects, platforms, and initiatives built on or connected to the Ripple network, potentially exploring use cases like payments, tokenization, or DeFi. This multi-faceted approach suggests that Trident Digital views XRP not just as a speculative asset but as a utility-rich digital currency with potential for active yield generation and strategic partnerships within its native environment. Exploring the Potential of This Large-Scale XRP Investment Why would a firm undertake such a significant XRP investment ? The rationale likely involves several factors: Belief in XRP’s Utility: XRP was designed for fast, low-cost global payments, a utility that continues to be relevant in an increasingly connected world. Ripple’s Network and Partnerships: Ripple Labs has established numerous partnerships with financial institutions and payment providers globally, creating a network effect that could benefit XRP. Potential for Yield: While native XRP Ledger staking is different from proof-of-stake, opportunities exist through related platforms or future protocol upgrades that could allow the treasury to earn passive income. Market Position: Acquiring a large volume of XRP could position Trident Digital as a significant holder and participant in the ecosystem. However, like any large-scale digital asset holding, this XRP investment comes with inherent risks, including market volatility, regulatory uncertainty surrounding XRP’s classification in various jurisdictions, and technical risks associated with digital asset management. How Does This Initiative Impact the Broader Ripple Ecosystem ? A $500 million fund dedicated to acquiring XRP and engaging with the Ripple ecosystem could have several positive implications: Increased Liquidity: A large treasury actively participating could add significant liquidity to the XRP market. Potential for New Use Cases: Trident Digital’s collaboration within the ecosystem could lead to the development or adoption of new applications leveraging the XRP Ledger. Institutional Validation: A substantial commitment like this from a firm like Trident Digital lends further credibility to the XRP Ledger and its associated technologies in the eyes of other potential institutional players. Support for Development: Engagement and potential investment in ecosystem projects could foster innovation and growth within the Ripple network. The Ripple ecosystem is constantly evolving, with developments in areas like On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), and tokenization. A large, dedicated fund could accelerate participation and development in these areas. Understanding the Trend: Why Companies Are Building a Crypto Treasury Trident Digital’s plan is part of a broader trend where companies are exploring or actively building a crypto treasury . While Bitcoin has been the most common asset for corporate treasuries (e.g., MicroStrategy), firms are starting to look at other digital assets for diversification, specific utility, or yield opportunities. The motivations for holding a crypto treasury can vary: Motivation Description Relevance to XRP Treasury Inflation Hedge Holding scarce digital assets to potentially preserve value against inflation. Less direct for XRP compared to Bitcoin, but still a potential diversification play. Investment/Growth Allocating capital to digital assets with high growth potential. Primary driver for a fund like Trident Digital’s. Utility/Operations Using the digital asset for specific business operations (e.g., payments, accessing services). Highly relevant for XRP, designed for payments and ecosystem interaction. Yield Generation Earning returns through staking, lending, or other DeFi activities. Explicit goal for Trident Digital’s plan. Balance Sheet Diversification Adding a new asset class uncorrelated with traditional assets. A common benefit of holding digital assets. Building a crypto treasury requires careful consideration of custody solutions, accounting treatment, tax implications, and regulatory compliance – complex factors that Trident Digital will need to navigate. What Are the Key Considerations and Challenges Ahead? While the announcement is exciting, the plan is scheduled to roll out in the second half of 2025. This timeline is subject to significant external factors: Market Conditions: The overall state of the cryptocurrency market will heavily influence the feasibility and strategy of acquiring $500 million worth of XRP. Regulatory Conditions: The regulatory landscape for XRP and digital assets is still evolving globally. Clarity and favorable regulations, particularly in key markets, will be crucial. The ongoing legal status of XRP in the United States remains a significant factor. Funding Success: Trident Digital must successfully raise the $500 million from investors. Potential challenges include: Executing large-scale XRP acquisitions without causing significant market impact. Implementing secure and efficient staking or yield-generating strategies. Navigating the technical and legal complexities of active participation in the Ripple ecosystem. Managing volatility and potential drawdowns in the value of the treasury assets. Compelling Summary Trident Digital’s plan to launch a $500 million corporate XRP Treasury marks a significant step for both the company and the broader digital asset space. It highlights growing institutional confidence in specific digital assets like XRP and the potential for corporate treasuries to move beyond traditional fiat holdings. By focusing on acquisition, staking, and active participation in the Ripple ecosystem , Trident Digital aims to create a dynamic crypto treasury that not only holds value but also generates yield and fosters innovation. While the initiative faces market and regulatory hurdles ahead of its planned H2 2025 rollout, its successful execution could serve as a blueprint for future large-scale XRP investment and corporate engagement with blockchain networks.

Crypto lending platform Maple Finance has announced a strategic partnership with Lido , the leading liquid staking provider. This collaboration introduces a novel offering: stablecoin credit lines specifically designed for institutions, collateralized by stETH , Lido’s popular liquid staking token. This move is a direct response to the growing demand from institutional players who hold staked Ethereum (ETH) but require access to flexible capital without disrupting their staking positions. By leveraging stETH , institutions can now unlock liquidity from their staked assets, offering a compelling alternative to traditional financing or the need to unstake their ETH, which would mean losing staking rewards and potentially facing unbonding periods. Understanding the Core: What is stETH and Why Does it Matter for Institutions? Before diving into the specifics of the Maple-Lido partnership, it’s essential to understand stETH and the concept of liquid staking. When users stake ETH on the Ethereum network (specifically for the Beacon Chain and now the fully operational proof-of-stake chain), their ETH becomes locked. While locked, it earns staking rewards, contributing to network security. However, accessing that capital requires ‘unstaking,’ which can involve waiting periods. Liquid staking protocols like Lido solve this by issuing a liquid token, like stETH , to represent the staked ETH plus earned rewards. Holders of stETH can trade it, transfer it, or use it in other DeFi protocols while their underlying ETH remains staked and earning rewards. This ‘liquidity’ is incredibly valuable, especially for institutions that need the flexibility to manage their capital actively. For institutions, holding large amounts of staked ETH represents a significant asset on their balance sheet. However, if that capital is locked, it limits their ability to use it for operational expenses, trading strategies, or other investment opportunities. stETH provides a way to retain the staking yield while also having an asset that *can* be used elsewhere in the crypto ecosystem. This is where the demand for Crypto Lending solutions collateralized by stETH arises. Maple Finance and Lido: A Powerful Partnership for Institutional DeFi The collaboration between Maple Finance and Lido is a natural fit. Lido is the dominant player in the liquid staking space, with a large amount of staked ETH represented by stETH . Maple Finance specializes in providing undercollateralized and overcollateralized Crypto Lending solutions, particularly tailored for institutional and corporate borrowers. Their platform allows for curated lending pools managed by experienced credit delegates. This partnership leverages the strengths of both protocols: Lido’s stETH: Provides the high-quality, yield-bearing collateral asset that institutions already hold. Maple Finance’s Infrastructure: Offers the regulated, compliant framework and lending pool structure needed to provide credit lines to institutions. The new credit lines will allow verified institutional borrowers on Maple Finance to deposit their stETH as collateral and borrow stablecoins like USDC. This means an institution can keep its ETH staked via Lido, continue earning staking yield on its stETH holdings, and simultaneously access stablecoin liquidity for its operational or trading needs. What are the Benefits of stETH-Backed Crypto Lending for Institutions? This new offering presents several compelling advantages for institutional participants in the crypto market: 1. Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Institutions no longer face the dilemma of choosing between staking yield and liquidity. They can have both. By using stETH as collateral, their staked ETH remains productive while they access necessary capital. 2. Continued Staking Yield: Borrowers continue to earn the underlying ETH staking rewards on the stETH they’ve deposited as collateral. This yield can potentially offset some of the borrowing costs, making the credit line more attractive. 3. Access to Stablecoin Liquidity: Stablecoins like USDC are crucial for various activities, including paying expenses, executing trading strategies, or managing short-term liabilities. These credit lines provide a direct, efficient way to obtain this liquidity using a major crypto asset they already hold. 4. Participation in Institutional DeFi: This product is a prime example of how Institutional DeFi is evolving to meet specific, sophisticated financial needs. It allows institutions to engage with decentralized finance protocols in a structured, familiar way (a credit line). 5. Mitigation of Opportunity Cost: Without this option, institutions needing liquidity might have to unstake ETH (losing yield and facing delays) or sell assets. Using a stETH -backed credit line avoids these opportunity costs. 6. Flexible Funding: Credit lines offer flexibility compared to term loans. Institutions can draw funds as needed up to their limit and repay when convenient, providing better treasury management capabilities. Exploring Potential Challenges and Risks While the benefits are significant, it’s crucial to consider the potential challenges and risks associated with Crypto Lending, especially when using liquid staking tokens as collateral: 1. stETH Depeg Risk: Although stETH is designed to trade close to the price of ETH, it is not a 1:1 peg maintained by an oracle. Market conditions can cause stETH to trade at a discount or premium to ETH. A significant depeg downwards could impact the collateral value and potentially lead to liquidation risks. 2. Liquidation Risk: Like any collateralized loan, if the value of the deposited stETH falls below a certain threshold relative to the borrowed stablecoins, the collateral could be liquidated to cover the loan. Market volatility in the price of ETH (and thus stETH ) is a primary driver of this risk. 3. Smart Contract Risk: Both Maple Finance and Lido operate on smart contracts. While audited, smart contracts are not immune to bugs or exploits, which could potentially affect the deposited collateral or the lending pool. 4. Protocol Risk: Beyond smart contracts, there’s risk associated with the governance and operation of the Maple Finance and Lido protocols themselves. Changes in protocol parameters or unforeseen issues could arise. 5. Credit Delegate Risk (on Maple): Maple’s model relies on Credit Delegates who manage the lending pools and assess borrower creditworthiness. While institutions are involved, the performance of the pool depends on the delegate’s decisions and the overall health of the borrower portfolio. 6. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for Crypto Lending and Institutional DeFi is still evolving. Future regulations could impact the viability or structure of such offerings. Institutions considering these credit lines must perform thorough due diligence on the risks, the specific terms of the lending pool on Maple Finance , and the stability of the stETH peg. How the stETH-Backed Credit Line Mechanism Works While the specifics of each lending pool on Maple Finance can vary, the general mechanism for these stETH -backed credit lines works as follows: Borrower Qualification: An institution undergoes a vetting process by a Credit Delegate on the Maple Finance platform to be approved as a borrower. Pool Access: The institution accesses a specific lending pool on Maple Finance designed for stETH collateral. These pools are funded by lenders (potentially other institutions or accredited investors). Collateral Deposit: The institution deposits a certain amount of stETH into the smart contract managing the lending pool as collateral. Credit Line Access: Based on the value of the deposited stETH and the pool’s collateralization ratio requirements (e.g., 120-150%), the institution is granted access to a stablecoin credit line. Drawing Funds: The institution can draw stablecoins (like USDC) from the credit line up to the approved limit. Interest Accrual: Interest accrues on the drawn amount based on the terms of the lending pool. The institution continues to earn staking rewards on their deposited stETH during this time. Monitoring and Liquidation: The value of the stETH collateral is continuously monitored relative to the outstanding stablecoin debt. If the collateralization ratio falls below a liquidation threshold, a portion of the stETH collateral may be automatically sold on the market to repay the stablecoin debt and restore the ratio. Repayment: The institution repays the borrowed stablecoins plus accrued interest. Collateral Withdrawal: Once the loan is fully repaid, the institution can withdraw their deposited stETH . This structured approach, facilitated by Maple Finance ‘s institutional focus and Lido ‘s dominant stETH asset, provides a robust framework for Crypto Lending within the Institutional DeFi space. The Growing Landscape of Institutional DeFi and Liquid Staking The partnership between Maple Finance and Lido is not happening in a vacuum. It’s indicative of a broader trend: institutions are increasingly comfortable exploring and utilizing decentralized finance primitives, provided they meet certain standards of compliance, security, and risk management. Liquid staking, particularly through established players like Lido and assets like stETH , has become a cornerstone of institutional crypto strategies due to its combination of yield and potential liquidity. This development validates the demand for financial products built around liquid staking tokens. It signals that institutions are moving beyond simply holding or staking crypto to actively using these assets within DeFi protocols for sophisticated financial operations like obtaining leverage or managing working capital. The success of these stETH -backed credit lines on Maple Finance could pave the way for similar offerings using other liquid staking derivatives or other yield-bearing assets, further expanding the possibilities within Institutional DeFi and Crypto Lending. Key Takeaways for Readers Maple Finance and Lido have launched stablecoin credit lines for institutions using stETH as collateral. This allows institutions holding staked ETH (via stETH ) to access liquidity without unstaking, preserving staking yield. The offering enhances capital efficiency and provides flexible stablecoin access for institutional operations and trading. It represents a significant step forward for Institutional DeFi, adapting decentralized protocols for traditional financial needs. Potential risks include stETH depeg, liquidation risk, and smart contract vulnerabilities, requiring careful due diligence. The partnership highlights the increasing importance of liquid staking assets like stETH in enabling sophisticated Crypto Lending strategies for large players. Conclusion The collaboration between Maple Finance and Lido to offer stETH -backed stablecoin credit lines for institutions is a landmark event in the evolution of Institutional DeFi. By providing a compliant and structured way for institutions to leverage their liquid staked ETH holdings, this partnership unlocks significant capital efficiency and flexibility. It underscores the growing maturity of the decentralized finance space and its increasing ability to cater to the complex requirements of traditional financial players.

Tron Sharpe Ratio Is Still Significantly Below Overheating Zone In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst has talked about the latest trend in the Sharpe Ratio of Tron. The “Sharpe Ratio” refers to an indicator that compares the returns of an asset against the risk associated with it. The numerator in the ratio, the ‘returns’ portion, is defined as the difference between the average return of the coin and the risk-free return (that is, the theoretical return involved with an asset carrying zero risk) over a given period. The denominator, the ‘risk’ part, is the asset’s standard deviation of returns over the same window (in other words, its volatility). Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the cryptocurrency is printing returns that outweigh its risk. On the other hand, it being under the threshold suggests the asset’s performance has been lackluster compared to its volatility. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Tron Sharpe Ratio over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Tron Sharpe Ratio fell below the 1 level earlier, but its value has since returned above the mark. According to the quant, the metric being above the level has historically accompanied bullish price action. An extremely high value, however, has proven to be an overheating signal, with the asset tending to arrive at a top. “Whenever the Adjusted Sharpe Ratio climbs above 40, it often signals a market that’s overheating,” explains the analyst. “In the past, readings over 40 have lined up well with local tops.” So far since its return above 1, the Tron Sharpe Ratio has only managed to reach a high of 8.3, which is clearly significantly below this cutoff. This trend could mean that TRX hasn’t been too overheated. “With TRX’s Sharpe Ratio still far from historical peaks, the data suggests there’s plenty of upside room for a potential bull run in 2025,” says the quant. It now remains to be seen how the coin will develop in the near future, given this pattern. Related Reading: Ethereum To $3,400?

This collaboration focused on achieving crosschain delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement, a critical function for the future of digital assets and asset tokenization. What Happened: The Chainlink, JPMorgan, and Ondo Finance Collaboration The core of this groundbreaking test involved settling a transaction across two distinct networks: a permissioned network representing traditional finance infrastructure (JPMorgan’s Kinexys Digital Payments) and a public testnet representing decentralized finance (Ondo Chain testnet). The goal was to demonstrate that assets and payments could be exchanged simultaneously and securely between these disparate environments. This wasn’t just a theoretical exercise. It was a practical demonstration of how tokenized assets, potentially held on a public blockchain or a DeFi-centric network like Ondo Chain, could be exchanged for tokenized payments or stablecoins residing on a permissioned, institutional-grade network like Kinexys, all in a single, atomic transaction. Why is Crosschain DvP Important? Delivery versus Payment (DvP) is a standard settlement mechanism in traditional financial markets. It ensures that the delivery of securities (like stocks or bonds) only occurs if the corresponding payment is received, and vice-versa. This eliminates settlement risk, which is the risk that one party delivers their asset but does not receive the payment, or vice versa. In the world of blockchain and tokenized assets, enabling DvP settlement across different networks (crosschain) is crucial for several reasons: Risk Reduction: Eliminates the need for trust between parties settling on different chains. No party is exposed to the risk of losing their asset or payment without receiving the other side of the trade. Increased Efficiency: Automates the settlement process, potentially reducing time and costs compared to traditional methods which often involve multiple intermediaries and manual steps. Enabling Liquidity: Allows assets residing on one chain to be easily and safely traded for payments or assets on another chain, improving overall market liquidity. Supporting Asset Tokenization: Provides a secure and reliable method for settling trades of tokenized real-world assets (like real estate, equities, or bonds) against digital currencies or stablecoins held on different platforms. JPMorgan’s Role: Kinexys and Traditional Finance Integration JPMorgan, a global leader in financial services, is actively exploring the potential of blockchain technology through initiatives like Onyx and its Kinexys platform. Kinexys Digital Payments represents JPMorgan’s infrastructure for wholesale payments using distributed ledger technology. Their participation in this test highlights the growing interest from major financial institutions in leveraging blockchain for core functions like payments and settlements. JPMorgan’s involvement underscores the critical need for interoperability between the highly regulated, permissioned environments favored by traditional finance and the more open, public blockchain networks where many digital assets and potential innovations reside. This test shows a practical pathway for bridging this gap, allowing institutional liquidity and assets within systems like Kinexys to interact safely with the broader digital asset ecosystem. Ondo Finance: Bridging the Gap with DeFi and Asset Tokenization Ondo Finance is a key player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, particularly focused on bringing traditional financial assets and structures onto the blockchain. They specialize in creating tokenized financial products, aiming to bridge the gap between institutional finance and DeFi protocols. The Ondo Chain testnet served as the public network in this collaboration, representing the environment where tokenized assets could potentially reside. Ondo Finance’s participation is vital as they represent the side of the equation focused on creating and managing tokenized assets and interacting with public blockchain infrastructure. Their expertise in tokenization and DeFi protocols complements JPMorgan’s traditional finance strength, making this a powerful partnership for demonstrating the potential of crosschain settlements for tokenized real-world assets. Chainlink’s Contribution: Powering Interoperability At the heart of enabling the communication and coordination between JPMorgan’s permissioned Kinexys network and the Ondo Chain testnet was Chainlink’s technology. Specifically, the test utilized Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) and its Runtime Environment (CRE). Chainlink CCIP is designed to provide a secure and reliable way for applications and token transfers to move across different blockchain networks. The Runtime Environment allows for complex computations and logic to be executed off-chain in a verifiable manner, which is crucial for coordinating actions like a DvP settlement across disparate systems that cannot directly communicate. Chainlink acted as the crucial middleware, enabling the atomic swap logic – ensuring that the ‘delivery’ on one network and the ‘payment’ on the other network happened simultaneously or not at all. This capability is fundamental for building robust crosschain financial applications and is a core reason why Chainlink is seen as vital infrastructure for the future of finance. Benefits of This Breakthrough This successful test opens the door to numerous potential benefits for the financial industry and the broader digital asset ecosystem: Enhanced Efficiency: Streamlines settlement processes, reducing time from days to potentially minutes or seconds. Reduced Counterparty Risk: The atomic nature of DvP eliminates the risk of one party failing to deliver after the other has performed their part. Increased Liquidity: Makes it easier to trade assets across different platforms and networks, boosting market depth. New Financial Products: Enables the creation of innovative financial instruments and markets involving tokenized assets settled crosschain. Improved Capital Utilization: Faster settlement frees up capital that would otherwise be tied up in lengthy settlement cycles. Bridging TradFi and DeFi: Provides a practical blueprint for how traditional financial institutions can safely interact with public blockchain networks and tokenized assets. Challenges and the Road Ahead While this test is a significant success, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges remain before crosschain DvP settlement becomes commonplace in mainstream finance. These include: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets and crosschain transactions is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Scalability: Ensuring these systems can handle the volume and speed required for global financial markets. Security: Maintaining high levels of security when interacting across different network architectures. Standardization: Developing common standards and protocols for tokenized assets and crosschain communication. Integration Complexity: Integrating these new technologies with existing legacy financial systems. Despite these hurdles, the successful collaboration between Chainlink, JPMorgan, and Ondo Finance demonstrates that the core technological challenges of crosschain DvP are being addressed. This test moves the industry closer to a future where tokenized assets can be freely and safely exchanged across diverse digital platforms. What Does This Mean for Asset Tokenization? Asset tokenization, the process of issuing digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of real-world assets, is widely seen as a major trend for the coming years. However, for tokenization to reach its full potential, the ability to trade and settle these tokenized assets efficiently and securely is paramount. The Chainlink, JPMorgan, and Ondo Finance test is a crucial piece of the puzzle for asset tokenization. By demonstrating secure crosschain DvP, they are building the necessary infrastructure layer that allows tokenized assets held on one type of network (e.g., a public chain for liquidity and transparency) to be seamlessly settled against payments or other assets on a different type of network (e.g., a permissioned network for institutional control and privacy). This unlocks the potential for a much wider range of participants and assets to enter the tokenized ecosystem. Summary: A Glimpse into the Future of Finance The successful crosschain DvP settlement test involving Chainlink, JPMorgan, and Ondo Finance is more than just a technical achievement; it’s a powerful proof of concept for the future of finance. By effectively bridging a traditional finance network with a public testnet using Chainlink’s interoperability solutions, these entities have demonstrated a viable path for secure, efficient, and risk-mitigated settlement of digital assets across different blockchain environments. This collaboration significantly advances the capabilities required for widespread asset tokenization and paves the way for a more interconnected and efficient global financial system.

A significant stride in this evolution is the recent launch of Morpho V2 , the latest iteration of the innovative crypto lending protocol. What Makes Morpho V2 a Game Changer for Crypto Lending? Morpho has always aimed to optimize capital efficiency in lending markets. With Morpho V2 , the protocol takes a monumental leap forward, particularly addressing the sophisticated needs of institutional participants and advanced DeFi users. Announced via their official channels, V2 introduces several key features designed to redefine the lending landscape: Intent-Based Architecture: Moving beyond traditional order books or fixed pool mechanics, V2 utilizes an intent-based system. This allows lenders and borrowers to express their specific desired terms. Customizable Loan Terms: A major highlight is the ability to negotiate and establish fixed-rate, fixed-term loans with highly customizable parameters. This is a stark contrast to the variable rates and open-ended terms typical of many existing DeFi protocols. Off-Pool Liquidity Structures: V2 enables direct, peer-to-peer (P2P) matching between specific lenders and borrowers, facilitating large, bespoke transactions without relying solely on the shared liquidity pools of integrated protocols like Aave or Compound (which Morpho historically optimized). Cross-Chain Functionality: Expanding beyond a single blockchain, V2 introduces capabilities for cross-chain lending , allowing users to interact and transact across different networks, significantly increasing market reach and flexibility. These features collectively position Morpho V2 as a protocol capable of handling more complex and tailored financial arrangements, bridging the gap between traditional finance expectations and decentralized possibilities. Why is Customizable Terms Lending Crucial for Institutional DeFi? While retail users have embraced the flexibility of variable-rate, open-term DeFi loans , institutional players often require the predictability and structure found in traditional finance. Fixed rates and fixed terms provide certainty regarding interest payments and repayment schedules, which is essential for balance sheet management, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance. Furthermore, the ability to customize terms allows institutions to negotiate specific loan-to-value ratios, collateral types, and liquidation parameters that align with their internal risk frameworks. This level of control and predictability offered by Morpho V2 is a significant draw for institutions looking to engage with decentralized finance in a structured manner. How Does Off-Pool Liquidity Enhance Efficiency? Traditional DeFi lending protocols aggregate liquidity into large pools. While efficient for small, standardized transactions, this can present challenges for large, specific deals. Morpho V2 ‘s off-pool or peer-to-peer matching mechanism allows for direct negotiation and execution between two parties. This direct approach can lead to: Potentially better rates negotiated directly between parties. Execution of large trades that might otherwise cause significant price impact in a pool. Greater privacy for specific, large-scale transactions. Tailored collateral arrangements outside of standard pool parameters. This architecture complements the existing pool optimization features, offering a dual approach to crypto lending on the Morpho protocol. Exploring the Potential of Cross-Chain Lending with Morpho V2 The fragmented nature of the blockchain ecosystem is a major hurdle for seamless interaction and liquidity flow. Cross-chain lending capabilities in Morpho V2 aim to break down these silos. Imagine a scenario where a user holds assets on Ethereum but wants to borrow against them to deploy capital on a different chain, say Polygon or Arbitrum, without having to bridge assets first (which can incur costs and risks). V2’s architecture is designed to facilitate such interactions, potentially unlocking vast amounts of previously isolated liquidity and creating a more interconnected DeFi landscape. This feature is particularly exciting for institutional DeFi strategies that might involve managing assets and positions across multiple networks. Addressing the Demands of Institutional DeFi Participants The stated goal of Morpho V2 is clearly aligned with attracting and serving institutional participants. These entities require robust infrastructure, predictable terms, efficient execution for large volumes, and increasingly, the ability to operate across different blockchain environments. By offering customizable, fixed-term DeFi loans and efficient off-pool liquidity, Morpho is building the necessary rails for institutions to confidently enter and scale their activities within the decentralized space. This could lead to significant growth in total value locked (TVL) and trading volume on the protocol, further maturing the DeFi ecosystem as a whole. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the features of Morpho V2 are promising, launching such a sophisticated protocol is not without its challenges. Ensuring robust security for cross-chain interactions, managing the complexity of customizable terms in a decentralized environment, and achieving widespread adoption among diverse institutional players will be key hurdles to overcome. The success of V2 will depend on user experience, integration with other DeFi primitives, and continued innovation in addressing the unique requirements of its target audience. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward for Crypto Lending The launch of Morpho V2 represents a significant evolutionary step for the crypto lending sector and the broader institutional DeFi movement. By introducing an intent-based system, customizable fixed-term loans, off-pool liquidity, and cross-chain lending capabilities, Morpho is directly addressing the needs of sophisticated users and institutions seeking greater predictability, efficiency, and flexibility in decentralized finance. This could pave the way for larger capital inflows and more complex financial strategies to be executed on-chain, pushing DeFi closer to mainstream institutional adoption.

In a new joint filing, both Ripple and the SEC have asked a Manhattan District Court to lift an existing order against Ripple and release $125 million currently held in an escrow account. Here’s what they’re proposing: Out of the $125 million, $50 million would be paid to the SEC as a penalty, while the remaining amount would be returned to Ripple. This move is part of a bigger effort to settle their nearly five-year legal fight, avoid more court appeals, and close this chapter for good. A Quick Recap of the Case: The case began in December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple, claiming the company had illegally sold XRP as an unregistered security. Over the years, the case saw several rulings, including a partial win for Ripple in July 2023. The court later ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million fine and placed an injunction on the company to stop it from violating securities laws. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The parties have renewed their request for an indicative ruling. pic.twitter.com/8uESP4eWa1 — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) June 12, 2025 Both sides filed appeals after the judgment, keeping the legal fight alive. However, recent talks between Ripple and the SEC led to a settlement agreement. To move forward with this, they need the court’s approval to dissolve the previous orders and distribute the escrowed money as agreed. Why the Change Now? The SEC and Ripple explained in their filing that “exceptional circumstances” now exist that make it reasonable to adjust the earlier court judgment. They argue that settling the case would save both government and company resources, avoid drawn-out appeals, and bring closure to a case that’s been closely followed by the crypto industry. On the flip side, the SEC has recently been closing several other crypto-related cases as it updates its approach to digital asset regulation. This move in the Ripple case fits into that trend. What’s Next? The court still needs to respond to this joint request. If the judge agrees, Ripple will pay $50 million to the SEC, keep the rest of the money, and both sides will drop their appeals — officially ending one of the highest-profile legal battles in the crypto world.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 02:39:08

For those invested in or simply curious about cryptocurrencies, recent statements from prominent political figures carry significant weight. A notable development involves former U.S. President Donald Trump and his remarks regarding the future of Trump crypto policy. What Did Trump Say About Trump Crypto? During the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, Donald Trump made a noteworthy declaration. He indicated that efforts would be directed towards establishing regulatory frameworks for the crypto market. The key takeaway from his statement was the emphasis on creating frameworks that are both clear and simple . This pledge is significant because the current regulatory environment in the United States is often perceived as fragmented and complex. Different agencies hold varying views and jurisdictions over different aspects of the crypto space, leading to uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. Trump’s stated goal is to simplify this landscape. His motivation, as articulated at the summit, is ambitious: to help America secure a dominant position in the future of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This suggests a strategic view where clear regulation is not seen as a hindrance, but rather as a tool to foster growth and innovation within the U.S., positioning it as a global leader in the digital asset space. Why Does Crypto Regulation Matter Now? The call for crypto regulation is not new, but it has gained increasing urgency. The cryptocurrency market has grown exponentially, attracting millions of participants and trillions of dollars in value. With this growth comes a greater need for structure and oversight to address various concerns: Investor Protection: Clear rules can help safeguard individuals from fraud, scams, and market manipulation. Market Integrity: Regulation can establish standards for exchanges and platforms, promoting fair and transparent trading. Financial Stability: As crypto becomes more interconnected with traditional finance, regulators are keen to understand and mitigate potential systemic risks. Innovation and Adoption: Ironically, clear rules can foster innovation by providing legal certainty for businesses, encouraging investment and development within the sector. Combating Illicit Activity: Regulation is crucial for preventing the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and other illegal purposes. The lack of a unified approach in the U.S. has led some companies to consider or move operations overseas, seeking clearer guidelines. This is the context in which Trump’s pledge for ‘clear and simple’ frameworks resonates with many in the industry. How Can US Crypto Policy Foster Dominance? The idea that US crypto policy can be a catalyst for global dominance might seem counterintuitive to those who view regulation purely as restrictive. However, a well-designed regulatory framework can provide several advantages: Attracting Capital: Institutional investors and large corporations often require regulatory clarity before committing significant capital to the crypto space. Clear rules can unlock vast pools of investment. Encouraging Talent and Businesses: Startups and established tech companies are more likely to build and operate in a jurisdiction where the rules of engagement are clear and predictable. Driving Innovation: Certainty allows innovators to focus on building new products and services rather than navigating legal ambiguities. Establishing Global Standards: By developing effective frameworks, the U.S. can influence how other countries approach crypto regulation, setting international benchmarks. Consumer Confidence: Increased trust and confidence among the general public, knowing there are safeguards in place, can accelerate mainstream adoption. Trump’s vision appears to be centered on leveraging these potential benefits. By providing a predictable legal and operational environment, the U.S. could become the preferred hub for crypto innovation, investment, and talent, thereby achieving a dominant position. What are the Challenges in Crafting Bitcoin Regulation? While the goal of clear and simple Bitcoin regulation (and crypto regulation generally) is widely supported by the industry, the path to achieving it is fraught with challenges. Crafting effective rules for a rapidly evolving, decentralized technology is inherently complex. Defining Assets: A fundamental challenge is classifying various digital assets. Are they securities, commodities, currencies, or something else entirely? Different classifications fall under the purview of different regulators (like the SEC or CFTC), leading to jurisdictional battles. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Regulators must find a delicate balance between protecting consumers and investors without stifling the very innovation that makes the technology promising. Overly strict rules could drive activity underground or overseas. Technological Complexity: Understanding the nuances of blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other emerging areas requires significant expertise from policymakers and regulators. Political Divisions: There are differing views on crypto regulation within the U.S. government, often along partisan lines, making it difficult to pass comprehensive legislation. Global Coordination: Crypto is a global phenomenon. U.S. regulation needs to consider international implications and ideally coordinate with other major economies to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Overcoming these hurdles requires collaboration between policymakers, regulators, and industry experts. The ‘simple’ aspect of Trump’s pledge is particularly challenging given the technical and legal complexities involved. Navigating the Future: Insights for the Crypto Market Frameworks The announcement from the Coinbase summit signals a potential shift in the political discourse around crypto, at least from one major political figure. For participants in the crypto market frameworks are a critical factor influencing future growth and stability. Key Takeaways and Insights: Political Attention is Growing: The fact that a former President is speaking about crypto regulation at a major industry event highlights the increasing political relevance of the sector. This suggests that crypto policy will likely be a topic in future elections and legislative discussions. Industry Advocacy is Impactful: Events like the Coinbase summit provide platforms for industry leaders to engage directly with policymakers and candidates, influencing their understanding and stance on crypto. Clarity is the Core Demand: Regardless of the specific rules, the industry’s primary request is for clarity and predictability. This enables long-term planning, investment, and growth. Dominance as a Policy Goal: Framing crypto regulation as a means to achieve U.S. dominance could resonate with a broader political audience, potentially building consensus for action. The Devil is in the Details: While the pledge for ‘clear and simple’ frameworks is positive on the surface, the actual impact will depend entirely on the specifics of any proposed or enacted legislation. For investors and businesses, staying informed about legislative proposals, regulatory actions from agencies like the SEC and CFTC, and the ongoing political debate will be crucial. The path to comprehensive, clear, and simple U.S. crypto regulation is likely to be a long and complex one, but Trump’s recent comments indicate that it remains a significant point of discussion at the highest levels. Summary: A Pledge for Clarity in the Digital Frontier Donald Trump’s recent statement at the Coinbase State of Crypto Summit marks a significant moment in the ongoing conversation about how the United States will regulate digital assets. By pledging to work towards clear and simple regulatory frameworks, he has aligned himself with a key demand of the crypto industry. The stated goal is ambitious: to leverage regulation not as a barrier, but as a pathway for America to dominate the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. While the challenges of crafting such frameworks are substantial, involving complex technical, legal, and political hurdles, the explicit mention of simplicity and global dominance as objectives highlights a potential strategic shift. The coming months and years will reveal whether this pledge translates into concrete policy that provides the certainty the industry craves, ultimately shaping America’s role in the global digital economy.

This isn’t just a simple wrapped token; Polygon is leveraging Wormhole’s innovative Native Token Transfers (NTT) framework to achieve this, a move poised to unlock new levels of Cross-chain Transfer capabilities and enhance overall Blockchain Interoperability . Understanding the Significance: Why Polygon POL on Solana Matters The Polygon POL token is the native asset of the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem, designed to power various functions across Polygon’s interconnected network of chains, including staking, governance, and transaction fees. Bringing this core asset natively to Solana is a strategic decision with several key implications: Expanding Reach: It allows POL holders and users on Solana to interact with the token within the Solana ecosystem. Unified Experience: Unlike traditional wrapped tokens which can suffer from liquidity fragmentation and loss of native properties, NTT aims to keep the token ‘native’ wherever it resides. Setting a Precedent: This deployment serves as a powerful example of how truly native cross-chain interactions can function, potentially paving the way for other assets. Historically, moving tokens between different blockchains has often involved ‘wrapping’ – creating a synthetic version of the token on the destination chain. While functional, this approach adds layers of complexity and potential points of failure. The NTT framework offers a more elegant solution. How Wormhole NTT Powers This Seamless Cross-chain Transfer At the heart of this integration is the Wormhole NTT framework. Wormhole is a leading interoperability protocol that facilitates communication and value transfer between various blockchains. The NTT framework is a specialized standard built on Wormhole that allows tokens to retain their ‘native’ characteristics even when transferred across chains. Think of it less like creating a copy and more like moving the original token’s representation. When a user transfers POL from Polygon to Solana using the NTT bridge, the tokens are locked on the source chain (Polygon), and an equivalent amount of ‘native’ POL is minted or unlocked on the destination chain (Solana). The key is that the token on Solana behaves like the original POL, maintaining its core functionalities and potentially benefiting from future upgrades or features of the original token contract. Key aspects of Wormhole NTT: Native Properties: Tokens transferred via NTT can potentially participate in staking, governance, and other chain-specific functions on the destination chain, assuming the necessary infrastructure is in place. Simplified Development: For developers, NTT provides a standardized way to handle cross-chain token logic. Enhanced Security: Leveraging Wormhole’s established security model for cross-chain messaging. This framework is crucial for realizing the vision of a truly interconnected blockchain ecosystem, where assets can flow freely and retain their utility regardless of the chain they reside on. The Impact on Solana and the Broader Ecosystem The arrival of Polygon POL on Solana via Wormhole NTT has exciting implications for both ecosystems and the wider world of DeFi and dApps. For Solana, it means: Increased Asset Diversity: Adding a major ecosystem token like POL directly to Solana provides users with more options. Potential for New dApp Integrations: Developers on Solana can now potentially integrate native POL into their applications, opening up new use cases. Boosting Cross-Chain Activity: This landmark integration encourages more users and projects to explore interactions between Polygon and Solana. For Polygon, it means expanding the utility and reach of its native token to one of the largest and most active blockchain networks outside of the EVM ecosystem. This cross-pollination of assets and users is vital for fostering a truly decentralized and interoperable Web3. This move significantly contributes to the ongoing effort to improve Blockchain Interoperability . As more protocols adopt standards like Wormhole NTT, the barriers between different blockchain networks will continue to dissolve, leading to a more fluid and user-friendly experience for everyone. Boosting Blockchain Interoperability: What Comes Next? The deployment of Polygon POL on Solana is more than just a technical achievement; it’s a statement about the future direction of blockchain technology. The demand for seamless Cross-chain Transfer is undeniable as users and developers operate across multiple networks to find the best performance, lowest costs, and most innovative applications. While exciting, the path to perfect interoperability isn’t without its challenges. Security remains paramount, as cross-chain bridges are often targets for exploits. The complexity of managing liquidity and state across multiple chains also requires robust technical solutions. However, the adoption of frameworks like Wormhole NTT by major players like Polygon and Solana signals a strong commitment to overcoming these hurdles. We can anticipate seeing more native assets making cross-chain journeys, enabling a future where a user might stake POL on Solana, use SOL in a Polygon-based DeFi protocol, or participate in governance for a protocol whose tokens live on several chains simultaneously. Actionable Insights for Users and Developers: Users: Keep an eye on wallets and dApps on Solana that begin to support native POL. Understand the process for transferring POL between Polygon and Solana using the Wormhole bridge when it goes live for users. Developers: Explore the Wormhole NTT documentation to understand how to integrate native cross-chain assets like POL into your Solana or Polygon applications. Consider how seamless cross-chain asset availability could enhance your dApp’s functionality and reach. Conclusion: A New Era for Polygon POL and Solana Polygon’s decision to bring its Polygon POL token to Solana using the Wormhole NTT framework marks a significant milestone. It’s a powerful demonstration of how technical innovation can break down blockchain silos, enabling truly native Cross-chain Transfer and pushing the boundaries of Blockchain Interoperability . This collaboration between two major ecosystems, facilitated by Wormhole, is a positive step towards a more connected, efficient, and user-friendly decentralized future.

Recently, the spotlight has been firmly on former U.S. President Donald Trump and his persistent views on the direction of monetary policy, particularly concerning the Federal Reserve and its leadership under Jerome Powell . For anyone tracking the pulse of the US economy and its potential ripple effects on global markets, including the fascinating world of cryptocurrencies, understanding this dynamic is crucial. Why Does Trump Fed Pressure Continue on Interest Rates ? Donald Trump has consistently voiced his opinion that the Federal Reserve should lower interest rates . His rationale often centers on stimulating economic growth, making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, and potentially reducing the cost of servicing the national debt. While president, he frequently criticized the Fed’s decisions, arguing that higher rates were hindering the economy and making the U.S. less competitive globally. Even out of office, this stance hasn’t changed. He continues to advocate for rate cuts, viewing them as a key lever to boost economic activity. His recent comments reiterated this long-held belief. He stated clearly his desire for lower rates, emphasizing that they are ‘needed’. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a direct expression of a policy preference that could have significant implications if he were to return to office. The call for rate cuts is often framed by Trump as a necessary step to unleash the full potential of the US economy , suggesting that current monetary policy is overly restrictive. What is the Role of the Federal Reserve and Jerome Powell ? The Federal Reserve , often called the Fed, serves as the central bank of the United States. Its primary mandates, set by Congress, are to promote maximum employment, stable prices (controlling inflation), and moderate long-term interest rates . The Fed achieves these goals primarily through setting the federal funds rate, which influences borrowing costs throughout the economy. A cornerstone of the Fed’s effectiveness is its independence from political pressure. This independence is intended to allow the Fed to make monetary policy decisions based purely on economic data and its mandates, rather than short-term political goals. Jerome Powell , as the current Chair, is the public face and key decision-maker (along with the Federal Open Market Committee – FOMC) for the Fed’s policies. Trump’s public calls for rate cuts, while not legally binding, are seen by many as an attempt to exert political pressure on an independent institution. During his presidency, this dynamic created tension, as the Fed under Powell continued to make decisions based on its assessment of economic conditions, sometimes in direct contrast to Trump’s wishes. How Do Interest Rates Impact the US Economy and Beyond? Changes in interest rates have profound effects on the US economy and, by extension, global markets, including asset classes like cryptocurrencies. Here’s a breakdown: Borrowing Costs: Lower rates make it cheaper for businesses to invest and expand, and for consumers to buy homes, cars, and other goods on credit. Higher rates do the opposite. Inflation: Lower rates can stimulate spending, potentially leading to higher inflation. Higher rates can cool down an overheated economy and help control price increases. Savings and Investment: Lower rates reduce returns on savings accounts and bonds, potentially pushing investors towards riskier assets in search of higher yields. Higher rates make saving more attractive and can draw money away from riskier investments. Currency Value: Interest rate differentials between countries can affect currency exchange rates, impacting trade. Asset Prices: Lower rates generally support higher valuations for stocks and real estate as future earnings are discounted at a lower rate. They can also make alternative assets like gold and potentially cryptocurrencies more appealing compared to traditional low-yield investments. For the crypto market, lower interest rates are often seen as a positive catalyst. When traditional investments offer low returns, and borrowing is cheap, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to riskier, high-growth potential assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, rising rates can increase the appeal of safer assets and increase the cost of capital, potentially leading to outflows from speculative markets. What’s Next in the Trump Fed Dynamic? Trump’s recent statement that he would ‘not fire’ Jerome Powell , while still insisting on rate cuts, is notable. During his presidency, there was speculation about whether he had the authority or the inclination to remove the Fed Chair, a move that would have been unprecedented and severely damaging to the Fed’s perceived independence. His current position suggests a focus on influencing policy rather than outright removing the head of the institution, though the pressure remains. The future of interest rates will depend on economic data – inflation, employment, and growth figures – and the Fed’s assessment of these factors. The Fed under Jerome Powell has indicated it will be guided by the data in deciding when and if to cut rates. Political commentary, while prominent, is officially external to the Fed’s decision-making process. The ongoing dialogue, or rather, the public difference in opinion between a former (and potentially future) president and the head of the central bank highlights the delicate balance between political leadership and monetary policy independence. Market watchers, particularly those in the crypto space, will continue to monitor these developments closely, as the direction of interest rates set by the Federal Reserve significantly influences the broader financial landscape and investor sentiment.

Meanwhile, XRP support levels between $2.10 and $2.15 have held firm, with traders eyeing a possible inverse head-and-shoulders rally setup. But while these top assets battle key chart levels and regulation delays, a new player is gaining momentum where it really counts, functionality. Meet Unstaked, a project flipping the script on AI crypto. With more than 1 billion tokens sold, a $0.1819 launch target, and a projected 3000x ROI, Unstaked is setting the stage for something big. If you’re searching for the best crypto coin to buy with real-world utility and massive upside, this could be your signal. Unstaked: AI Agents That Work, and Pay Unstaked isn’t just dropping a token, it’s launching a full-blown AI infrastructure for crypto users who want more than hype. Built around automated AI agents that run your social presence, manage community tasks, and log every interaction on-chain, the platform is giving regular users the tools big companies pay thousands for. And now, it’s offering early access at one of the most watched presale price points in the market. Currently in stage 20, Unstaked’s presale is priced at $0.011397. With over 1 billion tokens sold and nearly $9.7 million raised, this isn’t a low-effort launch. What’s driving interest is the simple value proposition, deploy AI agents that actually do work. These agents are fully customizable, run 24/7, and cost as little as $10–$25 per month. That’s pennies compared to the cost of a human support team. The project also rewards agent owners through performance-based $UNSD token incentives. All agent activity is logged on-chain, and rewards are tied directly to actual engagement. This turns Unstaked into more than a tool, it becomes a potential income stream. For users looking for the best crypto coin to buy, that combination of utility and upside is hard to beat. With a projected launch price of $0.1819, early buyers are looking at a possible 3000x ROI. If Unstaked sticks the landing post-launch and AI agents deliver results, this could be one of the few crypto platforms where the product, and not just the chart, generates real, compounding value. It might just be the best crypto coin to buy before AI goes mainstream in Web3. Cardano (ADA ETF approval) Could Change the Game All eyes are on Cardano (ADA ETF approval) after the SEC officially acknowledged Grayscale’s spot ETF application back in February 2025. The decision was recently delayed again, with a final deadline now set for October 22. Currently trading around $0.67, ADA still sits far below its all-time high of over $3. But if the ETF gets the green light, especially during a strong market upswing, analysts say a move to $1.20–$1.50 could play out fast. ETF approvals have shown real impact before. Bitcoin jumped from $45K to $65K after its ETF went live. Ethereum followed with a rally from $2,900 to nearly $4,100. If Cardano (ADA ETF approval) follows the same pattern, a surge back toward $2 isn’t out of reach. With institutional investors watching closely, this could be the turning point for ADA after years of sideways price action. Approval or not, the dates, July 15 and October 22, are now circled on every serious trader’s calendar. XRP Support Levels Hold Steady, But For How Long? XRP support levels between $2.10 and $2.15 have held strong over the past few sessions, giving traders a key range to work with. A bounce from this zone has already played out, but if XRP breaks below it, downside targets at $2.05 and even $2.00 could come into play. A dip under $2.00 might shift momentum fast, especially if broader market sentiment weakens. Technically, traders are watching a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern forming on the daily chart. For this bullish setup to play out, XRP needs to push through resistance zones at $2.33, $2.44, and the key golden pocket between $2.56 and $2.62. A confirmed move above that range could set up a strong push toward new highs. But as always, nothing is confirmed until price acts. While XRP support levels are doing their job for now, the next few weeks will reveal whether buyers are ready to drive the next leg up, or if profit-takers hit the brakes. Summing Up With Cardano (ADA ETF approval) likely coming to a head by October and XRP support levels holding firm above $2.10, both assets are at key turning points. Traders are watching closely, but the spotlight is starting to shift toward projects with real-world use cases. That’s where Unstaked is turning heads. With over 1 billion tokens sold, a 3000x ROI projected, and AI agents built for performance, not just automation, it’s hitting all the right marks. The current price in stage 20 is just $0.011397, making now the time to look closely. From agent-powered growth to real on-chain engagement rewards, Unstaked is showing why it could be the best crypto coin to buy before launch day. As crypto shifts from speculation to real utility, Unstaked is ready to lead. If you’re looking beyond charts and into what’s next, this might just be your move.

For companies selling software, one significant hurdle has always been the lengthy and repetitive process of convincing potential customers that their product meets stringent security and compliance standards. This isn’t just a minor step; it can add weeks, or even months, to a sales cycle. Imagine explaining your entire security posture repeatedly to dozens, sometimes hundreds, of different prospects. This is the challenge that Conveyor set out to solve using advanced AI automation . The Painful Reality of Vendor Security Reviews Before a company buys new software, especially for critical functions, they need assurance that it won’t introduce security risks. This leads to detailed vendor security reviews. Software vendors receive lengthy questionnaires covering everything from data encryption and access controls to compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Answering these questions accurately requires deep knowledge and significant time investment from security, compliance, and sales teams. Chas Ballew, co-founder of Aptible, a hosting platform for healthcare companies, experienced this pain firsthand. He saw his customers repeatedly explaining their security practices. “What we saw was that every time one of our customers was trying to close a deal, they would have to explain all of their security and compliance practices over and over again to their customer,” Ballew noted. This manual process wasn’t just slow; it was a major bottleneck delaying sales and even contract renewals. Recognizing this widespread inefficiency, Ballew founded Conveyor in 2021 with the mission to automate this specific, tedious workflow. Conveyor’s AI Automation Solution The timing for Conveyor was opportune. Shortly after its launch, OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, signaling a new era for AI capabilities. Conveyor quickly integrated this powerful technology to power its platform. The core idea is simple yet revolutionary: use AI to automatically complete those painful security questionnaires. Conveyor’s AI agent is trained on a company’s existing security documentation, policies, and previous questionnaire responses. When a new questionnaire arrives, the AI can analyze the questions and pull relevant, accurate information from the company’s knowledge base to generate responses. This significantly reduces the manual effort required. According to Conveyor, their AI agent can autonomously and accurately fill out over 90% of customer security questions. Think about the time savings! What used to take weeks of back-and-forth can now be completed in a fraction of the time, freeing up valuable security and sales resources. Why are companies embracing this? As Ballew puts it, the work is “very redundant and repetitive.” Companies “don’t feel it creates a ton of value, so they’re very happy for AI to fill out compliance forms.” It’s a perfect use case for AI automation – taking over tasks that humans find monotonous but are essential for doing business. Expanding Horizons: Revolutionizing RFP Automation Building on its success in automating security reviews, Conveyor is now tackling another time-consuming sales hurdle: Requests for Proposals (RFPs). RFPs are common, especially in large enterprise deals and public sector contracts. They require detailed responses covering not just security but also product features, pricing, implementation plans, and company background. The process of responding to RFPs is similar to security questionnaires in its repetitive nature, often pulling information from existing documents and requiring coordination across multiple departments. By applying their AI automation technology to RFPs, Conveyor aims to streamline this process as well. This expansion into RFP automation is a strategic move. It opens up Conveyor’s market beyond just tech companies focused on security compliance to a wider range of industries that frequently deal with RFPs. This broader appeal is expected to attract new customers and make the company more attractive to investors. Enterprise AI Adoption and Proven Success While some enterprises remain cautious about deploying new AI software, Conveyor’s value proposition is clear and tangible: saving time and accelerating revenue. This has led to rapid adoption among prominent companies. Conveyor proudly states it was the first AI vendor to be fully deployed in production environments at major companies like Zendesk, Atlassian, and Qualtrics. Their customer base also includes other well-known names such as Workday, Netflix, and Zapier, alongside over 400 other companies. This widespread adoption among large, security-conscious organizations demonstrates a significant level of trust in Conveyor’s technology and its ability to handle sensitive information securely while delivering tangible business benefits. It’s a strong signal for the growing acceptance of enterprise AI solutions for specific, high-value use cases. Fueling Growth Through Startup Funding The success in automating security reviews and the promising expansion into RFP automation have not gone unnoticed by the investment community. Conveyor recently secured a significant financial boost to fuel its continued growth. The startup announced a $20 million Series B funding round. This round was led by SignalFire, a prominent venture capital firm, with participation from Oregon Venture Fund and Cervin Ventures. This substantial injection of startup funding will enable Conveyor to further develop its AI capabilities, expand its product offerings (like RFP automation), hire more talent, and reach a wider customer base. This funding round validates Conveyor’s approach and its potential to become a leader in the sales and security automation space. It highlights investor confidence in the market need for AI-driven solutions that directly impact revenue cycles and operational efficiency. Addressing Challenges and Looking Ahead While the benefits of automating sensitive processes like security reviews and RFPs with AI are clear, it’s crucial to address the inherent challenges, particularly around data security and privacy. Companies are sharing highly confidential information about their internal security practices and business operations. Conveyor understands this critical concern. “We keep everything very secure, very isolated for each customer, which is very important,” Ballew emphasized. “Companies want to make sure that their confidential data is only used to process their information and it’s not exposed or mixed in with anyone else’s data.” Implementing robust guardrails and ensuring strict data isolation are non-negotiable for a platform handling such sensitive inputs. Conveyor isn’t the only company working in this area; competitors like Loopio, Responsive, and Rohirrim are also developing software for RFPs and security questions. However, Conveyor’s early focus on AI-powered automation for the security review piece, and its proven traction with major enterprises, position it strongly in the market. Conclusion: AI’s Impact on Business Efficiency Conveyor’s story is a compelling example of how specialized AI automation can solve real-world business problems that humans find tedious and time-consuming. By targeting the repetitive yet critical tasks of vendor security reviews and RFP responses, Conveyor is enabling sales teams to close deals faster and allowing security professionals to focus on higher-value work. Their success in securing significant startup funding and gaining traction with major enterprises underscores the growing demand for intelligent automation solutions that directly impact a company’s bottom line. As AI technology continues to advance, we can expect to see more applications like Conveyor that streamline complex business processes, ultimately making companies more efficient and agile.

Along with this, they’ve asked for the $125 million civil penalty currently held in escrow to be released. According to the proposal, $50 million would go to the SEC, while the remaining $75 million would be returned to Ripple. This move is part of both parties’ efforts to settle the long-running case, avoid further court battles, and close pending appeals. In their new court filing, both Ripple and the SEC argued that “exceptional circumstances” now exist that justify changing Judge Torres’s earlier decision. These include a settlement between the two sides, recent shifts in the SEC’s crypto policy, and a mutual desire to avoid dragging the case on any longer. Attorney Expresses Doubt However, this request comes just after Judge Torres denied a similar proposal in May. Legal expert Fred Rispoli shared his doubts about the new filing. He explained that the previous denial showed the judge was clearly frustrated and expected a stronger, more detailed motion this time. According to Rispoli, instead of addressing the SEC’s failures in regulating crypto and offering a sincere apology from Ripple, the new filing only briefly mentioned other case dismissals and a small note about the SEC’s crypto task force.

He called this one of the few missteps by Ripple’s legal team and warned that Judge Torres might once again reject it. Still, Rispoli remains hopeful that the judge might be ready to wrap up the case. Even if the injunction stays in place, Ripple can continue selling XRP to institutions, though not in the same way as before 2018. While some cautious firms might stay away, those open to innovation could still move forward.

A new report from Coinbase Research offers a compelling glimpse into what could drive the next major move for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. They’re setting their sights on the second half of 2025, predicting a significant Bitcoin rally fueled by a confluence of powerful economic and regulatory forces in the United States. What is Driving Coinbase Research’s Optimism for Bitcoin? The core of the Coinbase Research report points to several key factors converging in late 2025 that could create a highly favorable environment for Bitcoin. It’s not just one thing, but a combination of macro-economic shifts and structural improvements within the crypto landscape. According to their analysis, the primary catalysts include: Improved U.S. Economic Growth: A strengthening economy often correlates with increased investor confidence and willingness to allocate capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Expected Federal Reserve Rate Cuts: Lower interest rates typically make traditional savings less attractive and can push investors towards assets with higher growth potential. This can increase liquidity in the market, some of which may flow into Bitcoin. Progress on U.S. Crypto Regulation: Clarity from lawmakers removes uncertainty, potentially paving the way for broader institutional and corporate adoption. These elements, particularly the anticipated progress on US crypto regulation , are seen as significant tailwinds that could propel Bitcoin forward. How Will US Economic Growth Fuel the Crypto Market Outlook? A robust U.S. economy generally means higher employment, increased consumer spending, and stronger corporate profits. This environment often leads to a ‘risk-on’ sentiment among investors. When people feel more secure financially and see potential for growth, they are more likely to invest in assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Bitcoin, having matured significantly since its early days, is increasingly viewed by some as a digital store of value and a potential hedge against inflation, making it an attractive option in a growing economy. Furthermore, economic growth can boost the balance sheets of corporations and institutions, freeing up capital that could be allocated to new asset classes, including digital assets, further enhancing the positive crypto market outlook . The Impact of Fed Rate Cuts on Bitcoin Price Prediction Interest rates set by the Federal Reserve play a crucial role in the broader financial markets. When the Fed raises rates, it increases the cost of borrowing and can slow down the economy, often making safer assets like bonds more appealing relative to risk assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies. Conversely, when the Fed cuts rates, it lowers borrowing costs, stimulates economic activity, and can decrease the appeal of lower-yielding safe assets. This can lead investors to seek higher returns elsewhere, potentially driving capital into assets like Bitcoin. The expectation of rate cuts in 2025, as highlighted by Coinbase Research , is therefore a significant factor in their optimistic Bitcoin price prediction . Is US Crypto Regulation Finally Bringing Clarity? One of the biggest hurdles for mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially among large institutions, has been the lack of clear and consistent regulation in the United States. Uncertainty creates risk, making many traditional financial players hesitant to fully engage with the crypto space. Reports mentioning potential progress on legislation, such as the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts (though specifics and timelines can be complex and subject to change), signal a potential shift towards a more defined regulatory framework. Regulatory clarity can: Benefit of Regulatory Clarity Impact on Crypto Increased Investor Confidence Attracts both retail and institutional investors Reduced Legal Uncertainty Encourages businesses to build and operate in the crypto space Easier Integration with Traditional Finance Facilitates the creation of regulated products and services (like ETFs) Improved Market Integrity Helps combat illicit activity and scams, making the market safer This progress on US crypto regulation is a critical piece of the puzzle for the long-term growth and stability of the market, and a key reason behind Coinbase’s positive forecast. Beyond Macro: Corporate Adoption and Structural Tailwinds While macroeconomics and regulation are significant external drivers, the Coinbase Research report also points to structural shifts within the industry itself. There’s a growing trend of corporations exploring and adopting blockchain technology and digital assets for various use cases, from treasury management to supply chain finance. This increasing corporate adoption signals a maturing ecosystem and creates consistent demand. Furthermore, infrastructure for institutional participation (custody solutions, trading platforms, etc.) continues to improve, making it easier and safer for large players to enter the market. These underlying trends contribute to the positive long-term crypto market outlook . Bitcoin vs. Altcoins: Who Benefits Most? The report, as noted by CoinDesk, draws a distinction between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market in terms of how they might react to these tailwinds. While Bitcoin is expected to benefit significantly from the macro-economic improvements and regulatory clarity due to its status as the largest, most recognized, and increasingly institutionally-accepted digital asset, altcoins may face a different path. Altcoins often require specific catalysts for major price movements, such as: Successful protocol upgrades (like Ethereum’s transitions) Specific ETF approvals for that asset Major developments or adoption within their specific ecosystem Significant technological breakthroughs Without these individual drivers, many altcoins might lag behind Bitcoin, which is seen as more directly benefiting from the broad inflow of capital driven by macro and regulatory shifts. This highlights a potential divergence in performance within the crypto market. What Are the Potential Challenges or Risks? While the outlook presented by Coinbase Research is optimistic, it’s crucial to consider potential headwinds. The path to 2025 is not without risks. These could include: Unexpected economic downturns or recessions Delays or setbacks in passing US crypto regulation Geopolitical events that disrupt global markets Internal crypto market issues, such as major exchange failures or security breaches Changes in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy plans Investors should always be aware that the crypto market is inherently volatile and subject to rapid changes based on a wide range of factors. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Potential Bitcoin Rally Based on the Coinbase Research perspective, what might this mean for those interested in the market? It suggests that the period leading up to and including the second half of 2025 could be particularly interesting for Bitcoin. While this is not financial advice, understanding the potential drivers – U.S. economic health, Fed policy, and regulatory progress – is key. For those considering their strategy, it might involve: Staying informed about economic indicators and Fed announcements. Monitoring legislative developments regarding US crypto regulation . Considering Bitcoin’s position within a diversified portfolio, given its potential drivers differ somewhat from many altcoins. Recognizing that market timing is difficult and forecasts are subject to change. The Bitcoin price prediction offered by Coinbase Research is a forecast based on current information and trends, providing a framework for understanding potential future market movements. Conclusion: A Bullish Horizon, But Stay Informed The report from Coinbase Research paints a cautiously optimistic picture for Bitcoin, particularly targeting a potential rally in the latter half of 2025. The convergence of anticipated U.S. economic growth, expected Fed rate cuts easing liquidity, and crucial progress on US crypto regulation creates a compelling narrative for increased capital inflow into Bitcoin. While altcoins may require their own specific catalysts, Bitcoin appears well-positioned to benefit from these broader macro and structural tailwinds. As with any forecast in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, staying informed about these key drivers and potential risks is essential for navigating the market.

This latest movement places the asset 4.1% below its all-time high of over $111,000 recorded last month. Despite the short-term dip, some analysts see familiar signs in derivatives data that could point to the next phase of market movement. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Calm Rally Could Be a Setup for a Massive Breakout, Analyst Reveals Funding Rate Rebounds Signal Potential Upside for Bitcoin According to recent insights shared by on-chain analyst “nino” on CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin may be repeating a funding rate pattern that has historically led to price rebounds. The data shows the asset’s funding rate briefly dipping into negative territory before beginning to reverse, a pattern that has aligned with price recoveries earlier in the year. Nino’s analysis suggests this reversal, particularly the 72-hour moving averages exiting the oversold zone and producing a yellow-blue-black signal formation, could indicate a potential round of short position liquidations. The funding rate, still below levels typically associated with excessive bullish sentiment, may also imply that traders have yet to become overconfident, leaving room for additional upside without immediate overheating in derivatives markets. Nino’s observation focuses on market structure and derivative sentiment, highlighting how positioning in perpetual futures markets could precede notable spot price moves. In particular, when funding rates turn negative and then begin to climb, they often reflect the unwinding of overly bearish bets by traders who shorted BTC at high leverage. As these traders are forced to close positions, the resulting buy pressure can act as a short-term catalyst. This setup has played out multiple times earlier in 2025, and the current conditions suggest it may be occurring again. By keeping track of moving averages and sentiment zones, traders may interpret these signals as part of a broader cyclical trend. Binance Volume Share Signals Key Trends in Market Liquidity Separately, another analyst from CryptoQuant, Burak Kesmeci, addressed structural shifts in spot trading liquidity, particularly Binance’s share of global trading volume. Kesmeci emphasized that Binance’s dominance remains an important barometer of institutional participation and overall market health. He explained that an increase in Binance’s spot volume share is often associated with higher liquidity and smoother price discovery. Conversely, if Binance were to fall below a 30% volume threshold, it could signal a move toward more “fragmented liquidity” across exchanges such as Coinbase or Upbit. Such shifts could lead to more volatility and less predictable trading behavior.

This legislation, designed to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, has garnered significant attention as it nears potential passage . The announcement followed a procedural vote for the GENIUS Stablecoin Act carried out by the US Senate on Thursday, June 12, which might lead to fresh crypto regulation. The bill seeks to introduce a regulatory landscape for stablecoins to the crypto space, a milestone for the growing industry as trading and on-chain activity are expected to rise. John Thune believes the GENIUS Act will make crypto a common part of daily life Addressing the Senate floor on Wednesday, Majority Leader John Thune called for members of Congress to vote to pass the bill. The action doubles down on many of US President Donald Trump’s talking points regarding digital assets, such as how the legislation will help bring the US to the crypto capital of the world. In a 68-30 vote, the US Senate voted to advance the GENIUS Act. This took place more than a month after it was introduced. Several senators, including Democrats, voted to invoke cloture for the bill, putting it on the path for debate and a full floor vote before potentially moving it on to the House of Representatives for further discussion. Thune highlighted that they aim to make cryptocurrency a common part of everyday life, and the GENIUS Act will assist them in achieving that. He further stated that Congress had more work to do on digital assets, referring to a separate market structure bill working its way through the House. Regarding the bill mentioned by Thune, two House committees voted on Tuesday to move forward with the CLARITY Act, clearing the way for a full floor vote soon. Analysts have pointed out the US could become a leader in regulating digital currencies worldwide if the law passes. Based on their argument, this important federal guideline might set new standards for regulators checking other cryptocurrencies. Senator Elizabeth Warren calls for the Senate to stop Trump’s corruption Despite the celebration behind getting the GENIUS Act through the final approval, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts took to the Senate floor to say there were “serious issues” with the GENIUS Act. Warren raised concerns tha t th e chamber did not tackle the issue by not voting on some bipartisan changes. She also echoed questions from many Democrats about Trump’s links to his family-backed crypto platform World Liberty Financial and accusations that supporters who hold his meme coin will be treated to dinner and have access to the president. Warren stated that Trump’s crypto business allows him to easily trade presidential favors like tariff breaks, pardons, and government jobs for hundreds of millions, maybe even billions, from foreign countries, wealthy individuals, and big companies. Therefore, according to her, by approving the GENIUS Act, the Senate will support this corruption and help it grow. Warren added that the GENIUS Act has many gaps and lacks strong protection, consumer protection security, and financial health. While many Democrats voted to invoke cloture, some still ask Republicans to consider amending the GENIUS Act. Still, it is unclear whether the bill will have the support in the chamber, where Republicans have a slim majority, to pass. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

One of the world’s largest e-commerce platforms is dipping its toes further into the world of digital currencies. We’re talking about Shopify, and they’re about to make paying with stablecoins a reality for many merchants and customers. What’s the Big News About Shopify USDC Payments ? According to reports citing Fortune and Wu Blockchain, Shopify is gearing up to launch a pilot program that will allow select merchants in the United States and Europe to accept payments using the USDC stablecoin. This isn’t just a theoretical concept; the pilot is slated to begin surprisingly soon, starting in late June of this year. Here are the core details of this upcoming pilot: What: Piloting the acceptance of USDC stablecoin payments. When: Starting late June this year. Where: Initially for select merchants in the U.S. and Europe. How: Developed in collaboration with Coinbase and integrated using Stripe’s payment infrastructure. On What Network: The protocol is built on Coinbase’s Base network, a Layer 2 solution. Key Feature: Designed to support features like refunds and chargebacks, crucial for e-commerce. Merchant Choice: This payment option will be entirely optional for participating merchants. This move signals a growing interest from major platforms in integrating digital assets into mainstream commerce, specifically focusing on the stability offered by stablecoins like USDC. Why USDC Stablecoin ? Understanding the Choice You might wonder why Shopify would choose a stablecoin like USDC over, say, Bitcoin or Ethereum. The answer lies in the fundamental nature of stablecoins. Unlike more volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a traditional fiat currency like the US dollar (as is the case with USDC, which aims for a 1:1 peg). This stability is absolutely critical for commercial transactions. Imagine buying a product online. You want the price you see at checkout to be the price you pay, without worrying if the value of your payment token will drop significantly in the minutes or hours it takes to process the transaction. Stablecoins eliminate this volatility risk for both the merchant and the customer at the point of sale. USDC, specifically, is one of the largest and most widely recognized regulated stablecoins, managed by Circle and Coinbase. Its reputation and widespread adoption make it a logical choice for a major e-commerce platform looking to experiment with crypto payments while minimizing volatility concerns. The Power Duo: Coinbase Stripe Partnership Explained This initiative isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s a collaborative effort involving significant players in both the crypto and traditional finance/payment sectors: Coinbase: As a major cryptocurrency exchange and technology provider, Coinbase’s involvement is multifaceted. They co-manage USDC and have been instrumental in developing the underlying protocol for these payments. Crucially, the system is built on Base, Coinbase’s own Ethereum Layer 2 network. Building on Base likely offers advantages in terms of speed and lower transaction costs compared to transacting directly on the main Ethereum network, which is vital for high-volume e-commerce. Stripe: Stripe is a global leader in online payment processing. Their integration here is key to making this pilot functional within the existing e-commerce framework. Stripe provides the necessary infrastructure to handle the payment flow, potentially managing the conversion, settlement, and crucial features like facilitating refunds and chargebacks – aspects that are standard in traditional commerce but can be complex with native crypto transactions. Their expertise bridges the gap between the crypto payment rail and the merchant’s need for reliable financial operations. This partnership leverages the strengths of each company: Coinbase’s crypto expertise and network technology (Base), Stripe’s robust payment processing capabilities, and Shopify’s massive merchant base. How Does This Boost E-commerce Crypto Adoption ? A move like this from a platform as large and influential as Shopify has the potential to significantly impact the adoption of crypto payments in online retail. Here’s why: Normalization: When a mainstream platform like Shopify offers a crypto payment option, it helps normalize the idea of using digital assets for everyday purchases. It moves crypto beyond speculation and into practical utility. Merchant Access: Shopify provides tools and services to millions of businesses worldwide. Making it easy for these merchants to accept USDC removes a major barrier to entry for crypto payments. Merchants don’t need deep technical crypto knowledge; they can potentially opt-in through their familiar Shopify dashboard. Customer Access: For customers who hold USDC or other cryptocurrencies (which can be easily converted to USDC), this provides a direct way to spend those assets within the vast Shopify ecosystem. Infrastructure Development: The development of a payment protocol specifically designed for e-commerce, including features like refunds and chargebacks on a Layer 2 network like Base, builds crucial infrastructure needed for scaling crypto payments. While starting with a pilot, a successful rollout could pave the way for wider availability across Shopify’s platform, exposing millions of merchants and hundreds of millions of customers to crypto payments. Navigating Crypto Payments Shopify : Benefits and Considerations For merchants considering opting into this pilot (or a future wider release), there are several potential benefits, but also important points to consider. Potential Benefits for Merchants: Access to a New Customer Base: Tap into the growing number of individuals holding stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. Potentially Lower Transaction Fees: Crypto transaction fees, especially on Layer 2 networks like Base, can sometimes be lower than traditional credit card processing fees, though the overall cost structure (including any conversion fees handled by the processor) needs to be evaluated. Faster Settlement? Depending on the exact implementation, crypto settlements can sometimes be faster than traditional banking channels, improving cash flow. Reduced Chargeback Risk? While the protocol supports chargebacks, the nature of blockchain transactions can potentially reduce certain types of fraudulent chargebacks compared to traditional methods, though this depends heavily on the integration details. Innovation and Brand Image: Position the business as forward-thinking and innovative by offering modern payment options. Optionality: Merchants aren’t forced to accept USDC; it’s an additional tool they can offer alongside existing payment methods. Considerations for Merchants: Operational Complexity: While the integration aims to be seamless, merchants need to understand how these payments will appear in their systems, how refunds work, and how settlement happens. Tax Implications: Accepting crypto payments has tax implications that merchants must understand and manage according to their local regulations. Customer Support: Be prepared to handle customer inquiries about paying with USDC. Market Demand: Assess if their target customer base is likely to use this payment method. For customers, the main benefit is having an additional, potentially convenient way to spend their digital assets on a platform they already use extensively. What This Means for the Future The Shopify USDC pilot is more than just a small experiment; it’s a strong signal about the direction of e-commerce and payments. It suggests that major platforms see stablecoins as a viable, less volatile entry point for integrating crypto into mainstream commerce. If successful, this pilot could lead to a wider rollout on Shopify, potentially inspiring other large e-commerce platforms to explore similar integrations. This could significantly accelerate the adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets for everyday transactions, blurring the lines between traditional finance and the crypto economy. The focus on Base also highlights the growing importance of Layer 2 scaling solutions for making blockchain transactions fast and cheap enough for high-frequency activities like online shopping. Summary Shopify is launching an exciting pilot program in late June, enabling select U.S. and European merchants to accept USDC payments. This initiative, developed with Coinbase and integrated via Stripe on the Base network, is a significant step towards mainstream e-commerce crypto adoption. By leveraging the stability of USDC and the infrastructure of its partners, Shopify is exploring a future where paying with digital assets is as common as using a credit card. While initially a pilot, its success could unlock new opportunities for merchants and customers alike, marking a pivotal moment in the integration of crypto into global commerce.

Adding her voice to the discussion, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has issued a notable warning regarding the potential impact on US inflation . According to reports citing CNBC via the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, Yellen suggested that policies involving substantial tariffs, as proposed by former President Trump, could realistically push the year-on-year inflation rate up to 3%. Why Are Comments from Janet Yellen Significant? Janet Yellen is a highly respected figure in the economic world, having served not only as U.S. Treasury Secretary but also as the Chair of the Federal Reserve. Her insights carry significant weight due to her extensive experience at the highest levels of economic policy-making. When she speaks about potential economic outcomes, particularly concerning crucial metrics like inflation, markets and analysts pay close attention. Her perspective offers a view grounded in deep understanding of monetary policy, fiscal policy, and international trade dynamics. Therefore, her warning about the inflationary potential of Trump tariffs is not merely political commentary but an assessment based on economic principles and potential real-world consequences. Understanding the Proposed Trump Tariffs and Their Mechanism During his previous term and in recent public statements, Donald Trump has advocated for imposing broad tariffs on imported goods, sometimes suggesting universal tariffs or specific high tariffs on goods from countries like China. The core idea behind tariffs is to make imported goods more expensive relative to domestically produced goods, aiming to protect or stimulate domestic industries. However, the economic mechanism by which tariffs can fuel US inflation is relatively straightforward: Increased Import Costs: Tariffs are taxes on imported goods. When these taxes are applied, the cost for importers rises. Pass-Through to Consumers: Importers and retailers typically pass these increased costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices for goods sold in the United States. Reduced Competition: By making imports more expensive, tariffs can reduce foreign competition, potentially allowing domestic producers to also raise their prices without losing market share. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt established global supply chains, potentially leading to inefficiencies and higher costs in sourcing components or finished goods. This direct and indirect pressure on prices is what leads economists like Yellen to predict an uptick in inflation. How Could Tariffs Push US Inflation Towards 3%? A 3% inflation rate, while not historically unprecedented, represents a level that the Federal Reserve and policymakers generally aim to avoid exceeding consistently. The Federal Reserve’s target is typically around 2%. Yellen’s projection suggests that the scale and scope of the proposed Trump tariffs could be significant enough to move the needle on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) by a full percentage point or more from current levels or baseline projections. Consider the volume of goods imported into the U.S. A broad tariff applied across a wide range of products – from consumer electronics and apparel to industrial components and raw materials – would impact the cost basis for a vast segment of the economy. Even if only a portion of the tariff cost is passed onto consumers, the cumulative effect across numerous goods could be substantial enough to influence the overall inflation rate significantly. Furthermore, the uncertainty and potential for retaliatory tariffs from other countries could exacerbate the situation, leading to further price volatility and supply chain issues, adding more upward pressure on prices. Exploring the Broader Economic Impact The economic impact of rising inflation, particularly if driven by tariffs, extends beyond just higher prices for consumers. Here are some potential consequences: Reduced Consumer Purchasing Power: When prices rise faster than wages, consumers can buy less with their money, potentially leading to a slowdown in consumer spending, a major driver of the U.S. economy. Increased Business Costs: Businesses face higher costs for imported inputs, which can squeeze profit margins or force them to raise their own prices, contributing further to inflation. Monetary Policy Response: Persistent inflation can pressure the Federal Reserve to maintain higher interest rates or even hike them further to cool down the economy. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing investment and economic growth. Trade Relations: Imposing tariffs often leads to retaliatory tariffs from trading partners, harming U.S. exporters and potentially disrupting international trade flows. This complex web of effects highlights why economists view tariff-driven inflation with concern, as it can create headwinds for overall economic health. Potential Implications for the Crypto Market The potential for rising US inflation and its broader economic impact is highly relevant for participants in the crypto market . Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as a potential hedge against inflation due to their decentralized nature and finite supply, contrasting with fiat currencies that can be subject to inflationary pressures from government policies. If inflation were to rise significantly towards or above 3% due to tariffs or other factors, some investors might increasingly look to assets perceived as stores of value outside the traditional financial system. This narrative could potentially increase interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, the relationship is complex. Higher inflation could also lead to the Federal Reserve maintaining or increasing interest rates, which can make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Furthermore, a general economic slowdown caused by inflation and trade tensions could negatively impact investor sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Actionable Insight: For crypto market participants, Yellen’s warning serves as a reminder to monitor macroeconomic indicators like inflation closely. Understanding the potential economic consequences of proposed policies like tariffs can help inform investment strategies and risk assessments. Challenges and Uncertainties Predicting the exact impact of tariffs is challenging. The final inflation figure would depend on numerous factors, including the specific design and scope of the tariffs, the response of domestic and international businesses, the reaction of consumers, and the overall state of the global economy at the time. Yellen’s 3% figure is a projection based on current understanding and historical precedents, but actual outcomes can vary. Another challenge is distinguishing tariff-driven inflation from other inflationary pressures that might be present in the economy. However, a broad tariff implementation would likely be a significant and identifiable contributor. Conclusion: A Warning Worth Heeding Former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s warning that Trump tariffs could elevate US inflation to 3% underscores the potential economic consequences of protectionist trade policies. While tariffs aim to support domestic industries, economists widely agree that they can lead to higher costs for consumers and businesses, contributing to inflationary pressures and potentially broader negative economic impact . For those involved in the crypto market , these macroeconomic shifts are crucial to watch, as they can influence market dynamics and investment narratives. The discussion around tariffs and inflation is far from over, and Yellen’s comments add a significant voice to the debate, highlighting a potential challenge that policymakers and the public may need to confront.

With the Trump administration pushing to make the US the ‘crypto capital of the planet,’ racing to bring stablecoins to the masses, regulatory clarity appears imminent – but the real question is whether this political momentum will elevate stablecoins as transformative financial infrastructure or merely solidify them as casino chips for traders in a speculative market. The paradox of today’s stablecoins Stablecoins were meant to bridge crypto and TradFi (traditional finance), yet they remain largely confined to intra-crypto trading. They were originally envisioned as frictionless, programmable dollars that could flow across the globe in seconds. Yet, in practice, they have largely been used to arbitrage, speculate and navigate exchange inefficiencies. High-profile failures like TerraUSD’s algorithmic collapse, depegging events from USDC and Tether and ongoing concerns over opaque reserves expose a paradox that today’s stablecoins mimic the structural fragilities of the very financial systems they were meant to disrupt. While fiat-backed models may command the security of treasuries or bank deposits, they introduce counterparty risk, being repackaged under the label of innovation. In effect, most stablecoins don’t remove risk but rebrand it. Political opportunism The push for a stablecoin bill by August 2025 by Trump could bring much-needed legal certainty. But if legislation is shaped by industry lobbying and political self-interest, such as the Trump-linked stablecoin venture being formed, it risks enabling another cycle of light-touch regulation and insider enrichment. The Terra disaster proved that without robust safeguards, stablecoins remain a ticking time bomb. Could this open the door to regulatory arbitrage, where rules are written to favor a few powerful players while smaller or more ethical projects are sidelined? Addressing the lip service A common talking point in crypto circles is that stablecoins can ‘bank the unbanked.’ Yet, to date, access to stablecoins often requires an existing relationship with crypto exchanges, fiat on-ramps and a level of digital literacy far beyond the reach of the underserved. In practice, they serve the overbanked: traders, institutions and whales. True financial inclusion requires the right infrastructure, like AI-powered wallets that automate hedging, not just dollar-pegged tokens. Stablecoins as a new form of value With a lack of clear reserve requirements or public audits, and an unclear path to adoption for those most in need, it’s important to ask whether the US should prop up legacy models or incentivize stablecoins that actually power the next economy. The future lies in stablecoins that are intelligent, AI-backed, transparent and tied to real productive assets like AI compute power, tokenized research and development or DeFi lending markets. To achieve this, policymakers must mandate real-time, on-chain PoRs (proof of reserves) as opposed to self-reported audits, reward stablecoins that enable real-world use cases (payments, AI services, DeFi) over pure speculation and promote overcollateralized models that eliminate single points of failure. The Trump administration’s crypto push is neither inherently good nor bad. It’s a test of whether the industry can mature beyond short-term profiteering.

The U.S. began evacuations from Iraq amid fears of escalating regional conflict. Crypto markets turned risk-off, with Ethereum and XRP also posting sharp losses. Bitcoin fell sharply late Thursday, sliding over 4% to $103,556 following Israeli airstrikes on Iran that intensified already fragile Middle East tensions. The drop from a 24-hour high of $108,500 came as investors reacted to the prospect of a broader geopolitical crisis, triggering a retreat from risk assets. The sharp sell-off led to the liquidation of $427 million in long positions in the past 24 hours. Israeli officials confirmed the airstrikes targeted military infrastructure near Tehran and Tabriz, describing the action as a preemptive measure in response to Iran’s nuclear threat. Bitcoin Drops as Israel’s Attack on Iran Could Continue for Days Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the operation a necessary step to “remove this threat,” adding it would continue “as many days as it takes.” Iran has yet to issue an official response, but state media reported explosions and airspace closures. Meanwhile, the U.S. began pulling diplomats from Iraq and offered voluntary evacuations to military families in neighboring countries. The State Department also issued warnings for American citizens to leave Iraq, citing regional instability. In Washington, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel acted unilaterally but had informed the U.S. beforehand. Former Trump advisor Steve Witkoff noted that nuclear negotiations with Iran are still on the table, though risks of escalation remain. Historically, Bitcoin has shown sensitivity to geopolitical unrest, often falling as traders reduce exposure to volatile assets. While the crypto asset is seen by some as a long-term hedge, its short-term price often mirrors broader risk sentiment. Ethereum followed the downward trend, slipping below $2,500, while XRP retreated to $2.10, adding to the market-wide pressure. Bitcoin Struggles to Hold $104K Amid Tensions Bitcoin is trading at $103,990 at the time of writing, showing signs of stabilization after a sharp 4% drop triggered by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Price briefly dipped below $103,000 following Israeli airstrikes on Iran but has since bounced modestly. On the 2-hour chart, BTC remains under pressure, with Bollinger Bands widening and price hugging the lower band—a sign of increased volatility and bearish momentum. Bitcoin Just Lost Its Breakout — Here’s the Support Level That Matters Now Why this report matters Bitcoin’s breakout above $106,000 didn’t hold, and that could mean more than just a failed rally. Ethereum’s funding rate has quietly collapsed, even as open interest surged… pic.twitter.com/7XH0NMaK7I — 10x Research (@10x_Research) June 13, 2025 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 25.51, deep in oversold territory, indicating potential for a short-term relief bounce. However, MACD values remain heavily negative (-438.59 MACD line), suggesting bearish momentum is still dominant. Zooming into the 30-minute timeframe, price is struggling to reclaim the $105,000 zone. RSI stands at 32.30, also near oversold levels, while MACD shows downward expansion, further reinforcing downside risk if support fails. Bollinger Bands on this timeframe show a bearish squeeze breaking to the downside. The 1-minute chart reflects short-term recovery attempts, with RSI bouncing to 66.49 and MACD crossing bullishly. Still, this minor uptick is not yet confirmed by higher timeframes, suggesting caution is warranted. Key levels to watch include immediate support at $102,533 and resistance at $105,693. A close above $105,000 could ease selling pressure, but failure to reclaim it may open the door to further losses toward $100K. For now, sentiment remains risk-off, and BTC bulls must defend current levels to avoid deeper correction.

Recently, the popular blockchain tracking service, Whale Alert, reported a notable ETH transfer . A substantial amount of 86,430 ETH, originating from an address labeled as ‘unknown wallet,’ made its way to a platform associated with Liquid staking . Valued at approximately $237 million at the time of the transfer, this move is far from ordinary. Such a significant sum changing hands, especially from an unidentified source to a specific type of destination like liquid staking, prompts questions and speculation within the crypto community. What Exactly Happened with This Large Crypto Transfer? According to the alert disseminated by Whale Alert, the core details of the event are straightforward: Amount: 86,430 ETH Source: An address identified as ‘unknown wallet’ Destination: A platform categorized under ‘Liquid Stake’ Approximate Value: $237 million While large transactions are common on the Ethereum network, the combination of the amount, the unknown source, and the specific destination makes this large crypto transfer particularly noteworthy. It suggests a deliberate strategic decision by the holder of these assets. Why Does an Ethereum Whale Moving ETH Matter? When we talk about an Ethereum whale , we’re referring to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of ETH. These whales often have the potential to influence market dynamics simply through their buying, selling, or moving of assets. Tracking their movements can offer insights, although it’s crucial not to overinterpret single events. The movement of 86,430 ETH by an Ethereum whale to a staking platform, rather than an exchange or another private wallet, signals a potential shift in strategy. It suggests a long-term perspective focused on earning yield rather than immediate trading or selling. Exploring the Destination: What is Liquid Staking? The destination of this massive ETH transfer was a ‘Liquid Stake’ platform. But what does that mean? Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with the Merge. Under PoS, users can ‘stake’ their ETH to help secure the network and earn rewards. However, traditional staking often involves locking up ETH, making it inaccessible for other uses. Liquid staking solutions were developed to address this. They allow users to stake their ETH and, in return, receive a liquid token (like stETH, rETH, etc.) that represents their staked ETH plus earned rewards. This liquid token can then be used in other DeFi protocols, traded, or sold, providing flexibility that traditional staking lacks. The appeal of Liquid staking lies in offering the benefits of staking rewards while maintaining access to capital. This flexibility is particularly attractive to large holders or institutions who might want to earn yield without sacrificing the ability to participate in other decentralized finance activities or react to market changes. The Implications for ETH Staking and the Ecosystem This significant ETH transfer contributes directly to the total amount of ETH staked on the network. As more ETH is staked, it further strengthens the network’s security and decentralization (assuming stakes are distributed across validators and platforms). The fact that an Ethereum whale chose a Liquid staking route highlights the growing maturity and trust in these decentralized protocols. It underscores the increasing demand for yield-generating opportunities within the Ethereum ecosystem that also offer liquidity. Benefits highlighted by this move towards ETH staking via liquid platforms include: Yield Generation: Earning passive income on dormant ETH holdings. Capital Efficiency: Using the liquid staking derivative token in DeFi for lending, borrowing, or trading. Accessibility: Easier entry into staking compared to running a solo validator (which requires 32 ETH and technical know-how). However, it’s also important to consider the potential challenges and risks associated with Liquid staking : Smart Contract Risk: Vulnerabilities in the liquid staking protocol’s code could lead to loss of funds. Depeg Risk: The liquid staking token could trade below the value of the underlying ETH. Centralization Concerns: If a single liquid staking protocol gains too much dominance, it could introduce centralization risks to the network. This large crypto transfer serves as a real-world example of how significant players are navigating these considerations, opting for the benefits of liquid staking despite the inherent risks. Who Was This Unknown Wallet? The identity behind the ‘unknown wallet’ remains a mystery. It could be an early adopter, an institutional investor, a fund, or even a service moving assets internally before staking. Without further on-chain analysis or external information, it’s impossible to say definitively. What we can infer is that this entity holds a substantial amount of capital and is making calculated moves within the Ethereum ecosystem, focusing on yield through ETH staking via a liquid solution. Actionable Insights from the ETH Transfer For regular participants in the crypto market, what can be learned from this event? Whale Movements Offer Clues, Not Commands: While tracking large transactions can be insightful regarding potential trends (like the adoption of liquid staking), they should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Understand Staking Options: If you hold ETH, research the different ways to stake, including solo staking, pool staking, and Liquid staking , to understand the trade-offs between yield, liquidity, and risk. Risk Assessment is Key: Any participation in DeFi, including liquid staking, carries risks. Understand the specific risks of the platform or protocol you interact with. The Ecosystem is Evolving: This large crypto transfer highlights the continuous development and adoption of new financial primitives like liquid staking within Ethereum. Staying informed about these developments is crucial. Concluding Thoughts: A Strategic Move in the Staking Landscape The movement of 86,430 ETH from an unknown wallet to a Liquid staking platform is more than just a large number; it’s a signal. It underscores the increasing importance of yield generation for significant ETH holders and the growing preference for solutions that offer both staking rewards and liquidity. While the identity of the Ethereum whale behind this move remains obscured, their action clearly points towards a strategic decision to integrate yield farming into their holding strategy, further solidifying the role of ETH staking , particularly liquid solutions, in the broader crypto landscape.

The XRP Treasury is set to launch in the second half of 2025, with Chaince Securities LLC named as its strategic advisor. The $500M Game Plan – Staking, DeFi Partnerships & 2025 Launch According to the press release , the initiative will focus on building long-term reserves of XRP, earning yield through staking, and actively working within the Ripple ecosystem. The company also plans to partner with key DeFi projects to strengthen its role in the Web3 space. Funds will be raised through equity sales, strategic deals, and structured financing. It is already in talks with crypto foundations and investors to secure strong partnerships and favorable XRP terms. Trident (TDTH) shares dropped over 30% on Thursday and are now down more than 95% in the past year. XRP has also dipped over 5% today, currently trading at $2.12. Trident CEO Soon Huat Lim views blockchain as a game-changer for global finance, and said that this move shows how public companies can play a meaningful, responsible role in shaping the world of DeFi. “We see digital assets as key enablers in the evolution of the global financial landscape. This initiative reflects our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology for capital allocation and cross-border value transfer,” he said. XRP Joins the Big Leagues More companies are building XRP reserves. Chinese AI firm Weebus plans to invest $300 million, VivoPower is setting up a $100 million reserve, and Wellgistics Health is adding $50 million.

SHIB is barely clinging to support, with analysts watching for a breakdown, while Pi is inching up but still miles from a real rebound. Both are stuck in neutral, waiting for that next big move. Then there’s BlockDAG , breaking every norm before even launching. Over 1.5 million people are already mining BDAG through the X1 app daily. That’s not future hype; that’s real-time traction. Most projects dream of this kind of growth years after going live. BlockDAG is doing it first. The X1 app has turned phones into powerhouses, building a global base from the ground up. While others slow down, BlockDAG is racing ahead, and it’s easy to see why many think this is the next altcoin ready to erupt. 1.5M Users & Counting: BlockDAG Redefines Adoption! BlockDAG is flipping the script on what it means to build hype in crypto. While most projects throw around big claims with nothing to show for it, BlockDAG is doing the opposite, gaining serious traction before even going live. Its X1 Miner app already has over 1.5 million people mining BDAG from their phones daily. That’s a level of activity many well-known coins didn’t see until years after launch. What’s wild is this isn’t even the final stage, this is still the warm-up. BlockDAG is building from the ground up with actual daily engagement, not empty buzz. The X1 app is free to use, easy to get started with, and has already grown into something bigger than just a mining tool. It’s created a global network of users actively participating and fueling momentum long before the official rollout. That kind of early traction is rare. Most projects chase growth after launch. BlockDAG is pulling in millions before even opening the gates, and that says a lot. Right now, it’s in Batch 29, with BDAG priced at just $0.0018. But this low price doesn’t stick around for long. On June 13, it jumps to $0.0276, and the eventual listing price is pegged at $0.05. That’s a massive window of opportunity for anyone who gets in before the climb. With over $298 million already raised and 22.3 billion coins claimed, BlockDAG isn’t waiting to prove itself; it’s already proving it, one miner at a time. Shiba Inu’s Whale Exit Raises Red Flags for Price Stability Shiba Inu is feeling the pressure after a major pullback in whale activity. Big holders slashed their transactions by 84% in just four days, dropping from 24.3 trillion SHIB on June 5 to only 3.83 trillion by June 9. That kind of sharp decline has spelled trouble in the past, often signaling a price slide not far behind. To make matters worse, whales have recently pulled out around 262 billion SHIB, suggesting growing hesitation among the biggest players. Even with all this, SHIB is still clinging to support near $0.0000119. But that level is now under serious watch; if it cracks, some analysts believe another zero could creep into the price. Sentiment leans bearish at the moment, with a majority of traders betting on a drop. Unless something major turns the tide, SHIB might stay stuck in a tight range between $0.000010 and $0.000017. Right now, it’s a waiting game, and the pressure’s building. PI Price Stabilizes, But Community Patience Wears Thin Pi Network is trading around $0.641 after a modest 1% bump, but it’s still a long way off from its monthly peak, down nearly 40%. A recent 2 million PI transfer, likely a private deal between wallets, has caught some attention, with talk of potential institutional interest. Still, that hasn’t been enough to shift short-term sentiment, which remains cautious. A move back to $1.20 is seen as key to sparking real momentum. Within the community, opinions are split. Some are looking ahead to the June 28 “Pi Day 2” event, hoping it brings major news, maybe even exchange listings. But others are losing patience, especially those who’ve cleared KYC and are still waiting for their coins. Complaints about slowed mining and lack of visible updates haven’t helped either. For now, Pi is stuck in limbo. It’s holding steady, but unless something big drops soon, it may stay grounded instead of lifting off. Final Thoughts Shiba Inu is seeing a major slowdown in whale activity, casting doubt on its near-term momentum. Meanwhile, Pi Network is holding its ground but still struggling to recapture earlier highs, with attention now shifting to a possible update on June 28. Both seem stuck in pause mode, waiting for something to kickstart the action. BlockDAG isn’t waiting around. It’s already hitting serious benchmarks, with 1.5 million users mining through the X1 app every day, even before launch. That level of engagement is rare and speaks volumes about where this project is headed. The current price sits at just $0.0018 until June 13, after which it climbs sharply to $0.0276, with a launch target of $0.05. That’s a huge jump locked in for those getting in early. While others hope for a spark, BlockDAG is generating its own buzz, one phone, one miner, one day at a time.

The company has filed a Tesla lawsuit against a former engineer, alleging the theft of critical trade secrets related to its highly anticipated humanoid robotics program, Optimus . What are the Allegations Behind the Tesla Lawsuit? The lawsuit, which came to light recently, centers on accusations against Zhongjie “Jay” Li, a former engineer who worked on the Optimus project. According to the complaint, Li is alleged to have stolen confidential information concerning Tesla’s development of “advanced robotic hand sensors.” The company claims this proprietary information was then used to establish a competing enterprise. Key allegations detailed in the complaint include: Li downloaded confidential data related to Optimus onto two personal smartphones. During his final months at Tesla, Li allegedly researched “humanoid robotic hands” on his work computer. He also reportedly conducted internet searches regarding venture capital and startup funding sources while still employed at Tesla. The timeline presented in the lawsuit is striking: Li worked at Tesla from August 2022 to September 2024. The complaint states that Proception, the rival company, was incorporated less than a week after his departure from Tesla. Within just five months, Proception publicly claimed to have successfully built advanced humanoid robotic hands, which Tesla alleges bear a “striking resemblance” to the designs Li worked on while at the company. How Does This Relate to Trade Secret Theft and Robotics Startups? The core of the Tesla lawsuit is the accusation of trade secret theft . Trade secrets are confidential information that provides a business with a competitive edge. In the rapidly evolving field of robotics, particularly for complex systems like humanoid hands, the design and development details of sensors and mechanics can be highly valuable intellectual property. The lawsuit highlights the risks companies face when employees move to competing ventures, especially in cutting-edge sectors. Proception, described as a robotics startup backed by Y Combinator, aims to “revolutionize human-robot interaction by building the world’s most advanced humanoid hands.” Tesla’s legal action suggests a belief that Proception’s rapid progress was facilitated by the alleged misuse of Tesla’s confidential information. Challenges for Optimus and the Humanoid Robots Market The timing of this lawsuit adds another layer to the narrative surrounding Tesla’s Optimus program. The development of humanoid robots has proven to be a complex undertaking. Since unveiling the concept in 2021, Tesla has faced delays, with the initial target of introducing the bot in 2023 pushed back. Elon Musk most recently indicated sales might begin in 2026. Public demonstrations, like the “We, Robot” event in October 2024, have sometimes shown bots primarily controlled remotely, underscoring the ongoing development challenges. This legal dispute underscores the intense competition and high stakes involved in the race to develop viable humanoid robots . The potential for trade secret theft is a significant concern for companies investing heavily in R&D in this space. As more robotics startup companies emerge, leveraging advancements in AI and hardware, protecting intellectual property becomes paramount. Bitcoin World has reached out to both Proception and Tesla for comment on the lawsuit. Summary: Tesla has filed a significant lawsuit against a former engineer, alleging he stole trade secrets related to the Optimus humanoid robot’s hand sensors and used them to launch a rival robotics startup, Proception. The case highlights the challenges of protecting intellectual property in the competitive field of advanced robotics and adds another dimension to the ongoing development story of Tesla’s Optimus program.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana sink as Israel strikes Iran",https://crypto.news/crypto-market-bitcoin-down-israel-strikes-iran-2025/,"The cryptocurrency market plunged on Friday, June 13, as rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East rattled investors. Following news that Israel had launched a major military operation against Iran, digital assets tumbled sharply. The total crypto market capitalization dropped 7% over the past 24 hours to $3.3 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) declined around 5%, trading at $103,464 as of press time. Ethereum ( ETH ) fell 10% to $2,471, while Solana ( SOL ) dropped 11% to $141. XRP ( XRP ) and BNB ( BNB ) also lost ground, down 6% and 4% respectively. Data from CoinGlass shows that crypto liquidations surged 125% in a single day, reaching $1.2 billion. Open interest across crypto futures markets fell 9.7% to $142 billion, while the relative strength index sank to 28, indicating the market had entered oversold territory. Despite the selloff, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, compiled by software firm Alternative, remained in the “Greed” zone at 61, though down 10 points from the previous day. The drop in sentiment reflects investor uncertainty, as traders assess the risk of broader conflict.

According to a Reuters report , Israeli forces hit multiple high-value targets, including uranium enrichment facilities in Natanz, ballistic missile production sites, and the headquarters of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in Tehran. Iranian state media reported the death of General Hossein Salami and civilian casualties, including children. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes marked the beginning of “Operation Rising Lion,” a campaign aimed at neutralizing Iran’s nuclear threat. Israel has declared a state of emergency, closed its main airport, and raised air defenses in anticipation of retaliatory attacks. Iran has promised a “harsh response.” U.S. secretary of state Marco Rubio confirmed the United States was not involved in the strike, emphasizing that American priorities lie in protecting its forces in the region. Apart from cryptocurrencies, traditional financial markets bore the brunt as well. U.S. stock futures dropped 1.5% across major indexes, and European markets opened lower by a similar margin. Meanwhile, safe-haven assets surged slightly. Gold rose 0.75% to $3,428 per ounce, and the 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.32%. Crude oil, often seen as a geopolitical risk proxy, surged about 10% to $74 per barrel, according to data from Market Watch. With tensions climbing and the potential for regional war rising, both crypto and global markets could see continued volatility. Risk appetite may weaken further, pushing capital into safer, more liquid assets until the situation stabilizes.

Here’s Why!,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-are-bitcoin-and-altcoins-down-today-heres-why/,"The post Why Are Bitcoin and Altcoins Down Today? Here’s Why! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The global crypto market just dropped by 5.66%, leaving many investors wondering what’s going on. Bitcoin, which was recently aiming for a breakout above $109,000, has dropped back to around $104,000. That’s a 3.6% decline in just 24 hours. And it’s not just Bitcoin—Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and even meme coins like Dogecoin have followed, falling anywhere between 6% to 15%. So, what’s behind this sudden crash? Fed Rate Cut Hopes Crushed The biggest reason seems to be new signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve. After the latest inflation data came out, showing core CPI still above expectations and producer prices rising, the chances of a rate cut in June have nearly vanished. According to Fed CME tools, the market now has a 97.4% chance that the Fed will not lower interest rates this month. That’s made investors nervous, and it’s showing in crypto prices. Bitcoin ETFs See Big Outflows Another major blow came from the spot Bitcoin ETFs. After several days of strong inflows, June 12 saw a sudden reversal, with $202 million flowing out . Leading the charge was Fidelity’s ETF alone saw a $197 million withdrawal, while ARK Invest’s ETF lost over $10 million. Surprisingly, BlackRock stayed flat with zero inflows or outflows. $1.15 Billion in Crypto Liquidations Leverage traders took a big hit. In the last 24 hours, over 247,000 traders were liquidated, with total liquidations hitting $1.15 billion . The largest single liquidation order was a $201 million long on Binance. If Bitcoin drops further to around $95,800, nearly $11.76 billion worth of long positions are at risk. That could trigger another wave of sell-offs. Technical Charts Hint More Pain Meanwhile, technically, indicators hint at more struggle for Bitcoin as charts show rejection near the $106K resistance zone. Meanwhile, the MACD is showing a slight bullish crossover, but the momentum is weakening. If Bitcoin fails to hold $104K , we could see a retest of $102K or even $100K soon. Altcoin Market Suffers Too Altcoins are taking a big hit, closely following Bitcoin’s downward trend. The Altseason Index has dropped to 16, showing that Bitcoin still holds market dominance. Among the biggest losers, Ethereum (ETH) fell by over 9.29% , now trading near $2,508. While XRP, Solana, and Cardano all saw major declines, with no signs of recovery just yet.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 04:21:00

Broadening Wedge Hints At $4,200 Surge",https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/ethereum-breakout-imminent-broadening-wedge-hints-at-4200-surge/,"According to recent technical analysis, Ethereum (ETH) may be gearing up for a major breakout that could propel the cryptocurrency close to the $4,200 mark. Meanwhile, ETH continues to attract growing institutional interest, with Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) outperforming their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts. Ethereum Headed For A Breakout? In a recent X post, noted crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted that ETH is climbing within a massive weekly broadening wedge structure. The analyst shared the following chart and suggested that ETH could be targeting the $4,200 level – marking the top of the wedge. For the uninitiated, a broadening wedge is a chart pattern characterized by diverging trendlines, where price makes higher highs and lower lows, forming a megaphone-like shape. It typically indicates increasing market volatility and can signal a potential breakout, with the direction depending on the prevailing trend and breakout confirmation. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto echoed a similar outlook, stating that ETH is “setting up for a big move,” especially with over $2.2 billion in short positions clustered near the $3,000 level. If Ethereum breaks above $3,000, it could trigger a short squeeze, potentially accelerating ETH’s rally. At the time of writing, ETH is trading 43.7% below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021. Capital flows also indicate rising institutional interest in Ethereum. Crypto market commentator Ted Pillows recently pointed out that spot ETH ETFs attracted $240.3 million in inflows yesterday, compared to $164.6 million for spot BTC ETFs. The stronger performance of ETH ETFs suggests that capital may be rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum. It’s worth noting that while BTC is up 54% since June 2024, ETH is still down 24.6% during the same period. Crypto trader Merlijn the Trader shared the following monthly BTC/ETH chart showing two consecutive red candles, signaling a potential shift in momentum as BTC weakens relative to ETH. The trader noted that a similar capital rotation in 2020 preceded a “monster altseason.” Things Look Positive For ETH While altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and SUI created fresh ATHs in 2024, ETH’s performance did not live up to expectations. As a result, the broader sentiment in the Etheruem ecosystem took a hit. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Insanely Undervalued’ As Accumulation Addresses Keep Stacking – Is A Rally Imminent? However, 2025 appears to be ushering in a more favorable outlook. On-chain data reveals that ETH faces no major resistance until the $3,417 level. Additionally, ETH recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart – a bullish technical signal that could indicate an impending rally. At press time, ETH trades at $2,756, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

Donald Trump Warns ‘Fed Rate Cut NOW’ appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Donald Trump has reignited his battle with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a “numbskull” and criticizing the Fed for delaying interest rate cuts. Though he says Powell’s job is safe for now, Trump hinted that he may “force something” if rates don’t drop soon. The pressure comes as the 2024 campaign heats up and Trump pushes for a more aggressive economic stance. “Too High, Too Slow — Cut It Now!” Trump Rips Fed Chief Powell: “We’re Bleeding Billions While This Fool Sits There Saying ‘No Reason to Cut Rates’ — I Told Him Myself, If Inflation Comes, Hike It! But Right Now? We Need to Slash Rates Fast or Watch America Sink!” #NYI pic.twitter.com/eZCe33KhGG — NewYork-i (@Newyork__i) June 12, 2025 Speaking at a White House event, Trump claimed that cutting interest rates by just one percentage point could save the US $300 billion annually, while a two-point cut could double those savings. He blames Powell for being too slow to act, saying the Fed is making it harder to manage the country’s rising debt and borrowing costs. Officials Call FED’s Inaction ‘Monetary Malpractice’ The president has been saying this for a while, but it's even more clear: the refusal by the Fed to cut rates is monetary malpractice. https://t.co/HqUjWxwcHs — JD Vance (@JDVance) June 11, 2025 This isn’t the first time Trump’s administration has gone after Powell in recent days. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Vice President JD Vance have also attacked the Fed’s stance, calling it “monetary malpractice.” They argue that Powell’s reluctance to cut rates is hurting the economy, especially when inflation is easing and energy prices are dropping. Trump has pointed to Europe, where ten rate cuts have already taken place, as an example of how central banks should respond when inflation cools. He believes the US is falling behind and losing economic momentum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is The Crypto Market Going Down Today? , Can Trump Fire Powell? It’s Complicated Even though Trump has the constitutional power to remove Powell, doing so could rattle markets. Legal experts say the move would damage the Fed’s credibility and likely cause long-term interest rates to spike. Trump appears to be aware of this, which is why he hasn’t acted yet. Harvard legal scholars also note that the laws protecting Powell’s position have been slowly weakening in recent years. But despite the legal gray area, the real threat might come from how markets would react. Removing Powell could undermine investor confidence and hurt Trump’s broader economic goals. With energy prices falling and inflation data remaining stable, Trump’s calls for rate cuts may intensify. But whether the Fed listens or whether Trump acts on his threats remains to be seen. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The crypto crash followed news reports that Israel had launched a missile attack on Iranian nuclear sites in a pre-emptive strike.

More than 90% of those positions were long, and the majority of them were in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin led the losses , tanking hard and fast in a $5,000 dump from an intraday high of $108,350 to bottom out at $103,000 during Asian trading on Friday morning. The asset found support there and had reclaimed $104,000 at the time of writing, remaining within its six-week range-bound channel. Ethereum prices crashed more than 9%, tumbling from $2,760 to bottom out at $2,470 in a matter of hours. The asset had crept back over $2,500, where solid support lies at the time of writing. Altcoins suffered even more pain with Solana getting smashed 12% in a fall back to $140, Dogecoin dumping 10% in a dip to $0.17, and Cardano crashing 9.5% in a slide to $0.62. Other altcoins deep in the red include Sui, Chainlink, Avalanche, Shiba Inu, and Hedera. Nevertheless, losses were not so bad for BNB and Tron, which dipped a couple of percentage points. Total crypto market cap is down 7.9% to $3.34T amid Middle East tensions. Meme and Layer 2 categories saw the steepest declines, each falling over 12%.

This, of course, is ultimately a mistake, as inevitable money printing and monetary debasement soon follow. Smart investors will flee to assets that cannot be debased. The smartest will buy Bitcoin,” said former hedge fund manager James Lavish. The pro-crypto narrative from the United States continues to strengthen with the Securities and Exchange Commission withdrawing a tranche of Gary Gensler-era rules on June 12. Additionally, the US and China struck a trade deal this week as tariff tensions eased. However, benchmark Brent crude oil prices spiked by more than 8% and gold prices ticked up to $3,440 per ounce on the specter of all-out war.

At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.11, down by more than 6% in the last 24 hours. Why is XRP Price Falling? On June 13, Israel launched an airstrike targeting Iran’s nuclear sites, which triggered a drop in cryptocurrencies As a result, the total cryptocurrency market cap dropped by 4%. Adding to this, in the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC case, both parties submitted an updated settlement proposal the same day. However, legal experts have expressed concern that the new filing still doesn’t resolve the earlier concerns. XRP Price Prediction: What’s Next? Right now, the important price level to watch is around $2.34 to $2.35. This is the same area where the price was rejected not long ago, and it continues to act as a hurdle for XRP. If XRP manages to break above this zone, the next target will be around $2.44, and if the trend continues, it could climb up to $2.60. However, if the price fails to break through, there’s a chance it could drop to its nearby support levels. The first support is at $2.10, while stronger support can be found at $2.05. Will XRP Price Fall Below $2? On the shorter timeframes, there’s a bullish divergence still in play, which means the chances of a sharp drop in the next couple of days are low. Analysts suggest that we might see either a slow upward move or sideways trading for now. Additionally, XRP might have already formed a bottom in April, and since then, it seems to be building up a fresh five-wave rally. This pattern is often seen when a market trend is preparing to push higher. As long as XRP stays above the $2.11 mark, the positive outlook remains strong. However, if the price falls below $2.11, it could trigger a deeper correction, possibly sending XRP back towards the $1.94 to $1.79 range.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 05:11:57

Here's All You Need to Know!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-ethereum-eth-and-altcoins-dropped-hard-whats-the-reason-for-the-drop-heres-all-you-need-to-know/,"Just when Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins were recovering and starting to rise again, new declines occurred today. At this point, cryptocurrency markets triggered a flight from risky assets after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran and intensified regional conflicts, leading to sharp declines in Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH), and altcoins. The cryptocurrency market took off after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran, The Block reported. An unnamed Israeli military official confirmed to local reporters that the strikes targeted Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure. Historically, risky assets like cryptocurrencies tend to decline following tensions in the Middle East. According to the data, Bitcoin fell more than 4% in the last 24 hours, falling below the $104,000 level. BTC then recovered and rose to $104,400 levels. This decline also had a negative impact on altcoins other than Bitcoin. The largest altcoin, Ethereum, fell by 10% to $2,500. Popular altcoins such as XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Avalanche (AVAX) also followed BTC and ETH with declines between 6% and 15%. The biggest reason behind the decline in Bitcoin and altcoins, apart from geopolitical tensions, was the fact that the possibility of a FED rate cut has almost disappeared. The fact that the core CPI is still above expectations and the latest inflation data showing that producer prices are rising has almost eliminated the possibility of a rate cut in June. After this week’s data, the probability that the FED will leave interest rates unchanged in June has been priced in at 97.3%. This situation has also shown itself in a decline in cryptocurrency prices. According to Coinglass data, $1.14 billion worth of leveraged trades were liquidated in the last 24 hours. $1.04 billion of these were in long trades and $101 million in short trades. While 246,993 investors liquidated in the last 24 hours, the largest liquidation occurred in the BTC/USDT trading pair on Binance. *This is not investment advice.

The first quarter of the year was marked by volatility in the markets due to a short-term contraction in U.S. GDP and trade disruptions. However, recent data suggests a recovery. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracking data rose to 3.8% quarter-on-quarter as of early June, a significant increase from expectations at the beginning of the year. This development, combined with the expectation that the Fed will cut interest rates and adopt a more lenient trade policy, has eased recession concerns and boosted investor confidence. According to the Coinbase report, the weakening of the dollar’s global dominance and the rise of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation could also increase interest in crypto. However, high long-term US bond yields could limit this interest. The performance of altcoins will largely depend on specific catalysts such as ETF approvals or protocol-based developments. Another development that stands out in the report is the increasing tendency of public companies to include crypto assets in their balance sheets. The regulation that will come into force in 2024 and that will allow the transition to the “fair value” accounting method for digital assets supports this trend. However, this trend also brings new systemic risks. In particular, companies that finance crypto purchases with convertible debt may be forced to sell if refinancing opportunities narrow or market prices decline sharply. Related News: List of the 20 Altcoins That Crypto Developers Have Focused On the Most in the Last Year Has Been Revealed - There's a Big Surprise at the Top Significant steps are also being taken on the regulatory front. The Senate recently sent the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that passed with bipartisan support, to the House of Representatives. In addition, a more comprehensive market structure bill called the CLARITY Act is also on the agenda. The bill aims to clarify the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over digital assets. If passed, it would significantly reduce uncertainty for both issuers and investors. Meanwhile, the SEC is evaluating more than 80 crypto ETF applications, including multi-asset funds, staking and altcoin-based products. The first decisions are expected in July, with the rest expected by October. Overall, Bitcoin could perform strongly in the second half of the year, with macroeconomic and structural headwinds behind it, according to the Coinbase report. For altcoins, success will depend on navigating a more complex environment, including regulatory uncertainty and liquidity conditions. *This is not investment advice.

Israeli leaders pledged to continue operations until the threat is neutralized, while US President Trump's tariff threats further dampened investor sentiment. The strikes, which reportedly targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities and military infrastructure, marked a major escalation in tensions between the two countries and fueled fears of a broader conflict in the Middle East.

On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump signaled a possible hike in auto tariffs, saying it could push automakers to invest more in the U.S. “I might go up with that tariff in the not too distant future,” Trump said. “The higher you go, the more likely it is they build a plant here.” Looking ahead, markets are focused on the upcoming University of Michigan consumer sentiment report for June.

Bitcoin dropped 2.3%, Ethereum shed 4.5%, XRP lost 3.24%, and Solana slid 4.9% against the U.S. dollar. But it was Dogecoin that took the steepest plunge among the top ten, tumbling 5.9% in a single day. Over $320 million in bullish bets were wiped out within a single hour, signaling a harsh wake-up call for overly optimistic traders. BTC & ETH in Red, Altcoins Hit Harder? Bitcoin bore the brunt of the crash, with nearly $317 million in long positions liquidated in a day. The majority, over $306 million, were long bets. Prices slid nearly 4% in 24 hours, pulling BTC below $104K. While it’s still holding a 5% gain for the week, the momentum shifted after it peaked above $110,000 on Tuesday. One massive $201 million long on Binance alone got rekt in the plunge, according to CoinGlass data . Meanwhile, ETH fell over 6% on the day, crashing down to $2,650. Despite this drop, it’s still up about 9% on the week, thanks to an earlier surge. Daily liquidations for ETH totaled $151 million, second only to Bitcoin. While altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin were hit next, as bearish pressure swept across the altcoin market. Solana tumbled over 6% to $152.80, XRP dropped 4% to $2.20, and Dogecoin was the day’s worst performer, down 7% to $0.181. DOGE’s steep fall makes it the biggest loser among the top ten cryptocurrencies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Jerome Powell To be Fired?

Reports say Israel launched an airstrike on Iran’s nuclear site, which scared global investors. Many rushed to safer options like gold, causing it to jump 5%, while risky assets like crypto dropped. Inflation Data Triggers Profit-Taking The selling pressure began after the release of the U.S. CPI report on Wednesday , which showed cooling inflation for May. While that might seem like good news, the market reacted with a round of profit-taking, pushing prices down instead. Bitcoin and Ethereum slipped after the report, while altcoins were already struggling earlier in the day, only to see losses deepen by afternoon. Longs Crushed, Market Dips 5% In total, the market saw over $713 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours, $650 million of those from long positions. The broader market is now down roughly 5% in a day, according to CoinGecko, with traders rethinking their bullish positions amid rising volatility. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This event is very similar to last week’s options expiry, so the impact on spot markets is likely to be minimal. They have already tanked by more than 7% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.95, meaning that the longs and short sellers are pretty evenly matched. There is also a max pain point of $107,000, around $3,000 above current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at strike prices between $110,000 and $140,000, with more than $1.5 billion at each price, as bullish speculators remain confident, according to Deribit.

In addition to the batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 250,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring today, with a notional value of $687 million, a max pain point of $2,700, and a put/call ratio of 1.2. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $3.6 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization has slumped 7.4% to $3.34 trillion over the past 12 hours, with more than $180 billion exiting the space. Bitcoin has led the losses with a 4.3% dump to $103,000 during the Friday morning Asian trading session. However, the asset remains over six figures and within its six-week rangebound channel, so there is no need for panic yet. Ethereum has cooled after its promising rally , dumping a whopping 10% in a fall below $2,500 on Friday morning. This price level has served as support, so it must hold to prevent another major sell-off. The altcoins were a sea of red as expected, with double-digit pain for Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, Sui, Chainlink, and many others.

At the same time, Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission may soon conclude, as both parties seek court approval to finalize a $125 million settlement and dissolve a long-standing injunction. Trident Digital Tech Holdings to Launch $500 Million XRP Treasury Reserve Amid Growing Corporate Crypto Trend Trident Digital Tech Holdings, a Web3 technology firm headquartered in Singapore, announced on Thursday that it will establish an XRP treasury reserve of up to $500 million, marking one of the largest single corporate allocations to the Ripple-created cryptocurrency to date. The initiative sheds light on a deepening shift in how forward-looking companies are beginning to engage with decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based assets for treasury management and yield generation. In a statement released with the announcement, Trident’s founder and CEO Soon Huat Lim emphasized the company’s long-term strategic vision for blockchain integration. “This initiative reflects our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology for capital allocation and cross-border value transfer,” said Lim. “Through this initiative, Trident aims to demonstrate how public companies can thoughtfully and responsibly participate in the ongoing development of decentralized finance.” Unlike traditional treasury approaches that often center around passive buy-and-hold strategies, Trident plans to actively engage with its XRP reserve. The company revealed it will deploy the assets through staking mechanisms and other yield-generating strategies. Additionally, Trident intends to form deeper ties within the Ripple ecosystem, signaling a long-term commitment that could include partnerships or collaborations with RippleNet participants or decentralized applications built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The XRP reserve will be rolled out in the second half of 2025, contingent on regulatory clarity and favorable market conditions. Notably, Trident will fund this ambitious plan through a combination of stock issuance, strategic placements, and other financing instruments. Market Reaction and Financial Backdrop Despite the bold move, the market did not initially react favorably. Trident’s shares plunged by 37.6% on Thursday following the announcement. Investor concerns appear to stem from the company's financial performance rather than its crypto strategy. According to its latest financial disclosures, Trident reported a net income loss of $3.1 million as of December 2024. The company’s revenue declined a staggering 91.4% year-over-year, while operational expenses rose by over 100%, underscoring the financial strain it faces heading into this new initiative. Trident share price on June 12 (Source: Google Finance ) While some analysts view the XRP reserve strategy as a bold pivot aimed at repositioning Trident within a fast-evolving digital economy, others have questioned whether the timing and scale of the reserve are appropriate given the company’s current financial standing. Trident is not alone in its move to incorporate XRP into its corporate treasury. The past several months have seen a surge in similar announcements, highlighting a new trend where XRP joins the ranks of Bitcoin and Solana as a strategic crypto asset held by public and private companies alike. Chinese AI firm Webus recently unveiled a $300 million XRP reserve, while renewable energy conglomerate VivoPower has plans to allocate $100 million. Health logistics company Wellgistics Health also announced a $50 million XRP treasury commitment. Together, these reserves signal a significant shift in institutional perception of XRP—from a utility token used primarily for payments to a strategic digital asset. XRP’s growing role in corporate finance parallels earlier trends seen with Bitcoin and Solana. Bitcoin’s popularity as a corporate treasury asset began with Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) in August 2020, a move that was followed by firms like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific. In 2025, Solana has gained momentum in the same space, with firms like DeFi Development (formerly Janover) and SOL Strategies actively building SOL reserves in anticipation of broader DeFi and NFT adoption on the network. A New Era for Corporate Crypto Strategy? As corporate treasuries begin to resemble diversified crypto portfolios, the emergence of XRP as a reserve asset represents a new frontier. With its roots in real-world payments, and growing support within regulatory discussions, XRP offers a different value proposition compared to Bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative or Solana’s high-performance DeFi positioning. Trident’s move may prove to be a defining case study in how Web3-native firms can integrate blockchain assets beyond speculative exposure. However, the steep share price drop and looming financial pressures mean that the company will need to execute flawlessly to win back investor confidence. Whether Trident’s gamble will yield long-term strategic returns or serve as a cautionary tale remains to be seen—but one thing is clear: the age of blockchain-based corporate finance is accelerating, and XRP is staking its claim alongside Bitcoin and Solana. Ripple and SEC Propose $125 Million Settlement Split to End Years-Long Legal Battle The nearly five-year-long legal standoff between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may finally be approaching resolution, as both parties submitted a joint motion on Thursday to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York outlining a proposed settlement. In the motion, Ripple and the SEC asked Judge Analisa Torres to approve a plan that would dissolve the existing injunction against Ripple and allocate the $125 million penalty imposed in the case—$50 million would go to the SEC, while the remaining $75 million would be returned to Ripple. “Doing so would promote efficiency and the policy favoring settlements, obviate the need for additional litigation in this Court and the Court of Appeals, and be consistent with the SEC’s recent actions in other crypto registration cases,” lawyers for both sides stated in the joint court filing. Ripple’s Long Legal Road Nears Its End The case began in December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple, alleging the blockchain company had unlawfully raised $1.3 billion through the sale of its native cryptocurrency XRP, which the agency argued qualified as an unregistered security. The lawsuit instantly became one of the most high-profile crypto enforcement actions in SEC history, setting the tone for regulatory battles throughout the industry. In a landmark ruling in July 2023, Judge Torres handed down a split decision. She ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP , executed through blind bid processes on exchanges, did not constitute securities offerings. However, she found that Ripple’s direct institutional sales did fall under the purview of securities law, making the company liable for a $125 million penalty related to those transactions. Since the court’s decision, the legal process has shifted focus from liability to remedy. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse declared in March 2025 that the company’s legal fight with the SEC was “effectively over,” after the agency dropped its planned appeal. However, procedural hurdles have continued to delay final closure. Just last month, Judge Torres rejected a request from the parties for an indicative ruling under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs relief from a final judgment. She noted that Ripple and the SEC had failed to meet the “heavy burden” required to vacate an injunction and emphasized that such actions should only be granted under “exceptional circumstances.” Thursday’s filing attempts to clear that bar, citing significant developments in the regulatory landscape since the case began. Chief among them is the SEC’s recent policy shift under the Trump administration, which took office in January. Since then, the SEC has disbanded several ongoing investigations into crypto firms, dropped high-profile enforcement actions, and launched a new crypto-focused task force aimed at crafting a more pragmatic regulatory framework. Implications for the Broader Crypto Landscape If the court approves the proposed $50 million/$75 million split and lifts the injunction against Ripple, it would not only bring a long and expensive legal saga to a close but also signal a dramatic de-escalation of tensions between US regulators and major crypto firms. Since the exit of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler earlier this year, the agency’s crypto posture has notably softened. Several cases against leading firms—including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken—have either been scaled back or settled, and roundtable discussions are now guiding future regulatory frameworks instead of courtroom battles. Ripple’s case has long been viewed as a litmus test for how securities law applies to digital assets, and any settlement would likely be referenced in future enforcement and compliance strategies across the crypto industry. While XRP’s legal status remains partially resolved, the proposed compromise may allow Ripple to resume full-scale operations without further legal uncertainty—and reclaim significant funds to reinvest in its ecosystem and international expansion. Judge Torres will now review the joint motion and determine whether the proposed settlement meets the legal standards necessary to amend the final judgment. If granted, it could mark the end of one of the most closely watched legal battles in cryptocurrency history. Until then, both Ripple and the SEC appear aligned in wanting to put the past behind them and look forward to a regulatory environment that is clearer, more collaborative, and better suited to the evolving dynamics of the digital asset space.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-13 05:30:00

Writing on X, Coutts observed that his proprietary Global Liquidity Index broke to a fresh all-time high on 10 April after three years of drift and that, in the nine weeks since, Bitcoin has rallied about 40 percent. “Bitcoin has rallied 40% since April 10 which was when my global liquidity aggregate (GLI) after 3 years broke out to new all time highs on the back of a plummeting US dollar. Since then the aggregate is up 2%. Bitcoin’s Q2 rally is entirely consistent with liquidity regimes of this nature.” He added that “while Bitcoin’s sensitivity to GLI moderates over time, for every extra 1 percent of liquidity added to the system we should expect to see a > 20 percent move in the price of Bitcoin,” he said, further claiming that the steady inflow of capital “doesn’t account for the inevitable ‘oh shit’ moment of panic buying that is going to happen… eventually. It will be best of times, it will be the worst of times.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos The chart he shared, reproduced above, overlays his GLI (white) with daily Bitcoin prices (orange) from 2018 through June 2025. It shows the index pressing to roughly $138 trillion while Bitcoin changes hands near $108,000, underscoring the tight directional relationship between the two series across several liquidity cycles. Coutts builds the indicator by combining G4 central-bank balance sheets, broad money aggregates such as M2, and key US liquidity accounts including the Treasury General Account and the Federal Reserve’s reverse-repo facility. Since the April breakout the GLI has added only about two percentage points, yet Bitcoin’s market value has already risen by twice the elasticity implied by his model—an outcome he considers “entirely consistent” with prior liquidity regimes, which tend to produce the sharpest price response early in the cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Wildly Undervalued, Says Bitwise: ‘Fair Price’ Today Is $230,000 For now, he sees little evidence that the GLI’s momentum is cresting; with the Federal Reserve still draining its reverse-repo facility, the People’s Bank of China quietly expanding its balance sheet, and the European Central Bank hinting at renewed long-term refinancing operations, the backdrop remains structurally bullish even if it won’t be a straight line. Looking further out, mainstream liquidity research suggests modest but persistent growth: most macro desks expect the global aggregate to rise roughly one to six percent over the next twelve months, three to eight percent cumulatively by mid-2027, and on the order of ten to fifteen percent by the turn of the decade as governments roll over record debt loads and central banks normalise balance-sheet policies. If Coutts’ rule of thumb holds, even the low end of those projections would leave ample headroom for triple-digit percentage gains in Bitcoin before 2030. At press time, BTC traded at $107,676.

A recent statement attributed to prominent figure Howard Lutnick suggests one such significant shift may be on the horizon, potentially impacting everything from traditional stock markets to the volatile realm of digital assets. The core message? The current pause on China tariffs is unlikely to last. Who is Howard Lutnick and Why Does His View on China Tariffs Matter? Before diving into the implications, it’s important to understand the source. Howard Lutnick is a highly influential figure in the financial world, serving as the Chairman and CEO of BGC Partners and Cantor Fitzgerald. These are major players in global financial services, market brokerage, and real estate. Lutnick’s positions give him unique insights into global capital flows, market sentiment, and macroeconomic trends. When someone with his access and perspective speaks about major trade policy like China tariffs , markets and analysts tend to pay close attention. His comments, reportedly shared via Solid Intel on X, signal a potential change in the landscape that could have far-reaching consequences. Understanding the US-China Trade Context The history of recent US-China trade relations has been marked by periods of tension and negotiation, particularly concerning tariffs. Introduced primarily during the Trump administration, these tariffs imposed significant taxes on various goods imported from China, aiming to address trade imbalances and intellectual property concerns. While there have been phases of de-escalation or pauses on implementing new tariffs, the existing ones have remained a point of contention and a factor influencing supply chains and global economic planning. A ‘pause’ suggests a temporary hold or a lack of new escalations, but Lutnick’s view indicates this temporary state is nearing its conclusion. What Happens if the China Tariff Pause Ends? The potential end of the pause on China tariffs isn’t just a technical trade adjustment; it’s a policy shift with tangible economic effects. If new tariffs are imposed or existing ones are increased, several outcomes are likely: Increased Costs: Importers in the US would face higher costs for goods from China, which could be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. Supply Chain Disruption: Businesses might accelerate efforts to diversify supply chains away from China, a process that is complex, costly, and can lead to short-term disruptions. Retaliation: China could respond with its own tariffs on US goods and services, harming American exporters, particularly in sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. Reduced Trade Volume: Overall trade between the two economic giants could decrease, impacting businesses reliant on this exchange. This scenario paints a picture of increased economic friction between the world’s two largest economies, creating uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. How Could Renewed Tariffs Impact Global Markets? The potential re-escalation of the US-China trade conflict is a significant macroeconomic factor that directly influences global markets . Financial markets dislike uncertainty, and renewed trade tensions inject a large dose of it. Here’s how markets could react: Stock Market Volatility: Sectors heavily reliant on trade with China (e.g., technology, manufacturing, retail) could see increased volatility and potential downturns. Broader market indices might react negatively to the prospect of reduced corporate profits and economic slowdown. Investor Sentiment: A breakdown in trade relations can sour investor sentiment globally, leading to a more risk-averse approach. This might cause a rotation out of riskier assets into perceived safe havens. Currency Fluctuations: The US dollar and the Chinese Yuan could see movements based on trade flows and central bank interventions. Other currencies tied to global trade might also be affected. Commodity Prices: Demand for certain commodities could shift based on supply chain changes and industrial activity in both countries. Monitoring statements from figures like Howard Lutnick becomes crucial for market participants trying to navigate this complex environment. Exploring the Cryptocurrency Impact For those focused on digital assets, the potential end of the China tariffs pause raises questions about the cryptocurrency impact . While crypto markets often operate on their own unique drivers, they are not entirely immune to macroeconomic forces and shifts in global sentiment. Here are a few ways renewed trade tensions could play out: Safe Haven Narrative: In times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, assets outside the traditional financial system, like Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as potential safe havens. Increased trade tensions could bolster this narrative, potentially driving some capital into crypto. Risk-Off Sentiment: Conversely, if renewed tariffs trigger a broader ‘risk-off’ sentiment across global markets , cryptocurrencies, which are still considered high-risk by many traditional investors, could see outflows alongside stocks and other growth assets. Inflation Hedge? If tariffs contribute to inflation in the US by increasing import costs, assets perceived as inflation hedges, including Bitcoin, might gain attention. Capital Flight: In some scenarios, increased economic friction or capital controls related to trade could potentially lead to capital seeking alternative avenues, some of which might flow into cryptocurrencies, although this is a more speculative outcome. The relationship is complex and not always direct, but it’s clear that major shifts in US-China trade relations add another layer of macro uncertainty that crypto investors must consider. Challenges and Opportunities Arising from Trade Shifts The end of the tariff pause presents significant challenges but also potential opportunities: Challenges: Increased costs for businesses and consumers. Disruption of established supply chains. Reduced profitability for companies reliant on US-China trade. Heightened geopolitical risk. Potential for slower global economic growth. Opportunities: Incentive for companies to diversify supply chains to other countries. Potential boost for domestic industries that compete with Chinese imports. Increased focus on technological innovation to reduce reliance on imports. Possible increased interest in alternative assets (like certain cryptocurrencies) if traditional markets face sustained pressure. Navigating these requires careful analysis and strategic planning. Actionable Insights for Investors Given the potential for renewed China tariffs and their impact on global markets and the potential cryptocurrency impact , what steps can investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on official announcements regarding trade policy and expert opinions like those from Howard Lutnick . Review Portfolio Diversification: Assess exposure to sectors and companies heavily involved in US-China trade. Consider diversifying across different geographies and asset classes. Evaluate Supply Chain Risk: For stock investors, understand how companies in your portfolio manage their supply chains and their vulnerability to tariff changes. Consider Alternative Assets: If you believe trade tensions will increase market volatility or inflation, research how assets like gold or certain cryptocurrencies might fit into your strategy (understanding the risks involved with crypto). Long-Term Perspective: Trade disputes can create short-term noise. Focus on your long-term investment goals rather than reacting impulsively to daily headlines. Understanding the interplay between geopolitics, trade policy, and financial markets is key in uncertain times. Conclusion: Preparing for Potential Trade Headwinds Howard Lutnick’s reported comments serve as a timely reminder that the pause in China tariffs is not a permanent state. The potential return or escalation of these tariffs could introduce significant headwinds for US-China trade , disrupt global markets , and have an indirect but notable cryptocurrency impact . While the exact timing and nature of any policy changes remain to be seen, staying informed about the views of influential figures like Howard Lutnick and understanding the potential consequences is essential for navigating the complex economic landscape ahead. Investors across all asset classes should prepare for potential increased volatility and consider how renewed trade tensions might affect their portfolios.

The move was first reported by Fortune on June 12 and marks the company’s most extensive crypto integration to date. Select U.S. merchants will be able to accept USD Coin ( USDC ), a dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by crypto firm Circle, which recently completed one of the year’s largest IPOs. The pilot program will begin later this month. Shopify plans to expand stablecoin payments to all merchants across the U.S. and Europe by the end of 2025. The rollout is powered by a collaboration with Coinbase and Stripe. Coinbase helped Shopify build a custom crypto payments protocol on its Base blockchain, supporting chargebacks, refunds, and other retail-specific complexities. Stripe, one of Shopify’s core payment partners, is embedding stablecoin functionality directly into Shopify’s software stack. You might also like: Helio revamps crypto payments for Shopify with Solana Pay The program will be opt-out, meaning stablecoin payments will be turned on by default. Merchants who prefer not to accept USDC must manually disable the option. Those who do accept it will be eligible for up to 0.5% cash back on USDC transactions. Later this year, customers paying in USDC will also receive cash-back incentives. “I think other payment processors will look at what Shopify is building and be like, ‘Holy crap,’” said Jesse Pollak, head of Coinbase’s blockchain and wallet divisions. Shopify chief executive officer Tobias Lütke, also a Coinbase board member, emphasized the company’s alignment with crypto’s core principles during remarks at a Coinbase event on June 12. While Shopify has long supported crypto through third-party plug-ins, this marks its first native, platform-wide crypto integration. And it comes as stablecoins gain serious traction. Monthly stablecoin payment volume has surged from $2 billion to over $6.3 billion in the past two years, according to a blog post by Stripe. Companies like Visa, PayPal, JPMorgan, and Deutsche Bank are now building or using stablecoin infrastructure. Apple, Meta, Airbnb, and Google have also explored integrations. With Shopify now pushing stablecoin functionality into the hands millions of of merchants across 34 countries, digital commerce payments appears to be quietly shifting toward faster, borderless, regulated transactions.

According to the company’s June 12 press release , the notes, which do not pay interest and are due in 2032, will be sold privately to large institutional investors. GameStop also gave buyers the option to purchase an extra $450 million worth of notes, which could bring the total to $2.7 billion. The company expects the sale to close on June 17. After fees and costs, GameStop says it will receive about $2.23 billion, or $2.68 billion if the additional notes are sold. The funds will go toward general business needs, including investments and possible acquisitions. While GameStop has not confirmed plans to buy more Bitcoin ( BTC ), the move follows an earlier sale in April where it raised $1.5 billion and used part of the funds to buy 4,710 BTC worth $512 million. As previously reported by crypto.news, the June 11 announcement of the initial $1.75 billion offering triggered a sharp 20% selloff in GameStop shares.

With a dwindling retail footprint and declining core revenues, which dropped 17% quarter-over-quarter in Q1, the company has been doubling down on digital assets. GameStop is one of several public companies that now hold large amounts of Bitcoin. Its May purchase made it the 13th largest corporate holder, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. The company’s broader strategy appears to echo Strategy’s shift, where aggressive Bitcoin accumulation became central to market valuation despite stagnant product revenues. The newly priced notes carry a conversion rate equivalent to $28.91 per share, a 32.5% premium over the average June 12 trading price. The notes do not bear interest, and GameStop cannot redeem them until June 2029, unless certain thresholds are met. Investors may convert early under specific conditions or demand redemption in 2028. The offering gives GameStop more time and flexibility as it looks for ways to recover from declining sales and changing demand in the gaming and retail space.

If you’ve been watching the charts lately, you’ve likely seen some dramatic price swings. These movements, while exciting for some, can be brutal for others, especially those involved in crypto futures trading. We just witnessed a staggering event: over $321 million worth of crypto futures positions were liquidated in a single hour across major exchanges. Looking at the bigger picture, the past 24 hours saw total liquidations exceed a massive $636 million . These numbers aren’t just statistics; they represent significant losses for traders and highlight the inherent risks in the volatile crypto market . What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations? Let’s break down what these dramatic crypto liquidations actually mean. In simple terms, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange because they no longer have sufficient margin to keep the trade open. Think of margin as the collateral you put down for a loan (in this case, the leverage). If the market moves against your position, and your losses start eating into your margin, the exchange will automatically close your position to prevent your balance from going below zero. This prevents the exchange from losing money. It’s a swift, automated process designed to manage risk, but it can be devastating for the trader whose position is liquidated. Understanding Crypto Futures and Leveraged Trading The massive numbers we’re seeing are directly linked to crypto futures and the use of leveraged trading . Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) at a specific price on a future date. They are popular tools for speculation and hedging. Leverage is where things get amplified. Leveraged trading allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, with 10x leverage, you can open a $10,000 position with only $1,000 of your own money. This magnifies potential profits if the market moves in your favor. However, it also magnifies potential losses if the market moves against you. This is the core mechanism that leads to liquidations. Here’s a quick look at how leverage impacts your risk: Low Leverage (e.g., 2x-5x): Requires a larger margin percentage. More room for the market to move against you before liquidation. High Leverage (e.g., 20x-100x or more): Requires a much smaller margin percentage. Very little room for the market to move against you. A small price swing can trigger liquidation. The recent $321 million liquidation hour suggests that many traders were using high leverage, making their positions extremely vulnerable to even minor market fluctuations. The Role of Crypto Market Volatility The crypto market volatility is the fuel that drives these large-scale liquidation events. Cryptocurrencies are known for their rapid and unpredictable price swings. Unlike traditional markets, crypto can experience double-digit percentage moves in a single day, or even an hour. When many traders have leveraged long positions (betting the price will go up), a sudden sharp drop in price can trigger a cascade of liquidations. As positions are closed, selling pressure increases, potentially driving the price down further, which then triggers even more liquidations. This is often referred to as a ‘liquidation cascade’ or ‘long squeeze’. Conversely, a rapid price surge can cause a ‘short squeeze’, liquidating traders who were betting on the price falling. The recent event seems to be a result of a significant price drop, catching many leveraged long traders off guard. This highlights a key challenge of trading in this space: managing the extreme volatility. Navigating Trading Risk: Lessons from the Wipeout The recent liquidation event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent trading risk involved in leveraged crypto futures. While the potential rewards of leverage are high, the risks are equally, if not more, significant. So, what can traders learn from this? Challenges of Leveraged Trading: Magnified Losses: A small market move can wipe out your entire margin. Liquidation Risk: The constant threat of your position being forcibly closed. Emotional Toll: High leverage can lead to stressful decision-making and impulsive actions. Funding Rates: Holding leveraged positions overnight can incur costs. Actionable Insights for Managing Trading Risk: For anyone engaging with crypto futures or considering leveraged trading , here are some crucial steps to mitigate the trading risk : Understand Leverage: Don’t use leverage you don’t fully comprehend. Start small and understand the margin requirements and liquidation price for your specific position. Use Stop-Loss Orders: This is perhaps the most critical tool. A stop-loss order automatically closes your position if the price hits a certain level, limiting your potential loss and preventing liquidation. Avoid Excessive Leverage: Just because you can use 100x leverage doesn’t mean you should. Lower leverage gives your position more breathing room against crypto market volatility . Risk Management is Key: Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose on a single trade. Consider position sizing relative to your overall portfolio. Stay Informed: Keep track of market news, technical indicators, and sentiment. While volatility is inherent, sudden news or shifts can trigger rapid moves. Consider the Funding Rate: Understand the cost of holding leveraged positions, especially during periods of high market demand for leverage. Examples of good practice include setting stop-losses immediately after opening a leveraged position and using a trading journal to track decisions and outcomes. The Broader Impact on the Crypto Market While painful for individual traders, these large liquidation events can also have broader effects on the crypto market . They can contribute to price volatility in the short term, potentially leading to temporary price bottoms as forced selling exhausts itself, or conversely, accelerating downward trends. They also serve as a reset, sometimes clearing out over-leveraged positions and potentially setting the stage for more sustainable price movements later. However, they underscore that the market remains susceptible to sharp, rapid moves driven by leveraged positions. Conclusion: Navigating the Storms of Crypto Futures The recent event, seeing hundreds of millions in crypto liquidations within hours, is a powerful illustration of the amplified risks in crypto futures trading, especially when using high leveraged trading . It’s a direct consequence of the intense crypto market volatility colliding with aggressive positions. While the potential for profit is a draw, the reality of trading risk means that caution, education, and robust risk management strategies are not optional – they are essential. Understanding how liquidations happen and implementing tools like stop-losses can be the difference between weathering a market storm and being swept away by it. Trade smart, manage your risk, and respect the power of leverage in this dynamic market.

Circle’s latest development happened amid growing regulatory focus in the US on establishing a stablecoin framework, with officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent promoting dollar-pegged stablecoins as instruments to uphold the dollar’s global dominance. Meanwhile, stablecoin issuer Tether continues to diversify beyond fiat-backed tokens with its recent $89.4 million acquisition of a 32% stake in Elemental Altus Royalties. It is expected that this acquisition will help strengthen its position in gold-backed assets and enhance the appeal of its XAUt token. At the same time, US Bancorp is revisiting its crypto strategy under the Trump administration by reviving its custody services and even exploring stablecoin initiatives of its own. Overall, this convergence of corporate, banking, and government interest could be a pivotal moment. XRP Ledger Welcomes USDC Circle’s USDC stablecoin officially launched on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). This is a big step in integrating traditional financial tools with decentralized blockchain infrastructure. The addition of the overcollateralized, dollar-pegged USDC token to the XRPL allows users to leverage XRP as a bridge asset, which will enable seamless transfers between decentralized exchanges (DEXs) using the network’s auto-bridging feature. RippleX Senior Vice President Markus Infanger said that stablecoins are becoming crucial on-ramps into the crypto economy, especially for applications centered on utility rather than speculation. The launch coincides with a regulatory push in the United States to establish a comprehensive framework for stablecoins as the market capitalization of the sector climbs past $237 billion. Policymakers increasingly see stablecoins as strategic tools to maintain the global influence of the US dollar. Issuers of overcollateralized stablecoins typically invest in short-term US Treasury bills, using the yield from these government securities as profit while also strengthening the demand for US debt. Overview of the stablecoin market (Source: RWA.xyz ) This mechanism took on added importance as concerns about the US government’s creditworthiness and ballooning debt levels led some foreign governments to reduce their holdings of US bonds. Such sell-offs raise yields and drive up borrowing costs for the US government, compounding the already high $36 trillion national debt . To counter this trend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pledged at the White House Crypto Summit in March to support stablecoin development as a way to enhance the salability and global demand for the US dollar. Nevertheless, critics like Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser argue that relying on stablecoins to prop up the dollar is a short-term solution that will not prevent the long-term decline of the fiat system. Keiser believes that stablecoins backed by gold may ultimately outperform dollar-pegged tokens due to gold’s intrinsic resistance to inflation and its high stock-to-flow ratio, which ensures a more stable store of value. Tether Acquires Major Stake in Elemental Altus Royalties Circle is not the only stablecoin issuer making moves. Tether acquired a 32% stake in Canada’s Elemental Altus Royalties as part of a strategic move to diversify its assets beyond stablecoins. The stablecoin issuer announced the $89.4 million deal on Thursday, which involved purchasing over 78 million common shares from La Mancha Investments at CA$1.55 ($1.14) per share. This acquisition is part of Tether’s strategy to integrate long-term stable assets like gold and Bitcoin into its digital financial ecosystem to reduce risk and build resilience in its infrastructure. Elemental operates on a royalty and streaming model that provides exposure to global gold production without the operational risks of mining. Tether sees this as a low-risk way to back its digital assets with real-world value, enhancing transparency and financial stability. CEO Paolo Ardoino explained that investments in gold and Bitcoin are essential for creating a more durable and transparent financial system, and called the move a step toward building infrastructure for the next century. The acquisition also boosts Tether’s gold-backed stablecoin, Tether Gold (XAUt) , which has grown to become the largest gold-backed cryptocurrency by market cap. XAUt reached a market cap of $854 million in April, coinciding with gold’s 30% surge year-to-date that saw spot prices peak at $3,500 before dipping slightly to around $3,433. Tether hinted that its stake in Elemental could support even more expansion into commodity-backed digital assets. This purchase was made after a series of high-profile investments by Tether after it reported a record $13 billion profit in 2024 and formally expanded its focus beyond stablecoins in April of 2024. In May, the company acquired $458.7 million worth of Bitcoin for Twenty One Capital, a firm set to merge with Cantor Equity Partners, and later moved another $3.9 billion in BTC to the same firm. These transactions made Tether the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder behind Strategy and MARA. Earlier this year, Tether also took a 30% stake in Italian media company Be Water, and invested in the Juventus football club. US Bancorp Eyes Stablecoins Meanwhile, US Bancorp’s institutional crypto custody business is experiencing a resurgence under the crypto-supportive Trump administration, according to CEO Gunjan Kedia. At the Morgan Stanley US Financials Conference , Kedia explained that the bank’s crypto custody product, which was originally launched in 2021 , failed to gain traction during the Biden administration due to regulatory uncertainty. However, she said that institutional interest is returning now that the regulatory climate has shifted, and the bank is once again able to offer the service to clients. Gunjan Kedia The earlier stagnation of US Bancorp’s crypto offering was largely attributed to the SEC’s aggressive stance during the Biden era, which saw a number of enforcement actions against digital asset companies and offerings. These regulatory hurdles made large institutional investors very cautious about entering the space. With the Trump administration reversing many of these enforcement efforts and promising to stop more regulatory crackdowns, banks like US Bancorp are revisiting their role in the digital asset ecosystem. In addition to renewed interest in crypto custody, Kedia revealed that US Bancorp is closely monitoring developments around stablecoins. The bank is considering what role it might play in the growing stablecoin economy , including the possibility of launching its own dollar-pegged token. She explained that this would likely involve partnerships and pilot programs that are already underway. Moreover, the bank could take on a broader role in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure, like custody for the backing assets and escrow services, although she acknowledged that many details still need to be resolved. Kedia also pointed out that despite the headline growth in stablecoin transactions, a lot of the current volume is still limited to crypto-to-crypto activity rather than real-world payments. She believes that the path forward for traditional financial institutions in the stablecoin space will become clearer as legislation like the GENIUS Act progresses.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|USDT|XRP|USDC|XAUT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-13 06:12:32

The move is the latest effort in concluding their nearly five-year legal dispute. Both parties have requested that the Manhattan District Court issue a ruling to “dissolve the injunction against Ripple.” They said the court to allow for $50 million fines to go to the SEC, with the rest $75 million released to Ripple. Last month, a judge rejected a proposed settlement that would have reduced Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million. Judge Analisa Torres stressed that the SEC and Ripple must show “exceptional circumstances” to vacate a final judgment. @Ripple settles with the @SECGov , agreeing to pay a $50M penalty and dropping its cross-appeal, marking the near conclusion of a long-standing lawsuit. #SEC #Crypto #Ripple https://t.co/txqDDCnn0G — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 25, 2025 In the new request filed Thursday, Ripple and the SEC are trying to show that the circumstances now justify closing the case and lifting the restrictions. End of the Legal Battle? If Judge Torres approves this settlement, it would remove any remaining limits on Ripple’s ability to operate and return a significant amount of funds to the exchange. Further, the judgment could formally end the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. It would also mean that XRP has a legal ground in the US, potentially opening the door for broader institutional use and growth. “Doing so would promote efficiency and the policy favoring settlements, obviate the need for additional litigation in this Court and the Court of Appeals, and be consistent with the SEC’s recent actions in other crypto registration cases,” the Thursday filing read. Additionally, lawyers for Ripple and the SEC said that “there are ‘exceptional circumstances’ beyond the Settlement Agreement itself.” This justifies the modification of the final judgment to facilitate settlement, obviate the pending appeals, and conserve both parties’ resources. The Five-Year Saga: Ripple Declared Victory in March In 2020, the regulator accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion via a sale, which it says an unregistered security. Over a year ago, Judge Torres noted that some of Ripple’s sales did not violate securities laws. However, she ruled that other direct sales of the token to institutional investors were securities. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that the regulator has dropped its appeal, marking a decisive win for Ripple. This is it – the moment we’ve been waiting for. The SEC will drop its appeal – a resounding victory for Ripple, for crypto, every way you look at it. The future is bright.

According to Lummis, the bill, if passed, would have professionals using AI tools legally obligated to perform due diligence and validate the tech’s outputs. In a Thursday X post, the Republican Senator commented: “Today, I introduced the RISE Act of 2025 — legislation to protect innovation, empower professionals, and bring real transparency to powerful AI systems.” ~ Senator Cynthia Lummis Lummis’ RISE Act would require developers to disclose AI model specifications In a string of X posts, Lummis argued that artificial intelligence is progressing quickly and is now utilized across multiple fields, including medicine, law, and finance. However, developers still lack clarity on who remains accountable when these AI tools are used. In her view, current liability laws put developers at risk, even when licensed professionals use the tools responsibly and within their expertise. However, Lummis claimed her bill would change that and protect AI developers who meet transparency and documentation standards. In a press release, Lummis clarified that the RISE Act does not offer “blanket immunity” for AI, rather, it will need developers to reveal model specifications, allowing professionals to make informed choices about the tools they use. That means licensed professionals are ultimately responsible for the advice and decisions they make. If the bill passes, developers must disclose how the AI was trained and tested, its strengths and limitations, and the prompts and constraints that guide its behavior. Therefore, if a licensed professional uses an AI tool with a clear understanding of its capabilities and an issue arises, the developer would be shielded from civil lawsuit—provided they met their obligations and acted responsibly. The Republican senator maintained that developers have to be transparent and professionals make sound judgments, and if both parties fulfill their obligations, innovation shouldn’t be punished when mistakes happen. The House of Representatives approved a 10-year moratorium on states enforcing their own laws The House of Representatives recently passed the tax and spending bill , including a 10-year moratorium on states enforcing their artificial intelligence laws. The bill is still under consideration in the Senate, but if lawmakers approve it, US states cannot implement their individual AI regulations. Before the bill passed in the House, Representative David Joyce of Ohio had pushed for the law, arguing that there had been multiple AI bills varying in definitions, requirements, and enforcement mechanisms introduced since January, arousing uncertainty. However, he hoped it could pave the way for a national AI framework to provide more clarity for the industry. He remarked, “This law is a prime example of targeting a specific harm with a narrowly tailored law to fill a gap that has been identified in existing law.” However, some Democrats opposed the moratorium, saying it would be a giveaway to tech giants. Representative Lori Trahan, for instance, claimed that while a patchwork of different state laws can be chaotic, the moratorium is still not a great policy as it would hinder states from taking prompt actions when necessary. On June 4, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the moratorium when Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene threatened to vote against the package because of the provision’s inclusion. Greene believed the moratorium would infringe on state rights, adding that she was unaware of its inclusion in the bill. Her resistance could easily jeopardize the bill’s final passage since it passed the House by just one extra vote. Johnson argued that he likes the bill in its current state and that having 50 different states regulating AI would have serious national security implications.

The researcher recently underscored XRP’s fundamental role in executing transactions on the Ripple settlement network. He affirmed that XRP is not merely a speculative asset but a core component required for the functionality of Ripple’s transactional infrastructure. He wrote, “XRP IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS ON THE RIPPLE NETWORK AND WILL GAIN VALUE AS NETWORK ADOPTION GROWS” The post also references a particularly decisive line from the document: “The XRP token embodies, in effect, a licensing right for the Ripple transactional system.” This assertion directly ties XRP’s value to the growth and adoption of Ripple’s technology in institutional and financial contexts. XRP IS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE TRANSACTIONS ON THE RIPPLE NETWORK AND WILL GAIN VALUE AS NETWORK ADOPTION GROWS “The XRP token embodies, in effect, a licensing right for the Ripple transactional system.” Yes, XRP holders will DIRECTLY benefit from Ripple’s success. … pic.twitter.com/EpyC5OZTnJ — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 11, 2025 Legal Analysis Affirms XRP’s Utility, Not Speculation The shared excerpt, from a 2025 publication titled The Future of Crypto Regulation, elaborates on the distinction between XRP and traditional securities such as stocks or bonds. The document clarifies that XRP does not entitle its holders to shares of Ripple’s profits or debt payments. Instead, XRP’s utility stems from its necessity in enabling transactions on Ripple’s settlement network. It describes how XRP holders are effectively acquiring access to a system that requires the token for its core operations. The excerpt explains that, “What XRP entitles the holder to is the token itself, which is integral to executing transactions on the Ripple settlement network.” This means the value of XRP is directly connected to the operational needs of the Ripple ecosystem. It continues: “To the extent the Ripple network is successful, XRP should increase in value, as the full functionality of the system requires the token.” This links the token’s market value to the degree of network adoption and usage, emphasizing that XRP is structurally embedded in the architecture of Ripple’s services. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Comparative Licensing Analogy and Value Proposition The document draws a parallel between Ripple’s use of XRP and how a pharmaceutical startup might monetize a drug patent. The analogy suggests that, just as a drug patent’s value is tied to the continued relevance and usage of the drug, XRP’s value is dependent on Ripple’s sustained success and expansion. Therefore, XRP holders are, in a legal and economic sense, acquiring an essential piece of the infrastructure that drives Ripple’s business model. The characterization of XRP as “a licensing right for the Ripple transactional system” reinforces its standing as a required operational tool rather than a passive investment vehicle. As the Ripple network grows and more institutions adopt the technology, the demand for XRP should increase in line with its necessity in facilitating network activity. T he information highlighted by SMQKE provides clarity on a critical aspect of XRP’s utility and value. It reaffirms that XRP is not merely an asset to Ripple’s operations but a functional and required component of the system, with its value tied directly to the network’s adoption.

Upon learning of this activity, McLean immediately took steps to secure the network and engaged digital forensics specialists to investigate what happened and help determine whether any sensitive information may have been impacted.” The company says an internal investigation revealed that an unknown entity gained unauthorized access “to its network and may have downloaded certain files” that contained individuals’ personal information, including first and last name, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers and financial account numbers. The firm says it has reported the data breach to federal law enforcement and provided “written notice of this incident to relevant state regulators, as necessary.” McLean Mortgage Corporation provides real estate mortgage services as well as advice on purchasing a home, loan first pre-approval and new construction. The firm says it issued letters of notice to affected individuals while offering a 12-month credit monitoring and identity theft protection service.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency WorldCoin WDC Token WDC Price $ 0.00349731 -10.28% Market Cap $ 0.00 Circulating Supply 0.00 Trading Volume $ 5.1958 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Q2 2025 price action for Worldcoin (WLD) clearly showed signs of exhaustion before it could push higher. Despite recent optimism, its inability to establish a sustained, long-term bullish trend remains evident. Looking at its historical performance, the recent Q2’s gains appear modest, like a mere bucket of water from a deep well. Since early 2024, WLD is still down over 80% from its highs, even with the latest price surge. The entire weekly price action on the Binance exchange resembles a converging price action structure in a falling channel. This pattern has given good returns when a catalyst shoots a breakout from this range. Many are now asking: What could truly push Worldcoin higher? As seen time and again in the crypto space, social sentiment is often the key driver. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly enhance Worldcoin’s perceived value. The recent investment marks a crucial first step in that direction. If, in the coming sessions, optimistic momentum builds up, then WLD must achieve a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure by breaking above the $2.12 level in May or June. Once this level is cleared and a ChoCh is confirmed, Worldcoin could break out of its bearish pattern and potentially retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, if WLD fails to maintain a bullish trajectory this year, its price could drop as low as $1.10.

The recent performance of Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) suggests a pattern remarkably similar to the groundbreaking launch and subsequent activity of Bitcoin ETFs. This trend is capturing significant attention in the crypto market, indicating growing institutional and retail interest in Ethereum as an investable asset class. Understanding the Dynamics of Ethereum ETF Inflows Recent analysis highlights a compelling comparison: the flow of funds into Ethereum (ETH) ETFs appears to be tracking the path previously blazed by Bitcoin ETFs, particularly when accounting for the difference in their respective market capitalizations. This isn’t just a casual observation; data points are reinforcing this narrative. For instance, on June 11th, U.S. spot ETH ETF products recorded a substantial net inflow totaling approximately $240 million. This figure represents the second-largest single-day inflow observed since these products began trading. More significantly, these ETH ETFs have demonstrated remarkable consistency, maintaining a trend of net inflows for 18 consecutive days. This sustained positive flow is a key indicator of robust demand. Comparing this to the initial phases of Bitcoin ETF trading, we see parallels in investor behavior and capital allocation. While the absolute dollar amounts might differ due to Bitcoin’s larger market size, the proportional interest relative to the asset’s valuation appears strikingly similar. This suggests that the investment thesis for allocating capital via regulated ETF structures is extending beyond Bitcoin to Ethereum. How Do Ethereum ETF Inflows Compare to Bitcoin ETF Trends? The comparison between Ethereum ETF inflows and Bitcoin ETF trends is crucial for understanding the maturing crypto investment landscape. When Bitcoin spot ETFs launched in the U.S. in January 2024, they saw unprecedented trading volume and significant initial inflows, albeit offset initially by outflows from older Grayscale products. However, the net trend quickly turned positive and remained strong for extended periods. Here’s a breakdown of the comparison points: Relative Scale: While Bitcoin’s market cap is significantly larger than Ethereum’s, the inflow amounts into ETH ETFs, when adjusted for this difference, show a comparable level of investor enthusiasm and capital deployment relative to the asset’s size. Sustained Inflows: Both asset classes have demonstrated periods of sustained net inflows into their ETF products after launch, indicating persistent buying pressure rather than just initial speculative interest. The 18 consecutive days of ETH ETF inflows is a strong signal mirroring similar streaks seen with Bitcoin ETFs. Market Impact: Both types of ETFs provide regulated, accessible avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure. Their inflows directly impact the underlying asset’s price dynamics by increasing demand for the spot asset held by the fund issuers. Investor Base: The investor base for both appears to be a mix of retail gaining easy access through brokerage accounts and institutions seeking regulated exposure without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. This similarity suggests that the regulatory approval and accessibility provided by the ETF structure are powerful drivers of adoption for major cryptocurrencies. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Growing Crypto ETF Popularity? The increasing popularity and inflows into both Ethereum ETF and Bitcoin ETF products bring several benefits and challenges to the forefront of the financial and crypto markets. Benefits: Increased Accessibility: ETFs make investing in crypto as easy as buying stocks through traditional brokerage accounts, opening the market to a much wider audience. Regulatory Clarity: Operating within regulated frameworks provides investors with greater confidence and protection compared to unregulated crypto exchanges. Institutional Adoption: ETFs are familiar vehicles for large institutions, facilitating their entry into the crypto space and potentially bringing significant capital. Price Discovery & Liquidity: Increased trading volume and interest can improve price discovery and add liquidity to the underlying assets. Challenges: Centralization Risk: A large portion of the asset supply being held by a few ETF issuers could introduce centralization risks. Market Volatility: While ETFs offer exposure, they don’t shield investors from the inherent price volatility of cryptocurrencies. Fee Structures: Investors pay management fees for ETFs, which can erode returns over time compared to direct ownership (though direct ownership has its own costs and risks). Potential for Market Manipulation: While regulated, large flows in and out of ETFs could potentially influence market dynamics. Despite the challenges, the overall trend of increasing ETF inflows is widely seen as a net positive for the long-term growth and legitimization of the crypto asset class. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching the development of ETH ETF and BTC ETF markets, the current trends offer several actionable insights: Monitor Inflow Trends: Consistent net inflows indicate strong buying pressure, which can be a bullish signal for the underlying asset price. Keep an eye on daily inflow data reported by financial news outlets. Understand the Correlation: Recognize that the success of Bitcoin ETFs has paved the way and set expectations for Ethereum ETFs. Their performance may continue to show correlated patterns. Evaluate Your Investment Goals: Determine if gaining crypto exposure through a regulated ETF aligns with your risk tolerance and investment strategy compared to direct ownership. Consider Diversification: The emergence of ETH ETFs alongside Bitcoin ETFs provides options for diversification within the crypto segment of a portfolio using traditional investment vehicles. Stay Informed on Regulations: The regulatory landscape for crypto and crypto-adjacent products is still evolving. Stay updated on any changes that could impact ETFs. The data on ETH ETF inflows suggests that Ethereum is following Bitcoin’s lead in attracting significant investment via regulated products. This trajectory could have substantial implications for ETH’s price and its position within the broader financial ecosystem. Concluding Thoughts on the Future of Crypto ETF Investment The recent surge in Ethereum ETF inflows, mirroring the earlier success of Bitcoin ETFs, underscores a pivotal moment for the digital asset market. It signals growing confidence from traditional investors and provides further validation of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment assets. As these regulated products gain traction, they are likely to continue bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of blockchain, potentially unlocking even greater capital flows into the space.

The drop came after Israel launched an attack on Iranian nuclear sites on June 12, causing Bitcoin to fall from $107,000 to $103,000. In just one day, around $636 million was liquidated from the market. Now, there are tensions about Bitcoin slipping further to $102,000 or even $101,000. Despite this bearish trend, many analysts still believe Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of the year . But the big question is — how will Bitcoin achieve this, and what are the key reasons behind such a massive prediction? Why Bitcoin Could Hit $200k By The Year End? In a recent episode , Scott Melker discussed with Alice Liu from CoinMarketCap strong reasons why Bitcoin could rally to $200,000 soon. Liu said, “Crypto market is the golden moment. You need a catalyst like this to trigger people in non-crypto space to look at this.” Big Companies Are Buying Bitcoin: Companies and institutions from the U.S., Europe, Japan, and other regions are adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasury reserves . This rising demand from businesses is putting extra buying pressure on the market while supply stays limited, especially after the recent Bitcoin halving . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Israel-Iran Conflict Triggers Crypto Crash: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices Plunge Hard , Supply Is Drying Up : Bitcoin miners are currently selling very little into the market, averaging only around 500 BTC a day. With more people and companies wanting to buy and less Bitcoin available, this supply-demand imbalance naturally pushes the price higher. Bitcoin Is Seen as Digital Gold: More investors now view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, much like gold. Large funds, corporate treasuries, and even some governments are considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset. This confidence is helping to build a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s next major price surge. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin is down today, June 13, 2025, primarily due to increased geopolitical tensions following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. This triggered a broader market sell-off and risk-off sentiment among investors. How does institutional buying influence Bitcoin’s price? Big companies and institutions buying Bitcoin for their corporate treasury reserves create significant buying pressure, pushing the price higher as supply remains constrained. How does Bitcoin’s supply affect its price potential? Bitcoin’s limited supply, especially with miners selling very little (around 500 BTC/day) after the halving, creates a supply-demand imbalance that naturally drives its price up.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 07:10:16

While the world’s largest asset manager hasn’t made any official move yet, Geraci says BlackRock is unlikely to sit back and watch others dominate this next wave of crypto ETFs. Btw, I still fully expect BlackRock to file for spot sol & xrp ETFs… As leader in both spot btc & eth ETFs, it would make *zero* sense to cede other top crypto asset ETF categories to competitors. Related, I also fully expect BlackRock to file for index-based crypto asset ETF. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) June 12, 2025 BlackRock Could Make a Move Soon, Will it be XRP or SOL? Geraci believes that with BlackRock already leading the charge in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , it won’t want to miss out on the next big opportunity, XRP or Solana. In his view, XRP is now better positioned thanks to recent legal clarity and the launch of regulated XRP futures on the CME . These futures contracts, he says, are often a key step before spot ETFs are filed. He even suggested that the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which already holds XRP, could be turned into a full-fledged ETF. Interestingly, Polymarket shows higher approval odds for SOL—XRP at 87%, Solana at 90%. Get ready for a potential Alt Coin ETF Summer with Solana likely leading the way (as well as some basket products) via @JSeyff note this morning which includes fresh odds for all the spot ETFs. pic.twitter.com/UMzih4oou7 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 10, 2025 Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas hinted at a possible “ Altcoin ETF Summer ,” suggesting that Solana could lead the charge in upcoming altcoin ETFs. He shared insights from fellow analyst James Seyffart’s latest note, which includes updated odds for various spot ETF approvals. The post points to growing optimism around both individual altcoin ETFs and broader crypto basket products gaining traction soon. Why the Hold-Up? Despite the growing momentum, BlackRock remains focused on its two crypto products, the iShares Bitcoin Trust and the iShares Ethereum Trust, which have both seen strong performance. Last year, BlackRock’s ETF head, Samara Cohen, mentioned that only Bitcoin and Ethereum met their standards for liquidity and maturity. It’s unclear whether that stance has evolved since XRP’s legal status has become clearer. Still, regulatory uncertainty remains. Ripple and the SEC are awaiting final approval of their settlement, and XRP’s futures market is still developing compared to BTC and ETH. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For June 13 , XRP ETF Filings Piling Up While BlackRock watches from the sidelines, other major players are taking the lead. Firms like Bitwise, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton have all submitted applications for spot XRP ETFs. But so far, the SEC has delayed its decision. The regulator recently extended its review period for 21Shares’ ETF to October and has yet to respond to Grayscale’s filing from May. WisdomTree’s XRP Trust is now under formal review , with the SEC asking the public for input on risks such as market manipulation. Global Progress Already Underway Outside the U.S., XRP ETFs are already gaining ground. In Switzerland, 21Shares offers the AXRP ETP, while Brazil has become the first country to greenlight a spot XRP ETF . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As of June 2025, BlackRock has not officially filed for an XRP ETF. While there is significant industry speculation and predictions that BlackRock will eventually enter the XRP ETF market, no formal application has been submitted yet. What are the XRP ETF approval odds in 2025? Approval odds for a U.S. XRP ETF by the end of 2025 have ranged from 81% to as high as 98% on prediction markets, reflecting strong optimism but also ongoing regulatory uncertainty. How high could XRP go if BlackRock files for an ETF? If BlackRock files for a spot XRP ETF, analysts predict XRP could double from its current price and potentially surpass $3 within a week, with a possible rally to $4.60 or even its all-time high of $3.40 or higher in the following months.",News|Crypto ETF,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 07:13:19

The company registered nearly 58.7 million shares for potential resale in a Form S-3 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The news spooked investors, leading to a major sell-off and confusion over whether insiders were offloading stock. Chairman Lubin Clarifies: No Shares Sold Joseph Lubin, chairman of Sharplink and CEO of blockchain firm Consensys, attempted to set the record straight. He emphasized that the filing does not reflect any actual sales. “Some are misinterpreting” the filing, Lubin said on Wednesday. He clarified that the registration is standard practice following a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) deal and does not indicate any insider exit. “This is standard post-PIPE procedure in tradfi, not an indication of actual sales,” he said. Despite Lubin’s efforts to reassure markets, Sharplink’s stock dropped from $32.53 to under $8 in after-hours trading, according to Google Finance. It later recovered slightly to $10.55, marking a 67.6% drop from Thursday’s close. Treasury Strategy Involving Ether Raises Eyebrows Sharplink recently announced an ambitious Ethereum-based treasury strategy. The company disclosed plans on May 30 to raise up to $1 billion in equity, with a large portion earmarked for acquiring Ether (ETH). This strategy, backed by Consensys in a $425 million funding round, signaled a bold shift into blockchain-based assets. However, the timing of the filing and its perceived connection to share sales unsettled investors. Matt Corva, general counsel for Consensys, also weighed in, noting that the filing doesn’t imply actual selling. “It doesn’t reflect anyone’s sales, which may or may not ever happen,” Corva said. He added, “It’s a basic filing.” Existing Investors Spooked by Dilution Concerns BTCS Inc. CEO Charles Allen said the reaction is understandable. “This creates a prisoner’s dilemma: everyone rushes to sell before the others do — a classic race to the bottom,” he said. Allen suggested Sharplink could reverse the sell-off by immediately announcing their planned Ethereum purchase. “If they played cards right would expect a surprise PR tomorrow with $1b of ETH purchases — which could light the match to reignite the stock,” Allen noted. “They may have played it brilliantly,” he added. Despite reassurances from leadership, investor sentiment remains fragile as the firm moves forward with its crypto strategy.

According to data from Deribit, the contracts, scheduled to expire at 08:00 UTC, represent one of the largest expiries this quarter. The open interest includes nearly equal amounts of calls and puts, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.95. This suggests a slightly bullish bias, though the current spot price, hovering around $104,000, sits well below the max pain point of $107,000. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 At 08:00 UTC tomorrow, over $3.7B in crypto options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $3.04B notional | Put-Call: 0.95 | Max Pain: $107K $ETH : $687M notional | Put-Call: 1.20 | Max Pain: $2,700 ETH upside flows are strong heading into expiry. Will… pic.twitter.com/kLHnzspiXE — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) June 12, 2025 The max pain level is where option holders feel the most financial loss and often acts as a magnetic level in the final trading hours before expiry. Ethereum ( ETH ) options worth $678 million are also due to expire. Unlike Bitcoin ( BTC ), ETH’s put-to-call ratio sits at a more bearish 1.23, reflecting traders hedging downside risk after recent declines. Options are derivative contracts that grant traders the right, but not the obligation, to purchase (call) or sell (put) an asset at a fixed price. Spot prices may be impacted as traders unwind hedges or roll positions when large volumes of options expire. During these times, price frequently moves toward the maximum pain level, particularly in markets with low volume.

The total value of the cryptocurrency market has dropped 7% to $3.3 trillion, and Bitcoin has lost over 5% in the last day. Analysts point to Israel’s attack on Iran as the cause of the macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is beginning to show early signs of a trend shift. The price has slipped below the 20-day moving average, which is often used to predict short-term direction. A decline in bullish momentum is indicated by the relative strength index’s trend below the neutral 50 mark. Although volume has slightly increased, it is still insufficient to validate a complete bearish breakdown. BTC price analysis. Credit: crypto.news A short squeeze might be triggered if Bitcoin maintains above $101,000 and recovers $105,000 before expiration, which could push the price back toward $107,000, the maximum pain level and important resistance. Further declines could be possible if there is a clear break below $101,000, with $97,800 and $95,000 serving as potential support levels. A decline through those areas might signal a more significant correction.

The prime reason for this is the war tensions between Israel and Iran. The dispute escalated again as Israel launched an air strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities on June 13. Moreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest inflation report refused hopes for any interest rate cuts in June. This dual pressure from geopolitics and monetary policy has sent shockwaves through the market, leading to over $1.14 billion in liquidations. As crypto traders took the brunt, many sought refuge in safer assets like gold, with PAX Gold and Tether Gold among the rare green tokens in a sea of red. $1.14 Billion Worth Liquidation Hits Traders In the past 24 hours, 246,590 traders have been liquidated, which highlights a severe slash across the derivatives market. The total liquidations as of press time have spiked to $1.14 billion, emphasizing the intense volatility triggered by the external factors. Source: CoinGlass The single largest liquidation was registered on Binance’s BTC/USDT pair, wiping out a jaw-dropping $201.31 million in one go. Binance accounted for the largest share overall, registering $455.60M, Bybit followed next with $370.83M, and OKX with $125.58M. Bitcoin and Ethereum took the major brunt among cryptocurrencies, with $443.77M and $289.96M, respectively, in liquidation volume. Other altcoins, such as SOL, saw $51.95M, and DOGE took $25.61M in liquidations. Source: CoinGlass Where Is the Crypto Market Heading? At the time of press, the total market cap of the industry stands at $3.37 trillion, down 2.51%, while 24-hour trading volume is down 4.77% at $129.97 billion. The Fear & Greed Index remains at a greed-driven score of 61, which is expected to come lower as the day passes. Bitcoin presently trades 3.12% lower at $104,437.94, while Ethereum has taken a bigger hit, down 8.85% at $2,517.03. Major altcoins also faced pressure, with XRP at a 5.47% loss to $2.12 and SOL down 9.74% to $144.33. With BTC dominance at 63.2% and ETH at 9.8%, the market remains heavily reliant on Bitcoin’s resilience. However, unless geopolitical risks settle and macroeconomic stability returns, further downside could be in store.

While the broader trend remains under pressure, short-term indicators hint at a potential base forming as traders assess oversold conditions across multiple timeframes. What’s Happening With XRP’s Price? XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The recent XRP price action saw a swift drop from the $2.30–$2.32 range into the $2.09–$2.11 zone, a selloff that coincided with a broad correction across major altcoins. On the 4-hour chart, price broke below a rising trendline support and tested a key demand block between $2.06 and $2.10. That level also aligns with the long-term support trendline extending from the April low, which helped initiate the prior rally toward $2.50. XRP price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Despite the pullback, XRP has held above the weekly 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $2.11, measured from the late-2024 swing low to its 2025 high. A weekly close above this line would keep the broader uptrend technically intact.

Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) has announced a partnership with Lufthansa ’s Miles & More, Europe’s largest frequent flyer program, to offer new utility to its The Huddle, the Pudgy Penguins community. The collaboration enables users to earn airline miles through purchases made on the Pudgy Shop using either PENGU or fiat. The earned miles can then be redeemed with over 300 Miles & More partners for flights, travel experiences, and other rewards.

You might also like: Pudgy Penguins partners with NASCAR to reach new audience The announcement comes at a pivotal moment for PENGU price, which is currently trading at a make-or-break level, testing a key confluence zone marked by both the ascending trendline and a horizontal support range around $0.0090–0.0093. This area has previously acted as resistance and now aligns with the rising trendline that has supported the uptrend since early April, making it a technically significant level. Source: TradingView The price recently broke below the 20 EMA and is now sitting just above the trendline, with the 50 SMA also looming above as overhead resistance. The RSI is near 40, while the MACD has confirmed a bearish crossover, with histogram bars widening — both pointing to building downward pressure. However, because the price is at the confluence of two major supports, there’s a reasonable chance for a bounce if buyers step in here. If PENGU price bounces from the current confluence zone, the next major level to watch beyond the 20 EMA and 50 SMA is the recent swing high around $0.013. A breakout above $0.013 would confirm a higher high, signaling a possible continuation of the broader uptrend. If the support breaks, the price could drop to $0.0075 next, which acted as resistance during March consolidation.

According to data from crypto.news, WhiteBIT Coin ( WBT ) rallied for the third straight day, hitting a new all-time high of $34.3 on June 13 afternoon Asian time. As of press time, its price has settled at $33.67 with a market cap of $4.85 billion, ranking it as the 33rd among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. WBT retained some of its past day gains as the broader crypto market was reeling from Israel’s launch of a major military attack against Iran early morning on June 13, in response to which Iran has promised to take retaliatory measures of its own. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped about 5% to an intraday low of $103,081, while major altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DO G E ) saw losses between 6%-10%, with crypto liquidations soaring 125% to $1.2 billion in a day. You might also like: Tencent reopens talks to acquire South Korea’s Nexon, a game developer exploring blockchain Why is WBT rallying? One key factor driving WBT’s gains today is its announcement of a spot listing for the HOME token, which powers the DeFi App platform, while also adding a HOME-PERP pair to its futures section, drawing in more traders and boosting volume. WBT also gained investor interest as the exchange teased an upcoming partnership with an undisclosed European football club. On-chain activity further supports the bullish sentiment. Data shows a 580% spike in daily active addresses, a strong sign that more users are interacting with the WhiteBIT ecosystem. Meanwhile, Santiment reported a notable increase in whale accumulation, indicating that large holders are buying up WBT. This kind of activity often signals confidence in the token’s longer-term potential and can amplify price momentum during bullish phases . Source: Santiment At press time, WBT had shed some of its gains but still managed to retain its position as the highest gainer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, with bullish momentum continuing to outweigh broader market selling pressure. WBT price analysis On the 1-day USDT chart, WBT looks to have been forming an ascending broadening wedge pattern since early May, typically a sign of increasing volatility within an uptrend. WBT price, MACD and Aroon chart — June 13 | Source: crypto.news The Aroon Up indicator is currently at 92.86%, while Aroon Down is at 28.57%, showing that bullish momentum is still in play. The MACD lines are also pointing upward, adding to the positive sentiment. If this momentum holds, WBT could climb toward the key psychological level of $35. A clear breakout above that would confirm the bullish pattern and may encourage bulls to aim for $38 next, marking a 13% gain from current prices. On the contrary, if market risk sentiment weakens due to escalating macro tensions, the nearest support level to watch would be around $31, where traders previously stepped in to buy the dip.

It also lays the groundwork for Vietnam’s technological and blockchain framework. February 2024- May 2025- Decision/QD-TTg It was issued by the Prime Minister of Vietnamoutling the AML/CFT compliance in digital assets and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The law was expected to be implemented in May; however, it has now been delayed and will take effect by the end of 2025. What is the Vietnamese Government’s Stance on Cryptocurrency? Currently, the Vietnamese government is actively working on creating a legal framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets. It mainly focuses on: The Ministry of Finance is establishing a comprehensive and secure cryptocurrency regulatory framework by providing transparency and integrating AML and CFT compliance. Vietnam’s State Security Commission is collaborating with Bybit to explore the future steps to create a resilient and secure regulatory framework for cryptocurrency and other digital assets. Crypto Tax in Vietnam 2025 Because cryptocurrencies are classified as investment assets in Vietnam, they are subject to tax. By the end of 2025, the government is planning to introduce a new tax policy to generate significant revenue. The Vietnamese blockchain association says, if the government imposes a 0.1% tax on each transaction, it could bring over $800 million annually without even disrupting the market. Reporting: Earnings must be reported to the General Department of Taxation; individuals annually by March 31 , while businesses file quarterly. Tax type Tax rate Application Capital Gain tax 20% On the conversion of crypto into other fiat currency Income tax (individuals) 5-35% Mining, staking, airdrops Income tax (business) 20% Mining, staking, airdrops VAT 10% Service fees for crypto exchanges Exemption – First VND 10 million in gains per year Penalty Starting at VND 2 million or 2% of the unpaid tax Failure to comply Crypto License in Vietnam Crypto license is not implemented in Vietnam yet. While the European Union has mandated a Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) license through MiCA, Vietnam is yet to enact the legislation. Crypto Adoption Rate in Vietnam Penetration: Vietnam ranks 7 in the global crypto adoption rate, with a 20.69% user penetration rate in 2025. It is expected that the number of users will reach 21. 71 million by 2026, demonstrating the penetration rate of 21.25%. Revenue: In 2025, the revenue market is expected to reach US$1.9 billion, depicting the average revenue per user estimated to be US$92.5. The current revenue market is growing at a rate of 25.47% and is anticipated to reach US$2.4 billion by 2026. Crypto holdings: The Vietnamese government’s crypto holdings are not publicly disclosed yet; rather focuses on creating a legal framework for digital assets. Conclusion With a significant amount of the Vietnamese population using Bitcoin, the country has become a crypto hub. Vietnam’s ambition to become a blockchain leader by 2030 has halted due to uncertainty in the regulatory framework. However, in 2025, the government introduced comprehensive regulations, leading to significant development in the field. With upcoming laws for consumer protection, dispute resolution, and mitigating illegal activities, Vietnam’s victory in tech is certain. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The sale has now sparked a political storm, leading to the resignation of the justice minister and a call for a no-confidence motion in parliament. $45 Million Bitcoin Scandal The scandal started when the Czech Justice Ministry revealed it had auctioned nearly 500 Bitcoins. These digital assets were seized from Tomas Jirikovsky, an online drug dealer convicted in 2017. He had been in prison from 2017 to 2021 for drug trafficking, fraud, and illegal possession of weapons. While the sale raised approximately 1 billion Czech koruna (about $45 million), the opposition argues that the transaction lacked proper transparency and oversight. Meanwhile, Justice Minister Blazek was criticized for accepting the funds without involving police or prosecutors to verify if the assets were legal, raising concerns about whether the government may have unintentionally legitimized money from criminal sources. Opposition Call For No-Confidence Motion Alena Schillerova, vice chair of the opposition ANO party, called the situation unacceptable. In a recent tweet post , she said there was “no choice” but to file a no-confidence motion, which is now scheduled for Tuesday. ANO is demanding to know who approved the sale, whether the Bitcoin’s origins were legally verified, and if any party improperly benefited. This case highlights the growing need for transparency when governments handle digital assets like Bitcoin. With public trust at stake and elections approaching, how the Czech government responds now could shape its political future. Justice Minister Steps Down As pressure grew, Justice Minister Pavel Blazek resigned on May 30. Although he denied any wrongdoing, he said he was stepping down to protect the government’s image ahead of the October elections. Eva Decroix has stepped in as the new justice minister and has promised an independent probe into the sale. She has also said the ministry will fully cooperate during the investigation. Crypto Scandals Aren’t Just Local This controversy isn’t happening in a vacuum. Around the world, other political leaders are facing similar heat. Argentina’s President Javier Milei faced backlash after a token he promoted collapsed in price, though he was later cleared.

His remarks were captured in a tweet by crypto commentator Xaif, who noted the significance of Schwartz’s comments about real-world tokenization , DeFi development, and institutional momentum flowing toward the XRP Ledger. Personal Reflections on a Decade of Progress Schwartz spoke candidly about his connection to the XRP Ledger’s evolution. Reflecting on the journey, he described his emotional attachment to the project. He stated that he experiences a deep sense of ownership and fulfillment watching the ledger grow into what it is today, more than a decade after its inception. Although he had hoped the ledger would become something meaningful, he admitted that he could not have predicted the full scale and shape of what it has become.

This year’s event saw participation from institutional representatives, retail investors, developers, and general supporters of the ecosystem. Schwartz pointed out that the presence of institutions focused on tokenizing real-world assets signals a major shift. He identified this institutional engagement as a key factor that could drive the next wave of blockchain adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Building DeFi for Everyday Financial Needs On the topic of innovation on the XRP Ledger , Schwartz emphasized that the most crucial developments are those enabling the kind of financial tools needed by ordinary users. He noted that while speculation and digital collectibles have dominated earlier phases of blockchain growth, they are not sufficient for achieving widespread adoption. Instead, Schwartz argued that the future lies in providing services such as loans, payments, and stable investment products that meet real financial needs. He described these developments as necessary to make decentralized finance a viable alternative to traditional finance. Technical Foundations for Institutional-Grade Blockchain Use In technical terms, Schwartz highlighted that the ability to support complex asset structures is fundamental for achieving this vision. This includes tokenized real-world assets, loan portfolios, and fractional ownership mechanisms. He explained that once these functionalities are robustly implemented on-chain, the blockchain space will be able to directly compete with traditional finance markets. According to him, this represents a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity, orders of magnitude larger than the current DeFi market. Schwartz’s appearance at Apex 2025 comes at a pivotal time for the XRP Ledger, which is increasingly drawing attention from both developers and institutional players for its capabilities in supporting tokenization and scalable financial applications. His comments align with broader trends indicating growing convergence between blockchain infrastructure and mainstream financial services.

He argued that the initiative could bring in $5 million to $10 million in annual returns to Cardano. Hoskinson hopes the idea will supercharge decentralized finance and boost liquidity on the network. He also said the expected annual returns could be used to strengthen the treasury and support future growth. Hoskinson plans to advance Cardano’s liquidity infrastructure BREAKING NEWS: CARDANO TO CONVERT $100M IN ADA TO USDM 🙀🙀🙀 @IOHK_Charles says ""There's 1.7B ADA in the treasury. We could convert $100M of it into $USDM to boost trading, market making, and TVL on Cardano. Earn 5–10% returns, use it to buy ADA every year, and donate it… pic.twitter.com/nuge1UB9Vz — Mintern (@MinswapIntern) June 11, 2025 Hoskinson previously acknowledged that major tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla, are increasingly interested in digital currencies. He revealed that the tech firms are exploring integrating crypto wallets and stablecoins into their platforms, which he envisions could connect with 3 billion users. The Cardano treasury currently holds roughly 1.7 billion ADA, worth over $650 million at publication. During a recent ask-me-anything session, Hoskinson argued that the stockpile of funds is sitting idle while the ecosystem misses out on big opportunities. “We could convert a hundred million ADA into USDM, put financial infrastructure behind it, and start building up trading, market-making, and total value locked in the Cardano ecosystem.” ~ Charles Hoskinson , Co-founder of Cardano The American entrepreneur’s strategy reflects a self-reinforcing loop, where the company earns passive income by providing liquidity, then uses that income to buy back ADA and refill the treasury. Hoskinson estimates the idea could garner a 5 to 10% annual yield, all while strengthening stablecoin liquidity and encouraging DeFi activity. The Cardano stablecoin, USDM, issued by Mehen, is backed 1:1 with U.S. dollars and fully on-chain. Hoskinson believes anchoring $100 million worth of ADA into the stablecoin could ignite Cardano’s liquidity, as seen in ecosystems like Ethereum or Solana. Similar strategies are gaining traction across the crypto industry, including Avalanche’s recent allocation of $50 million to bring more tokenized assets on-chain, betting that increased liquidity drives adoption. Hoskinson believes Cardano could do the same – if the community steps up. Despite suggesting his promises, Cardano’s co-founder also expressed clear distraught over what he sees as community inaction. Hoskinson pointed to Intersect, a governance entity designed to help manage treasury funds and proposals, as an underused tool. He argued that Intersect was set up to give Cardano’s treasury the freedom to do exactly what he suggested. Hoskinson also noted missed chances, such as failing to bring Circle’s USDC stablecoin to Cardano. He believes the partnership could have positioned Cardano ahead of the curve in the stablecoin space. Cardano’s co-founder sees potential in including venture capital from companies like a16z or Pantera. Hoskinson argued that investors like venture capital firms might fund liquidity initiatives, returning profits to the treasury and creating a growth cycle. Cardano aims to launch private stablecoin Hoskinson spoke on eToro’s ‘Conversation with Leaders’ podcast on May 9 and proposed privacy-preserving stablecoins for Cardano. He revealed that his team wants Cardano to be the first blockchain with a private stablecoin. Privacy stablecoins have been viewed as a threat, with privacy-enabling digital assets like Monero and Zcash getting delisted and banned from exchanges due to concerns over their use by criminals. The European Union also said it will ban exchanges from dealing with private cryptocurrencies starting in July 2027. Hoskinson argued there’s a way to offer privacy without sacrificing regulatory compliance. Cardano’s founder argued that the stablecoin could have selective disclosure to provide the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism funding provisions that regulators require. Hoskinson also revealed on May 10 that Cardano will transform as it adopts a more open and agile development model. He argued that the new approach would allow external contributors to participate more actively in building the network. The blockchain’s founder also said it will introduce flexible workflows to speed up innovation while preserving its security principles. Cardano’s founder acknowledged that the company’s early design favored caution over speed.

Ethereum Has Recently Seen Notable Exchange Outflows As explained by the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) in a new post on X, a large amount of Ethereum has left exchanges. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the “Exchange Netflow,” which measures the net amount of ETH entering into or exiting out of the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the exchanges are receiving a net number of deposits. As one of the main reasons why investors deposit their tokens to these platforms is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have a bearish implication for the ETH price. Related Reading: Tron Has Plenty Of Room For A 2025 Bull Run, Risk Metric Signals On the other hand, the indicator being below zero suggests the exchange outflows outweigh the inflows. Such a trend can imply the holders are accumulating, which can naturally have a bullish effect on the asset. Now, here is the chart shared by Sentora that shows the trend in the Ethereum Exchange Netflow over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the Ethereum Exchange Netflow has seen a sharp negative spike during the past day, which suggests the investors have withdrawn a significant amount of the cryptocurrency. In total, the exchanges have handled net outflows of more than 140,000 ETH (worth about $390 million) with this withdrawal spree. This is the largest single-day exit that these platforms have faced in over a month. These outflows have come as Ethereum has been attempting a breakout from its month-long range. As such, it’s possible that a portion of the large holders of the market have some level of confidence in this rally. In some other news, the cash-margined Ethereum Futures Open Interest has set a new all-time high, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed in an X post. The Futures Open Interest is an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to Ethereum that are currently open on all derivatives platforms. Here, the ‘cash-margined’ Open Interest is of relevance, which includes all the contracts that have fiat/stablecoins as collateral.

The platform enables automated strategies for efficient collateral management in lending and borrowing activities. During the beta testing period, Altitude attracted over $5 million in total value locked (TVL) from whitelisted participants. The platform is designed to help users manage onchain borrowing while maintaining optimal capital efficiency and preventing under-collateralization. Automated rebalancing features Altitude offers automated rebalancing capabilities, adjusting borrowing positions based on collateral price movements for assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). The platform’s dashboard displays loan health metrics based on loan-to-value (LTV) ratios with controls for parameter adjustments. When collateral values increase, Altitude borrows against the assets and uses the capital to generate yield that reduces the loan amount. Conversely, when collateral values decrease, the platform returns funds to lending pools to maintain optimal LTV ratios. The system also identifies favorable lending rates and adjusts positions to secure the most attractive financing terms. Addressing capital efficiency challenges The platform targets capital efficiency issues in DeFi, where users typically borrow at 40-50% LTV ratios, leaving significant capital unused. Beta users have reported improved capital efficiency and reduced complexity in borrowing processes, allowing them to focus on yield generation opportunities. Funding and market positioning Altitude raised $6.1 million in funding from web3 venture capital firms, including Tioga Capital, New Form Capital, and GSR. The platform positions itself as the first DeFi protocol to offer automated rebalancing for borrowing based on collateral price movements. The public launch provides DeFi users access to lending and borrowing activities through an interface that reduces the need for constant position monitoring while enabling yield generation on crypto assets .

Accordingly, it has been reported that the US Senate is planning a final vote on the GENIUS Act on June 17. Date Set for GENIUS! The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a final vote on the GENIUS Act, which aims to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, on June 17. The announcement stated that the date was set as June 17, but the exact time would be determined later by the Majority Leader in consultation with the Senate Democratic Leader. If the bill passes the Senate, it will be sent to the House of Representatives for the next vote. The bill requires stablecoins to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or similar liquid assets, and aims to create legal footing for them by requiring annual audits for issuers with a market value of over $50 billion and adding compliance guidelines for foreign issuers. US President Donald Trump previously said he wanted to pass stablecoin legislation by August. Earlier this week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that stablecoin legislation could pave the way for the USD stablecoin market to exceed $2 trillion by the end of 2028.

Buying from wallets with over 10 BTC reached their highest levels in the year to date. Bitcoin accumulation addresses saw rapid inflows in the past few days, despite the price spike. Over 30K BTC were bought up and sent to addresses that were extremely conservative about moving their coins. In total, accumulation addresses absorbed $3.3B, or 30,754 BTC. Currently, accumulation and even occasional buying are absorbing all newly mined coins, while also drawing down the reserves of OTC desks and exchanges. The recent wave of buying continued even at prices above $109,000. Bitcoin is still in accumulation mode, though sinking slightly to $104,578. Accumulation is happening while anticipating a larger rally in 2025, with $120,000 the next target. Accumulation addresses are relatively old, and have an average accumulation price of $64,000. However, newer accumulation addresses are also added, even near peak prices. Based on CryptoQuant data, over 2.91M BTC are now held in accumulation addresses with different ages. In 2025, inflows to accumulation addresses exhibited a higher baseline, with more regular stacking. There is also a growth trend in buying more Bitcoin , as inflows reached peak levels for the year to date. Bitcoin accumulation wallets had higher baseline activity in 2025, recently reaching peak inflows for the year to date. | Source: CryptoQuant The recent data confirms the trend where despite the near-peak valuations, whales are not taking profits. BTC spot markets still show long-term confidence, despite the short-term volatility with derivative trading. The crypto fear and greed index switched to 51 points, signaling a neutral attitude, down from the recent levels of extreme greed. However, spot accumulation can continue under different market conditions. BTC accumulation boosted by the treasury narrative The recent Bitcoin buying is a mix of anonymous whales and high-profile corporate buyers. Previous trends showed retail was hardly active above $90,000 per BTC, with most of the accumulation coming from whales and other large-scale wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC. Corporate buyers and funds can also afford to keep absorbing Bitcoin even near peak prices. Treasuries already contain 3.41M BTC, with active buying from some of the high-profile holders in the past week. Even smaller corporate buyers have taken up to 5,000 BTC off the market in a single day. In the past month, 20 companies added Bitcoin to their public balances, with more announcements and plans to finance Bitcoin acquisitions with debt or equity. The idea of a Bitcoin strategic reserve is also brought back to crypto projects. Recently, the Polkadot community raised a proposal to build a tBTC reserve, buying and holding wrapped coins for the long term. Part of the Bitcoin accumulation may also be due to DeFi protocols and other types of collateral wallets. As Bitcoin becomes more valuable, on-chain activity is slower, while some protocols are offering a way to tap the Bitcoin value without selling. Solana is also becoming one of the venues for wrapped Bitcoin. A total of 4,726 BTC is now held on Solana in the form of tBTC , with 75% growth for the whole of 2025. Additionally, Bitcoin staking and other DeFi protocols are holding up coins with no intention to sell.

The largest single liquidation was a bitcoin BTC long position on Binance, valued at $200 million, making it one of the biggest one-off losses in the year so far. It is unclear which trading firm or individual was behind that position, as exchanges don’t make that data public. Data from Coinglass shows over 247,00 traders were liquidated in the 24-hour span. Long traders bore the brunt, accounting for over $1 billion in losses — reflecting overly optimistic positioning after a week of bullish sentiment fueled by Circle’s high-profile IPO and a resurgence in U.S.-focused DeFi narratives. BTC lost more than 3% to trade at $104,700 in Asian afternoon hours, while ether ETH sunk 8% to $2,530. Tokens like solana's SOL SOL and dogecoin DOGE also slid over 8%, while XRP XRP fell to $2.20. Crypto exchanges Binance and Bybit accounted for more than $834 million in liquidated trades, the most among counterparts. Liquidations occur when traders use borrowed funds to bet on asset prices and fail to maintain a sufficient margin to cover their positions.

This time they are asking for an indicative ruling under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. What is Rule 60(b)? In simple terms, Rule 60(b) allows a court to modify or dismiss a final judgment if there are “exceptional circumstances” — unusual or important new reasons to undo a decision that’s already been made. Why Are Ripple and the SEC Doing This? Last year the court ruled against Ripple and ordered them to pay a $125 million fine and barred them from selling XRP to certain buyers in violation of U.S. securities laws (injunction). Ripple had to put the full penalty in escrow while both sides appealed the decision. Now both Ripple and the SEC have reached a settlement and want to close the case. To do this they are asking the court to: Dissolve (remove) the injunction that restricts Ripple’s XRP sales Release the escrowed funds: Ripple would pay $50 million to the SEC and get the rest back However, because the case already reached a final judgment, they need the court’s permission through a Rule 60(b) motion. What Happens Next? If Judge Torres issues an indicative ruling agreeing that she would grant this motion, Ripple and the SEC will ask the appeals court to send the case back down, so Judge Torres can officially dissolve the injunction and release the funds. Why Ripple’s IPO Plans Are Affected by the Injunction Currently, Ripple is prohibited from selling XRP to institutions or the general public in ways that are against U.S. securities laws by a court injunction. Since those sales are an important part of any company’s fundraising strategy, particularly if it wishes to initiate an IPO (Initial Public Offering) or provide other investment opportunities, this restriction is a barrier for Ripple. According to Ripple and the SEC, the primary factor preventing their settlement and impeding Ripple’s future business plans is this injunction. Because of this, Ripple is requesting that the court lift the injunction under Rule 60(b), which permits final court orders to be modified if there are If the court agrees, Ripple would be free to fully restart its business operations and move toward an IPO or similar offerings in the future.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 08:15:07

As we move into June, the best crypto presale to invest in is top of mind for early adopters aiming to get in before the crowd. With dozens of presales flooding the market, only a few stand out. This article explores three of the most talked-about names right now: Nexchain, BEST WALLET, and Lightchain AI. Among them, only one is shaping up to be a real game-changer. Why Nexchain Is the Best Crypto Presale to Invest In Nexchain is gaining massive traction in the presale market, and for good reason. With $4.3 million raised in Stage 18 of its presale and a projected ROI of 429%, it’s quickly climbing to the top of every serious crypto presale list. Investors can currently grab NEX tokens at just $0.07, with a listing price locked at $0.30. But the numbers only tell part of the story. Nexchain is not just another cryptocurrency project; it’s an AI-powered Layer 1 blockchain with genuine utility. The platform combines blazing-fast throughput of 400,000 TPS, hybrid consensus, and smart-contract functionality powered by artificial intelligence. Its low gas fees and scalability make it ideal for real-world adoption. What truly sets Nexchain apart is its Certik audit , a major trust factor in today’s uncertain market. The project also features a doxxed team, public roadmap, and a daily gas-fee sharing reward system that benefits NEX token holders, making it a top-rated ICO. Getting started is seamless: investors can join the presale with a 3-click purchase system that accepts USDT, ETH, or a card. In an ocean of hype-driven tokens, Nexchain’s foundation of utility, transparency, and trust makes it the best crypto presale to invest in 2025. BEST WALLET – Security-Focused Utility BEST WALLET positions itself as a privacy-focused crypto tool designed to protect users’ digital assets. It offers self-custody wallets, on-chain privacy controls, and secure dApps for transaction management. With growing concerns around centralized exchanges and hacks, BEST WALLET is tapping into a real need. The wallet aims to introduce a modular ecosystem that enables users to manage their DeFi and NFT assets securely, without compromising personal data. It’s building a tech stack centered around encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and decentralized security. These features are especially appealing to crypto users who prioritize control over their keys. However, while BEST WALLET has intriguing features, it’s still in its early development phase, with limited information about the product timeline, tokenomics, or public team. The roadmap lacks clarity, and no major audit has been confirmed so far. Compared to Nexchain, which already has a Certik audit, strong fundraising progress, and a utility-rich Layer-1 infrastructure, BEST WALLET feels more like a promising concept than a proven investment. Lightchain AI – Still Building Hype Lightchain AI has entered the spotlight as an AI-integrated DEX (decentralized exchange), targeting traders seeking smarter algorithms, predictive analytics, and automated trading strategies. Its pitch is compelling: an AI bot-powered system that helps users optimize DeFi yield and token swaps across chains. The platform also hints at launching NFT marketplaces and AI-enhanced decentralized launchpads, aiming to revolutionize how users interact with DeFi infrastructure. Influencers are driving early investor buzz and sneak peeks into its sleek UI mockups. But here’s the catch: Lightchain AI is still a pre-product, with no live demo, no audit, and no functioning beta. The project is in the “hype and hope” phase, relying on vision and marketing rather than working technology or user adoption. Nexchain, on the other hand, has not only completed multiple presale stages successfully but is also backed by real utility, public proof of progress, and blockchain infrastructure that’s already under development. It’s a much safer and smarter choice for investors seeking the best crypto presale of 2025. Final Thoughts Both BEST WALLET and Lightchain AI present interesting concepts in the evolving Web3 space. Their focus on privacy and AI-driven trading may deliver results in the long term, but they’re still building the foundation. Nexchain , however, is already delivering on its promises. With a massive $4.3M raised, a clear roadmap, a Certik audit, and a highly functional blockchain ecosystem, it leads the pack as the best crypto presale to invest in 2025. Industry experts suggest not to miss out on this final opportunity before Nexchain hits major exchanges, the upside potential is too significant to ignore.

The selloff began in the early hours before Israeli forces launched Operation Rising Lion , targeting what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described as the “heart” of Iran’s nuclear program, including strikes on the Natanz enrichment facility and military infrastructure near Tehran and Tabriz. This unexpected geopolitical war affected global financial markets, with Bitcoin dropping from a 24-hour high of $108,500 as investors fled risk assets amid escalating Middle East tensions. Source: Cryptonews The liquidation data reveals the severity of the market panic, with long positions bearing the brunt of the damage at $1.16 billion compared to just $113.97 million in short liquidations. Source: Coinglass The cascading effect intensified throughout the day, starting with $20 million in liquidations within the first hour and exploding to nearly $1 billion over 12 hours as algorithmic trading systems and leveraged positions were quickly wiped out. Geopolitical Catalyst Exposes Crypto Market Leverage The Israeli strikes, which began around 3:30 AM local time in Tehran, revealed the cryptocurrency market’s dangerous overleverage as what started as a geopolitical war quickly morphed into a technical breakdown. Netanyahu’s announcement that the operation would continue “for as many days as it takes to remove the threat” created sustained uncertainty that prevented any meaningful recovery attempts throughout the trading session. However, if the war escalates, the cryptocurrency as we know it has always served as digital gold during global uncertainty. The speed and magnitude of the decline, amplified by algorithmic trading systems treating crypto as a risk-off asset, quickly shifted sentiment in an already overleveraged market. Iran’s immediate counterattack, launching approximately 100 drones toward Israel while declaring a state of emergency, further amplified market fears and sustained the selling pressure across all major cryptocurrencies. For Instance, ETH is down over 8% from a week high of $2,700 to $2,500. Similarly, XRP has been down 6%, SOL 9%, and Dogecoin 9%, all in the past 24 hours. This indicates that the selloff was indiscriminate across the entire market rather than concentrated in Bitcoin alone. Technical Analysis Reveals Bitcoin Might Dip Further The price action across multiple timeframes revealed that the geopolitical development triggered technical breakdowns that had been building for weeks, suggesting the market was vulnerable to external catalysts. The hourly chart showed Bitcoin breaking decisively below critical support at $106,500, with three distinct rejection points in the supply zone between $109,500 and $110,500 indicating heavy institutional selling pressure. The bearish breakout pushed Bitcoin below the psychological $105,000 level, with the next major demand zone sitting around the round-number $100,000 target. The four-hour analysis also exposed a descending channel pattern constraining Bitcoin since its peak above $112,000. The recent break below the channel’s lower support line signaled an acceleration of the bearish trend. The volume profile showed increased selling activity coinciding with the geopolitical news flow, while the resistance level around $112,000 now appears formidable for any recovery attempts. The technical structure suggests that rallies will likely be met with renewed selling pressure, with the channel breakdown targeting the $100,000-$102,000 demand zone. Most concerning was the Ichimoku rising wedge breakdown on the four-hour timeframe, which revealed Bitcoin trading below the cloud and indicated a shift from bullish to bearish momentum. Rising wedges represent diminishing buying pressure despite higher prices, and the breakdown typically leads to sharp declines with measured move targets around $96,000. This technical objective aligns with previous significant support levels and would represent approximately a 10% decline from current levels, suggesting further downside pressure if geopolitical tensions remain elevated or additional macro factors emerge to pressure risk assets.

So far, we’ve covered: Moving Averages (SMA & EMA) to spot trends and momentum Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify overbought or oversold zones Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for timing entries and exits with trend shifts Now let’s dive into Bollinger Bands , a flexible tool that helps traders read volatility and spot extremes in price. What Are Bollinger Bands? Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: Middle Band : A 20-period simple moving average (SMA) Upper Band : The SMA + 2 standard deviations Lower Band : The SMA – 2 standard deviations They stretch and contract based on market volatility. When the bands are far apart: high volatility When they’re tight: low volatility (and often a big move is coming) How to Use It: Price exceeds the Upper Band This often signals overbought conditions. A short-term pullback or reversal may follow, though strong momentum can drive further gains. Price dips below the Lower Band This may indicate oversold conditions. A bounce is possible, but it’s best confirmed with additional indicators like RSI or volume. Price moves closely along the Upper Band Known as “walking the band,” this usually reflects a strong trend. While it can persist, traders should watch closely for fading momentum. Bands contract significantly A squeeze suggests the market is in a low-volatility phase. These periods often precede sharp breakouts in either direction. Bands begin to widen Indicates rising volatility. The market may be transitioning into a more active phase with larger price swings. Example in Action: Let’s break down what we’re seeing on a 1-hour BTC/USD chart on Bitfinex, using Bollinger Bands (BB 20, 2) as your main indicator. Current price: 105100 Middle Bollinger Band (20 SMA): 104978 Upper Band: 105619 Lower Band: 104337 In this example, BTC is sitting just above the Middle Band, showing tentative signs of strength. This is often a neutral-to-bullish zone, where price is deciding whether it wants to make a move or hang out sideways for a while longer. What’s interesting is that the Bollinger Bands were wider earlier , reflecting some sharp moves (clearly seen from the recent dips and spikes). But now they’re starting to contract , hinting that the market could be entering a consolidation phase . What Could Happen Next? Bullish Scenario: If BTC can hold above the Middle Band and we see a few strong candles push higher, a test of the Upper Band (~105619) is likely. A clean break above it could signal an incoming breakout (keep an eye on volume). If the price climbs without strong participation, it may just be a fake-out. Bearish Scenario: If BTC slides back below the Middle Band and volume picks up on red candles, we could revisit the Lower Band (~104337) pretty quickly. This would keep BTC in a short-term downtrend channel. Sideways Drift: The most probable scenario for now: consolidation. The slight tightening of the Bands suggests reduced volatility, meaning BTC might just range between the Middle and Upper/Lower bands while traders wait for a macro catalyst. Bollinger Bands work best when used with confirming indicators . If you’re serious about catching breakouts or reversals with more confidence, try pairing this with: RSI for overbought/oversold confirmation Volume for strength validation Candlestick patterns near the bands for entry signals BTC/USD Update with RSI + Bollinger Bands Current RSI (14): 51.47 This puts us right in the neutral zone between overbought (70) and oversold (30). No clear momentum yet, but… RSI has been slowly climbing out of a recent low and just broke above 50. This can sometimes be seen as a shift in short-term momentum , where bears are losing control and bulls are cautiously stepping in. Right now, the chart says: neutral-to-hopeful. BTC is crawling back from recent lows, with RSI nudging toward bullish territory. Still a waiting game. Pro Tips: Use Bollinger Bands with RSI or MACD to confirm signals Don’t assume every touch of the bands = reversal. Context is key Bollinger Band “squeezes” are often followed by powerful moves Watch for price – band divergence . This is when the price makes a new high but the band doesn’t widen. This could mean the trend is losing strength and a reversal or slowdown may be near.

Speaking at the Coinbase Annual Summit with Yahoo Finance, Pham said that Donald Trump’s crypto stance doesn’t mean companies can ignore the rules or operate outside the law. “There is no easy street for anybody, and regulators aren’t easy,” she stated. “Just because we are pro-innovation and pro-growth does not mean that you’re going to be able to get away with breaking the law.” The acting chair clarified that this does not mean the commission will unfairly target the crypto sector as the previous administration did. Instead, the focus will be on fair and firm enforcement to tackle real issues like fraud and misconduct. You might also like: SEC chair Paul Atkins proposes “innovation exemption” to spur onchain development Pham further criticized the Biden regulatory era. Echoing industry sentiment, she emphasized that regulators bent the rules to go after crypto in ways the law didn’t support, an approach she describes as undermining trust in the U.S. system. She added that fear-based policymaking curated out of wrong perceptions that the industry is “evil” no longer serves, stressing the importance of restoring regulatory clarity. Caroline Pham’s remarks come as U.S. crypto regulation takes a new form, especially with the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Seen as a pro-crypto choice, Atkins is expected to help fulfill Trump’s promises to the sector and undo long-standing regulatory irregularities that have hindered growth. Earlier this month, the regulatory chief reaffirmed his mission to create clearer rules for the crypto industry. “A key priority of my Chairmanship will be to develop a rational regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that establishes clear rules of the road for the issuance, custody, and trading of crypto assets,” he stated.

While the CFTC is expected to be among these institutions, interim CFTC Chair Caroline Pham made important statements. Pham said the agency will maintain tight control over the cryptocurrency industry despite the Trump administration's support. CFTC interim chairman Pham emphasized that the Trump administration’s cryptocurrency policy does not mean unconditional regulatory ease. Speaking at the Coinbase Summit, Caroline Pham said the agency will not ease its oversight of cryptocurrencies amid the Trump administration’s promise to support the industry. “There is no easy path for anyone and it is not easy for regulators either. Just because we are for innovation and growth doesn't mean you can break the law with impunity. And I'm not talking about twisting the law to criminalize an asset class or technology, I'm talking about lying, cheating and stealing.” Stating that fraud and theft will not be tolerated in the crypto industry at this point, Pham stated that the CFTC has ended its “regulation through enforcement” approach and shifted its focus to fraud and scams. Caroline Pham also recently criticized previous crypto policies under the Joe Biden administration. “Biden’s past laws and regulations have not only harmed cryptocurrencies but also the current derivatives market,” Pham said. *This is not investment advice.

Speaking at the XRP APEX 2025 event in Singapore on Wednesday, Garlinghouse framed the prediction around XRP’s utility in transferring funds internationally. “There are two parts to SWIFT today: messaging and liquidity,” Garlinghouse said. “Liquidity is owned by the banks. I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity. If you're driving all the liquidity, it is good for XRP … so I’ll say five years, 14%.” SWIFT dominates interbank messaging for cross-border transfers, telling banks where to send money, but doesn't actually move the funds. If a person transfers money from a U.S. bank to one in Europe, messages are sent on SWIFT to coordinate the transfer. The cash takes longer to arrive, often relying on multiple intermediaries, which can make the process slow and expensive. Ripple is angling to compete on the liquidity layer, arguing that the ability to move capital seamlessly, not just communicate transactions, will let it gain market share. Instead of just sending a message, Ripple’s system moves both the message and the money using blockchain technology. XRP acts as a bridge currency, converting money instantly from one currency to another, and reducing the need for banks to hold funds in foreign accounts.",Markets|Brad Garlinghouse|Ripple|SWIFT|Interbank Payments|News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-13 09:25:42

X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a crypto pundit on X, recently drew the community’s attention to this trend, highlighting XRP’s rapid growth in the East while Western nations, such as the U.S., fall behind. A Massive XRP Reserve in China In China, Webus is initiating a $300 million fund to build an XRP reserve for ride-payment and Web3 loyalty services. Notably, this initiative is corporate-led rather than government-backed, indicating strong private sector conviction in XRP’s role in the Web3 economy. This reserve aims to support scalable micropayments and loyalty systems built on blockchain rails, signaling a strategic alignment with tokenized real-world use cases. $XRP is quietly taking over Asia China building a $300M XRP reserve Dubai tokenizing real estate on XRP Ledger 61 banks in Japan adopting XRP by 2025 While the West debates, the East is building If #XRP isn’t in your top bags by now… what are you even holding? pic.twitter.com/SM345zZw7z — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 12, 2025 UAE Advances Real Estate Tokenization on the XRPL Meanwhile, the UAE is advancing digital real estate transformation through XRP. The Dubai Land Department is piloting a tokenization program using the XRP Ledger , enabling fractional property ownership starting from AED 2,000 (approximately $545). This approach lowers entry barriers for investors and enhances property liquidity. Ripple is also the first blockchain-based payment company authorized by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). This approval broadens the market for XRP and RLUSD and adds a layer of regulatory credibility. X Finance Bull’s post shared a prediction from analysts that the increasing adoption in the UAE could lead to a 21.5% increase for the asset by 2026.

Through SBI Ripple Asia, a 61-bank consortium representing 80% of the country’s banking sector has been trialing XRP-based payment solutions, such as MoneyTap, since 2016. The post shared a quote attributed to SBI’s CEO, predicting that all banks in Japan will adopt XRP this year. This level of adoption suggests that XRP is more than just a digital asset, but is becoming a foundational component of Japan’s domestic and cross-border payment systems. From Crypto Assets to Financial Infrastructure This broad-based alignment is not just about technology; it’s about positioning. As one observer stated , “XRP isn’t a crypto bet in the East. It’s infrastructure.” Real estate is moving on-chain, and adoption in Asia is rising faster than many market participants anticipated. In contrast, Western jurisdictions grapple with legal definitions and regulatory clarity. Donald Trump has promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. However, if it does not overhaul or significantly speed up its regulatory framework, it may lose the crypto race.

Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious. In this outlook, we’ll assess how Pi’s price has responded to recent events and provide an informative Pi network price prediction model from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.546 Price Change 24h -12% Market Cap $4.1 Circulating Supply 7.44B PI Trading Volume 24h $217.6M All-Time High $2.98 (Feb 26, 2025) All-Time Low $0.4012 (Apr 05, 2025) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.546 Price Prediction $ 0.477123 (-25.39%) Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 22.32% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 41.98 Pi Price Analysis PI Network dropped over 11% in 24 hours, signalling strong bearish pressure. The RSI fell to 31.92, nearing oversold territory and indicating weak buying momentum. The MACD histogram below zero shows bearish momentum with no reversal signal. As of June 13 2025, PI Network faces support near the $0.50 level, where the price briefly bounced off after a sharp decline. This zone could attract buyers looking for a short-term entry. The resistance is at around $0.60, a level previously broken during the recent decline. For any bullish recovery, the price has to break and hold above this resistance area. Pi 1-day chart shows price fall as selling pressure grows Pi Network’s price dropped to $0.5460, losing over 11% in 24 hours. This decline shows strong selling pressure dominating the market. The MACD indicator is in negative territory, with a wide gap between the MACD and signal lines. This suggests bearish momentum is gaining strength with no signs of slowing. The RSI is at 31.92, approaching the oversold zone below 30. This reflects weak buyer interest and a possible continuation of the downward trend unless reversal signals emerge. Pi/Usdt Price Chart Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The Pi/USDT 4-hour chart reveals bearish pressure as the price dropped by 3.05%, closing at $0.5461. During the session, the price touched a low of $0.5430, showing sellers remain in control. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 14.32, which is in the oversold zone, indicating extreme selling conditions and weak buyer activity. Pi/Usdt Price Chart The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) supports the downtrend, with the MACD line at -0.0136 and the signal line at -0.0048. The growing gap between these lines, along with deep red histogram bars, confirms that bearish momentum is still strong. Traders are closely watching the $0.50 support level, which may offer temporary relief if selling slows. Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.626183 BUY SMA 5 $0.615731 BUY SMA 10 $0.670562 SELL SMA 21 $0.758351 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.706153 SELL EMA 5 $0.704162 SELL EMA 10 $0.696138 SELL EMA 21 $0.77642 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.72 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Is Pi A Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? Pi Coin is down today due to growing investor exits, as shown by large exchange inflows and insufficient demand to support price stability. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. April 2025 Pi network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. May 2025 , the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-13 09:30:00

After promising pro-crypto reforms during his campaign, Trump has now followed through. His administration has officially rolled back at least 14 controversial crypto rules introduced under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler — signaling what many believe is the start of a new deregulatory era for crypto in the U.S. US SEC Under Paul Atkins Withdraws 14 Gensler-Era Crypto Rules In a major move aligning with President Trump’s pro-crypto and deregulatory agenda, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now led by crypto-friendly Chair Paul S. Atkins , has withdrawn multiple rules that were considered harmful to digital asset innovation. Most of these policies, introduced between March 2022 and November 2023 during Gensler’s tenure, were seen as overreaching and restrictive. Why These Withdrawals Matter The previous Biden administration maintained a conservative and skeptical stance toward crypto. Gensler’s SEC took an aggressive regulatory approach that many in the industry labeled as hostile — targeting DeFi platforms, custodians, crypto derivatives, and more. Trump vowed to dismantle these roadblocks. Now, he’s making good on that promise. Top Gensler-Era Rules Now Scrapped Here are the key rules that have been rolled back , bringing relief to the crypto industry: Rule 3b-16 — DeFi in the Crosshairs Would have expanded the definition of “exchange” to include DeFi protocols and platforms facilitating communication between buyers and sellers. Its withdrawal is seen as a win for decentralized finance. Qualified Custodian Rule Would have restricted crypto custody to traditional financial institutions like banks or broker-dealers. This would’ve effectively excluded most crypto-native exchanges and wallet providers. Cybersecurity & Risk Management Rules Aimed at investment advisers and funds, including those handling crypto. Would have imposed stricter cybersecurity frameworks and regular incident disclosures. Large Swap Position Reporting Required firms dealing in crypto-related swaps to report detailed position data. Many crypto funds saw this as onerous and unnecessary. ESG Reporting Mandate Would have forced public companies to disclose extensive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics. Critics argued it added non-crypto-related burdens that hinder innovation. Coinbase and Industry Leaders Celebrate Crypto leaders quickly voiced support. Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal cheered the move on X, posting: “Down goes 3b-16, qualified custodian, and all the other unfinished Gensler rule proposals.” The sentiment is shared across the crypto industry, as many view this as a turning point for regulatory clarity in the U.S. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. May Issue Crypto Bonds Backed by Bitcoin and XRP, Says Ex-CFTC Chair , What’s Next for US Crypto Regulation? Although these Gensler-era rules are now off the table, the SEC under Atkins may propose new, industry-friendly regulations in the future — but only after open consultation with stakeholders. For now, the message is clear: Crypto has a seat at the table under Trump’s administration, and unnecessary barriers are being dismantled. Bottom Line With Gensler’s policies getting tossed and pro-crypto voices leading the charge, this moment could mark the true beginning of America’s crypto renaissance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The National Statistics Agency reported the drop and adds credence to the argument by President Javier Milei that his radical economic reforms are stabilizing the economy. This figure contrasts with the 2.8% in April and the 25.5% increase recorded in December 2023, when Milei assumed office. The monthly inflation rate has dropped to a political shot in the arm as midterm elections near in October, but the annual rate remains at a high of 43.5%. Milei has focused his economic policy on deregulation, fiscal consolidation, and eliminating market interventions that have existed for decades. The government abandoned the peso crawling peg system in April as part of a 20 billion dollar deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and permitted the currency to float between 1,000 to 1,400 to the U.S. dollar. “When there’s a fiscal surplus, and the printing press slows down, inflation plummets. It’s natural for this to happen. The fundamental laws of economics dictate this.” ~ Milei’s spokesman Manuel Adorni. Markets have taken it with caution. The government also came up with a temporary tax exemption on agricultural exporters, which assisted in bringing in more U.S. dollars to prop up the peso. Economic measures aim to restore reserve buffers IMF projects the Argentinian economy to recover by 5.5% in 2025, though current signs show that the economy is not growing. Productivity is slow, and consumer demand is too feeble to influence spending in important areas. The inflation has eased, but now lower activity poses a risk of undermining popular support. Argentina needs to increase its foreign reserves to handle its financial needs. The country is to meet an additional $4.4 billion by July under the IMF, a delay of a previous June deadline. Milei has ruled out the method employed by previous administrations of acquiring U.S. dollars by printing pesos, saying that the expansion of the monetary base should be restricted. Rather, the government has tried other mechanisms, including a repurchase agreement with foreign banks for $2 billion and a bond issue to foreigners to the tune of $1 billion. The central bank has recently announced that it would allow the market to set interest rates, abandoning the traditional benchmark rate system in a move that is consistent with the Milei Phase 3 economic program. Previously, the monetary authority had set the rate at 29%, but it now targets monetary aggregates to decelerate the expansion of the money stock. The central bank said , “This reorganization consolidates a more conventional monetary aggregates control framework, eliminating the notion of a ‘monetary policy interest rate’ typical of schemes such as inflation targeting.” This was in addition to the new dollar repo auction that the central bank undertook on June 11 after conducting a similar exercise in December. These instruments are aimed at strengthening reserves without fueling domestic monetary growth. The reforms of Milei constitute the most economic turn in Argentina in decades.

Last December, decentralized exchanges reached a remarkable milestone, surpassing $462 billion in monthly trading volume. Although the volume has fluctuated during different market cycles over the past quarter, trading activity on DEXs continues to surge at a remarkable pace. You might also like: The future of non-custodial models in a post-Coinbase world | Opinion It’s no longer just advanced traders on these platforms. Even beginner users on these platforms are now actively seeking new assets and early trading opportunities—not just advanced traders. This trend reflects a deeper structural shift happening in the financial practices, as users move decisively away from centralized finance toward decentralized finance. Why is this shift happening? Because there’s a growing demand for enhanced control, improved security, and frictionless trading experiences among crypto users. Within this transformation, crypto wallets have evolved from passive storage solutions into sophisticated trading terminals, reshaping how users engage with blockchain technologies. Crypto wallets have come a long way Historically, crypto wallets served a single, passive function—securely storing digital assets. Over time, however, wallets began offering basic transactional capabilities, allowing users to send and receive cryptocurrencies. Today, the role of the wallet has dramatically expanded, driven by user demands for integrated functionalities that deliver real-time intelligence and trading capabilities. In my experience leading the rollout of pro-grade trading features at Bitget Wallet, this shift has been pronounced. Mobile-first wallet interfaces now have extremely sophisticated and advanced features, previously found only on professional trading platforms, such as sophisticated K-line charting, dynamic trading overlays, and real-time on-chain analytics. In particular, we’ve seen strong traction from power users with Bitget Wallet Alpha, our advanced trading suite that delivers precision tools like signal alerts, whale tracking, and risk dashboards—directly within the wallet. These enhancements are not cosmetic or visual upgrades; they represent a fundamental redefinition of wallet capabilities. Crypto wallets, or web3 wallets in general, are becoming active, intelligent trading hubs that empower users to execute informed decisions instantly and securely. User behavior is shifting toward wallet-based trading Recent on-chain research by Bitget Wallet confirms this significant shift in user behavior. Across global markets, wallets are now the primary interface for trading, with 48% of surveyed users actively trading within their wallets. Importantly, users aren’t only trading—they’re also leveraging wallets for earning rewards and airdrops (46%), payments (40%), yield generation (37%), and market trend analysis (35%). Additionally, 33% rely on wallets for token discovery, and 31% actively explore decentralized applications. This diverse range of activities highlights a broader trend toward consolidation, reflecting a preference for comprehensive, all-in-one wallet experiences. Another critical observation is that the behavioral shift varies by region. In developed markets like North America, Western Europe, and Oceania, wallets primarily handle essential financial activities such as transfers, payments, and staking. But emerging regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America demonstrate a more expansive approach. Users in these countries are using wallets for token discovery, price monitoring, and accessing novel blockchain protocols. These regional differences show that crypto wallets can now meet distinct market demands through a versatile, user-focused approach. There is a great deal of adaptability in today’s platform, and it’s only getting better with new developments. It’s all about user experience One critical driver accelerating this transition from CeFi to DeFi is user experience. Historically, decentralized platforms have faced challenges in user adoption. And this was mainly due to complex interfaces and unintuitive workflows. However, as wallets integrate increasingly advanced features into user-friendly, mobile-centric designs, barriers to adoption are quickly dissolving. Sophisticated does not have to mean complicated. Wallets that simplify complex DeFi interactions through intuitive design and seamless integration of advanced analytics and trading tools are winning substantial market share. Our own experience shows that mobile-first designs, complemented by real-time market insights and analytical capabilities, significantly boost user confidence in self-custody and decentralized trading. This intuitive UX fosters broader adoption and creates lasting user engagement, which is crucial for DeFi’s sustained growth. Integrating intelligence with autonomy The current generation of crypto wallets excels at bridging the gap between asset custody and active trading. The integration of analytics, trading overlays, and real-time on-chain data means users no longer need multiple platforms to access critical information. As these capabilities are centralized within wallets, users gain autonomy over their investment decisions through real-time market intelligence. Also, integrating such capabilities within wallets directly addresses the historical pain point of fragmented user experiences, where managing crypto requires jumping through multiple disconnected applications. As wallets become more sophisticated and feature-rich, users are increasingly consolidating their activities into a single, cohesive experience. The future of wallets as trading terminals Looking forward, wallets will continue evolving into increasingly powerful trading terminals. We are heading towards a phase where all crypto trading requirements will be bundled into a singular dynamic wallet platform. So, even if someone wants to just store their digital assets, or gain advanced trading insights, or access passive income opportunities, all will be possible through a single mobile-native interface. Innovations in decentralized exchanges, real-time data analytics, and enhanced security measures will accelerate this evolution, reinforcing wallets as indispensable tools in the DeFi ecosystem.

Sonic ( S ) price fell 15% to an intraday low of $0.314 on June 13, down by over 68% from its highest point this year. This crash has brought its market capitalization close to losing the $1 billion mark, and down from $3.15 billion in January. Rising geopolitical tensions triggered a flight from risk assets on June 13. After Iran launched a military attack on Israel, with retaliatory threats building, the global crypto market lost over 7% in value. Sonic was among those hit the hardest. While Coinbase’s confirmation of an S token listing earlier today brought brief attention to the project, it hasn’t altered the trend . On-chain data remains decisively bearish, with core metrics pointing to sustained weakness across the network. Data from Santiment shows that the total value locked across DeFi protocols on Sonic chain has plunged from nearly $2 billion in May to $1.54 billion. Flagship protocols including Silo Finance, Pendle, AAVE, and Beets have seen their TVLs drop by 35% to 50% over the past month. This slowdown in activity means Sonic isn’t making as much revenue as it was a few months ago. Daily on-chain revenue has slipped to just $5,977 as of Friday, compared to a peak of over $42,000 in May. You might also like: Sonic Labs announces 200M S token airdrop, U.S. residents will be eligible Stablecoin supply on Sonic has also contracted by nearly $200 million this year. Fewer stablecoins in circulation means liquidity across the network has weakened, and user activity has consequently slowed. Furthermore, funding rates across exchanges have remained negative, indicating bearish sentiment among traders. Santiment data shows, on May 13, the funding rate dipped to 0.05%, its lowest in over a week, indicating that traders expect Sonic’s price to fall below the spot rate. Based on these bearish on-chain metrics, Sonic may continue to face downward pressure in the near term, with limited signs of a strong recovery unless ecosystem activity and investor sentiment show a meaningful turnaround. Sonic price analysis On the 1-day USDT chart, Sonic’s price has been in free fall over the past few weeks. It recently dropped below $0.32, which was its last strong support level, and well under $0.38, a key zone that matched April’s lowest swing. The $0.38 level also acted as the neckline of a double-top pattern that formed around $0.618, a classic bearish signal in technical analysis. S price, 20-day and 50-day SMA chart — June 13 | Source: crypto.news Sonic has also been moving within a falling broadening wedge, which usually indicates continued downward pressure as long as the price stays inside the pattern. Adding to the bearish setup, the 20-day simple moving average has crossed below the 50-day, forming a death cross, and it’s continuing to widen, suggesting sellers are still in control. The MACD lines are pointing downward, and the Aroon Up is sitting at 0% while Aroon Down is elevated, both signs that the downtrend is still strong. S MACD and Aroon chart — June 13 | Source: crypto.news Based on this setup, Sonic’s price could keep sliding, with the next major psychological support level around $0.30. However, if buyers manage to step in and push the price above the upper boundary of the wedge, it could signal a bullish reversal and send the token back above $0.399, which also lines up with its 20-day moving average.

While Solana has captivated many with its high-speed transactions and burgeoning ecosystem, even its most ardent supporters can fall prey to common pitfalls. This article delves into critical errors that can hinder portfolio growth and explores how the rising wave of Neo Pepe ($NEOP) is subtly influencing market perspectives, showcasing a different path for savvy investors. We’ll unravel the intricate dance between market dynamics and investor psychology, highlighting innovative approaches that are redefining decentralized finance and community engagement. New Rules for Investors The cryptocurrency landscape is perpetually reshaped by a confluence of macroeconomic forces, regulatory crackdowns, and groundbreaking technological advancements. Recent shifts in global interest rates, for instance, have a tangible ripple effect, impacting the appetite for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Simultaneously, evolving regulatory frameworks, particularly in major economic blocs, introduce both uncertainty and, paradoxically, a maturing influence on the market. The specter of unbridled inflation and the unpredictable swings in traditional markets often push investors towards digital assets as a hedge, yet this very influx can lead to heightened volatility. Here are three key factors currently dictating the market’s pulse: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global inflation concerns and central bank policies directly influence investor liquidity and risk tolerance within the crypto space. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased government oversight, while aiming to protect investors, can also stifle innovation and create compliance burdens for projects. Technological Leapfrogging: Continuous advancements in blockchain scalability, interoperability, and security redefine what’s possible, siphoning attention and investment towards promising new protocols. Crypto’s Cutting Edge—DeFi Innovators You Need to Know While established players often dominate headlines, the true innovation in the crypto sphere often lies in the projects pushing boundaries. Consider, for instance, the advancements in zero-knowledge proofs, which are dramatically enhancing privacy and scalability across various blockchains. Another area of significant disruption is the emergence of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), which aim to decentralize real-world infrastructure like Wi-Fi networks and energy grids. One such trailblazing project focuses on bridging traditional financial instruments with blockchain technology, offering unprecedented access to tokenized real-world assets. Its unique value proposition stems from its robust legal framework, ensuring regulatory compliance while still leveraging the efficiency and transparency of blockchain. Here are some of its standout features: Fractionalized Asset Ownership: Enables investors to own a portion of high-value assets that were previously inaccessible. Automated Compliance Engines: Integrates regulatory checks directly into smart contracts, streamlining legal processes. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Allows for seamless transfer of tokenized assets across multiple blockchain networks. Neo Pepe Ascends— New Powerhouse in Crypto In the bustling realm of meme coins, Neo Pepe ($NEOP) has carved out a distinctive niche, merging the virality of internet culture with substantive decentralized finance (DeFi) principles. It’s more than just a passing trend; Neo Pepe Coin positions itself as a community-driven phenomenon with genuine utility and a robust governance model. What truly sets Neo Pepe apart from other hottest cryptocurrency contenders is its commitment to decentralization from day one. Unlike many projects where control remains centralized, Neo Pepe ‘s governance framework ensures that all major decisions, from treasury spending to protocol upgrades, are voted on by the community through a secure on-chain process. This is powered by the NEOPGovernor contract, a smart contract system that integrates proposal creation, voting, and time-delayed execution of decisions. Holders of $NEOP tokens gain significant voting power, allowing them to propose new ideas, delegate votes, and participate in DAO votes. For a proposal to pass, at least 5% of the total token supply must participate in the vote. This ensures broad community consensus before implementation. Furthermore, every approved proposal undergoes a mandatory delay via a Timelock contract, adding an extra layer of security and transparency, preventing rushed or malicious actions. Even the original developers cannot unilaterally change or control the system once it’s live. The tokenomics also play a crucial role. There’s a 2.5% fee on Uniswap trades (adjustable up to a maximum of 5%), which is sent directly to the community treasury, not to developer wallets. This treasury is also governed by DAO votes, with funds allocated to marketing campaigns, ecosystem grants, liquidity support, and even “meme warfare”. This unique fee structure and community-controlled treasury management, which can only be moved by community proposals and timelocked approval, demonstrate a clear commitment to long-term sustainability and community empowerment. The presale model itself, with 45% of the total supply allocated to presale participants, further emphasizes community engagement. The tiered structure, using Chainlink oracles to peg $NEOP pricing in USD, and accepting various token types, indicates a thoughtful and transparent approach to distribution. This blend of humor, genuine utility, and a strong emphasis on decentralized governance makes Neo Pepe an interesting contender in the search for the best cryptocurrency presale . Opportunities Beyond Solana The allure of Solana often lies in its impressive transaction speeds and low fees, making it a favorite for many seeking a scalable blockchain. However, a singular focus on these metrics can lead to overlooking crucial aspects of true decentralization and community control—areas where Neo Pepe is making a significant statement. As the crypto market evolves, staying informed about new presale 2025 opportunities like Neo Pepe that prioritize decentralized governance can be key. Here are five common mistakes Solana holders might make: Ignoring Centralization Risks: While Solana is fast, concerns about its validator decentralization have been raised. Overlooking these risks can lead to a false sense of security in the network’s resilience. Underestimating the Power of Pure Community Governance : Many projects, even on high-throughput chains, still retain significant developer control. Neglecting the shift towards truly decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) where the community has immutable control over the treasury and protocol changes can be a costly oversight. This is where a best presale project like Neo Pepe Protocol stands out, offering full community control from the outset. Focusing Solely on Technical Specs Over Community Ethos: Chasing the fastest or cheapest blockchain often means ignoring the foundational philosophy of decentralization and community ownership that underpins the crypto movement. For those looking for the hottest new presale , a strong community ethos should be a significant factor. Dismissing Meme Coins as Pure Hype: While many meme coins are indeed fleeting, dismissing all of them outright can mean missing out on projects like Neo Pepe that are leveraging meme culture to build genuinely decentralized and community-driven ecosystems with innovative tokenomics. Neglecting Due Diligence on Treasury Management: Assuming all project treasuries are managed transparently can be a mistake. Failing to investigate how funds are controlled and whether community proposals are genuinely enacted can expose investors to unnecessary risks. The Neo Pepe Protocol ensures that all fund movements require passed proposals and a timelock delay, offering a transparent treasury. Tomorrow’s Crypto Communities—Powered by Decentralization The crypto market is constantly evolving, and the projects that will define its future are those that not only offer technological prowess but also embody the core tenets of decentralization and community empowerment. The mistakes often made by investors, particularly a narrow focus on superficial metrics, highlight the importance of a deeper understanding of a project’s governance, treasury management, and commitment to genuine community control. The Neo Pepe Protocol , with its community-governed treasury and on-chain decision-making, serves as a compelling example of this evolving paradigm, offering a glimpse into what a truly decentralized future might look like.

On June 13, blockchain tracking account Lookonchain revealed on X that the mysterious trader bought 48,825 ETH, worth approximately $127 million, from Coinbase and Wintermute, over an eight-hour period at an average price of $2,605 per coin. Opportunity in Turmoil This fresh accumulation came amid a brutal market rout sparked by reports of Israeli missile strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The preemptive move sent shockwaves through equities, commodities, and, most notably, digital assets, with more than $190 billion in crypto market value evaporating within hours, driving the price of Bitcoin (BTC) down nearly 5% to $103,000. Ethereum also suffered a similar fate, plunging from $2,760 to a low of $2,470, to erase gains from its recent surge to a 15-week high of $2,830 just days prior. Currently, ETH is trading at about $2,520, down 8.6% in the last 24 hours. Still, it added an extra 2.3% over seven days, outpacing the broader crypto market’s rather measly 0.1% gain in that time. Yet while retail traders fled for the exits, liquidating more than $1 billion in leveraged positions, this veteran whale saw an opportunity. And it isn’t their first strategic move: Lookonchain’s earlier posts traced their footsteps back to late April. On April 27, the entity bought 600 BTC and 30,000 ETH, with the latter costing just under $55 million. Weeks later, on May 22, they sold that ETH at $2,621 each, netting about $23.73 million in profit. Undeterred by volatility, they plunged back in on May 26, acquiring another 30,000 ETH for $75.39 million at $2,513 per coin. That batch was sold just three days ago on June 10 for $82.76 million, securing a further $7.3 million gain. Today’s $127 million buy marks the whale’s largest single accumulation spree yet, executed as retail traders jettisoned their holdings. Confidence in a Rebound? The move appears to be a calculated gamble that the recent plunge in ETH’s value is an overreaction. The whale often leverages OTC desks for discreet, large-scale moves, avoiding slippage and market impact, a luxury unavailable to retail. Their proven track record of buying fear and selling into strength suggests they may view the dip below key technical and psychological support as a prime accumulation zone, betting on Ethereum’s strong fundamental backdrop, including sustained ETF inflows , a supportive U.S. regulatory shift , as well as Vitalik Buterin’s recently unveiled scaling roadmap updates.

This comes after the court rejected the original proposal on June 4. In response, Zettai filed a formal request on June 6 under case HC/SUM 940/2025 seeking “further arguments,” as confirmed by WazirX on X (formerly Twitter). Update on Proposed Scheme of Arrangement As we shared last week, the Singapore Court has declined Zettai’s application in HC/SUM 940/2025 (“SUM 940”) for the Court’s sanction of Zettai’s proposed Scheme.

If the High Court accepts the restructuring plan, Zettai may be required to file a new submission and attend further hearings. The company has been under pressure since WazirX’s hack on July 18, 2024, in which over ₹2,000 crore vanished , leaving 4.4 million users in limbo with no access to their funds. However, the delay in court proceedings has left users frustrated, and if the proposal is not approved, Zettai’s only option will be a longer and more complex appeal process. Silence From WazirX Founder Nischal Shetty Throughout the legal proceedings, WazirX co-founder Nischal Shetty has remained noticeably silent. While he has acknowledged the legal case, he has not issued a public apology to affected users nor shared any repayment plans. Despite the ongoing crisis, no refunds have been initiated, and no user funds have been recovered. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is The Crypto Market Going Down Today? , Shetty Focuses on Shardeum Despite WazirX Collapse Amid WazirX’s ongoing troubles, Shetty appears to be focusing on Shardeum, his new Layer 1 blockchain venture. This week, Shardeum Foundation announced MiCA whitepaper acknowledgment, allowing operations in Europe—an achievement promoted by Shetty on social media. Although Shetty has distanced himself from WazirX publicly, Shardeum is still mentioned in his X bio, raising questions about his true involvement in both ventures. What’s Next for WazirX? Zettai has submitted two proposals so far—both rejected by the Singapore High Court . With June 20 approaching, the crypto community is anxiously awaiting the court’s final verdict. If rejected again, Zettai is expected to file an appeal, but there is no official roadmap for repayment or resolution. Final Thoughts With millions in user funds at stake, the crypto world will be watching closely as Singapore’s High Court delivers its decision on June 20. For now, WazirX users remain in the dark, holding onto hope for a favorable outcome. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-to-xrp-holders-its-time-to-pay-very-close-attention-heres-why/,"XRP has maintained a relatively quiet profile in recent weeks, trading within a narrowing range while broader market attention has shifted elsewhere. However, a recent post by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto), a technical analyst active on X, has given market participants reason to keep an eye on the digital asset. The End of XRP’s Consolidation The analyst shared a chart showing a clear symmetrical triangle pattern that appears close to resolution, potentially marking the end of a consolidation phase that has lasted for almost 6 months. Notably, CasiTrades, another well-respected analyst, has unveiled a similar consolidation phase and expects a breakout by June 16 . The Heikin Ashi candlestick chart shared by Steph reveals converging trendlines stretching from January to June. The pattern is typical of market consolidation, where price compresses into a tighter range, reflecting declining volatility and uncertainty ahead of a potential breakout. The triangle began forming after XRP rose to a multi-year peak of $3.39 in January. Tariff threats from the Trump administration triggered a price correction in early February , and the asset has not regained the $3 level ever since. However, Steph’s analysis suggests that the asset could soon reclaim this level and head toward higher targets, potentially hitting a new all-time high. It’s time to pay very close attention if you hold #XRP pic.twitter.com/bhqCAeMe90 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 11, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Setup and a Potential Target At the time of his analysis, XRP traded at $2.2874, sitting just below the triangle’s upper boundary. Steph Is Crypto emphasized the upcoming bull run visually with a sharply rising green arrow extending from the breakout zone toward the $4.2 mark. Another well-respected analyst recently spotted an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that has been forming since March and could send XRP to $4.22 , adding credence to Steph’s target. While Steph did not provide a detailed breakdown, the implication is clear: a bullish breakout could follow if the digital asset decisively clears the triangle resistance. Such formations often precede significant volatility, especially when confirmed by a strong volume surge at the breakout point. XRP has tested the resistance level multiple times since May, and the most recent upward move in June has brought it once again into proximity with the triangle’s ceiling. Other Analysts are predicting even bigger moves for XRP, with a recent analysis showing that the digital asset could climb to $23 based on a multi-year pattern . Multiple experts are pointing toward an imminent XRP surge, and the breakout from this symmetrical triangle could be the start of a historic bull run.

So far, the rejections from $110,000 have been swift and have put the bears back in control. This has given credence to calls that the Bitcoin price will fall back below the psychological level of $100,000, something that could trigger another wave of declines in the crypto market. Bitcoin Rejection At $110,000 Part Of The Plan? The Bitcoin price rejection has no doubt triggered a wave of panic among investors, many of whom believe that this is the end of the cycle. However, a crypto analyst has suggested that the pullback is part of the larger plan as the largest cryptocurrency by market cap moves on its way to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000 In the analysis, they explain that the digital asset is currently at a point where it is undergoing significant distribution, and this will explain the decline in price. The pullback in and of itself is no cause for alarm, as minor corrections after major surges are normal. In addition to this, there is a lot of accumulation going on as Bitcoin moves from the hands of old investors into the hands of new investors at a higher cost basis. The accumulation is expected to move Bitcoin into the next bullish wave. This bullish wave is the next step in the trend as the BTC price moves into place for the next price surge. Once the volume moves upward as expected, then the asset’s price is expected to follow in succession. BTC Price Could Hit $130,000 Target After Breakout Going by the analyst’s chart shared on the TradingView website, the Bitcoin price correction is not expected to last for long. Mainly, holding the $107,000 support becomes paramount at this level as this could set the launchpad point for the next bullish impulse. Related Reading: XRP Price Forms Flag Pattern Above Accumulation Zone That Points To $5 Target The completion of the accumulation phase puts the next breakout level as high as $130,000, which would be an over 20% increase from the current level. However, this may not be the end as the crypto analyst has set a swing target for as high as $150,000. As for the timeline for when this could happen, the crypto analyst places a long-term target for the end of the year 2025. But there is also the possibility that the trend would be completed sooner and the Bitcoin price could reach its target and new all-time highs before the year runs out.

45924658,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70764,1749808841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,This Crypto Raised Millions and Still Trades Below $0.03 — Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the Next 20x?,https://timestabloid.com/this-crypto-raised-millions-and-still-trades-below-0-03-is-mutuum/,"In today’s competitive crypto market, it is unusual for a project to raise over $10.45 million and still trade below $0.03. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has achieved exactly that, making it a standout opportunity for large investors preparing for the next market upswing. With over 11,900 holders and a total supply of 4 billion tokens, this project is capturing the attention of whales and retail investors alike. The question is no longer if MUTM will grow, but how fast—and how high. Why Raising $10.45 Million at a $0.03 Price Is Uncommon Most crypto projects that secure more than $10 million in presale funding enter the market with valuations exceeding $100 million, often pushing their token price well above a few cents. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), however, still trades under $0.03 despite generating around $10.45 million in its Phase 5 presale round. This makes MUTM a rare opportunity where significant capital has been committed but the token remains highly affordable. This pricing dynamic opens the door for substantial upside. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and many yet to circulate freely, the supply-demand imbalance will fuel upward price momentum as adoption increases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) features a dual lending system designed to meet a wide range of user needs. Its pool-to-contract (P2C) model allows users to deposit assets into shared liquidity pools, where interest rates adjust dynamically based on pool utilization. Higher demand raises rates, encouraging more capital inflow, while lower demand reduces borrowing costs. Alongside this, the peer-to-peer (P2P) model enables users to lend and borrow directly from one another. This system supports tokens that are typically not listed on conventional pool-based platforms—such as memecoins like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB—broadening participation for niche communities. When users supply assets to either model, they receive mtTokens that represent their deposit and automatically accrue interest over time. These mtTokens can be traded, transferred, or used within the protocol, offering flexibility without locking funds. This yield-generating system gives users access to passive returns based on real borrowing demand and protocol activity. CertiK Audit Provides a Security Edge Security is a top priority for institutional and large retail investors, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses this with a rigorous CertiK audit. The audit, completed in May 2025 after being requested in February, involved manual reviews and static analysis. The token achieved a Token Scan Score of 80.00, confirming strong contract integrity and reduced risk of vulnerabilities. According to its roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a beta version of its platform concurrently with the token going live. This release will allow early adopters to test lending, borrowing, and stablecoin features, creating valuable feedback loops and driving initial liquidity. Additionally, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway campaign is incentivizing new users to join the community, accelerating growth and network effects. With a current price under $0.03 and a total supply of 4 billion tokens, a 20x increase would place MUTM around $0.60 per token. This target is consistent with the token’s planned listing price and the protocol’s expected utility expansion. Unlike many speculative projects, MUTM’s growth is supported by revenue-sharing mechanisms and buybacks. The protocol plans to use a portion of profits to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to stakers in the safety module, creating upward price pressure and rewarding holders over time. Token Utility That Drives Long-Term Value MUTM is the native token of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). A portion of the protocol’s revenue will be used to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will be redistributed to users who stake their mtTokens in the protocol’s safety module, forming the basis of a passive dividend mechanism. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also features a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin backed by on-chain collateral. This stablecoin operates within the protocol’s lending and borrowing framework, contributing to capital efficiency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be built on Layer-2 technology, offering faster and cheaper transactions compared to many other DeFi platforms. This technical advantage will reduce network congestion and high fees, improving the overall user experience and driving continued growth. This infrastructure choice will position Mutuum to capture and retain both liquidity providers and borrowers in a market that will increasingly demand speed, cost-efficiency, and scalability. Conclusion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a rare project that has raised over $10.45 million in presale funding yet still trades below $0.03. Its 4 billion token supply, dual lending engine, passive income via mtTokens which is a tokenized representation of their assets deposited, upcoming beta launch, and full CertiK audit combine to create a strong, scalable foundation. With most tokens still locked and an active strategy for buybacks and staking rewards, a 20x return is not wishful but structurally supported. For investors seeking the next high-potential DeFi project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers an opportunity to enter early before the market fully recognizes its value. This is a chance to catch a rising star at the ground floor—much like catching MATIC when it was trading for mere fractions of a penny.

Warp, a company founded in 2021, initially focused on streamlining shipping supply chains through its network. Now, it’s taking a significant leap by integrating robots to enhance warehouse automation across its network. Driving Supply Chain Efficiency with Robotics Warp’s core mission is to make shipping more efficient and reduce costs for its customers, which include major enterprises like Walmart, Gopuff, and HelloFresh. Daniel Sokolovsky, co-founder and CEO of Warp, explained that the company is always looking for improvements. With advancements in AI, new opportunities for automation emerged. While long-haul trucking and short-range delivery present unique challenges for automation, Warp identified the workflows inside its warehouses as an area ripe for change. This focus on optimizing internal processes is key to boosting overall supply chain efficiency . Experimenting with Warehouse Automation Warp began its journey into automation by setting up a test warehouse in Los Angeles. They installed cameras and used computer vision technology to create a virtual representation of the facility – essentially a digital twin. This simulation environment allowed them to experiment freely. Sokolovsky described the initial phase as throwing ideas at the wall to see what worked. An early attempt to train humanoid robots to use traditional pallet jacks proved unsuccessful. However, Warp found success by adapting off-the-shelf robots and retrofitting them with additional technology. Leveraging AI and Robotics for Logistics Automation Warp is breaking down complex logistics problems into smaller, manageable components that systems can understand and execute. Sokolovsky stated that they are now using AI, in various forms like voice, text, email, and phone calls, alongside robotics, to manage tasks such as unloading, storing, and reloading freight. This integrated approach to logistics automation aims to achieve their goals quickly without needing to hire more people for these specific tasks. The company believes this blend of AI and robotics is crucial for future growth and efficiency in the logistics sector. The Benefits of Warp Robotics and Future Plans Troy Lester, Warp co-founder and CRO, highlighted the benefits of this automation for Warp’s underlying warehouse partners. These partners, who operate most of the warehouses in Warp’s network outside the LA test facility, frequently face staffing issues. Lester noted that the labor performing the work often finds it undesirable. Introducing Warp robotics provides an opportunity to empower these partner businesses with robotic kits. These kits not only enhance Warp’s network but also improve the partners’ operations with other companies, helping to reduce labor costs and address staffing challenges. Warp recently secured a $10 million Series A funding round, co-led by Up.Partners and Blue Bear Capital, to support this automation initiative. The company is currently testing several robot versions and plans ambitious deployment this year. The Los Angeles test facility is already fully autonomous, and Warp intends to roll out these robots to warehouses in its core network locations: Los Angeles, Chicago, New Jersey, Dallas, and Miami. For now, Warp plans to keep this technology within its network, viewing it as a competitive advantage for itself and its partners. Sokolovsky emphasized that Warp is first and foremost a logistics company focused on servicing customers, and this automation is a natural evolution built upon their existing system and ecosystem, rather than simply being a robotics or AI company selling technology externally. AI in Warehouses: A Competitive Edge The integration of AI in warehouses is not just about replacing tasks; it’s about creating smarter, more efficient operations. Warp’s approach, starting with a digital twin for experimentation and then deploying adapted off-the-shelf robots, demonstrates a practical path to automation. This strategy allows them to refine workflows and integrate AI for decision-making in real-time warehouse operations. By focusing on automating internal warehouse processes, Warp is building a network that is more resilient to labor shortages and capable of handling freight more quickly and accurately. This provides a significant competitive edge in the demanding logistics market. In summary, Warp is making significant strides in enhancing warehouse automation through the strategic deployment of robotics and AI. By creating digital twins, experimenting with robot types, and focusing on core warehouse workflows, the company aims to dramatically improve supply chain efficiency and provide a competitive advantage to its network partners. This move into logistics automation , powered by Warp robotics and integrated AI in warehouses , positions Warp at the forefront of modern freight handling, promising faster, more reliable, and cost-effective services for its high-profile clients.

The move comes as investor confidence in crypto is rebounding, helped by pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration. The deal involves a potential merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, a SPAC backed by Cohen & Company, and signals a major shift toward growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Here’s how Pompliano is positioning himself at the heart of this renewed momentum. Crypto’s New CEO: Pompliano Takes Charge Pompliano is reportedly in talks to lead ProCapBTC, a new group aiming to raise $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt, according to a Financial Times report. The plan is to use this capital to directly purchase Bitcoin – similar to the aggressive strategies of Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. The funding would come through a planned merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, which went public on Nasdaq last month with a $250 million upsized IPO. The merger is expected to be announced soon, though discussions are still ongoing. Pompliano already has experience in this space. Just last month, he launched ProCap Acquisition Corp, another SPAC, through a $220 million IPO. It’s not yet clear how the two ProCap entities are connected, based on public info. Trump’s Pro-Crypto Polices Make an Impact Under Trump’s second term, crypto is making a comeback with support from the top. His administration’s pro-crypto outlook is helping to bring back big money, and big players, into the space. ProCapBTC’s focus on acquiring Bitcoin fits right into this larger trend. IPOs from crypto firms like Bullish and Gemini are gaining traction, and Circle’s stock initially jumped 170%, reflecting growing demand for exposure to digital assets. If the deal goes through, Pompliano could play a key role in what may become the administration’s broader push for crypto adoption. Why Anthony Pompliano is a Perfect Choice? Pompliano has been in crypto since 2013, has over 1.7 million X followers, and holds deep market understanding. His influence, podcast success, and $220 million blank-cheque experience make him a top contender to lead ProCapBTC’s $750 million Bitcoin investment goal. Trump’s pro-crypto policies and growing institutional demand further facilitate this move, making Pompliano at the forefront of Bitcoin’s institutional revolution. Conclusion: ProCapBTC’s approach to dubbing Saylor’s methods demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin’s prospects. Columbus Circle’s $250 million IPO in May paves the way for a major influence on the market. Pompliano’s leadership might accelerate additional institutional acceptance. As talks advance, the cryptocurrency community watches intently, anticipating Pompliano’s next step.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 10:09:17

Iconic toy giant Mattel is teaming up with AI leader OpenAI . This partnership signals a fascinating move to integrate cutting-edge generative AI technology directly into the heart of toy making and content development. While cryptocurrency enthusiasts often focus on blockchain and decentralized tech, understanding the broader impact of AI, especially from major players like OpenAI , is crucial as these technologies increasingly intersect and influence various sectors. Mattel Explores Generative AI for Innovation This partnership marks a notable step for OpenAI , extending its reach beyond traditional licensing deals with publishers and enterprises into the consumer product space. For Mattel , known globally for beloved brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Masters of the Universe, this collaboration is a strategic move to leverage generative AI to enhance its product offerings and vast intellectual property pipeline. Mattel has been actively expanding its entertainment footprint, especially following the massive success of the “Barbie” movie in 2023. The company is currently developing films and TV shows based on other popular toys and is also venturing into digital gaming. While details are sparse, the integration of AI in toys and content creation could potentially accelerate development cycles, enable new forms of interactive play, and personalize fan experiences in unprecedented ways. What Does This Partnership Mean for AI in Toys and Content? While the specifics of the collaboration remain under wraps, the core focus is clear: applying generative AI to: Product Development: Potentially aiding in the design, prototyping, and even creation of new toy concepts. Content Creation: Assisting in writing scripts, developing storylines, generating art, or creating interactive experiences for films, TV shows, and digital games. Fan Engagement: Creating more personalized, interactive, and engaging experiences for consumers across various platforms. Both companies have emphasized a commitment to safety, privacy, and security as central tenets of this partnership, acknowledging the importance of responsible AI deployment, especially when dealing with products aimed at children and families. Anticipating the First AI-Powered Product The partnership expects to reveal its first joint “AI-powered product” later this year. This announcement is highly anticipated as it will provide a concrete example of how generative AI can be applied in the toy and entertainment sectors. Will it be a toy with advanced conversational capabilities, a tool that allows fans to create their own content based on Mattel IP, or something entirely new? The possibilities enabled by content creation AI are vast and intriguing. Beyond consumer products, Mattel employees will also gain access to OpenAI tools like ChatGPT Enterprise. This internal adoption aims to boost productivity and creativity within the company, streamlining processes from initial ideation to final product realization. Josh Silverman, chief franchise officer at Mattel , highlighted the potential, stating, “AI has the power to expand on that mission and broaden the reach of our brands in new and exciting ways. Our work with OpenAI will enable us to leverage new technologies to solidify our leadership in innovation and reimagine new forms of play.” Whether this collaboration leads to a conversational Barbie powered by a large language model or simply accelerates the scriptwriting process for an upcoming film, it’s clear that Mattel ‘s decades-old brands are embracing the next generation of technological advancement. The integration of AI in toys and entertainment is poised to bring exciting new possibilities to fans worldwide.

The vote is scheduled for Tuesday, June 17, and could mark a turning point for crypto regulation in the country. The U.S. Treasury Secretary believes the stablecoin market cap could exceed $2 trillion in the next few years. What’s the GENIUS Act About? The full name of the bill is the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act. Its goal is to bring legal clarity to stablecoins by setting specific rules for issuers. If passed, stablecoin providers would be required to fully back their tokens with U.S. dollars or other liquid assets. The bill also mandates yearly audits for companies that issue more than $50 billion worth of stablecoins, and it includes extra compliance measures for foreign issuers like Tether. The U.S. Senate will hold a final vote on the GENIUS Act—a major stablecoin regulation bill—on June 17. If passed, it moves to the House. pic.twitter.com/ZRmUqzqOpq — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) June 13, 2025 What Happens After the Senate Vote? If the Senate passes the GENIUS Act, the bill will move to the House of Representatives for further review and voting. The House already has its version of a stablecoin bill, called the STABLE Act, which was passed out of committee in May. However, the two bills differ in some key areas, especially in how they regulate state-based issuers and handle oversight for foreign stablecoin companies. For the legislation to become law, both the Senate and House must agree on a final version of the bill. Why This Matters Now Stablecoin legislation has become a hot topic, especially after President Donald Trump voiced support for clearer crypto laws. Trump wants to see progress by August, adding urgency to the process. Earlier this week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that passing such a law could open the door for massive growth in the stablecoin sector. He even predicted the market could explode to over $2 trillion by 2028. Right now, the USD stablecoin market stands at around $252 billion, according to CoinGecko. Tuesday’s vote could be the first major step toward building a clear and unified rulebook for stablecoins in the U.S. Whether the GENIUS Act becomes law or not, it’s clear that Washington is finally getting serious about crypto regulation. Globally, big investors are eyeing the stablecoin market, and if approved in the US, it will open the door for global investors to flood the US market.

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum began the week on a strong footing by testing the $2,800 resistance following a 10% rally. However, this suddenly came to a stop in the past 24 hours after Israel bombed Iran. The geopolitical tension pushed the whole crypto market down, and ETH erased much of its recent gains, closing the week with a modest 1% gain. The price briefly visited the $2,400 support during its recent drop and is hovering around $2,500 at the time of this post. Hopefully, buyers will defend this support level as a breakdown here could open the way to $2,000 next. With the market on edge due to the geopolitical context, volatility could continue to be high. So far, ETH has made a higher low, and on Wednesday, it made a higher high. This supports a bullish bias as long as the key support holds. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) XRP reversed on Monday and turned bearish when it was rejected at the $2.3 resistance. With sellers taking back control, the last four daily candles closed in red, which brought the price back to the $2 support. This is why XRP closed the week in red with a 1% loss. While this is not too concerning, the support at $2 has to hold if this cryptocurrency hopes to make higher highs later. The current momentum is bearish, but due to the low volume, sellers don’t seem interested in doing much more at this time. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency remains stuck in a tight range with low volatility. This has been ongoing for months, and there has been no decisive breakthrough to date. This is likely to continue to suppress the price. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA tried to distance itself from the $0.64 support, but in the past three days, sellers brought it back to this key level, closing the week with a 2% loss. Ит struggled throughout May and June, and it has not been much better to date. This supports a bearish bias with momentum favoring sellers at this time. The daily MACD also turned bearish today which could put in danger the current support. Looking ahead, if Cardano can’t hold its price above $0.64, then it could revisit $0.5 in the near future. This is a level where buyers returned in the past. Hopefully, they do it again if the key support is lost. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Solana gave market participants a brief excitement when its price moved above $152, which used to act as a resistance. However, that did not last, and in the past three days, sellers returned and pushed it under $150. With a lower low confirmed, the downtrend for Solana is likely to continue. If so, the next major support levels will be found at $130 and $118. The momentum indicators, such as the daily MACD and RSI, also remain bearish at this time. If nothing changes in the days to come, which is unlikely considering the wider market context, then SOL has a good chance to revisit $130. This is a level that could attract buyers and lead it into a relief bounce. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) HYPE made waves in the past few months, and this week is no different. It made a new all-time high at $44 and closed this week with a 15% gain. This makes it the best performer on our list and across most of the market. This achievement also got HYPE next to ADA in terms of market cap on sites such as CoinMarketCap. If this performance continues, HYPE is well placed to challenge ADA or even TRX and DOGE in the future. Looking ahead, HYPE remains in a clear uptrend with key resistances at $41 and $44, at the time of this post. The support level is found at $38, and the price bounced on it during its most recent pullback. If the rally continues, then expect new record prices in the future.

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Dogecoin (DOGE) Source: TradingView Dogecoin (DOGE) currently trades between $0.17 and $0.20. In the past week, it edged up by 0.371%. However, over the last month, it dropped 17.70%, and over six months, it declined by 53.72%. This sharp fall shows significant selling pressure and decreased investor confidence. Technical indicators hint at a possible rebound. Both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are at $0.19, suggesting short-term price stability. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 35.10, below the neutral 50, indicating oversold conditions. The Stochastic oscillator at 19.20 reinforces this view. The negative MACD level of -0.0018 signals bearish momentum that may reverse. If DOGE breaks above the resistance at $0.22, it could rally to $0.25, offering potential gains over 25%. Conversely, if it falls below the support at $0.15, it might drop to $0.1166, a decline of about 30%. Traders are watching these levels to predict DOGE’s next move. XRP (XRP) Source: TradingView XRP has seen notable fluctuations in its price recently. Over the past week, it edged up by 1.83%, settling within a range of $2.12 to $2.36. However, the past month tells a different story, with the price dipping by 11.92%. Looking at the last six months, XRP has decreased by 7.47%, reflecting a broader downward trend. Technical indicators suggest mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 36.16, indicating that XRP is approaching oversold territory. The stochastic value is at 17.05, supporting the possibility of a rebound. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are close, at $2.25 and $2.28 respectively, showing consolidation. The MACD level of -0.0148 suggests bearish momentum may be weakening. XRP faces immediate resistance at $2.44. If it surpasses this level, the next target could be $2.68, representing a potential rise of about 13%. On the downside, support is found at $1.97, and further at $1.73, which could mean a decline of up to 18% if these levels are breached. These figures highlight critical points that might influence XRP’s direction in the near future. Conclusion While DOGE and XRP have delivered gains, XYZVerse (XYZ) could be the next standout, blending meme culture with sports and aiming for massive growth.

Amidst all the hustle and bustle, analyst Cryptex Guy in an X post talks about whether we will see the altseason again. In this write-up, we take you through the proponent’s thesis, on the altcoin season, BTC dominance, stablecoins, Ethereum’s stance, and more. BTC Dominance + Stablecoin Mix: The BTC.D + USDT.D + USDC.D combo chart shared by the analyst highlights how much money sits outside altcoins. Historically, this metric approaching the 74–75% red zone has been a trigger point for sharp altcoin rallies due to rejection from that overhead resistance. Currently sitting at 70.87%, a final push into that zone, followed by rejection, as seen in the past, could mean a capital rotation into altcoins. Notably, a break below the ascending cyan trendline would confirm the end of Bitcoin’s capital dominance run, making way for a full-fledged Altseason, similar to the mini alt-run we’ve seen in Q4 2024. BTC Dominance on Lower Time Frame: On the 4H chart, BTC Dominance has broken out of a rising wedge, a classically bearish pattern for BTC.D. Since altcoins are inversely correlated to BTC.D, this breakout could lead to a short-term relief rally in altcoins. Now, BTC.D appears to be retesting the wedge’s upper boundary. Should this retest be rejected, we can expect a quick 5–10% upside candles on strong altcoins. This aligns with Ethereum’s recent $1000+ surge, which injected $138B into the altcoin ecosystem. Ethereum’s Retest & the Bigger Altseason Picture On higher time frames, Ethereum has reclaimed a significant multi-year trendline, known as the Bull-Bear boundary. A successful reclaim would boost investor confidence and could catalyze sustained inflows into altcoins. The altcoin market is also forming a bullish structure. If this pattern holds, it would set the stage for Altseason 2025, with many altcoins potentially seeing 2–3x gains from current levels. This scenario mirrors the patterns from 2023 and 2024, when capital rotation into alts delivered broad market upside. Also read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 FAQs When can we expect the next Altseason to begin? If BTC.D gets rejected from the 74–75% zone and breaks the trendline, Altseason could commence in late 2025, as historical patterns and technical structures align. What role does Ethereum play in triggering Altseason? Ethereum acts as a capital gateway.

This action, reported by Axios and shared widely via platforms like X by figures such as Walter Bloomberg, marks a critical moment in the ongoing regional tensions. For those following global events and their potential ripple effects on financial markets, including the often-sensitive cryptocurrency space, understanding the nuances of this situation is paramount. This event injects a new level of Geopolitical Risk into an already volatile global landscape. Understanding the Latest Iran Israel Strike The report of an Iran Israel Strike follows a period of heightened direct confrontation between the two nations. For years, the conflict has primarily unfolded through proxies and covert operations. However, recent events saw Iran launch an unprecedented direct missile and drone attack on Israel, which Iran stated was in retaliation for a strike on its consulate in Damascus. Israel had vowed to respond to Iran’s direct attack. The reported strike in Iran appears to be that response, bringing the long-simmering conflict into a more overt phase. While details are still emerging, initial reports suggest the strike targeted specific locations within Iran. The nature and extent of the damage, as well as Iran’s official response, are key factors that will determine the immediate trajectory of the situation. The world watches closely, assessing the potential for further escalation. Why Geopolitical Risk Matters for Global Markets Major geopolitical events inherently introduce uncertainty, which financial markets dislike. An increase in Geopolitical Risk can trigger significant reactions across various asset classes. Historically, conflicts in the Middle East, a region central to global energy supplies, have had pronounced effects on oil prices. Rising oil prices can contribute to inflation, impacting monetary policy decisions by central banks worldwide. This, in turn, influences everything from bond yields to stock valuations. Beyond energy, heightened tensions can disrupt supply chains, affect international trade, and dampen investor confidence. In times of uncertainty, investors often move towards assets traditionally considered ‘safe havens,’ such as gold or certain government bonds. However, the definition of a safe haven can shift, and the interconnectedness of modern markets means that even traditional safe havens can experience volatility during extreme stress events. Here are some potential ways geopolitical risk can ripple through markets: Energy Prices: Direct impact if conflict threatens production or transit routes. Investor Sentiment: Increased fear can lead to sell-offs in riskier assets. Supply Chains: Disruptions can affect global manufacturing and trade. Inflation: Higher energy or commodity prices can fuel inflationary pressures. Central Bank Policy: Geopolitical factors can influence decisions on interest rates. Navigating Escalating Middle East Tensions The current Middle East Tensions between Iran and Israel are particularly concerning due to the potential for a wider regional conflict involving other state and non-state actors. The involvement of proxies, the strategic importance of the region, and the complex web of alliances make de-escalation challenging. Any miscalculation could have severe consequences, extending beyond the immediate combatants. Understanding the historical context is crucial. The animosity between Iran and Israel dates back decades, rooted in political, religious, and strategic disagreements. Iran’s support for groups hostile to Israel and its nuclear program are central points of contention. Israel views Iran as an existential threat. This latest direct exchange marks a dangerous evolution in their rivalry. International reactions play a key role in shaping the narrative and potential outcomes. Calls for restraint from global powers are common, but the effectiveness of such calls depends on the willingness of the parties involved to step back. The position of major global players like the United States, European Union nations, Russia, and China will be critical in diplomatic efforts, or lack thereof. The Potential Global Market Impact The immediate Global Market Impact of the reported strike is likely to manifest as increased volatility. Futures markets often react quickly to such news, and the start of trading sessions will reveal how this development is being priced in by investors worldwide. Sectors most directly affected might include energy, defense, and potentially technology, given the reliance on global supply chains. However, the longer-term impact depends heavily on whether this event leads to further escalation or if diplomatic efforts manage to contain the situation. A prolonged or expanded conflict would likely have a more sustained negative impact on global economic growth prospects and market stability. Conversely, a swift de-escalation could see markets recover relatively quickly, having priced in the initial shock. Market participants will be closely monitoring official statements from Iran and Israel, as well as reactions from major international bodies and governments. The language used and the actions taken in the coming hours and days will be critical indicators of the potential trajectory of the conflict and, consequently, the markets. Considering Crypto Volatility in Times of Geopolitical Stress The relationship between geopolitical events and the cryptocurrency market is complex and not always straightforward. While Bitcoin was envisioned by some as a non-sovereign store of value, potentially acting as a safe haven during traditional financial system stress, its price often behaves like a risk asset, correlating with technology stocks. Crypto Volatility is already a defining characteristic of the market. Geopolitical events can exacerbate this volatility, though the direction isn’t always predictable. In some instances, initial news of conflict might lead to a sell-off in risk assets, including crypto. However, if the event is perceived as weakening traditional financial systems or increasing inflation fears (due to rising commodity prices, for example), some investors might theoretically turn to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value, potentially driving prices up. The crypto market is also influenced by global liquidity and macroeconomic factors, which are indirectly affected by geopolitical stability. Increased global uncertainty can lead to tighter financial conditions, which typically pressure risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, if central banks were to react to a geopolitical crisis with more accommodative monetary policy (though this is not the current trend), it could potentially provide tailwinds for crypto. Here’s a look at potential, though not guaranteed, impacts on crypto: Initial Sell-off: As part of a broader risk-off move across markets. Increased Correlation: May see crypto move in tandem with traditional indices like the S&P 500. Narrative Play: Renewed discussion around Bitcoin as a potential safe haven, though market action doesn’t always support this consistently. Heightened Volatility: Prices likely to swing more dramatically based on news flow. For cryptocurrency holders and traders, this period calls for increased vigilance. Monitoring global news alongside market data is essential. Understanding that external, non-crypto specific events can significantly impact digital asset prices is a crucial part of navigating this market. What Happens Next? Potential Scenarios Predicting the future in geopolitical situations is impossible, but analysts are considering several potential scenarios following the reported Iran Israel Strike : De-escalation: Both sides, having demonstrated capability and resolve, might choose to step back, possibly under international pressure. This is the most hopeful scenario for regional stability and markets. Limited, Tit-for-Tat Exchanges: The situation could devolve into a series of limited strikes and counter-strikes, potentially targeting military assets or infrastructure, but avoiding all-out war. This maintains high tension and market uncertainty. Wider Regional Conflict: The conflict could expand, drawing in proxies or even direct involvement from other regional powers or global players. This is the most dangerous scenario with severe humanitarian and economic consequences. The actions and rhetoric of leaders in Tehran, Tel Aviv, Washington D.C., and other capitals will provide clues about which path is most likely being taken. Diplomatic efforts, back-channel communications, and public statements will all be scrutinized. Actionable Insights for the Informed Reader Given the unfolding situation and its potential Global Market Impact , what should readers, especially those with exposure to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, consider? Stay Informed: Rely on reputable news sources for updates on the geopolitical situation. Understand the facts as they are reported and differentiate them from speculation. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events are a reminder that external shocks can occur. Ensure your investment portfolio aligns with your comfort level regarding risk and volatility. Understand Market Correlations: Be aware that crypto prices can be influenced by broader market sentiment and macroeconomic factors tied to global stability. Avoid Panic Decisions: Volatility can trigger emotional responses. Make investment decisions based on your long-term strategy, not short-term news spikes. Diversification: Consider whether your portfolio is adequately diversified across different asset classes, which can help mitigate risks associated with specific market segments or events. While it’s impossible to perfectly predict how Middle East Tensions will specifically affect Crypto Volatility in the short term, being prepared for potential market reactions is prudent. This involves understanding the underlying factors at play and maintaining a rational approach to investing during uncertain times. Summary: A Critical Juncture The reported Iran Israel Strike marks a significant escalation in long-standing Middle East Tensions . This event immediately heightens Geopolitical Risk , with potentially far-reaching consequences for regional stability and the global economy. The Global Market Impact is likely to be characterized by increased uncertainty and Crypto Volatility , at least in the short term. While the exact trajectory of events remains uncertain, the coming days will be critical in determining whether this leads to further conflict or a path towards de-escalation. For investors and global citizens alike, staying informed and understanding the potential implications of this developing situation is essential.

In a latest analysis, expert EllioTrades has listed some altcoins that he believes have major upside once regulations are clear. Aave (AAVE) Aave is currently trading at $284.82, down 3% in the past day. It is up 24% in the past month. AAVE has rallied 180% since April, recently hitting $312, its highest since February. AAVE also formed a golden cross on the charts, and it could keep climbing toward $398, a 28% gain from current levels, unless it falls below the $282 support. Maker (MKR) Maker is currently trading at $1885, down 5% in the last 24 hours. It is up around 17% in the last 2 weeks, and experts predict Maker to rise by 34% and reach $2,512 by July 13, with a price range between $1,879 and $2,570. While the short-term sentiment is mixed, analysts expect up to 35% upside in July if the trend holds, with an average target around $2,475. Maple Finance (SYRUP) Maple Finance is currently trading at $0.4825, down over 3%. It is up around 60% in the past month. Key levels to watch are support at $0.46 and resistance at $0.52. If volume picks up, the price could rise toward $0.55. Ethena (ENA) Ethena is currently trading at $0.2931, down over 10% in the last 24 hours. However, analysts believe that Ethena is testing the upper resistance of a descending channel on the daily chart. A breakout could send the price toward key targets at $0.45, $0.63, and $0.95. Euler (EUL) Euler is currently trading at $7.51, down 7.3%. Euler is down 15.78% over the past month and currently trades below both the 50-day and 200-day SMAs, signaling a bearish trend. A short-term recovery could push EUL to $16.10 by end of June, with a longer-term target of $27.32 by end of 2027. Pendle (PENDLE) Pendle is currently trading at $3.83, down 1.5% in the past day.

Nexon is heavily invested in Web 3 gaming, including the ambitious MapleStory franchise. The firm has reportedly approached the family of Nexon’s late founder Kim Jung-ju, who controls a 44.4% stake in Nexon via holding company NXC Corp, to discuss a potential acquisition. Discussions are still preliminary, and there’s no guarantee they will result in a deal, the report states, citing sources close to the matter. If successful, Tencent would be acquiring a company with a $16.6 billion market capitalization, a move that could reignite its ambitions in global gaming M&A after a slowdown sparked by Chinese regulatory crackdowns in 2020. The deal could help Tencent secure long-term control over popular intellectual property and give it a firmer foothold in South Korea’s lucrative gaming market. But any deal would be complicated. The Kim family inherited control after the founder’s death in 2022 and has since handed shares to the Korean government to cover inheritance taxes. The government has been unable to offload its stake. Tencent previously tried to buy Nexon in 2019, but talks collapsed over pricing. This new attempt follows Tencent’s $1.3 billion investment in a new Ubisoft unit and a 10% stake in K-pop label SM Entertainment. The Chinese tech giant is also expanding in the blockchain space, announcing earlier this year that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop a suite of blockchain API services with Ankr.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/blackrock-xrp-etf-is-coming-heres-the-latest/,"Speculation surrounding a potential XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) surged this week after influential ETF analyst Nate Geraci suggested that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is likely to expand its crypto ETF portfolio to include XRP . In a post on X, Geraci asserted that he “fully expects BlackRock to file for spot Solana and XRP ETFs,” explaining that, as a market leader in spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, it would make “zero sense to cede other top crypto asset ETF categories to competitors.” Shortly after Geraci’s post, Amonyx echoed the sentiment in a bold update: “BREAKING: BlackRock XRP ETF is coming .” Though no formal filing has been made public, the momentum building behind this possibility reflects broader industry expectations that XRP could soon join the ranks of institutionally traded digital assets. BREAKING: BlackRock #XRP ETF is coming. pic.twitter.com/ZL56tykoI0 — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 13, 2025 BlackRock’s Expansion Strategy and the XRP Advantage BlackRock’s interest in digital assets has moved far beyond exploratory. Since the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become a dominant force in crypto markets, drawing billions in institutional capital. In May 2024, the SEC also approved 19b-4 filings for spot Ethereum ETFs.. With these milestones achieved, the next logical step for BlackRock is expansion into other high-liquidity digital assets. XRP stands out as a prime candidate. It is one of the oldest and most actively traded cryptocurrencies, with a deep pool of liquidity, robust exchange listings, and a well-established infrastructure through Ripple and the XRP Ledger. Geraci also noted that he expects BlackRock to file for an index-based crypto ETF — a fund likely to include XRP among other top tokens. Such a move would not only expand investor access to diversified crypto exposure but also elevate XRP’s role in institutional portfolios. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Clarity Supporting ETF Possibility A crucial factor supporting an XRP ETF is the partial legal clarity secured in Ripple’s ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In July 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security in programmatic (exchange-based) sales, effectively giving the green light for its trading on secondary markets. While the case remains active, a final resolution is expected soon. Compared to many altcoins still clouded by regulatory ambiguity, XRP enjoys a legal advantage that makes it a feasible candidate for ETF structuring. With Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs already approved and launched, XRP’s combination of legal clarity, market maturity, and infrastructure strength makes it a natural next step. Market Watching for BlackRock’s Next Move Amonyx’s declaration that a “BlackRock XRP ETF is coming” may not reflect an official filing, but it aligns with a growing consensus in the financial world. BlackRock has made no secret of its ambition to dominate the crypto ETF space. Failing to secure a position in the XRP market would leave room for rivals such as Fidelity or VanEck — a move that seems unlikely given BlackRock’s aggressive strategy to lead. As the regulatory environment evolves and demand for diverse crypto investment vehicles grows, the launch of a BlackRock XRP ETF appears increasingly inevitable.

Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz reiterated his projection that Bitcoin could rise tenfold to reach $1 million, while Mercurity Fintech Holding unveiled plans to raise $800 million to build a corporate Bitcoin treasury. Mike Novogratz Projects $1 Million Bitcoin: A Macro Asset on the Rise Galaxy Digital CEO and outspoken crypto advocate Mike Novogratz is once again making waves with his bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting the digital currency could one day reach $1 million per coin. Speaking in an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Novogratz outlined a scenario in which Bitcoin continues its steady ascent by gradually displacing gold as a store of value, driven by younger generations and expanding institutional adoption. “The bull case becomes that over time young people care about it more than old people, so gold slowly gets replaced by Bitcoin,” Novogratz said. “If you look at gold's market cap and Bitcoin's market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go — 10x — and so that’s [$1 million] Bitcoin just to be where gold is.” Novogratz’s outlook isn’t based on short-term speculation but rather a broader shift in the global financial paradigm. With Bitcoin currently trading around $106,210 and a total market capitalization exceeding $2 trillion, reaching a $1 million valuation would imply a staggering $20 trillion market cap — putting Bitcoin on par with the total estimated value of all the world’s gold. The Galaxy Digital chief emphasized that macro-level adoption of Bitcoin is already underway. ”Now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin,” he said. “The adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in — I think that’s now a ball rolling downhill.” That momentum is most clearly seen in the rise of institutional Bitcoin investment vehicles, most notably BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF. Since its launch, the ETF has accumulated over $70 billion in assets under management, accounting for roughly 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. The product provides traditional investors with exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of self-custody, making it easier than ever to add the asset to a portfolio. This institutional interest is helping to legitimize Bitcoin as a modern-day alternative to traditional safe havens like gold. According to Novogratz, it’s this systemic shift — rather than speculative hype — that is laying the foundation for Bitcoin’s long-term growth. A Broader Chorus of Bulls Novogratz is far from alone in predicting Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest made headlines in April when it raised its long-term price projection for Bitcoin from $1.5 million to $2.4 million by 2030, citing continued institutional inflows and technological innovation. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor, another vocal Bitcoin bull, has also consistently reiterated his belief in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, going so far as to funnel billions of dollars from his company’s balance sheet into the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s fundamentals have continued to strengthen as well. With an annual price appreciation of over 50%, the asset is now trading within reach of its all-time high of $111,000. Despite short-term volatility, the longer-term trend remains bullish, particularly as macroeconomic conditions favor hard assets amid concerns of inflation and fiat currency debasement. While Novogratz’s comments are bullish, they are not without vested interest. Galaxy Digital has positioned itself deeply within the crypto ecosystem. The firm’s asset management division last year raised $113 million for Galaxy Ventures, a fund dedicated to early-stage crypto investments. Additionally, the company holds approximately 12,830 BTC on its balance sheet — worth more than $1 billion at current prices — and operates a large-scale Bitcoin mining operation in Texas. The performance of Bitcoin has a direct impact on Galaxy Digital’s financial health, as well as the broader valuation of the crypto sector. A tenfold increase in Bitcoin’s price would not only validate Novogratz’s thesis but significantly boost the firm’s own assets and revenue. Roadblocks Ahead? Despite the optimistic outlook, a number of factors could slow Bitcoin’s ascent to $1 million. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant concern, especially in jurisdictions with tightening scrutiny on crypto markets. Moreover, the pace of institutional adoption, while growing, still faces hurdles in terms of infrastructure, security, and risk management. Critics also point to Bitcoin’s scalability and energy consumption as challenges to mass adoption, although proponents argue that these issues are being mitigated by innovations in layer-2 scaling solutions and growing use of renewable energy in mining operations. Novogratz’s vision for Bitcoin is not predicated on short-term price action, but on a multi-decade transformation of global finance. As the asset becomes more embedded in the portfolios of corporations, sovereign wealth funds, and everyday investors, its utility as a digital store of value could rival or even exceed that of gold. Whether Bitcoin will eventually reach the $1 million milestone remains to be seen. But if the current trajectory of adoption, innovation, and institutional integration continues, Novogratz’s projection might be less far-fetched than it seems. Mercurity Fintech to Raise $800M for Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Amid Rising Corporate Crypto Adoption Meanwhile, Mercurity Fintech Holding, a Nasdaq-listed digital finance firm focused on blockchain-based payment infrastructure, announced plans on Wednesday to raise $800 million in capital to create a long-term Bitcoin treasury reserve. The move places the company among a growing list of corporations integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheet strategies as institutional adoption of crypto assets accelerates worldwide. In its official statement, Mercurity detailed that the Bitcoin reserve would be established using a blockchain-native approach, incorporating custody solutions, staking mechanisms, and tokenized treasury management services. The initiative is aimed at creating a resilient and yield-generating asset reserve that aligns with the firm’s strategic focus on digital financial infrastructure. Mercurity’s proposed $800 million capital raise—if executed at current market prices near $104,000 per BTC—would enable the company to purchase approximately 7,433 Bitcoin. This would catapult Mercurity into the 11th spot among corporate Bitcoin holders globally, surpassing GameStop, which holds 4,710 BTC, according to data from Bitbo. Largest corporate Bitcoin holders (Source: Bitbo ) The initiative reflects a growing corporate trend of transitioning idle treasury funds into digital assets with long-term upside and inflation-hedging potential. Mercurity said it plans to structure the reserve in a way that generates yield while maintaining strategic exposure to Bitcoin as a long-duration asset. The reserve will integrate with blockchain-based treasury management services, reinforcing the company's commitment to decentralized financial systems. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Reaches Record Highs Mercurity’s announcement comes amid a surge in corporate interest in Bitcoin. Recent figures from BitcoinTreasuries.NET reveal that over 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin in their treasuries, up from just 124 earlier this month. These firms collectively control over 819,000 BTC, equivalent to nearly 3.9% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Firms like Strategy, Galaxy Digital, and Tesla have already paved the way for Bitcoin to become a legitimate corporate reserve asset. Strategy alone holds more than 214,000 BTC, and the trend appears to be accelerating with new entrants like Mercurity Fintech stepping into the arena. While Bitcoin remains the primary asset of choice for corporate treasuries, alternative cryptocurrencies are also gaining traction. For example, Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness equipment manufacturer, recently disclosed plans to raise up to $500 million to establish a Fetch.ai (FET) token treasury. The move underscores a broader institutional appetite not just for Bitcoin, but for blockchain-based assets more generally.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-13 12:00:00

Through a $1 billion capital raise, Strategy has given the market a third preferred share option, Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, for income investors with higher risk tolerance. STRD pays an effective yield of 11.3%, though dividend payouts are not mandatory. I still like STRF far better due to seniority and cumulative, mandatory payouts, but I think STRD is also worth a look. After purchasing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) at a blistering clip for much of April and May, Strategy ( MSTR ) has slowed down the company's purchases of BTC during the month of June. Through June 11th, Strategy has reported buying just 1,750 BTC at a total cost of $185 million: Reported Periods (Strategy, Author's Chart) For just about any other company in the public equity markets, $185 million in just a couple of weeks would be significant. But for Strategy, this is perhaps underwhelming, given the company has averaged about $4 billion per month going back to September. What is also interesting, in my view, is that both of the announced purchases have come with funding through Strategy's preferred stock offerings via the MicroStrategy Incorporated 10.00% SER A PERPETUAL STRIFE PFD STK ( STRF ) and MicroStrategy Incorporated 8.00% SERIES A PERPETUAL STRIKE PFD ( STRK ) rather than through the company's common stock. Simultaneous to these preferred share-driven BTC acquisitions, Strategy announced the offering and pricing of a third perpetual preferred share, this latest one is the Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock ( STRD ). In this article, I'll detail how STRD is different from Strategy's previous two preferred share offerings and assess whether income investors should consider adding STRD to their portfolios. STRD Offering Details On June 6th, Strategy announced the offering of 2,500,000 shares of STRD perpetual preferred shares with a yield of 10%. Subsequent to the offering, Strategy sold 11,764,700 shares at an offering price of $85 per share. The STRD offering raised $1 billion for the company, with expected net proceeds of $979.7 million after underwriting commissions. Like the two other perpetual preferred shares, STRD has a liquidation preference of $100. Which means the effective yield on STRD would actually be closer to 11.3% at the closing price of $88.35 on June 11th assuming Strategy declares the dividend and pays shareholders. That last point is the critical difference between STRD and both STRK/STRF. Comparison of Strategy Preferred Stocks Unlike STRK and STRF, STRD is not a mandatory dividend. This makes STRD the riskiest of the three offerings, but it's a terrific way to raise capital from Strategy's vantage, since it isn't dilutive to common stockholders. The latter of which saw shares outstanding grow by over 50% year over year as of the quarter ended March, with even more dilution through the ATM to fund BTC purchases subsequent to Q1. Still, assuming Strategy wants to ever be able to raise capital again in this market, I would expect the company to declare the STRD dividend each quarter. The breakdown of the key differences between the shares as I see it is below: Share Comparison STRD STRF STRK Coupon 10% 10% 8% Cumulative? No Yes Yes Mandatory Dividend? No Yes Yes MSTR Convertible? No No 10:1 Preferred Seniority Rank 3 1 2 Liquidation Preference $100 $100 $100 Share Price Close as of 6/11/25 $88.35 $104.70 $106.72 Effective Yield 11.32% 9.55% 7.50% Source: Strategy From where I sit, Strategy has actually done a pretty incredible job of creating preferred share structures that appeal to different investor types. All of these preferred shares are ultimately backed by the company's Bitcoin on the balance sheet. But one need not believe in the future price appreciation of BTC to find these shares appealing. Given the seniority rank of STRF compared to the other preferred stocks, I view STRF as the lowest-risk and most suitable for income investors. The shares have a mandatory dividend that are cumulative. Meaning, if Strategy misses a payment, STRF shareholders are still owed the payout. Since STRF is not convertible to MSTR shares, the upside in STRF is more limited than that of STRK in the event Bitcoin rallies significantly and drags MSTR with it. But even at a 9.55% effective yield, STRF is quite attractive given Strategy's collateralization ratio. STRK is perhaps more suitable for investors who care less about the effective yield and more about the total return of the shares. At a $1,000 MSTR share price, STRK becomes interesting on the capital appreciation potential given the 10:1 convertibility to the common stock. However, purely as an income product, I think STRK is less appealing than STRF due to the seniority rank and lower effective yield. STRD is perhaps the most interesting preferred stock of the three offerings because it's the highest risk and currently has the highest yield. For income investors who like sure things, I'd probably avoid this one. But for income-investors who have a higher risk-tolerance, I think STRD is worth a look. The biggest reason for that - aside from Strategy's collateralization ratio - is that the market has already taken the more senior preferred shares above liquidation preference. So the effective yields when buying those funds on secondary are actually lower than the 10% and 8% coupons from the offering. Thus, if you still want a Strategy preferred that yields 10%, STRD is your only option currently. Can Strategy Actually Pay These Shareholders? Ultimately, the investment case for any of these preferred stock shares lies in the ability Strategy has to actually pay shareholders back. At current Bitcoin price levels, my view is that there is low risk in holding these shares today. However, that view is predicated on the notion that Strategy exhibits a willingness to lock in some of the company's unrealized Bitcoin gains and pay its preferred share dividends with the proceeds of those sales. Even if Strategy stops raising capital through the preferred instruments going forward, the company has an annualized coupon obligation of over $300 million based on my calculation of the combined outstanding shares: Preferred Payouts STRK STRF STRD Shares 11,306,243 9,412,070 11,764,700 Annual Coupon Obligation $90,449,944 $94,120,700 $117,647,000 Source: Strategy filings, Analyst's calculations Of course, Strategy could simply not pay the $118 million STRD dividends over the next 12 months. But again, I think doing so would irreparably damage the company's ability to raise capital. My view is it's essentially a mathematical certainty that Strategy will have to start selling Bitcoin to pay these preferred obligations. Keep in mind, the company's software business loses money and cannot support these preferred share payouts. Data by YCharts After a gross profit of $326 million on a trailing twelve-month basis, Strategy's bottom-line goes negative when factoring in the combined $392 million on SG&A and R&D expenses. So again, Strategy cannot pay these dividends from the operations of the software business. The company either has to keep raising from new investors to pay the old ones (there is a word for this) or it has to realize gains in BTC appreciation. My vote is the latter. Major Risk Of course, the risk here is that Strategy is one of the biggest BTC holders in the market at this juncture. If the company starts selling, investment demand through the spot ETF products could sour and Strategy could take the market down essentially by itself. But given the current market value of Bitcoin, I think longing STRD is worth the risk given Strategy has $11.5 billion in convertible debt and preferred share obligations against $63 billion in Bitcoin holdings. Closing Summary In my opinion, STRF is hands-down the best choice for income-focused investors who want a high-yield offering with some margin of safety. With STRF, the dividends are mandatory, cumulative, and are senior to the other two offerings. Meaning, if Bitcoin goes into a deep bear market and Strategy is forced to sell BTC to make preferred payments, STRF shareholders are paid back before STRK and STRD shareholders. While STRD is clearly the riskiest of the three offerings because there is no guarantee of any dividends at all, I do expect Strategy to pay them and believe the market will bring STRD shares more in line with the liquidation preference of $100 as it did with both STRK and STRF; each of which now trade at premiums to liquidation preference. Thus, at a share price currently trading under $89, I think STRD is somewhat easy to justify on the potential price appreciation alone. As I noted in my last coverage of MSTR, I'm personally long STRF. I am now also long STRD to a smaller degree. My approach to STRD is quite simple; I'm long the shares at $88 and plan to sell closer to $95-96. At that point, I'd entertain rolling proceeds into STRF for the mandatory payment. I remain of the view that Strategy's Bitcoin flywheel could have devastating consequences in a Bitcoin bear market, and I view STRF shares as insurance against my BTC position. The price of that insurance is the spread between Bitcoin capital gains that I may miss out on and the 11% effective yield at my STRF cost basis.",STRF|STRK|STRD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-13 12:00:00

The move comes after KuCoin secured a license from Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), allowing it to operate as a legally recognized digital asset exchange. Announced on Friday, the new entity—KuCoin Thailand—is the company’s first fully licensed exchange in any market. The platform was formed through the acquisition and rebranding of ERX Company, which was Thailand’s first SEC-regulated digital token exchange. All existing ERX users have been migrated to the newly launched KuCoin platform. KuCoin emphasized that the launch demonstrates its dedication to regulatory compliance and security. The exchange recently attained both the SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications, underlining its focus on robust data protection and risk management practices. “This marks a significant step toward strengthening our presence in the fast-growing markets of Southeast Asia,” said KuCoin CEO BC Wong. “More importantly, it brings secure, accessible crypto services to users where they are.” Strategic Market Entry Through Acquisition Rather than building from the ground up, KuCoin chose to acquire ERX to accelerate its market entry. This strategic approach enabled KuCoin to enter Thailand’s competitive crypto market with an established user base and SEC oversight already in place. ERX was rebranded to KuCoin Thailand on April 22, and operations have since been transitioned to the KuCoin platform. Thailand is a rapidly growing hub for digital asset trading, currently home to eight other licensed exchanges, including Bitkub Online, Gulf Binance, Upbit Exchange, and WAAN Exchange. With the KuCoin Thailand launch, the exchange positions itself among these top players, eyeing both local and international traders. Thailand Crypto Ambitions KuCoin’s expansion aligns closely with the Thai government’s pro-crypto stance. The country has been pursuing several initiatives to integrate blockchain and crypto technologies into its economy. Among them is a plan to allow tourists in Thailand to make crypto payments via credit card systems—a move that could boost Thailand’s appeal as a tech-savvy travel destination. Additionally, Thailand is exploring the launch of a Thai Baht-backed stablecoin tied to government bonds. This could democratize bond investments and potentially introduce a new means of everyday payments, setting the stage for further crypto adoption in the region.

The whale, recognized as one of the most experienced traders in the crypto space, switched to a short position with 20X leverage. Another Hyperliquid whale was pushed out of its long position following the downturn of BTC prices. The whale, recognized as @aguilatrades, is one of the oldest known participants in the BTC market. Unlike Wynn, this trader hardly publicizes its decisions and trades, and is not seeking popularity. The new wallet was identified just days ago and tagged by on-chain investigators. AguilaTrades( @AguilaTrades ) has closed his $BTC long position with over $12.4M in losses — and flipped short. Will he keep racking up losses, or is this short his shot at redemption? https://t.co/dSItG8OY3n pic.twitter.com/L04a0FyNtE — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 13, 2025 Hyperliquid whales have suffered recent liquidations On-chain data showed the trader closed a 40X leveraged long on BTC, absorbing $12.4M in losses. Soon after that, the whale opened a 20X leveraged short position valued at over $878K. At one point, AguilaTrades took a position opposite the risky trader James Wynn . The inflow of whale traders also attracted none other than Andrew Tate , who was quickly liquidated in the high-risk market. Recently, Wynn also got liquidated on multiple positions, also involving meme tokens like PEPE. Counter-trading Wynn was still a winning strategy, as in the case of one whale making $8M from shorting BTC just in time for its downturn. The Hyperliquid whale was closely watched for a shift in sentiment, as long positions were attacked again. | Source: Hyperliquid The series of liquidations affected multiple whales that voted confidence in BTC or went long on ETH. BTC traded at $104,763, while ETH slid to the $2,500 range, breaking its attempt to regain $2,800. The market momentum turned, as greed trading shifted to a more neutral attitude. The liquidations for long whales coincided with the market-wide downturn and liquidation of long positions. Around $1B was liquidated from the crypto markets in the past 24 hours, with over $451M in liquidations for BTC pairs. Hyperliquid activity remains near peak levels Despite this, Hyperliquid’s activity remained near peak levels, aiming to retain its activity from April and May. Hyperliquid usually became more active during times of clear direction for top coins, with whales taking high-profile positions. Following the recent peak activity, HYPE slid down to $40 after peaking at $43.76. The token sees additional buying pressure from whales, which may bring the price back toward $45. Whales are also using Hyperliquid to build positions on the native token, as well as currently hot meme tokens. Hyperliquid remains a high-risk venue, which has still produced whales with significant earnings, based on the DEX leaderboard . The high-profile trades partially disguised the performance of whales that still managed to win in the current market. Hyperliquid still reflects the general exuberance of the market. However, there are skeptics that see the exchange as a venue for money-laundering, using liquidations to sway the asset price, while holding the reverse position on another exchange. Additionally, Hyperliquid users are still expecting a potential second airdrop, keeping up activity in the hopes of receiving a higher payout. Hyperliquid remains the ninth-largest ecosystem by value locked, mostly due to the weight of the native HYPE token, but also for a small collection of memes . The ecosystem locks in $1.6B in value, with near-record inflows of USDC in the past days. The DEX still contains over $3.1B in USDC, breaking to a new high in the past week.

Tether is well known for creating the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT . In recent months, Tether has been bolstering its gold and Bitcoin reserves, as part of a broader strategy to back up its stablecoin with hard assets. Tether obtained 78,421,780 common shares of Elemental Altus. The deal was reportedly made offshore to secure such a large transaction. Tether made an options trade, with AlphaStream mediating the agreement, to obtain 34,444,580 additional shares from Elemental Altus. The trade marks a pivotal moment for the stablecoin issuer, with a significant investment in the gold royalties market. Tether invested in the gold royalties company Elemental Altus for around $89.2 million, branching out into precious metals and tangible asset markets. The stablecoin USDT, operated by Tether, has a market capitalization of $155 billion. Elemental Altus is a publicly listed company that is traded on the Toronto-based exchange. The share price of ELE jumped around 23% on the news that Tether had purchased a third of the shares. Tether purchased the common shares from La Mancha, a Luxembourg-based mining and investment firm. When the announcement was made to the general public, the price of ELE jumped to around $1.30. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, commented that the investment reflects Tether’s confidence in the gold market and its fundamentals at this moment in time. Elemental Altus is a gold royalty company, which means it finances mining operations and receives a royalty in return for the gold revenues. For this reason, gold royalty companies are considered low-risk because they merely finance operations and have very little overhead to concern themselves with. Gold royalty companies spend considerable time investigating whether a client would make a profit for the company. From an investor’s perspective, gold royalty companies are attractive because they can potentially continue to make profits even after a gold price boom. Tether commented that such an investment reflected their interest in low-risk exposure to real-world assets. Tether plans to enhance its financial products’ stability and transparency by diversifying into the gold royalties market. Ardoino commented that Tether was increasing in Gold and Bitcoin as part of a forward-looking strategy to build a more transparent financial system. Ardoino argued that Bitcoin was a proven hedge against inflation, and Gold was a time-tested long-term value store. Ardoino reiterated that gold investment was about profits and creating a resilient financial infrastructure for the next century. Tether’s complex asset strategy includes over 100,000 BTC, 80 tons of physical gold, and stablecoin Tether Gold XAUT. Tether has been slowly building a new financial infrastructure to replace the existing systems. However, Tether is creating an economic system built from blockchain technology, making it a more transparent and fair system for investors. A portfolio combining Gold and Bitcoin allows investors to couple the two assets into one portfolio. Bitcoin already symbolises Gold through its language, such as proof-of-work and mining. It makes sense to further associate the two assets with one another. Tether has consistently built its gold stablecoin XAUT, which is further validated by having gold investments. Tether may also wish to invest in commodity-backed digital assets, requiring expertise in various business models such as gold royalties. Tether may create a gold-based backbone for the Tether USDT ecosystem by associating Gold with Bitcoin. Tether could also collaborate with the Elemental Altus management board to develop financial products further. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, stated that the core strategy for Tether was to create a financial system backed by tangible assets. In Q1 2025, Tether bought around $735 million worth of Bitcoin. This formed part of the company’s strategy to back up their financial instruments with real-world assets. Tether bought 8,888 BTC when the price was valued at around $82k. This massive buy-in ranked Tether as the sixth-largest holder of Bitcoin worldwide. At the time, the buy-in added to Tether’s accumulation treasury of 92,647 BTC. However, the stablecoin issuer now owns over 100,000 BTC. Tether, moreover, owns around 80 tons of gold, showing its commitment to amassing real-world assets to its portfolio. It would be convenient for Tether to amass Bitcoin reserves because the digital asset is stored online. Still, Tether has also aimed to accumulate gold reserves to back up its gold stablecoin.

He spoke at a Senate hearing this week. His outlook came as Congress moved to set new rules on how these tokens must be backed. Related Reading: TRX Price Up As Tron Rolls Out The Red Carpet For Trump-Backed Stablecoin Growth Forecast Details According to Bloomberg, Bessent said a leading industry group expects the stablecoin market cap to top $2 trillion. He called that view “very reasonable.” It would mean backing up to $2 trillion in tokens with US Treasury Bills. Based on reports, Citigroup analysts think issuers might buy an extra $1 trillion in those bills by 2030. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that dollar-linked stablecoins could hit $2 trillion or even more as he reiterated the potential for these digital assets to strengthen the greenback’s position https://t.co/HwVRu0aPkT — Bloomberg (@business) June 11, 2025 Backing Rules Move Forward Lawmakers voted to advance a key amendment to the GENIUS Act, which would force stablecoin issuers to hold reserves in top-tier assets. The amendment won cloture yesterday. That clears the way for a final vote, likely early next week. Supporters say the change will boost confidence by ensuring every dollar-linked token has real backing. Market Size Today Right now, the total stablecoin market sits at about $255 billion. Dollar-pegged coins make up roughly $233 billion of that. That equals 90% of the whole market. The top nine dollar-pegged coins include USDT, USDC, USDe, DAI, USD1, FDUSD, PYUSD, TUSD, and USDD. They account for nearly all stablecoin activity. Challenges Ahead Regulators have work to do. If the GENIUS Act stalls or changes, issuers might head to friendlier markets. There’s also a risk that a handful of big players could dominate. That could create new “too big to fail” worries if a major issuer faces trouble. Plus, tech glitches and smart-contract bugs could still trigger runs on tokens.

Issuers need strong risk plans. And users must see clear benefits beyond speculation. For now, the market is small compared with the broader financial system.

While plenty of names are riding short-term buzz, one project is consistently topping the charts for both innovation and traction: BlockDAG. Its unique combination of DAG structure and Proof-of-Work, paired with full EVM compatibility, makes it a standout on the tech front. Add in the X1 app, which has already brought over 1.5 million users into the mix, and it’s clear this isn’t just hype, it’s real momentum. Elsewhere, Solaxy (SOLX), Snorter (SNORT), and Cardano (ADA) are showing solid signals too, with niche strengths and growing communities. But when it comes to all-around impact, BlockDAG is setting the pace. Here’s a closer look at what each name brings to the table. 1. BlockDAG: Speed, Scale, and 2,660% ROI Already Delivered! BlockDAG is turning heads across the crypto space in June 2025, and the momentum is impossible to ignore. With over $299 million already raised and more than 22.4 billion BDAG sold, the project is quickly becoming the standout of this cycle. Its current batch 29 price sits at $0.0276, offering a huge upside before it officially launches at $0.05. Early coin holders have already seen an ROI of 2,660%. What sets BlockDAG apart isn’t just the numbers; it’s the tech. This Layer 1 combines a Proof-of-Work mechanism with a DAG framework, delivering blazing speeds without compromising decentralization. It’s also fully compatible with Ethereum, making it easy for builders to shift over without reworking their entire platforms. The buzz keeps growing. BlockDAG’s X1 app has now been downloaded over 1.5 million times, letting people mine daily right from their phones, up to 20 BDAG every day. That’s helped push its popularity through the roof. Lastly, with 20 exchange listings coming soon, BlockDAG is setting a new benchmark for breakout projects in 2025. 2. Solaxy: Solana’s First Layer-2 Star Solaxy is closing in on the end of its presale and picking up serious attention as the first native Layer-2 built for Solana. With over $46 million raised and pricing between $0.00174 and $0.00175, it’s grabbing a solid spot on June’s best crypto project watchlists. What sets it apart? A mix of tools like the Igniter Protocol, a built-in DEX, and support for launching meme coins, all designed to boost Solana’s scalability and ease congestion. The presale also offers an eye-catching APY of 87–88% for those staking early, helping fuel demand ahead of launch. Whether Solaxy becomes a long-term player or just rides the initial hype will likely come down to how smoothly it delivers after its TGE. 3. Snorter: AI Trading With Meme Energy Snorter is quickly grabbing attention as a standout in the meme-meets-utility category, thanks to its rapid rise and powerful AI-driven Telegram bot. In just a few days, it’s raised over $650,000, and more than 5 million SNORT have already been staked. What’s driving the hype? Its bot delivers tools like instant sniping, copy trading, portfolio tracking, and even honeypot detection, available across both Ethereum and Solana networks. With prices hovering around $0.0943–$0.0947 and staking rewards hitting up to 530% APY, it’s no surprise the project is gaining traction fast. Notable mentions include a $15.6K whale buy from Slovenia, pushing visibility even further. The big question now is whether Snorter can keep the buzz alive post-launch in a crowded, meme-heavy market. 4. Cardano: Legacy Meets Layered Growth Cardano may not be making the rounds on presale lists, but it’s still holding strong as one of the more established names showing fresh momentum. ADA recently saw a 3% bump after being added to NASDAQ’s crypto benchmark index, joining the ranks of XRP, Solana, and Stellar. Trading volume has jumped 68%, and recent updates, like Charles Hoskinson’s push for Bitcoin DeFi integration and plans to add XRP support to the Lace wallet, are giving the community a reason to stay bullish. ADA is currently sitting around $0.72, with many eyeing a move toward $0.85. Still, resistance near $0.71 could be a short-term hurdle. For those looking beyond the presale buzz, Cardano offers a seasoned option with steady institutional attention. Which Is The Best Crypto Project to Join Now? If there’s one name turning heads on every best crypto projects list, it’s BlockDAG. While Solaxy brings clean energy flair and Snorter leans into quirky utility, and Cardano keeps pushing its enterprise playbook, BlockDAG stands out by doing it all, fast tech, huge reach, and serious growth potential. Over $299 million has already poured in, and its X1 mining app has onboarded more than 1.5 million users. The buzz keeps rising, especially with 20 exchange listings coming soon. BlockDAG isn’t just keeping pace, it’s pulling ahead. For those watching the charts and waiting for a standout, this might be the moment that changes everything.

The US SEC has reportedly decided to scrap some significant regulatory proposals that were on the table, particularly those related to SEC crypto regulation under former Chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. This move could signal a notable shift in the regulatory landscape for digital assets in the United States. What Proposed Rules Did the US SEC Drop? According to Eleanor Terrett, a host of Crypto in America, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially ditched several major proposals that had been introduced during Gary Gensler’s time as Chair. This isn’t just minor tinkering; these were rules with potentially wide-reaching implications for how crypto operates within the traditional financial system and for decentralized finance (DeFi). Two key proposals stand out: The Expanded Custody Rule: This proposal aimed to broaden the definition of ‘custody’ and apply it to all client assets managed by registered investment advisers, including cryptocurrencies. The rule would have mandated that advisers keep client assets with ‘qualified custodians’. A major point of contention was whether certain state-chartered trust companies, which currently handle significant crypto custody, would still qualify under the stricter definition. This raised concerns about disrupting existing custodial relationships and limiting options for institutional investors looking to enter the crypto space. Rule 3b-16 (DeFi Regulation): This was perhaps one of the most controversial proposals for the native crypto community. Rule 3b-16 sought to amend the definition of an ‘exchange’ under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Critics argued that the proposed changes were so broad they could potentially sweep many decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and platforms under the purview of being classified as national securities exchanges. This would have subjected them to stringent registration and compliance requirements designed for traditional centralized trading venues, which many felt were incompatible with the decentralized nature of DeFi. Terrett also mentioned that the SEC has dropped its plan to require public companies to comply with stricter environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosure requirements, indicating a broader review or shift in the agency’s regulatory priorities beyond just crypto. Why Were These Rules So Contentious? Both the proposed crypto custody rule and the potential DeFi regulation via Rule 3b-16 faced significant pushback from the cryptocurrency industry, legal experts, and even some policymakers. For the custody rule, the main concerns revolved around: Limited Qualified Custodians: The worry was that the stricter definition would disqualify many entities currently providing crypto custody services, creating a bottleneck and potentially driving crypto activity offshore. Impact on Institutional Adoption: Clarity and reliable custody are crucial for institutional investors. Uncertainty around the rule made it harder for traditional finance players to confidently engage with crypto assets. Definition of ‘Custody’: Applying traditional finance custody definitions to the unique nature of digital assets, especially self-custody or multisig arrangements, proved complex and potentially restrictive. Regarding the proposed DeFi regulation : Incompatibility with Decentralization: Many argued that applying exchange rules (like know-your-customer requirements, market surveillance, etc.) to automated, permissionless DeFi protocols was technically infeasible and fundamentally misunderstood the technology. Stifling Innovation: The fear was that heavy-handed regulation would stifle innovation in the burgeoning DeFi space, pushing developers and users away from the US. Lack of Clarity: The broad language of the proposed rule left significant ambiguity about which protocols or activities would be covered. The dropping of these proposals suggests that the SEC may have acknowledged the industry’s concerns, faced legal challenges, or perhaps is recalibrating its approach to regulating digital assets following changes in leadership or priorities. What Does This Mean for SEC Crypto Regulation Going Forward? The decision by the US SEC to abandon these specific proposals is widely seen as a positive development by many in the crypto community. It removes some immediate regulatory hurdles and uncertainties that were hanging over the market. Benefits of Dropping the Proposals: Reduced Uncertainty: The immediate threat of these particular stringent rules is gone, providing some relief to crypto custodians, DeFi developers, and investment advisers dealing with crypto. Potential for Innovation: Removing the shadow of Rule 3b-16 could allow the DeFi sector in the US to continue developing without the immediate threat of being classified as traditional exchanges. Stability for Custody Providers: Existing state-chartered entities providing custody may breathe a sigh of relief, maintaining their current business models without immediate disruption from the federal level. However, it’s crucial to understand that this doesn’t mean the end of SEC oversight or SEC crypto regulation . The SEC still views many cryptocurrencies as securities and continues to pursue enforcement actions against companies and individuals it believes are violating existing securities laws. This move might indicate a shift in *strategy* rather than a complete withdrawal from the space. It could mean the SEC is: Considering alternative approaches to regulating crypto that are better tailored to the technology. Prioritizing enforcement actions under existing rules while it re-evaluates potential new rulemaking. Responding to feedback and legal challenges, recognizing that the proposed rules might not have been the most effective or legally sound path forward. The tenure of Gary Gensler at the SEC was marked by a strong focus on bringing crypto within the existing regulatory framework, often stating that most tokens were securities and subject to SEC rules. While enforcement actions initiated during his time continue, the decision to drop these forward-looking rulemaking proposals could be interpreted in various ways – from a pragmatic response to industry pushback to a strategic pivot under potentially changing political winds. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What should market participants take away from this development? Stay Informed: While these specific rules are off the table, the regulatory landscape remains dynamic. Keep monitoring SEC announcements, enforcement actions, and any new proposals that may emerge. Engage with Policymakers: The industry’s collective voice likely played a role in the SEC’s decision. Continued constructive engagement with regulators and lawmakers is essential. Focus on Compliance (with existing rules): Dropping proposed rules doesn’t erase existing securities laws. Companies and projects should continue to assess their operations under current regulations and seek legal counsel where necessary. Innovate Responsibly: For DeFi developers, this offers a window, but it’s not a free pass. Building with potential future regulatory considerations in mind, focusing on transparency and risk management, remains prudent. Conclusion: A Moment of Relief, Not the End of the Story The news that the US SEC has abandoned significant proposals for stricter crypto custody rule and DeFi regulation , initially pushed during the tenure of Gary Gensler , is undoubtedly a moment of relief for many corners of the crypto industry. It removes some immediate threats that were perceived as potentially stifling innovation and disrupting established business models. However, this is not the final chapter in the story of SEC crypto regulation . The agency retains jurisdiction over many aspects of the digital asset market, and the conversation about how best to regulate this rapidly evolving technology will continue. This development simply means that these particular proposed paths forward have been closed, leaving the door open for potentially different approaches in the future.

The two parties have asked that the Manhattan District Court dissolve a prior injunction and free a $125 million civil penalty currently held in escrow. The move signals that the long-running spat might be finally coming to an end. The Proposed $125 Million Settlement In a court document filed on Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, attorneys representing Ripple and the SEC requested the judge grant their joint motion and issue a ruling to “dissolve the injunction against Ripple” and pay the regulator a $50 million civil penalty. The remaining funds would be returned to the company. “Doing so would promote efficiency and the policy favoring settlements, obviate the need for additional litigation in this Court and the Court of Appeals, and be consistent with the SEC’s recent actions in other crypto registration cases,” they said in the filing. The June 12 filing marks the latest move in the high-profile legal saga between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission that has stretched nearly five years. In late 2020, the SEC accused Ripple of raising $1.3 billion by selling XRP as unregistered securities. In 2023, the blockchain payments firm notched a partial legal victory when Judge Torres ruled that programmatic sales of XRP to retail buyers via exchanges did not constitute securities offerings. She did, however, determine that Ripple’s institutional sales violated securities laws. The SEC demanded a mammoth $2 billion fine after the ruling, though it was later reduced to $125 million. Both parties are looking to have $50 million go to the SEC, with the remaining $75 million going to Ripple. Why The Fate Of The Latest Motion Is ‘Very Important’ Prominent attorney and crypto personality Bill Morgan has observed that the latest motion filed by the two parties is “very important.” “If the motion is not allowed and the settlement agreement is not varied or a new settlement agreement entered, then there is no settlement and the appeal and cross-appeal would continue,” Morgan postulated in a June 13 post on the X social media platform. As ZyCrypto reported , Judge Torres previously rejected an earlier joint motion for an indicative ruling on the settlement, citing procedural flaws due to the pending appeals before the Second Circuit, while also citing that the parties failed to justify the necessity for reworking the final judgment. In the most recent joint motion, the parties cite “exceptional circumstances” such as the SEC’s pivot away from its previously aggressive crypto enforcement under former chair Gary Gensler. After U.S. President Donald Trump assumed office in January and appointed crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to serve as the SEC’s new chairman, the Commission has done an about-face on crypto regulation.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Ripple|SEC|XRP News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SPONSORED|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-13 12:03:45

Today, that spotlight is shifting toward Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). It’s not just another chain with promises and hype. This project brings something crypto hasn’t seen in years: a realistic shot for everyday people to build wealth from their phones, with zero barriers. At the heart of this movement is a powerful combination of cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure and something delightfully simple: mobile mining. The Sea of New Coins—and Why BTC-S Is Different From meme coins to AI-layer plays, the current wave of new coins is loud, crowded, and often fleeting. Many offer bold visions but lack the structure to deliver. Bitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, arrives not just with promises but with real, working architecture and a delivery-first mentality. It isn’t trying to ride hype waves. It’s creating its own. Its biggest innovation? The upcoming Solaris Nova app which turns any smartphone into a mining device. No expensive GPUs. No complicated setup. Just pure, daily rewards through one of the cleanest interfaces crypto has seen. This simplicity is what gives BTC-S a massive edge—and a growing army of early adopters. Core Strength: Bitcoin Solaris’s Powerful Technical Design Under the hood, BTC-S operates on a hybrid dual-consensus architecture—combining the reliability of Proof-of-Work with the high-speed performance of Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This system allows it to process over 10,000 transactions per second while maintaining Bitcoin-level security and decentralization. The Helios Consensus, a unique innovation, rotates validators efficiently to keep the network balanced, stable, and tamper-resistant. Even more impressive, BTC-S achieves this while using 99.95% less energy than traditional PoW chains. Smart contract capabilities have also been baked in, enabling powerful decentralized apps and integrations that support gaming, DeFi, and beyond. Liquid Staking That Works for Real Users One standout feature that’s catching the attention of both developers and retail users is Bitcoin Solaris’s liquid staking model . Instead of locking up tokens, BTC-S allows stakers to convert their holdings into sBTC-S at a 1:1 ratio, earning passive rewards while keeping full liquidity. Benefits include: Rewards + Liquidity: Passive income without asset lockups. DeFi-Ready: Use sBTC-S across lending platforms and governance. Stronger Network: Boosts decentralization and security. User-Friendly: Fully integrated with the upcoming Solaris Nova App. This staking model not only enhances the ecosystem, it empowers the user. BTC-S Makes Crypto Simple and Profitable Verified, Trusted, and Backed by Experts Bitcoin Solaris hasn’t just built hype—it’s passed the test of scrutiny. Independent audits from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm the integrity of its smart contracts and ecosystem infrastructure. In a space where rug pulls and vaporware dominate headlines, this level of transparency matters—and it’s helping drive rapid adoption. So is the growing buzz from influencers, including a full breakdown by 2Bit Crypto , who highlighted BTC-S as one of the few “new coins” with actual substance. Mining for the Masses: A Direct Comparison Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Mining Setup ASIC rigs Smartphone Energy Use High 99.95% lower Mining Access Wealthy users Anyone with a phone TPS ~7 Over 10,000 Mobile Mining Not possible Core feature via Nova App And yes, the Solaris mining calculator lets you see real-time estimates of your potential earnings, based on nothing more than your phone’s power and network contribution. Presale Buzz: This Is Not a Drill With phase 7 underway, Bitcoin Solaris is sitting at $7 per token. The next jump—$8—is fast approaching, and the final launch price is already set at $20. With over 11,000 unique users already on board and more than $4.1 million raised, this is being hailed as the shortest and most explosive presale in recent memory. There are only around 7 weeks left before the presale closes. With the rate of adoption and attention, Bitcoin Solaris could be one of the rare few that deliver both early entry and long-term value. Bitcoin Solaris might be the final chance at a ground-floor opportunity that can actually live up to the Bitcoin legacy. Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just another “new coin” thrown into the crypto firehose—it’s a calculated response to everything this space promised, yet never delivered. With unmatched scalability, real mobile mining, flexible staking, and a proven technical backbone, BTC-S offers a legitimate path for everyday users to build lasting financial momentum. And with the presale closing in fast, it might just be the last of its kind.

Although the price has slightly recovered, it remains 2% lower compared to 24 hours ago . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the strikes, stating they aim to eliminate the Iranian threat to Israel. He also warned that such military actions will continue if necessary. This military response followed a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), revealing Iran’s failure to comply with uranium enrichment restrictions—a first in 20 years. The news sparked speculation about a potential strike, which U.S. President Donald Trump acknowledged could trigger a “massive conflict,” though he still hopes for a diplomatic resolution. On the prediction market Polymarket, bettors previously saw less than a 30% chance of an Israeli attack by July. Initial reports came from Axios, and Al-Jazeera later confirmed explosions in Tehran.

He shared a detailed update about a decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) for the Cardano ecosystem during a recent podcast. From Bitcoin investments to ADA buybacks, this plan could bring long-term value and stability to the community. But not everyone is on board just yet. Hoskinson Cardano SWF Work In his podcast on X, Hoskinson explained how the Cardano SWF would work. He said it’s inspired by how countries like Norway use their wealth to invest in various assets for future growth. The idea is to take around $100 million worth of ADA from the treasury and convert some of it into stablecoins and Bitcoin. Cardano Decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund https://t.co/8RIELNl872 — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 13, 2025 This isn’t about abandoning ADA; in fact, it’s the opposite. The plan is to invest a portion of treasury funds into less volatile assets to earn yield, then use those earnings to repurchase ADA over time. This strategy, according to Hoskinson, would help grow ADA’s value and strengthen the entire Cardano ecosystem in a sustainable way. Bitcoin Investment – ADA Buybacks Strategy Hoskinson suggested that profits from the Bitcoin investment could be used to buy back ADA, which could increase demand and support its price. He believes that by reinvesting these profits every year over five to ten years, the community could create a self-sustaining financial model that strengthens Cardano’s future. This move isn’t just about making money; it’s about making Cardano stronger in the long run without risking too much of its core treasury. Community Support and Skepticism While some members of the Cardano community welcomed the idea, others had different thoughts. One member, Chad Luce, suggested that a Private Equity Fund or Green Energy Fund might bring in more investors and better returns than the proposed SWF. Despite mixed reactions, Hoskinson made it clear that diversification is key and that long-term planning is essential for ADA to grow and thrive. ADA Treasury Plan for Stability Charles Hoskinson’s proposal shows that Cardano is focused on long-term growth, not short-term hype. By using part of the treasury wisely, building profits, and supporting ADA, the Sovereign Wealth Fund could become a smart way to protect and grow the Cardano network for years to come. As of now, Cardano ADA price is trading around $0.64 , reflecting a drop of 5.4% in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $10.9 billion.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 12:07:05

Total assets in Bitcoin ETFs rose from $91 billion in April to $132 billion in June, a 45% increase in two months, pointing to sustained demand from large investors. With Bitcoin price activity, sentiment, and institutional positioning all showing upward movement, new models such as the Golden Curves and Sine Wave forecasts are gaining attention. Let’s understand the math behind the optimism, revisit historical cycle behaviors, and assess if buying Bitcoin now offers a favorable risk-reward setup. Middle East risks redirect capital toward gold Bitcoin’s recent pullback points to a combination of macroeconomic developments and geopolitical stressors that are introducing short-term uncertainty. U.S. inflation remains contained, with core consumer prices holding steady at 2.8%. That has led to increased expectations of interest rate cuts later this year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, most traders are now pricing in two potential cuts starting in September. A lower interest rate environment typically reduces the appeal of the U.S. dollar and fixed-income assets, giving risk-on markets like crypto more space to perform. However, those expectations are being tested by current global events. In the Middle East, escalating tensions are starting to impact capital flows. The U.S. is relocating personnel from parts of the region amid security concerns, while Israel’s reported plans regarding Iran have attracted renewed international attention. Earlier today, the International Atomic Energy Agency stated that Iran has violated its nuclear obligations for the first time in two decades. As a result, investors have shifted some capital into traditional safe havens, with gold prices rising over 1.5% in the last 24 hours to $3,375 per ounce. Bitcoin has been affected by this repositioning. It is down 1.7% over the same 24-hour period, mirroring risk asset behavior in response to global uncertainty and short-term flight to safety. Meanwhile, the broader crypto derivatives market remains active. On Deribit, open interest in Bitcoin options has risen to $36.7 billion, the highest level so far this month. The June 27 expiry leads in volume, accounting for $13.8 billion in notional terms. A significant number of call options remain concentrated at the $140,000 strike price, although the overall put-to-call ratio has adjusted to 0.60, signaling a slightly softer bullish bias than previous sessions. In futures markets, total open interest across Binance, Bybit, OKX, Deribit, and Hyperliquid has reached $55.4 billion, with Binance alone contributing $23.3 billion, pointing to sustained participation despite near-term volatility. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release May’s Producer Price Index data today. Expectations point to a month-over-month increase of 0.3% in core PPI, following a decline of 0.4% in April. Headline PPI is also forecast to rise 0.2% after last month’s drop of 0.5%. Year-on-year, both core and headline readings are projected to remain steady or move slightly higher. If confirmed, the rebound in monthly PPI figures could indicate fresh inflationary pressure at the wholesale level, challenging the broader market narrative of cooling inflation. That, in turn, may affect expectations around how soon and how much the Federal Reserve can ease rates. Predictive models suggest $160K–$170K range still in play Bitcoin’s short-term direction appears to be hinged on a complex interaction between macro triggers, technical structure, and behavioral signals from larger market participants. Technical analysts are paying close attention to the $106,000 to $107,000 range. According to trader KillaXBT, this is a key demand zone. He notes that BTC has “rejected local supply” and is attempting to stabilize within this range. $BTC | Analysis As of now, structure is still bullish. Bitcoin rejected local supply & is now pushing into demand around 106-107K. This is quite a important level in terms of market structure, if we are unable to hold, we likely fill the CME gap below. 114-116K is a HTF… pic.twitter.com/rtkdL07tYZ — Killa (@KillaXBT) June 12, 2025 His high time frame (HTF) target remains between $114,000 and $116,000 for the month, but he cautions that “if we lose 106K,” the Bitcoin price may fall to fill a CME futures gap, which would involve testing lower levels before any continuation of trend. The broader sense from his analysis points to a structured market that is still intact, provided Bitcoin does not breach $100,000 support. On the behavioral side, on-chain data from CryptoQuant highlights the role of large holders. During prior cycle tops, Binance whales — wallets with over 1,000 BTC — typically increased exchange inflows as prices approached new highs, signaling intent to take profits. A strong bullish signal from Binance whales! “Today, however, inflows are just around $3 billion and are continuing to decline, suggesting that these whales prefer to keep holding.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Full analysis ⤵️ https://t.co/T1FlLnM4nK pic.twitter.com/O3XrqhAyEc — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2025 In early 2024, inflows peaked around $5.3 billion and climbed to $8.45 billion and $7.24 billion during earlier rallies. Currently, inflows are down to around $3 billion and trending lower, indicating a preference to hold rather than distribute. The pattern signals that many large holders are not yet ready to exit and may be positioning for higher levels ahead. Sentiment models also point to possible future upside, though with varying levels of confidence. The Golden Diminishing Curves model, shared by CryptoCon, places the next cycle top between $160,000 and $170,000. By almost all measures, 160 – 170k is the next step up for Bitcoin. The cycle top on the golden diminishing curves is at +2, which has gone completely untouched. A ticking time bomb for an explosion to the upside pic.twitter.com/DHXnsMaD8H — CryptoCon (@CryptoCon_) June 11, 2025 The model’s upper cycle band labeled as “+2” has not been reached yet, suggesting that the current cycle still has room to develop. CryptoCon described the setup as a “ticking time bomb,” but the data itself simply illustrates that past cycle tops followed a clear curve pattern that has not yet been completed in this run. PlanB, known for his stock-to-flow and RSI-based cycle studies, weighed in with a separate observation. If Bitcoin’s monthly Relative Strength Index retests 75, it would historically align with price levels around $130,000. Would be nice if BTC retests RSI 75 again this month. RSI 75 = ~$130k (June closing price). pic.twitter.com/AIjjQRxyDK — PlanB (@100trillionUSD) June 9, 2025 He adds that “RSI 75 = ~$130k (June closing price),” suggesting that if momentum continues, such a target is plausible based on prior RSI peaks during bull runs. Across these perspectives, one common thread is that the structure remains intact, and many indicators are pointing to the possibility of further upside. The $114K–$116K region appears to be a major short-term target. However, risk still remains. A break below $100K would weaken the bullish structure, and a failure to hold $106K could trigger lower retracements. The current phase, therefore, is less about euphoric breakout calls and more about managing expectations within clearly defined levels. As always, consult a financial planner before making any investment decisions, trade wisely, and never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Polkadot Community Proposes Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Using Treasury Funds The plan currently being discussed on the Polkadot governance forum proposes allocating 501,000 DOT (Polkadot’s native token) to gradually purchase tBTC, a decentralized, Bitcoin-backed token. Under the proposal, the tBTC purchase will be carried out over a period of one year using Hydration’s Rolling Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) mechanism, providing a stable and risk-free entry into the Bitcoin position. Once purchased, tBTC will be deposited into the Hydration Omnipool as liquidity, leveraging the Threshold Network’s custody-free Bitcoin bridge to maintain full decentralization and asset security. Proponents of the proposal argue that the move would diversify the Treasury’s holdings, provide a hedge against market volatility, and promote cross-chain liquidity in the Polkadot ecosystem. The proposal is still in the discussion phase and has not yet been put to an on-chain vote. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Creation Craze Continues to Spread!

Novogratz has now joined the $1 million per Bitcoin (BTC) bandwagon, suggesting that the OG cryptocurrency could 10X and break that milestone if it continues to grow in popularity and surpass gold. Novogratz Says Bitcoin Tops $1 Million If Adoption Trend Continues Appearing on CNBC’s Power Lunch on Thursday, Mike Novogratz said he foresees a seven-figure moonshot for the premier cryptocurrency. Novogratz’s main rationale for anticipating Bitcoin’s potential 1,000% growth is based on the crypto’s increasing institutional adoption as a macro asset. “Now we’ve got all these treasury companies buying Bitcoin, we’ve got sovereign wealth buying Bitcoin, we’ve got retail investors buying Bitcoin, there’s easier ways to get it,” he quipped. “So the adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset, as an asset to save money in, I think that’s now a ball rolling down hill.” BlackRock is perhaps the most notable example of institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a macro asset. The $11 trillion asset manager’s spot BTC exchange-traded fund has amassed approximately 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply for its clients since going live in January 2024. The iShares Bitcoin Trust currently holds more than $70 billion in assets under management. Novogratz further suggested that the increasing adoption will ensure Bitcoin catches up with gold. According to the pundit, younger investors would buy Bitcoin over gold, with the supply-capped digital asset replacing the yellow metal over time: “If you look at gold’s market cap and Bitcoin’s market cap, Bitcoin has a long way to go, 10x, and so that’s [$1 million] Bitcoin just to be where gold is.” Other Seven-Figure Bitcoin Calls Novogratz is not the first Bitcoin bull to predict that Bitcoin will appreciate significantly in value over the long term. In April, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest raised its bull-case Bitcoin price projection to $2.4 million by 2030, up from a previous projection of $1.5 million. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes said last month that BTC could break $1 million by 2028, thanks to strong tailwinds including a likely outflow of foreign investment and devaluation of the huge stock of the US Treasury. Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor has also, on multiple occasions, shared his thoughts on how high he thinks the price of Bitcoin could rocket to.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Gold|Mike Novogratz,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-13 12:09:07

The Altcoin Season Index, a widely watched indicator, recently registered a value that confirms we are currently experiencing a period known as Bitcoin Season . This news carries important implications for investors and participants across the entire crypto market , particularly concerning the performance of altcoins . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index To grasp the significance of the current market phase, it is essential to understand the Altcoin Season Index itself. This metric, tracked by major cryptocurrency data platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a barometer for the relative performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin. The index is designed to provide a clear picture of whether the broader altcoin market is outperforming or underperforming the leading cryptocurrency. It achieves this by analyzing the performance of a specific group of cryptocurrencies over a defined period. What it tracks: The index specifically looks at the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. What it excludes: Importantly, it excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC), focusing purely on native altcoins and Bitcoin. The comparison: It compares the performance of each of these top 100 altcoins against Bitcoin’s performance. The timeframe: The comparison is typically made over the past 90 days. The resulting index score, which ranges from 1 to 100, provides a single number that summarizes the overall state of the market’s preference for altcoins versus Bitcoin. Decoding the Seasons: Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season The value of the Altcoin Season Index directly corresponds to one of two primary market phases: Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season . These phases are defined by specific thresholds based on the index score. Altcoin Season: Definition: According to the index methodology, Altcoin Season is declared when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Index Score: This typically corresponds to a high index score, often above 75. Characteristics: During Altcoin Season, we typically see significant rallies across a wide range of altcoins. Capital flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to a decrease in Bitcoin’s dominance percentage relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Enthusiasm is high, and many smaller cap tokens can experience exponential growth. Bitcoin Season: Definition: Conversely, Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Index Score: This corresponds to a low index score, typically 25 or below. Characteristics: In Bitcoin Season , Bitcoin tends to dominate the market. It may be consolidating, experiencing a strong upward trend, or showing relative strength during downturns while altcoins struggle. Bitcoin dominance usually rises, and capital is often seen flowing into BTC as a perceived safer asset within the crypto space, or simply leading the overall market movement. Many altcoins may lose value against Bitcoin, even if they are stable or slightly increasing in fiat terms. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Altcoin Season Index ≤ 25 ≥ 75 Top 100 Altcoins Outperforming BTC (90 days) ≤ 25% ≥ 75% Bitcoin Dominance Generally Rising Generally Falling Altcoin Performance vs. BTC Underperforming Outperforming (Broadly) Market Sentiment Often Cautious on Altcoins High Enthusiasm for Altcoins The Current State: Altcoin Season Index at 25 Confirms Bitcoin Season As reported, the Altcoin Season Index stood at 25 at 00:31 UTC on June 13. This figure represents a drop from previous readings and, crucially, falls precisely on the threshold that defines Bitcoin Season according to the index methodology. A score of 25 means that over the past 90 days, only about a quarter (or fewer) of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin. This data point reinforces the observation many market participants have made: while Bitcoin might be consolidating or making moves, a large portion of the altcoin market is currently lagging behind in terms of relative performance against BTC. This doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are losing value in fiat terms, but it signifies that an investment in Bitcoin over the last three months would, on average, have yielded better results than an investment spread across a basket of top altcoins. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: Implications for Altcoins Being in Bitcoin Season has distinct implications for holders of altcoins and those looking to enter the crypto market . Challenges for Altcoin Holders: Relative Underperformance: The primary challenge is that altcoins, on average, are not keeping pace with Bitcoin. This can lead to frustration for investors holding altcoins while watching Bitcoin potentially make gains or hold its value better during volatility. Increased Risk: During Bitcoin Season, capital often flows into Bitcoin. This can leave altcoins more susceptible to price drops, especially if overall market sentiment turns negative. Smaller cap altcoins can experience significant losses. Lack of Broad Rallies: Unlike Altcoin Season where many different altcoins pump simultaneously, Bitcoin Season is characterized by more isolated altcoin pumps based on specific news, developments, or narratives, rather than a broad market wave. Potential Opportunities in Bitcoin Season: Selective Accumulation: While the broad market underperforms, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate high-conviction altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Identifying fundamentally strong projects that are temporarily suppressed by market dynamics can be a strategy. Focus on Bitcoin: Some investors choose to rotate capital into Bitcoin during this phase, leveraging its relative strength and dominance. Learning and Research: Bitcoin Season provides a quieter period, away from the frenzy of altcoin pumps, allowing investors to conduct thorough research on projects, understand underlying technology, and plan strategies for the next market cycle. Broader Crypto Market Dynamics in Bitcoin Season The shift into Bitcoin Season reflects and influences broader dynamics within the crypto market . Bitcoin’s dominance is a key factor here. When Bitcoin’s price is strong or consolidating while altcoins lag, its percentage of the total crypto market capitalization tends to increase. This rising dominance reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is the primary focus for capital flows. Market sentiment can also shift. During periods of uncertainty or consolidation, investors often seek the relative safety or liquidity of Bitcoin. This gravitational pull towards BTC can further dampen enthusiasm for higher-risk altcoins. Furthermore, major macroeconomic factors and regulatory news often impact Bitcoin first and most significantly, with altcoins reacting with greater volatility afterwards. In Bitcoin Season, the market narrative is often centered around Bitcoin’s price movements, institutional adoption of BTC, or Bitcoin-specific developments like halving events or ETF flows. Strategies for Navigating Bitcoin Season Given the current state indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , what steps can investors take? Here are some actionable insights: Prioritize Risk Management: This is crucial in any market phase, but particularly when altcoins are broadly underperforming. Consider reducing exposure to highly speculative altcoins or setting tighter stop-losses. Increase Bitcoin Exposure: If you believe Bitcoin’s dominance will continue or that BTC is poised for a significant move, increasing your allocation to Bitcoin can be a prudent strategy during this period. Selective Altcoin Accumulation: Instead of broadly buying altcoins, focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development, and potentially upcoming catalysts. Look for altcoins that might show relative strength or are trading at attractive valuations against BTC. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue or start a DCA strategy into Bitcoin and/or a select few high-conviction altcoins. This removes the emotion of trying to time the bottom and allows you to accumulate assets over time. Stay Informed: Pay close attention to Bitcoin’s price action, dominance charts, and overall crypto market sentiment. Also, monitor the Altcoin Season Index for potential shifts. Looking Ahead: When Might Altcoin Season Return? Bitcoin Season is not permanent. Market cycles are a natural part of the cryptocurrency landscape. A return to Altcoin Season would be signaled by the Altcoin Season Index climbing significantly, ideally above 75. What factors could trigger such a shift? Bitcoin Consolidation/Stagnation: Often, Altcoin Season kicks off after Bitcoin has had a major rally and then enters a period of consolidation or sideways trading. This allows capital that profited from the BTC run to flow into altcoins seeking higher returns. Increased Risk Appetite: A general increase in confidence and risk appetite across the broader financial markets can spill over into crypto, encouraging investment in higher-beta assets like altcoins. Major Altcoin Narratives: The emergence of strong, compelling narratives around specific sectors (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, AI) or major upgrades/events within prominent altcoin ecosystems can drive significant interest and investment into those areas, potentially sparking a broader altcoin rally. Falling Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained decrease in Bitcoin’s share of the total market cap is a visual indicator that altcoins are collectively gaining ground. Monitoring these potential catalysts, alongside the movement of the Altcoin Season Index , can help investors anticipate and prepare for the next phase of the market cycle. Limitations and Other Considerations While the Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, it is not the only metric to consider. It provides a broad overview of the top 100 altcoins’ performance relative to Bitcoin, but it doesn’t capture the nuances of the entire market. Beyond the Top 100: Many promising projects exist outside the top 100 by market cap. Their performance isn’t directly factored into this specific index. Individual Project Fundamentals: Even during Bitcoin Season, individual altcoins with strong fundamentals, significant news, or successful product launches can perform well independently of the broader market trend. Macro Environment: The overall economic climate, interest rates, inflation, and global events significantly impact the entire crypto market , including both Bitcoin and altcoins. Regulatory Landscape: Changes in regulations can disproportionately affect certain types of altcoins or the market as a whole. Therefore, while the index signals the prevailing season, a comprehensive investment approach requires looking at a variety of indicators, understanding specific project details, and considering the broader market context. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 25 serves as a clear indicator that the crypto market is navigating a period defined as Bitcoin Season . This means that, on average, altcoins have been underperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days. While this presents challenges for altcoin investors hoping for broad, rapid gains, it also offers opportunities for strategic accumulation and a focus on risk management. Understanding the characteristics of Bitcoin Season and keeping an eye on the factors that could signal a shift back towards Altcoin Season are crucial for navigating the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape effectively.

Trident Eyes $500 Million Raise To Buy XRP Nasdaq-traded Trident has announced that it is raising up to $500 million for its XRP treasury strategy. The tokens purchased by Trident will serve as the company’s long-term strategic reserves. “This initiative reflects our belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology for capital allocation and cross-border value transfer,” Soon Huat Lim, founder and CEO of Trident, said in a statement. “Through this initiative, Trident aims to demonstrate how public companies can thoughtfully and responsibly participate in the ongoing development of decentralized finance.” Trident intends to use its XRP reserves to generate yield via staking and have a “deep engagement” with Ripple’s ecosystem instead of a mere buy-and-hold strategy. The company will launch the treasury in the second half of 2025, dependent on regulation clarity and market sentiment. U.S.-based Chaince Securities will act as a strategic advisor on the XRP treasury play. Trident plans to raise capital for the initiative through equity sales, private placements, and other structured financing instruments. CEO Soon described the effort as a novel bet on the role of cryptocurrencies in corporate capital management. “We see digital assets as key enablers in the evolution of the global financial landscape,” he opined, asserting that the initiative reflects Trident’s “commitment to transparency, strong governance, and strategic foresight.” The Bitcoin corporate treasury reserve has become quite popular in the cryptoverse. Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) pioneered the trend back in 2020, and publicly listed companies like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific have since emulated the firm’s BTC-buying master plan. Just a few companies have announced similar strategies with XRP. These include Chinese AI-focused automotive firm Webus, which is planning a $300 million treasury plan with the token; VivoPower’s forthcoming $100-million XRP-centric stockpile; and Wellgistics Health’s $50 million XRP reserve . If successful, Trident’s treasury would further strengthen XRP’s place among corporate-held crypto assets.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-13 12:15:17

The decline coincided with news of Israel’s military strike on Iranian targets, sending the altcoin markets into a bloodbath. Data from CoinMarketCap showed that PI dropped from $0.62 to as low as $0.40 during the early hours of trading. Although the token briefly recovered to $0.55 later in the session, it still remains far below its 30-day high of $1.27, a 53% loss from the level. The token’s 24-hour volume jumped 276%, which could mean holders offloaded their positions in fear of further declines. At press time, PI was down approximately 12% from the previous day and 21% over the past week. Pi Coin price volatility after token unlock announcement The price volatility came just weeks after the crypto community started speculating about Pi Network Core Team’s announcement scheduled for early May. The teaser started a bullish spell for the token, causing a price spike from $0.60 to nearly $1.70 within a few days. However, even before the announcement was made public, prices began to tumble. Once the team revealed its plan to invest in Pi Network-native projects , the price corrected to just over $0.60. According to data from PiScan, over 340 million PI tokens are scheduled for release over the next month, with the largest unlocks expected on June 18, June 26, July 5, and July 7. The releases will increase supply, and will more than likely push the price down further. Investors, who have been waiting years for token liquidity, may choose to cash out once their assets become available. The result could be a significant increase in sell-side activity, further straining prices that the altcoin market slump has already weakened. Moreover, market analyst Moon Jeff noted that altcoins had begun to rally in early June. In a post dated June 10, he remarked : “ALTs have started pumping again. Every time an altseason starts, something always happens. I wonder what will happen this time round.” His comments foreshadowed the end to that short-lived rally, which was interrupted by Friday’s tragic news in Iran. Bitcoin led the crypto sell-off, plunging by $5,000 during the Asian trading session. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, also fell over 9% in a matter of hours, dropping from $2,760 to as low as $2,470. It has since climbed back above $2,500, a level that analysts identify as its psychological support zone. Alongside Pi, the correction hit other altcoins like Solana, which was down 12%, retreating to $140. Dogecoin posted a 10% decline, sliding to $0.17, while Cardano tumbled 9.5%, falling to $0.62. Currently, PI coin is showing no clear bullish or bearish trend. The market appears to be in a holding pattern, with minimal momentum on either side. Analysts warn that until buyers step in with conviction, or a new announcement shifts sentiment, the price may remain trapped in its current range.

As a result, Bitcoin price suffered a loss of 7%, as it fell short of bullish strength to surpass the benchmark $112,000 ATH. Moreover, the leveraged long positions were unwound, which further amplified downside momentum for top crypto and altcoins. Similarly, recent on-chain metrics highlight that derivative exchanges saw significant withdrawals of stablecoins. Where these withdrawals are coupled with a notable divergence between BTC price and Binance’s Open Interest. These converging signals strongly indicate a cautious outlook for Bitcoin in the immediate short term. BTC Jumped From Cliff – Down 7%: What Exactly Happened? The global uncertainty has increased recently, which has affected the financial sector, including cryptocurrencies. This happened as Donald Trump plans to put unilateral tariffs in the next two weeks. Alongside the pessimism surrounding Trump’s tariffs, the Israel-Iran Conflict also escalated further, which has triggered aggressive selling. The sudden spike in sell volume closely aligns with Israel’s unexpected military strike on Iran early Friday (June 13), which sent shockwaves through global markets. Crypto is regarded as a high-risk asset and faces immediate liquidation pressure. Where traders dumped BTC in anticipation of broader market turmoil. What DOes This Divergence Between Bitcoin Price and Binance Open Interest Means For Investors? Recent insights from CryptoQuant reveal a notable divergence between Bitcoin’s price and Binance’s Open Interest (OI). As the Bitcoin price neared its all-time high of $110,000- which was last seen in late May, the OI failed to match the peak levels. This is clearly indicating a weakening interest in futures trading despite strong long-term BTC price momentum.

This significant movement mirrors a similar withdrawal on May 29, 2025, also around $750 million. Such synchronized outflows often indicate capital rotation or changes in trader behavior. When these occur near market highs, they may signal hedging or de-risking actions.

BTC/USD 1.D. COINBASE | Source: TradingView Therefore, amid the geopolitical chaos, the absence of confirmation from Binance OI, along with repeated large stablecoin outflows, increases the likelihood of a short-term pullback. If the $101,000 support area is breached, BTC price could drop to the support zone around $96,000. The short-term situation urges market participants to “DYOR” and should avoid “FOMO” based future decisions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin’s price is down today primarily due to escalating geopolitical tensions from Israel’s military operation against Iran, alongside global uncertainty stemming from potential new tariffs proposed by Donald Trump. How might upcoming U.S. interest rate decisions influence crypto prices? If the Fed keeps rates high or signals fewer future cuts, it makes riskier assets like crypto less attractive, as investors favor more stable, yield-bearing assets. Conversely, rate cuts can boost crypto appeal. How low can Bitcoin go this month? Bitcoin is currently trading around $104,000. Key support levels to watch are $101,000-$102,000, and if breached, it could potentially drop to $96,000 this month due to ongoing bearish pressure.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-13 12:15:52

A new report published by Chainalysis on June 12 reveals that the illicit Chinese-language platform remains active following the closure of its website and Telegram channels. Huione’s Crypto-Laundering Network Still Thriving Under New Domain On May 13, Huione announced it was shutting down after Telegram banned thousands of associated accounts. This followed the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) move to designate Huione as a primary money laundering concern under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act. The proposed designation aims to cut the platform off from the U.S. financial system. However, according to Chainalysis, Huione’s transaction volumes have not declined. In fact, they have increased. “Our data shows that the platform continues to process billions of dollars worth of transactions, pointing to a highly resilient system that operates largely independent of its public-facing infrastructure,” the report stated. Following the takedown of its website, Telegram channels, and its officially announced closure, Huione’s operations have have not slowed at all. In fact, our data shows that the platform continues to process billions of dollars worth of transactions. https://t.co/ZhHj81hDU6 — Chainalysis (@chainalysis) June 12, 2025 Despite losing access to the U.S. dollar and facing infrastructure takedowns, Huione’s ability to operate appears largely unaffected. The report highlights that its complex laundering networks avoid mainstream exchanges and rely heavily on a “guarantee” system—a model of laundering services built to bypass traditional scrutiny. Chainalysis says Huione’s survival reveals a deeper issue: the growing sophistication of Chinese-language laundering networks, many of which rely on “guarantee services.” These platforms provide peer-to-peer escrow-like services for illicit money movement, bypassing traditional financial institutions and leaving little trace in regulated systems. Even after losing key infrastructure, Huione’s crypto platform has returned under a new domain, Huione\[.]me, retaining its branding and activity. The company continues to list its own token, XOC, and the Huione-promoted stablecoin USDH. Its Telegram presence has also quietly resumed, with continued engagement between users and administrators. The report details various laundering typologies used by Huione-linked services. These include fiat-to-stablecoin swaps, in-person cash pickups, and prepaid card transfers. In some cases, vendors organize motorcades for physical handoffs, demonstrating a blend of digital and real-world logistics. Huione’s operations are believed to be deeply embedded in broader criminal networks. Its continued resilience, despite visible enforcement actions, highlights the limitations of targeting surface-level infrastructure. Chainalysis warns that addressing platforms like Huione will require more than just taking down websites or blocking messaging apps. Huione’s case, the firm argues, shows the need for “multi-vector enforcement strategies” that go beyond surface-level interventions. These strategies would involve international coordination, advanced blockchain intelligence tools, and real-time data sharing between law enforcement and financial regulators. “The question now isn’t whether Huione is still operational — it clearly is — but rather, what kinds of interventions can meaningfully disrupt it,” Chainalysis stated. The findings raise serious questions about current methods to combat sophisticated laundering networks and point to the need for long-term, cross-border collaboration. Telegram Crackdown Fails to Deter Darknet Activity as Huione Remains Operational Despite Telegram’s takedown of thousands of illicit channels in May, Huione Guarantee, a darknet marketplace reportedly tied to Cambodia’s elite, continues to operate, blockchain analytics firm Elliptic says . Telegram shuts down Xinbi & Huione Guarantee revealing how stablecoins & encryption power industrial-scale cybercrime. #CryptoCrime #Telegram #usdt https://t.co/q5dRh8zSvf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 14, 2025 The crackdown followed revelations that Huione and its Chinese-language counterpart, Xinbi Guarantee, facilitated over $35 billion in illicit crypto transactions, mostly in Tether (USDT). Elliptic’s analysis shows at least $27 billion in USDT flowed through Huione alone, which offers money laundering services, fake documents, stolen personal data, and even intimidation-for-hire. Xinbi has processed another $8.4 billion since 2022. Both marketplaces use Telegram’s encrypted infrastructure to operate at scale, acting as hubs for cybercriminals. Even after the takedown, Huione reportedly continues to function through alternative channels. The U.S. Treasury labeled Huione Group a major global money laundering concern in May 2025, tying it to $98 billion in crypto flows, some allegedly linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group.

A pivotal moment for digital assets is approaching on Capitol Hill. The U.S. Senate has officially scheduled the final vote on key legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins, known as the GENIUS Act, for June 17. This development, reported via Cointelegraph on X, marks a significant step forward in the ongoing effort to integrate digital assets into the existing financial framework while addressing potential risks. The exact timing on June 17 will be determined by Majority Leader John Thune, adding a layer of anticipation to this critical legislative event. What is This US Senate Vote Really About? At its core, this upcoming US Senate vote centers on the GENIUS Act, a piece of crypto legislation designed to bring clarity and structure to the stablecoin market. Stablecoins are a vital part of the digital asset ecosystem, intended to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, typically a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aim to offer price predictability, making them useful for trading, payments, and lending within the crypto space. However, the rapid growth and increasing use of stablecoins have raised concerns among regulators regarding consumer protection, market integrity, and potential risks to broader financial stability. The lack of a clear regulatory framework in the U.S. has been a significant point of discussion for years. The GENIUS Act, if passed, is expected to establish rules for stablecoin issuers, potentially covering areas such as: Reserve Requirements: Mandating what assets stablecoin issuers must hold as reserves and how frequently they must report on these reserves. Licensing and Oversight: Requiring stablecoin businesses to obtain specific licenses and submit to regulatory supervision. Consumer Safeguards: Implementing rules to protect users from potential failures or mismanagement by issuers. Interoperability: Potentially addressing how stablecoins can interact across different platforms and systems. This vote isn’t just procedural; it represents the culmination of extensive discussions, debates, and negotiations among lawmakers, industry stakeholders, and regulatory bodies. Passing this legislation could set a precedent for how other forms of digital asset regulation are approached in the future. Why is Stablecoin Regulation So Crucial Now? Stablecoin regulation has moved from a niche topic to a priority for policymakers globally. Several factors contribute to this urgency: 1. Market Growth and Adoption: The stablecoin market cap has grown significantly, with billions of dollars in value and daily transaction volumes often exceeding those of traditional payment systems. This scale means potential issues could have wider impacts. 2. Potential for Systemic Risk: If a major stablecoin were to fail or lose its peg due to inadequate reserves or poor management, it could trigger instability within the crypto market and potentially spill over into traditional finance, impacting financial stability. 3. Consumer and Investor Protection: Without clear rules, users face risks, including lack of transparency regarding reserves, potential for fraud, or difficulty redeeming stablecoins for fiat currency. Regulation aims to build confidence and protect users. 4. Preventing Illicit Finance: Regulators are concerned that stablecoins could be used for money laundering or other illegal activities. Legislation can impose Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements on issuers. 5. International Harmonization: Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union with its MiCA regulation, are moving forward with comprehensive crypto frameworks that include stablecoins. The U.S. is keen to establish its own rules to maintain competitiveness and influence in the global digital asset landscape. The scheduled US Senate vote on June 17 reflects a recognition that the current regulatory uncertainty is unsustainable. Clarity is needed for businesses operating with stablecoins and for consumers using them. What Could This Digital Asset Regulation Mean for the Market? The passage of the GENIUS Act or similar digital asset regulation could have profound effects across the crypto ecosystem: For Stablecoin Issuers: Increased compliance costs and operational requirements. Potential need to adjust reserve management practices to meet new standards. Enhanced legitimacy and trust, potentially attracting more institutional participation. Clearer rules of the road for innovation and growth. For Users and Investors: Greater confidence in the stability and reliability of regulated stablecoins. Improved transparency regarding reserves and issuer practices. Potential for wider acceptance and use of stablecoins in payments and commerce. Understanding which stablecoins meet regulatory standards will become important. For the Broader Crypto Market: A clear framework for stablecoins could pave the way for regulation of other digital assets. Increased institutional adoption of stablecoins could lead to more capital flowing into the crypto market. Unregulated stablecoins might face significant challenges or be pushed out of the U.S. market. This crypto legislation could reduce perceived risks associated with the asset class as a whole. The outcome of the US Senate vote will be a critical indicator of the U.S.’s approach to integrating digital assets into its financial system. While regulation brings challenges, many in the industry believe that responsible stablecoin regulation is necessary for the long-term health and adoption of the technology, contributing to overall financial stability. What Actionable Insights Should You Consider? As the June 17 date approaches, what should market participants and interested individuals keep in mind? 1. Monitor the Vote Closely: The exact timing determined by Majority Leader John Thune will be key. The vote’s outcome will immediately influence market sentiment and expectations for future crypto legislation. 2. Understand the Details (Once Available): If the GENIUS Act passes the Senate, the specific provisions will matter. How strict are the reserve requirements? What is the role of different regulators (e.g., Federal Reserve, Treasury, state regulators)? 3. Consider the Path Forward: A Senate passage is a major step, but it’s not the final one. The bill would still need to pass the House of Representatives (potentially reconciling differences with any House version) and be signed into law by the President. This process can take time. 4. Evaluate Stablecoin Choices: For users and businesses relying on stablecoins, understanding which issuers are proactively preparing for or are likely to meet new regulatory standards will be important. Regulated stablecoins may gain a competitive advantage. 5. Engage with the Conversation: The development of digital asset regulation is ongoing. Staying informed and participating in discussions (where possible) helps shape the future of the industry. This US Senate vote on stablecoin regulation is more than just political news; it’s a critical event that could redefine the landscape for one of the most widely used applications of blockchain technology, with direct implications for financial stability and the future of digital assets. Concluding Thoughts: A Defining Moment? The scheduling of the final US Senate vote on the GENIUS Act for June 17 marks a potentially defining moment for stablecoin regulation in the United States. This move signifies a serious legislative push to address the opportunities and challenges presented by stablecoins, aiming to enhance consumer protection, ensure market integrity, and contribute to overall financial stability. While the path to final law is still uncertain, the outcome of this vote will provide crucial insight into the direction of U.S. digital asset regulation and its potential impact on the broader crypto market. All eyes will be on the Senate floor as June 17 arrives. To learn more about the latest crypto legislation trends, explore our articles on key developments shaping digital assets regulation.

DOGE and SHIB are among the affected ones, heading south by 6-7% each, but SPX and FARTCOIN lead the adverse trend. Memes Bleed Out The cryptocurrency sector and the meme coin niche recorded a substantial resurgence earlier this week. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, the market cap of all the memes reached almost $65 billion on June 11 , but currently , it is hovering around $55 billion. The downtrend was most likely triggered by the latest geopolitical tension caused by the military conflict between Israel and Iran. Some of the worst-affected meme coins include SPX6900 (SPX) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). The former is down 22% on a daily scale, while the latter retraced by 17% within that timeframe. SPX Price, Source: CoinGecko Interestingly, those assets were among the best performers during the recent rally. As CryptoPotato reported , SPX became the fifth-biggest meme coin, with its market cap surging well above $1 billion. Other tokens of that type that have posted double-digit losses on a 24-hour basis are Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), dogwifhat (WIF), Floki (FLOKI), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT), and many more. On the other hand, lesser-known meme coins such as REKT, AURA, and TST have charted some gains. How Are the Big Shots Doing? Dogecoin (DOGE) – the undisputed leader in the meme coin sector – has also nosedived, albeit posting less substantial losses than the aforementioned tokens . It currently trades at around $0.17, representing a 7% decline for the past 24 hours. Shiba Inu (SHIB) – DOGE’s biggest contender – briefly dipped to as low as $0.0000114, the lowest point since April. As of this writing, the self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer is worth roughly $0.00001170, or a 6% decrease on a daily scale. Meme coins are notorious for their heightened volatility and typically decline more significantly and rapidly than well-established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) during periods of uncertainty and market turmoil. Having that said, investors should tread carefully with them, conduct proper research before committing funds, and invest only as much as they are ready to lose.

The polarity of discussions is negatively dominated, signifying strong bearish opinions being expressed. This is due to Pi Network’s price took a massive hit today, crashing 36% to reach an all-time low of $0.40. This happened because of a combination of factors, the crypto sector turned red in the past three days, with Donald Trump’s unilateral tariffs threat, Israel’s latest strike on Iran – heightening israel – iran conflict, and delays in the Pi mapping migration in Chinese-speaking regions, which could have contributed to the sharp drop. In addition to macro tensions and technical weaknesses, concerns about tokenomics are also growing. The daily unlocks of the PI token can influence its price. According to PiScan , over 340 million PI tokens will be released next month. Notably, June 18, June 26, July 5, and July 7 will see the largest unlocks. These developments may increase selling pressure. Some investors, who have waited years for their tokens, might choose to take profits. Weighted Sentiment Plunged: Strong Negative Hint For PI Network Price Action If we go back to last month, we remember that the Pi Network Core Team hinted at a major announcement in early May. This led to a rapid price surge, pushing PI price from $0.6 to nearly $1.7 in just days. A Pi ecosystem announcement will be released on May 14. Tune in to find out what's coming next! pic.twitter.com/5jn7m5mlmD — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) May 7, 2025 However, the asset quickly lost momentum, dropping back to just over $0.6 even before the announcement was made. This decline followed the launch of a new initiative focused on investing in Pi Network-native projects. Since the decline, the overall market sentiment for Pi Network has been notably negative the past 30 days. Source: santiment The weighted sentiment indicates a drop in confidence among Pi holders, contributing to the ongoing downtrend. This lack of investor optimism may significantly impact Pi Network’s price as it is already too low and is in serious need of nearby support, which, for now, it is facing difficulty finding. PI Price Hits April’s Lows Again As of now, the Pi Network price is at $0.56, reflecting a 13% drop today. While this decline is significant, the intra-day low of $0.39 raises the most concern. This drop marks a 36% fall, reaching the lowest point in the altcoin’s history. The $0.39 all-time low was recorded in April. Although there has been some recovery, this sharp decline has caused panic among investors. However, if investors choose to take advantage of the situation, it could be an opportunity to buy Pi at a discount. This may lead to a price rebound. PI/USD 1.D. OKX | Source: TradingView According to the Fibonacci tool, the PI price is near the “0.0%” level. If it rebounds, the next target could be the “23.6%” level at $1.052, but it must first break the $0.73 level in the short term. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This 3.73 percent decline within a day highlights the difficulties of when to invest in proven commodities such as Solana. Although Solana is still a powerful contender with a well-built infrastructure, its volatility in recent times has caused investors to seek other projects with a higher upside potential. With the presale momentum, Kaanch Network, the best crypto, has become a plausible solution for investors looking to limit the risks exposed to market changes but aiming to achieve high returns. Kaanch’s Presale: A 15,870% Surge Potential Kaanch Network is on Stage 6 of the presale, and the price of tokens is $0.32, which will be doubled in the next stage to $0.64. With more than 2,132,685 raised, the project proves to be of great interest to investors, which can be explained by the scarcity of the supply or 58 million tokens. With the upcoming Bitmart listing at a price of $30 per token, Kaanch is set to experience a significant price increase, and analysts estimate that the token could rise by 15,870% after the listing. Investors will be able to buy tokens with ETH or USDT, and an additional benefit will be up to 30% APY live staking in the presale. Interested parties can visit the Kaanch presale website and have an opportunity to buy the best crypto tokens at a lower price before the price increment. Unmatched Technical Capabilities The Kaanch Network infrastructure is performant, capable of up to 1.4 million transactions per second with 0.8-second finality. Such speed guarantees an immediate execution of trades and low latency smart contract functionality, outperforming a variety of current Layer-1 blockchains. Also, with almost zero gas fees, Kaanch becomes an affordable solution to decentralized applications, microtransactions, and payments, attracting developers and businesses alike. With 3,600 decentralized nodes, the network focuses on security and scalability, making it a strong basis of enterprise and individual applications. Real-World Asset Tokenization and Governance Kaanch differentiates itself by focusing on real world asset tokenization, including gold and real estate, as opposed to speculative cryptocurrencies. The method allows safe, immediate transfer of physical assets, fulfilling the need in regulated decentralized finance applications that is growing rapidly. The community-based governance system of the platform, enabled through an open staking dashboard, allows token holders to have a voice in governance, creating a sense of transparency and engagement. Kaanch smart contracts are audited by SpyWolf and VerifyLab, which increases investor confidence and makes the ecosystem secure and transparent. Enterprise and Developer-Friendly Design The ability of Kaanch Network as the best layer 1 to interoperate with the most popular blockchains, such as Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain, turns it into a flexible environment to develop scalable decentralized applications. It has an enterprise-friendly architecture and developer tools that simplify integration, making Kaanch poised to be used massively. The knch domain system also enables digital identity and wallet verification, making it even more useful in Web3 applications. Those investors wanting to participate in this project need to visit the Kaanch presale website and purchase some of the quickly selling presale to take advantage of its potential prior to the BitMart listing in late June 2025.

If so, you might be interested in hearing what some leading industry figures are saying. A new institutional report, ‘The Bull Case for ETH,’ suggests that the second-largest cryptocurrency is not just undervalued – it’s *severely* undervalued, with potential price targets that might sound astronomical at first glance. Why Experts Believe Ethereum Is Severely Undervalued The core argument presented in a report cited by The Block is that traditional financial models simply fail to grasp the true value and Ethereum potential. Unlike a company stock, which can be valued based on profits, assets, or market share, Ethereum serves a fundamentally different purpose within a burgeoning digital economy. Key points highlighting why legacy valuation methods fall short: New Asset Class: Digital assets and blockchains represent a novel asset class that doesn’t fit neatly into existing categories like equities or commodities. Foundational Technology: Ethereum isn’t just an application; it’s the infrastructure – a foundational layer – upon which decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, DeFi protocols, and more are built. Diverse Utility: ETH tokens are used as collateral in DeFi, fuel for computations (gas fees), and yield-generating assets through staking. This multi-faceted utility is hard to quantify with traditional metrics. Understanding the ETH Valuation Challenge Valuing a network like Ethereum is complex because its value is derived from its utility, security, and the economic activity it facilitates. Vivek Raman, co-founder of the ETH think tank Etherealize, is a strong proponent of abandoning outdated valuation models. He argues that comparing ETH to traditional assets like oil, bonds, or even the M2 money supply provides a more accurate perspective on its potential scale and impact. Think about it: Oil is essential for transportation and industry. Bonds represent sovereign debt and stability. M2 money supply reflects the total liquid money in an economy. Raman suggests that as the on-chain economy grows, ETH’s role as a fundamental economic primitive could place it in a similar category of global significance. What is the Reported Ethereum Price Prediction? The report mentioned by The Block suggests a staggering long-term ETH price target of up to $740,000 per token. While this number might seem unbelievable today, it stems from the belief that as the digital economy matures and Ethereum becomes increasingly integral to global finance and activity, its value will appreciate exponentially. This prediction is not based on short-term market speculation but on a long-term view of Ethereum’s adoption curve and its fundamental role in securing value and enabling economic activity. The report notes that Ethereum currently secures approximately $767 billion worth of assets on its network, underscoring its significant existing role. Is ETH Undervalued Compared to What? When experts say Ethereum undervalued, they mean it’s undervalued relative to its potential future utility, adoption, and the sheer scale of the digital economy it is poised to underpin. It’s less about comparing its current market cap to, say, a tech company, and more about comparing its potential impact and value accrual mechanisms to foundational global assets. The argument is that the market hasn’t yet fully priced in the transformative potential of a global, decentralized computing platform and economic layer. Just as early investors in the internet infrastructure saw value far beyond dial-up modems, proponents of this view see ETH’s current ETH valuation as a fraction of what it could become if the on-chain economy reaches mass adoption. Could Ethereum’s Impact Rival the Internet? Vivek Raman draws a powerful parallel: he believes that Ethereum’s eventual adoption could rival, or even surpass, the transformative impact of the internet itself. The internet revolutionized communication and information access. Blockchains like Ethereum are poised to revolutionize value transfer, ownership, coordination, and economic interaction on a global scale, potentially creating entirely new markets and business models. If this vision materializes, the demand for ETH – as the necessary fuel and collateral for this new economy – would surge, naturally driving up its value significantly beyond current levels. Conclusion: Re-evaluating Ethereum’s Place The argument that Ethereum is severely undervalued challenges investors and analysts to look beyond traditional metrics. It posits that ETH is not merely a speculative asset or a ‘tech stock’ but a foundational component of a rapidly expanding digital economy. While a $740,000 price target might seem extraordinary, it highlights the immense long-term potential seen by those who view Ethereum through the lens of global reserve assets and transformative technological shifts. Understanding Ethereum’s role as collateral, computational fuel, and yield infrastructure, and comparing its potential scale to global economic mainstays, offers a new perspective on its true value. As the on-chain economy continues to grow, the debate around ETH’s valuation will undoubtedly intensify, but the case for its significant long-term potential remains strong among its proponents.

Most altcoins were in the red, with the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and stablecoins dropping to $580 billion, the lowest level since June 5. Nansen data shows that some smart money investors are using the ongoing crypto crash as an opportunity to buy. Smart money refers to individuals and institutions with a long track record of success in the crypto industry. In most cases, these investors buy when tokens crash and short when they peak. Here are some of the top altcoins that smart money investors are buying. Aerodrome Finance Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ), the biggest decentralized exchange on Base, is attracting smart money investors. Per Nansen, net buys on DEX networks stood at $180,000. A likely reason for the buying is that Aerodrome Finance continues to gain market share on the Base network. Its DEX volume in the last 30 days was $15.4 billion, much higher than Uniswap and PancakeSwap, which handled $10.9 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, on Base. Another reason is a recent announcement by Coinbase that it would be integrating DEX networks on Base into the main Coinbase app, giving Aerodrome access to millions of users. Coinbase APP将为用户提供base链的DEX服务。 https://t.co/nFMDd9dEm3 — Based Chinese(Base中文) (@base__chinese) June 13, 2025 Freysa AI Freysa AI ( FAI ) is another top altcoin that smart money investors are buying. Nansen data shows that these investors bought tokens worth $232,000 in the last 24 hours, even as its price crashed by 10%. Freysa AI is a blockchain network on the Base blockchain. According to its website , it is an agent coordinating the Digital Twins network. Digital Twins is described as a user’s personal companion and second brain, representing users within a global network. FAI has a market capitalization of over $102 million. AAVE Smart money investors tracked by Nansen are buying Aave ( AAVE ), the biggest player in decentralized finance with over $27 billion in assets. They bought tokens worth $118,700 in the last 24 hours. As crypto.news wrote , AAVE is being supported by strong technicals and fundamentals. It has formed a golden cross pattern on the daily chart, pointing to a potential surge toward its highest level from last year. Fundamentally, AAVE has continued to gain market share in the lending and borrowing industry, with its total value locked (TVL) jumping to a record high. Further, GHO, its its stablecoin , has continued to attract investors, with its market cap rising to $218 million. Virtuals Protocol Virtual Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) is another top altcoin that smart money investors are buying. It recorded buy orders worth $60,000 and no sales in the last 24 hours. Virtuals Protocol is one of the leading players in the artificial intelligence industry, helping developers build AI agents within minutes.

Today is day 61,” Trump wrote on Truth, adding, “Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!” His comments came just hours after Israeli forces launched a wave of airstrikes against Iranian targets, an operation Trump said he was briefed on before it began. In a separate post , Trump claimed Iran was warned over and over again. “I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal,” he wrote. “I told them, in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it,’ but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn’t get it done.” He then added, “Certain Iranian hardliners spoke bravely, but they didn’t know what was about to happen. They are all DEAD now, and it will only get worse!” US says it stayed out as Iran responds with drones Although the US military did not take part in the airstrikes, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that Washington had been informed about the plans and clarified that “we are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.” Negotiations had been ongoing between the US and Iran in recent weeks, but the administration under Trump reportedly pushed for a direct deal rather than military escalation. In response to the strikes, Iran launched nearly 100 drones at Israeli targets on Friday morning. An Israeli military spokesperson confirmed the wave of drones and said the country’s defense systems were intercepting them in real time. Following the attack, a state of emergency was declared in Israel as officials prepared for more incoming threats. The situation has added even more tension to a region already worn out by the war in Gaza and clashes across the Middle East. Trump , in a second post, emphasized the potential for more destruction. “There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” he warned. “Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire. No more death, no more destruction, JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. God Bless You All!” Oil and gold rally as war fears rock the market Oil traders reacted immediately. The US West Texas Intermediate July contract surged 8.48% to $73.81 per barrel by 8:40 a.m. ET. Brent crude for August delivery rose 7.86% to $74.81. At the same time, gold prices also rose as traders scrambled for safer places to put their money. Spot prices of gold climbed 1.3% to $3,426.31, while gold futures for August jumped to $3,445.40. US Treasury bond prices moved higher in the morning, pulling yields lower across the 30-year, 10-year, and 2-year notes. The dollar, which had been slumping near a three-year low, bounced back sharply as the panic set in. The dollar index rose 0.5%, trading around 98.41. It also gained against typical safe havens like the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, rising 0.33% and 0.5% respectively. These gains show that the dollar is still king when fear kicks in, even in the face of other strong global currencies like the Swedish krona, the Swiss franc, and the Russian ruble, which are all outperforming it right now, according to data from CNBC. The mood in Europe is grim right now. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was down 0.9% halfway through the session. Travel and leisure companies took the hardest hits, falling 2.6%. Germany’s DAX lost 1.5%, the most out of any major European index. Individual stocks were slammed. IAG, the parent of British Airways, dropped 4.8%. Carnival, the cruise operator, lost 4.2%, while Auto1 Group, the online car sales company, fell 6%. These losses show just how quickly the market pulls out of anything tied to travel when war is on the table. At the same time, oil shipping companies surged. Frontline, the tanker giant, was up 8.2%, leading the Stoxx 600 as investors bet on higher oil demand and tighter supply routes if the war expands.

ETH is down 8.8% in the last 24 hours, while XRP is down 5% and Solana (SOL) is down 9%. However, one analyst said that despite the declines and rising geopolitical tensions, XRP and Solana are still seeing positive influence from corporate narratives and continue to attract institutional interest. Speaking to Coindesk, Bitget Research Chief Analyst Ryan Lee said that XRP is attracting attention with its growing share in institutional treasuries. At this point, Ryan Lee stated that companies such as Chinese company Webus International ($ 300 million), VivoPower ($ 121 million), Wellgistics ($ 50 million) and Trident ($ 500 million) are creating XRP buying pressure approaching $ 1 billion. “The increase in institutional XRP treasuries is a sign of greater institutional adoption of XRP due to its low-cost, high-speed payment capabilities.” At this point, Lee said that regulatory clarity around XRP and ETF speculations could push XRP to $5 by mid-2025. However, Lee added that downside risks for XRP also remain. Interest in Solana (SOL) Continues! Ryan Lee, who also outlined his Solana estimates, said institutional interest in Solana remains buoyant, as SOL benefits from solid network fundamentals and ETF demand, with data pointing to further gains. Solana rose to around $165, supported by over $1.2 billion in Q1 execution revenue and increased open interest in the futures markets, Lee noted. This signals renewed confidence in Solana among both retail and institutional players. At this point, the analyst stated that if the current momentum in Solana continues, the SOL price could rise to the $200-250 range or even exceed $300. *This is not investment advice.

Recent preferred stock offerings introduce significant cashflow risks, as their high yields could become unsustainable without sufficient revenue or Bitcoin price appreciation. Valuation now appears fair after a strong run-up, and future upside is limited unless Bitcoin substantially outperforms the high cost of capital from preferred shares. While the 21/21 plan is ambitious, regulatory and tax risks, plus the burden of perpetual preferred dividends, make the risk/reward less attractive for common shareholders. Co-Authored by Noah Cox and Brock Heilig Investment Thesis Shares of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) ( MSTR ) are currently outperforming the market by a strong margin. Year to date, Strategy shares are up more than 31%. Over the last 6 months, the stock has fallen by more than 3%. And in the last year, shares have increased by a strong 136.81%. Because of this quick rise in share price (driven by the rise in Bitcoin), I am actually downgrading my view of shares of Strategy from a buy to a hold. While Strategy’s plan to accumulate more Bitcoin could still turn out to be a solid one, I am concerned by the series of preferred stock the company has added to their capital stack. None of this was on their capital stack when I first wrote on the company back in January. My fear now is that their growth of debt could exceed the growth of their Bitcoin equity. The company’s stock has grown by more than 20% since the last time I wrote on them in mid-January, and I was very impressed by Q1 execution. However, I think shares are now fairly valued. I don’t see a ton of upside from here. This aligns well with my upside prediction from my writing back in January. Strategy adding preferred stock to their balance sheet may not end up being sustainable. I think this will be a tough pill for current common shareholders to swallow. Shares of Strategy are downgraded to a hold. Why I’m Doing Follow-Up Coverage As I mentioned earlier, Strategy stock has rallied about 26% since I last wrote on the company in early January. Over just 5 months, Strategy shares have risen from about $310 to roughly $391 a piece. In this same time frame, the S&P 500 has risen just 4.44%. As the price of Bitcoin has done well year to date, Strategy shares have followed (and frankly outperformed). Despite this, my concern going forward is not that shares have outperformed. My concern is that future growth is going to be fueled by unsustainable preferred stock. The company has raised a total of $10 billion in fresh capital in 2025, ($6.6 billion in equity, $3.4 billion in debt), building on a record $18.1 billion in Q4 2024 and bringing total Bitcoin holdings closer to 600,000 coins. Strategy owns nearly 3% of all 21 million Bitcoins that will ever exist. I’m tracking institutional demand for yield-bearing crypto products. Strategy’s Bitcoin-linked preferred shares (STRK, STRF, and STRD) offer a compelling yield. But will this yield turn out to be unsustainable given this is often a cash payment when the company cannot support cash payments with little revenue? This is my major concern. At the core of why I am doing follow-up coverage, I want to talk about what, I think, is a flip in their capital structure. Previously, MicroStrategy (now Strategy), was what, I believe, was ‘well capitalized.’ The company has no preferred shares, and convertible notes that convert into common stock once shares go above a certain price. Now, Strategy has Preferred shares (which pay a dividend unless this dividend is suspended). I think this sets a dangerous precedent. This is the opposite of the capital structure I originally saw that made me fascinated by the asset acquisition model (can’t really call it a ‘business model’). With this, I am doing follow-up coverage because I believe that Strategy may be at a turning point (and not for the better). Strategy needs to keep its preferred shares in check, which will slow its Bitcoin yield per share. This is a major issue. Unsustainable Debt At the heart of my downgrade on Strategy is my view of their now increasingly leveraged balance sheet. To review, when I last wrote on Strategy back in January, their capital structure consisted of two main securities: Common stock owned by shareholders. This trades under “MSTR” here in the US. Issuing common shares has little impact on the long run viability of the company (leverage wise). Convertible notes, many of which pay 0% interest, are non-recourse loans, and often will convert into stock. These also have not concerned me because they don’t bleed capital (in terms of interest payments) in the event of a Bitcoin drawdown with the company still having to service their debt. In essence, common shares (and convertible notes) cost the company zero on an accounting or cash basis until the convertible notes mature. Their new instruments (STRF), ( STRK ), and ( STRD ) all have their host of interest payments). These are all forms of preferred stock. So, unlike their convertible bonds that have a maturity date (but no interest payments), these have no maturity date (but have a ton of interest payments). (STRD) is the newest of the three preferred share offerings. The first two are summarized nicely by the company’s most recent 10Q (table from 10Q below). Preferred Stock Share classes Q1 (Seeking Alpha) For “STRD,” their most recent offering, preferred shares yield 10% per annum. Dividends are not cumulative; meaning if the board does not declare a dividend, then no backpay of dividends is owed. To me, the net result of this is a catch 22 now for Strategy. Either they pay the 8-10% nominal yield on these securities per annum (and see a huge cashflow drag that is not supported by revenue and will require more stock issuances), or don’t pay these cumulative dividends and make investors of the preferred shares question if there is going to be some sort of liquidity risk with their investments. After all, preferred shares theoretically are outstanding forever. So, if Strategy fails to pay a dividend, what are the odds new investors will finance new preferred shares? I say all of this because I believe that while Bitcoin’s price has touched all-time highs in the last few weeks, Strategy common shares have been lagging. I think common shareholders are starting to wonder if the Bitcoin yield per share is sustainable (or if all of this will need to be paid back to creditors eventually). While I am not a shareholder, I am wondering this too. Valuation To be clear, I have no idea what strategy is worth at this point (hence why I am rating them a hold vs. a buy or a sell). When I last wrote on them, I implied that there could be up to roughly 30% upside in shares. Since then, we have seen shares jump by 26% pricing in most of this upward swing. According to Strategy’s valuation metrics , the company has a trailing twelve months price-to-book ratio of 3.24, which is 5.56% lower than the sector median of 3.43. Seeking Alpha Quant gives the company a grade of a C+ on this metric. The biggest issue is the knockout risk that comes from MicroStrategy/Strategy failing to refinance debt and this leading to the collapse in shares of the Bitcoin treasury company. Since there is now billions of dollars of convertible debt and preferred stock on top of common shares, the effective “Bitcoin yield” to shares is a little bit skewed and maybe misrepresenting what the actual Bitcoin yield is. For example, if Strategy buys Bitcoin now and finances it using preferred stock that costs them 10% in annual preferred dividend payments, this means that for the Bitcoin per common share yield to increase, the price of Bitcoin would need to increase by more than 10% per annum. This is technically possible since Bitcoin has compounded at roughly 57% CAGR over the last 5 years according to Strategy chairman Saylor. This is not guaranteed going forward, however. In fact, if we were to see Bitcoin compound at a rate less than 10% per annum over any period of time, technically the Bitcoin yield would turn negative. Since it appears we may be near the end of the 4-year bull run cycle in Bitcoin, I think there is a real risk it underperforms over the next few years. This is a huge risk now with preferred stock on their capital stack. It’s the main reason why shares are a hold now. Bull Thesis Even though I am downgrading shares of Strategy, this doesn’t mean that there is not a bull thesis. At the end of the day, the whole story with Strategy comes down to execution. With this, the main question: can the firm execute its innovative 21/21 plan and create net shareholder value with the combination of debt plus far more equity. The 21/21 plan is a now shareholder approved proposal to raise $21 billion of equity and $21 billion of fixed income over the next three years. On the surface, I still believe buying up large amounts of Bitcoin via equity and leverage is a bullish play if the network can figure out its Quantum hacking risks (more on this another time with an article that focuses on Bitcoin directly). The risk now is regulatory. The biggest risk with this plan is not even the interest on the debt that Strategy now has to pay. The biggest risk (I believe) is the 15% corporate AMT on unrealized gains under the Inflation Reduction Act could force Strategy to sell Bitcoin starting in 2026. This would be a very concerning outcome. Saylor, a Bitcoin enthusiast, has been arguing for years he would never sell any of Strategy's Bitcoin. It could create a sticky situation for Saylor and Strategy. In essence, this AMT tax works as a minimum tax on “adjusted financial statement income” which includes unrealized gains from (among other things) cryptocurrency investments. This is Strategy’s whole business. While some cryptocurrency firms have requested exemptions from the AMT, there is no guarantee that Strategy will earn an exemption. Starting in 2026 , companies will be forced to pay this AMT (unless they get an exemption). This could be a multi-billion dollar tax bill for Strategy alone. Bottom Line While Strategy may remain one of the purest equity proxies for Bitcoin upside, I think the biggest risk now is that the preferred stock the company has on its balance sheet may get too metaphorically heavy. Historically, as Bitcoin grew, Strategy grew along with it, simply because of how much Bitcoin the company owns and how Saylor sliced the risk appetite up based on the company’s different share classes/convertible notes. The biggest risk with preferred stock is not even that it's perpetual. The biggest risk is that the debt pays an interest rate that (depending on the specific tranche of preferred stock) may have to be a cash dividend. This is a tough pill to swallow. Bitcoin will inevitably have its drawdowns in the future. Saylor will have to fund these interest payments with either the sales of Bitcoin (bad idea for investor trust) or via issuing more debt. At this point, you’re talking about issuing new principal debt to pay off the interest on the previous debt. While this is how the US government runs, this is not sustainable for a single company. It frankly is probably not stable for the US government either. For long-term Bitcoin bulls, Strategy may still offer a high-conviction, high-reward vehicle. Its currently expanding Bitcoin treasury could really be the only paths to justify the risk diffusion complexity and common share volatility. With this, shares are downgraded from a buy to a hold.",STRK|STRD|STRF|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|STRK,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-13 13:36:04

As institutional capital pours into the crypto sector, the best investment strategy right now is to buy low and watch your portfolio grow 20x or more. A good example of this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , where investors stand to make bombastic returns. Recent analysts forecast that the MUTM token could rise by as much as 2,745% once it goes live. Let us take a closer look at the next wave of crypto stars. Ripple (XRP) The XRP coin has been in the news a lot lately. For instance, Ripple Labs recently made the case for why XRP could replace the SWIFT payment system. In the past week, this has led to some positive price movement, with XRP rising over 4%. However, XRP has recently come under scrutiny by the crypto market due to ongoing legal challenges. Some analysts have stated that XRP could dip by as much as 20%. Unless something big happens in the next few days, this could happen. The cycle of unstable gains and massive slides is expected to continue for the medium term. If you are looking for consistent and dependable gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) still offers the best prospects for massive returns. Currently in the presale, it offers investors the perfect entry point. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is an exciting ecosystem that rose to a new all-time high in January 2025. However, it has since fallen off as utility has failed to materialize amid the meme coin surge. Despite this, SOL could surprise many critics by rising over 25% in 20205 to around $200 per coin. While these gains would be impressive, they are a drop in the bucket compared to the massive gains of 20x expected for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Primed For Explosive Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an innovative new project in the Defi sector that is built for complete transformation. The protocol allows users to participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When participating as a lender, you deposit your funds into the pool to earn interest. The interest you receive is based on the pool utilization rate. As the amount of loans taken by borrowers rises, the utilization rises. This, in turn, encourages the borrowers to pay back loans to avoid the rising rates. Meanwhile, lenders seize the opportunity for higher yields and deposit more funds. The result is that the Mutuum Finance protocol is a self-sustaining ecosystem that will achieve optimal capital efficiency. To ensure that the pools always have enough liquidity, all loans on the protocol must be overcollateralized. Additionally, the protocol applies a reserve factor to ensure there is a meaningful liquidity buffer across the ecosystem. Liquidity Safeguards On Mutuum Finance, various measures are taken to ensure the long-term viability of the protocol. One of these measures is the restricted collateralization mode, where collateral is restricted to borrowing only one type of asset. This is done when an asset has too much volatility that would make it a potential source of instability in the ecosystem. Another measure used to protect the ecosystem is the Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE), which applies to closely correlated price movements, such as stablecoins. The ECE is used to provide these assets with elevated borrowing limits, encouraging the participation of high-value assets in the protocol. The result is that participants get the benefits of enhanced capital efficiency when dealing in assets with consistent pegs and near-identical market movement. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is another important metric used to safeguard liquidity on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). It is a cap on how much a given asset can borrow relative to its value. For instance, an asset may be assigned an LTV of 60%, which means 1 unit of that asset can only borrow 0.60 worth of another token. The actual LTV fluctuates with time based on real-time market movements. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also has a liquidation trigger to safeguard liquidity. This is the threshold at which a debt is deemed unsafe and liquidated. For instance, if the borrowed amount surpasses a level of 70% of the collateral value, that position could be deemed unstable. The liquidators step in and acquire the debt at a discount. These liquidators make a small profit as a reward for helping to stabilize the ecosystem. Once a position is in liquidation, the system applies a liquidation penalty. A portion of this amount can go to the treasury as compensation, while the rest goes to the liquidator. The protocol uses an allocation factor to determine how much goes to the treasury and how much goes to liquidators. As a result, there is a balance between incentives for quick liquidations and ensuring the long-term solvency of the protocol. MUTM Token Presale The MUTM token presale has raised over $10.45 million so far and is in phase 5. Tokens in this phase are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. In the next phase, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, around 11,900 participants have taken part in the presale, and the number grows daily as word spreads. If you are looking for the most optimistic token presale of 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is, hands down, your best bet.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Dogecoin Unleashed: The Shiba Inu Coin Shaking Up Crypto Markets Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer. They wanted a fun alternative to serious cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Using the Shiba Inu “Doge” meme as its logo, Dogecoin was designed to be friendly and accessible. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin is plentiful, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply. What began as a “memecoin” quickly grew, thanks to its active community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared, reaching a market cap over $50 billion and becoming one of the top ten cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin’s rise shows the power of community and social media in crypto. Influential figures like Elon Musk boosted its popularity with tweets. While Dogecoin lacks advanced technology of some cryptocurrencies, its simplicity is part of its charm. Its unlimited supply means it’s less likely to be a store of value like Bitcoin, but useful for tipping or small transactions. In the current market, Dogecoin remains a wild card. Its price can be volatile, driven by trends and online hype. For some, it could be an exciting opportunity, but it’s important to be cautious and do your research before investing. XRP: The Fast and Borderless Cryptocurrency Transforming Global Payments XRP is a digital currency that aims to make moving money as easy as sending an email. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP is fast, low-cost, and open to all. It doesn’t need a bank account to work, and transactions happen quickly without a central authority. With XRP, people can send money across borders without high fees or delays. Ripple, the company that supports XRP, was given 80 billion XRP to help develop the system. They use XRP to improve the network and hold some in reserve to release over time. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” showing its goal to make payments flow smoothly between different currencies. XRP has the potential to change how we think about money transfers. Its technology allows quick and cheap transactions, a big advantage over cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can be slower and more expensive. In the current market, XRP looks attractive to those seeking a practical digital currency for real use. As more people and businesses look for faster ways to move money, XRP could become more popular. Compared to other coins, XRP offers a unique mix of speed, low cost, and accessibility. Many are interested in cryptocurrencies that solve real problems, and XRP fits well. Conclusion While DOGE and XRP have yielded gains, XYZVerse’s unique fusion of sports and meme culture positions it for potential 25-fold growth in the ongoing bull run.

The investment bank has experience as the backer of crypto and blockchain startups and therefore would be suitable as a sponsor for this highly publicized Bitcoin-focused SPAC. Pompliano’s SPAC Track Record The action is only a few days after Pompliano created ProCap Acquisition, another fintech SPAC. Listed on Nasdaq under ticker PCAPU, the company raised $250 million in its May IPO. PCAPU shares have risen sharply since then, up from June 1’s close of $10.60 to a high of $11.40 before closing at $11.30 by Thursday. Waiting to be confirmed So far, Pompliano has not made the ProCapBTC merger public.

For anyone tracking financial assets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, understanding these shifts is paramount. This significant jump in energy costs isn’t just about the price at the pump; it has far-reaching implications that could directly influence the performance and perception of digital assets. Why Did Oil Prices Skyrocket? Understanding the Trigger The immediate catalyst for the sharp increase in Brent WTI futures was a specific geopolitical event. Reports of an Israeli airstrike in Iran triggered immediate concerns about potential supply disruptions in a critical oil-producing region. The Middle East remains a linchpin in global energy supply chains, and any instability there directly threatens the flow of oil, impacting prices globally. Here’s a breakdown of the factors at play: Geopolitical Event: The specific incident involving Israel and Iran heightened fears of escalating conflict in a region vital for oil production and transit. Supply Concerns: Markets reacted swiftly to the possibility that conflict could disrupt oil production facilities or crucial shipping lanes like the Strait of Hormuz. Risk Premium: Traders immediately priced in a higher ‘risk premium’ due to the increased uncertainty and potential for future supply shocks. Market Psychology: Fear and speculation often amplify price movements in volatile situations, leading to rapid buying. This event occurred within an already tense global environment, adding fuel to existing anxieties about energy security and supply-demand balances. The Scale of the Surge: Brent and WTI Futures React The reaction in the oil futures market was immediate and substantial. Both major benchmarks saw significant gains: Brent Crude Futures: The international benchmark surged by more than 10%. WTI Crude Futures: The U.S. benchmark also experienced a jump exceeding 10%. A 10%+ move in a major commodity like oil within a short period is highly unusual and underscores the severity of the market’s reaction to the perceived increase in Geopolitical risk . This level of volatility hasn’t been seen frequently outside of major global crises. Historically, oil prices have shown a strong correlation with geopolitical instability in the Middle East. Past conflicts and tensions in the region have often led to sharp, albeit sometimes temporary, price spikes as markets grapple with potential supply disruptions. This latest event fits a pattern of markets reacting nervously to regional flare-ups. Economic Fallout: Inflation Fears Take Center Stage One of the most significant consequences of rising Oil prices is their direct impact on inflation. Energy costs are a major component of consumer price indices (CPI) in most economies. When oil goes up, it directly increases the cost of transportation, manufacturing, and countless goods and services. This surge intensifies existing Inflation fears around the globe. Central banks have been working to control inflation, and a spike in energy prices complicates this effort. Higher inflation can erode purchasing power, impact corporate earnings, and potentially lead to tighter monetary policies (like interest rate hikes) from central banks. Potential economic consequences include: Higher Consumer Prices: Increased costs for fuel, heating, and goods manufactured using oil. Reduced Consumer Spending: As essential costs rise, discretionary spending may decrease. Increased Business Costs: Companies face higher expenses for logistics, production, and energy. Pressure on Central Banks: May force monetary authorities to maintain or implement stricter policies, potentially slowing economic growth. Supply Chain Issues: Higher transportation costs can exacerbate existing supply chain pressures. The ripple effects of expensive oil are vast and can slow down economic activity, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as ‘stagflation’ if combined with stagnant growth. How Does This Oil Price Surge Affect the Crypto Market? Now, let’s bridge the gap to our world. While oil and crypto seem disparate, global macroeconomic forces connect them. The surge in Oil prices and the resulting increase in Inflation fears are critical factors for the Crypto market impact . Here’s how the connection works: Inflation Hedge Narrative: Bitcoin, in particular, has been championed by some as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. When inflation fears rise due to factors like soaring oil prices, this narrative can gain traction, potentially increasing demand for Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Risk-Off Sentiment: Geopolitical instability and economic uncertainty often lead investors to move away from perceived ‘riskier’ assets towards ‘safer’ ones. This ‘risk-off’ sentiment can negatively impact the broader crypto market, especially smaller altcoins, which are often seen as more speculative than Bitcoin. Macro Correlation: In recent years, the crypto market has shown increasing correlation with traditional financial markets, particularly tech stocks. If rising inflation fears lead to concerns about interest rate hikes or an economic slowdown, this could weigh on the stock market, and crypto might follow suit. Investor Behavior: Global uncertainty can lead to increased market volatility across all asset classes as investors react emotionally and strategically to developing events. The Crypto market impact is not always straightforward or immediate. It’s a complex interplay of narratives, correlations, and investor sentiment reacting to the evolving macroeconomic landscape shaped by events like the oil price jump. Is Bitcoin the New Safe Haven Amidst Geopolitical Risk? The narrative of Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or a safe haven asset resurfaces during times of heightened Geopolitical risk and economic uncertainty. When traditional financial systems seem vulnerable or inflation looms, proponents argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative. Evidence for this is mixed and debated: Arguments for Safe Haven: Decentralization away from government control, finite supply (21 million cap), censorship resistance. Some argue its performance during specific crises supports this (e.g., capital flight during certain geopolitical events). Arguments Against Safe Haven: High volatility compared to traditional safe havens like gold or government bonds, relatively short history as an asset class, increasing correlation with risk-on assets (like tech stocks). The recent surge in Oil prices provides another test case for this narrative. While some investors might turn to Bitcoin fearing inflation and instability, others might view it as too risky during a period of general market caution. The market’s reaction will likely be a key indicator of how widely the ‘safe haven’ narrative is currently accepted. Navigating the Volatility: What Crypto Investors Should Consider The surge in Brent WTI futures and the broader implications for inflation and geopolitical stability mean that crypto investors need to be particularly vigilant. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on global news, not just crypto-specific news. Events in the Middle East or changes in central bank policies directly impact the macro environment influencing crypto. Understand Correlations: Be aware that crypto prices don’t exist in a vacuum. They are increasingly influenced by traditional markets, commodity prices, and macroeconomic indicators like inflation. Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Periods of heightened Geopolitical risk often bring increased market volatility. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Consider Diversification: While tempting to focus on one asset, a diversified portfolio across different asset classes can help mitigate risk during uncertain times. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term price swings driven by geopolitical events can be significant. For long-term investors, focusing on the fundamental value and adoption trends of cryptocurrencies might be more productive than reacting to every piece of news. Inflation Hedges: If Inflation fears are a primary concern, research assets traditionally considered inflation hedges, including but not limited to Bitcoin, and understand their pros and cons. Ignoring events in traditional markets, especially those as significant as a 10%+ jump in Oil prices , would be a mistake for any serious crypto investor. The world is interconnected, and financial markets reflect this reality. Conclusion: Oil’s Surge and Crypto’s Crossroads The dramatic surge in Oil prices following the recent events in Iran is a stark reminder of how quickly geopolitical tensions can disrupt global markets and reignite Inflation fears . This significant movement in Brent WTI futures highlights the inherent volatility introduced by Geopolitical risk . For the cryptocurrency market, this situation presents both challenges and potential opportunities. It tests the narrative of Bitcoin as a safe haven and underscores the growing interconnectedness between traditional finance and digital assets. While short-term volatility may increase, understanding the underlying macroeconomic forces at play – driven partly by events like the oil price jump – is crucial for making informed decisions in the crypto space. As the situation evolves, the crypto market’s reaction will provide valuable insights into its maturity, its correlation with traditional assets, and the prevailing investor sentiment regarding its role in a volatile world.

Bitcoin Long-Term Impact and Market Implications Despite geopolitical headwinds and short-term volatility, analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory if Japanese institutions begin to buy. The price holding above $100,000 means long-term investors are treating dips as buying opportunities. Japan’s move could: Make BTC a neutral reserve asset Accelerate institutional adoption in Asia Diversify central bank reserves away from traditional fiat reserves. If that happens, we could see a new buying wave and a sustainable move above $110,000. Until then, macro and technicals will keep things range-bound.

The crypto exchange stated that there’s a possibility of both forced and discretionary selling pressure in the crypto market, even as overall sentiment appears positive for the second half of 2025. Coinbase’s research team has identified roughly 228 publicly traded companies that now hold over 820,000 BTC collectively. Only 20 financial firms have a subset actively mimicking the high-risk, debt-financed accumulation model used by firms like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). These companies issue debt, often in the form of convertible notes, to raise capital used almost exclusively for crypto accumulation. Institutional leveraged crypto holdings could lead to sell-offs According to Coinbase, these firms have little to no operating revenue outside of their digital asset holdings and are trading at a premium relative to their underlying net assets. Accounting standards introduced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in December 2023 allow companies to report digital assets at fair market value. It removed prior constraints that required marking down losses without recognizing unrealized gains. The accounting change, effective from December 2024, helped companies create Bitcoin-focused treasury strategies and what Coinbase terms “publicly traded crypto vehicles” (PTCVs). Coinbase mentioned two risks with PTCVs, the first being forced selling, where companies may have no choice but to offload holdings to service debt if refinancing is unattainable. Much of this debt, issued during periods of low interest rates, will come due between 2029 and 2030, but some notes have early redemption features as soon as 2026. Chart data in the report shows that firms like Strategy, Riot, and Semler Scientific have billions in outstanding convertible notes. Debt of corporations and maturity dates. Source: Coinbase monthly report Long-term maturity may reduce the immediate risk, but Coinbase warns that if market conditions deteriorate or interest rates spike, they may be forced to sell assets as they would likely fail to refinance debts. The second risk is motivated discretionary selling, where firms might choose to sell portions of their crypto to fund operations or cash flow needs. Even without financial distress, given their large accumulation numbers, such liquidations could trigger negative market sentiment. If prices fall, other entities may rush to exit. “Even a relatively small unexpected sale by one of these entities could destabilize investor confidence and lead to a broader liquidation event,” Coinbase wrote. Relief from economic stability Coinbase reiterated that the US economy has shown stronger-than-expected growth, with recession fears largely receding. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDPNow estimate rose from 1.0% in early May to 3.8% by June 5. Coinbase believes the change supports asset prices and reduces the likelihood of an economic downturn. That said, the US Treasury yield curve, especially with 30-year bond yields, clocked 5.15% on May 21, a two-decade high. Rising long-term rates could tighten financial conditions, increase borrowing costs, and stifle the growth of debt-heavy PTCVs. According to a chart within the report, there is a correlation between macroeconomic stress and crypto market volatility. If long-dated yields rise too quickly, equity and credit markets could experience a slump, indirectly affecting leveraged crypto firms. Number of standard deviations based on 180d average of period prior to recession.

U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF products are showing remarkable strength, recording their 19th consecutive day of net inflows on June 12, totaling an impressive $113.32 million. This consistent positive flow into these regulated investment products signals growing investor confidence and increasing participation in the Ethereum ecosystem. What Are Spot Ethereum ETFs and Why Do Inflows Matter? Before diving into the numbers, let’s quickly touch on what a Spot Ethereum ETF is. Simply put, it’s an investment fund traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Ether (ETH) as its underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without the complexities of buying, storing, or managing the cryptocurrency directly. For many, especially large institutions, this regulated wrapper is the preferred way to access the crypto market. So, why are inflows significant? Net inflows mean more money is coming into these ETFs than is leaving. This indicates demand from investors who are buying shares of the fund. Consistent inflows, like the streak we’re seeing, suggest sustained buying pressure and a potentially bullish sentiment towards the underlying asset – in this case, Ethereum. Breaking Down the Latest Ethereum ETF Inflows On June 12, the combined net inflows for U.S. Ethereum ETF inflows reached $113.32 million. This isn’t just a one-off event; it’s part of a trend that has now seen positive net flows for 19 consecutive trading days. This sustained demand is a powerful signal coming from the traditional finance world into the crypto space. Looking at the specifics for the day: Total Net Inflows (June 12): $113.32 million Consecutive Inflow Days: 19 Key Contributors on June 12: BlackRock’s ETHA: $102.49 million Fidelity’s FETH: $10.83 million Other ETFs: No reported change in holdings for the day. As the numbers show, BlackRock and Fidelity are currently leading the charge, capturing the vast majority of the daily inflows. This highlights the significant role that major asset managers play in attracting capital to these new investment products. What Does Growing Institutional Ethereum Interest Mean? The substantial contributions from financial powerhouses like BlackRock and Fidelity underscore the growing trend of Institutional Ethereum adoption. These firms represent massive pools of capital, and their decision to invest heavily in ETH ETFs provides a significant validation for Ethereum as an asset class. For many large investors, including pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers, participating through regulated ETFs offered by trusted names is crucial. Increased institutional participation can have several positive effects on the Ethereum ecosystem: Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into the market can improve trading volumes and make it easier to buy and sell ETH. Enhanced Legitimacy: Institutional adoption signals that Ethereum is being taken seriously by traditional finance, which can attract even more investors. Potential for Price Stability: While crypto remains volatile, a broader base of large, long-term investors could potentially contribute to greater market stability over time. Analyzing the Performance of Various ETH ETF Products With the approval of several U.S. ETH ETF s, investors now have choices. However, the current inflow data clearly shows that capital is concentrating in the funds offered by the largest and most reputable asset managers, like BlackRock and Fidelity. The fact that other approved ETFs saw no change in holdings on June 12 suggests that, at least initially, investors are flocking to the most established names in the traditional finance world to gain their ETH exposure. This early concentration could lead to a competitive landscape where only a few ETFs capture the lion’s share of the market. Asset managers will likely compete on factors like fees, liquidity, and brand recognition to attract investors. The Broader Impact of Crypto ETFs on the Market The successful launch and sustained inflows into both Bitcoin and now Crypto ETFs represent a significant evolution for the digital asset market. They act as bridges, connecting the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency with the established infrastructure of traditional finance. These products offer accessibility and regulatory clarity that was previously unavailable to many investors. However, it’s important to remember that investing in crypto ETFs still carries risks. The value of the ETF is directly tied to the volatile price of the underlying cryptocurrency. Regulatory landscapes can change, and market sentiment can shift rapidly. While ETFs provide a convenient wrapper, the fundamental risks of investing in a volatile asset class like Ethereum remain. What to Watch For Next The 19-day streak of inflows is a strong positive signal. Moving forward, key indicators to watch include: Continued Inflow Streak: Will the positive trend continue? A prolonged streak would further solidify confidence. Volume and Value of Inflows: Are the daily inflow amounts increasing, decreasing, or staying consistent? Participation Across ETFs: Will other ETH ETFs start seeing significant inflows? Impact on ETH Price: While inflows don’t directly cause price increases dollar-for-dollar, sustained buying pressure through ETFs can be a bullish factor. Regulatory Developments: Any new guidance or rules from regulators could impact the ETF market. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal from Spot Ethereum ETFs The recent surge in Ethereum ETF inflows , culminating in over $113 million on June 12 and marking 19 consecutive days of positive flow, is a clear and powerful signal. It demonstrates robust demand for regulated Ethereum exposure, particularly from large institutional players like BlackRock and Fidelity.

Pompliano, known for his influential podcast and massive following on X, is expected to become CEO of ProCapBTC, a new entity planning to raise $750 million to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ) directly. The company aims to go public through a merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, a special purpose acquisition company backed by investment firm Cohen & Company, according to Financial Times reporting . The deal would mark one of the largest recent crypto-focused capital raises, part of a broader resurgence of interest in digital assets in public markets . The deal would mark one of the largest recent crypto-focused capital raises and is part of a broader resurgence of interest in digital assets in public markets. According to people familiar with the talks, ProCapBTC would seek $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt as part of the merger. If finalized, the move would position the company as a major institutional Bitcoin buyer, following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor and Japan’s Metaplanet. Pompliano’s Bitcoin initiative Columbus Circle Capital 1 raised $250 million in a May IPO and was created to identify merger targets in sectors like fintech, digital assets, and AI. Cohen & Company, a New York-based boutique investment bank, sponsors the SPAC. Pompliano is no stranger to dealmaking. Earlier this year, he raised $220 million for a separate blank-check vehicle not involved in this initiative. The ProCapBTC deal is still under negotiation, and sources say an announcement could come as soon as next week.

SharpLink Gaming announced on June 13 that it has acquired 176,270.69 Ether ( ETH ) tokens for $462,947,816, positioning itself as the second-largest ETH holder globally, just behind the Ethereum Foundation. The iGaming giant is also the largest publicly traded holder of ETH and has staked over 95% of its total holdings to generate yield while contributing to Ethereum’s network security. With this move, SharpLink is doubling down on ETH as the backbone of its treasury, making a bold statement about the future of crypto on Wall Street. You might also like: British tech firm expands crypto reserves with $5m bitcoin purchase Why SharpLink is buying ETH SharpLink’s aggressive accumulation of ETH, partly fueled by a recent $79 million capital raise, has delivered an 11.8% increase in ETH-per-share value since early June, highlighting the potential upside of its crypto-focused reserve policy. “We believe Ethereum is foundational infrastructure for the future of digital commerce and decentralized applications. Our decision to make ETH our primary treasury reserve asset reflects deep conviction in its role as programmable, yield-bearing digital capital,” Rob Phythian, Chief Executive Officer of SharpLink Gaming. The timing of SharpLink’s move is no coincidence. As U.S. Congress advances landmark stablecoin and digital asset market structure legislation, institutional adoption of Ethereum is gaining unprecedented legitimacy. Joseph Lubin, SharpLink’s chairman, Ethereum co-founder, and Consensys CEO, framed the acquisition as a watershed moment for institutional crypto adoption. He believes SharpLink’s move is both timely and catalytic, with the potential to accelerate Ethereum’s adoption as a core technology layer for global digital infrastructure. With its half-billion-dollar bet, SharpLink isn’t just hedging on ETH’s price. The company is betting on Ethereum’s enduring utility as the backbone of decentralized finance, digital ownership, and next-gen internet infrastructure. And if Congress delivers clear crypto regulations, SharpLink may soon look less like a pioneer and more like an early adopter in a wave of corporate crypto treasuries.

33767162,[object Object],1749823216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,XRP Lawsuit: Ripple And SEC Renew Joint Push For A Ruling,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-renew-joint-push-ruling/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs Inc. have returned to Judge Analisa Torres with an amplified request that could bring their four-and-a-half-year XRP lawsuit to an abrupt close. In a five-page joint letter filed on 12 June 2025 (Doc. 987), the litigants ask the Southern District of New York for an “indicative ruling” that would dissolve the injunction imposed on Ripple last August and release the lion’s share of the $125 million civil-penalty escrow. The End Of The XRP Lawsuit? The motion , brought under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 62.1 and 60(b)(6), comes after Judge Torres rejected an earlier, near-identical application in May for failing to show the “exceptional circumstances” required to modify a final judgment. The renewed filing seeks to fill that gap. “Exceptional circumstances warrant the requested modification of the Final Judgment,” the parties write, identifying settlement efficiency, conservation of judicial resources and the SEC’s evolving crypto-enforcement priorities as the decisive factors. Under the proposed arrangement, Ripple would pay $50 million to the SEC “in full satisfaction” of the penalty, while approximately $75 million plus accrued interest would revert to the company. In addition, the permanent injunction—entered on 7 August 2024 and premised on violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act—would be lifted. The parties emphasize that their compromise is a “necessary condition of settlement” and promise, if the indicative ruling issues, to petition the Court of Appeals for a limited remand so the district court can enter the relief and the appeals can be dismissed. The letter recites a procedural history that began with Judge Torres’s landmark 13 July 2023 summary-judgment order. That decision split the SEC’s case, holding that Ripple’s institutional XRP sales ran afoul of federal securities law while ruling that programmatic sales on crypto exchanges did not constitute offerings of investment contracts. After the SEC’s remaining claims against Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen were voluntarily dismissed, the court, on 7 August 2024, imposed the $125 million civil penalty and enjoined Ripple from further unregistered XRP institutional distributions. Both sides noticed appeals in October 2024, but those proceedings were placed in abeyance on 16 April 2025 to allow time for a settlement‐in-principle. The joint request for an indicative ruling followed on 8 May 2025 but was denied a week later because the parties had not articulated why modification met the Rule 60(b)(6) “exceptional circumstances” threshold. The new submission leans heavily on Second Circuit authority— Microsoft Corp. v. Bristol Tech., Major League Baseball Props. v. Pacific Trading Cards—which recognizes that a court may modify or vacate its own judgment when doing so is indispensable to settlement and promotes judicial economy. “Termination of the appeals … would be consistent with these dismissals by joint stipulation” the SEC has recently executed in other crypto-asset cases, the letter notes, pointing to the agency’s post-January 2025 policy shift under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and his newly formed Crypto Task Force. The parties also argue that public interests are not harmed because Judge Torres’s substantive summary-judgment ruling will “remain untouched and will continue to bind the parties.” The requested relief, they contend, affects only remedial provisions—penalty size and injunctive scope—whose adjustment “reflects the unique facts of this case” and therefore carries “relatively small” precedential weight. What Comes Next Judge Torres now must decide whether these articulated factors meet the high bar of Rule 60(b)(6). Should she signal her willingness to grant the relief in the XRP lawsuit, the securities regulator and the San Francisco-based fintech will ask the Second Circuit to remand the case for entry of an amended judgment, after which both the SEC’s appeal (No. 24-2648) and Ripple’s cross-appeal (No. 24-2705) would be voluntarily dismissed. If the court demurs, the litigation returns to the appellate track, extending a saga that began when the SEC sued Ripple on 22 December 2020. For now, the fate of the injunction and $75 million in escrowed funds—and, by extension, Ripple’s immediate regulatory posture—rests on whether Judge Torres accepts that, five years on, the “exceptional circumstances” standard has finally been met.

Curious about where the big money is moving in the Bitcoin world? The latest data on US spot Bitcoin ETFs offers a fascinating glimpse. On June 12, these investment vehicles collectively recorded their fourth consecutive day of net inflows, pulling in a cool $86.79 million. This sustained positive trend suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment and continued interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional financial instruments. What Are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Why Do These Inflows Matter? US spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. Approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024, they allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without having to buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. This accessibility has opened the door for both retail and institutional investors who might be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. The data on Bitcoin ETF inflows is closely watched by analysts and investors alike because it serves as a proxy for institutional and broader market demand for Bitcoin. Consistent net inflows indicate that more money is entering the Bitcoin ecosystem via these regulated products than is leaving, which is generally seen as a bullish signal for the crypto market . Breaking Down the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows Data from June 12 According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, June 12 saw a total net inflow of $86.79 million across all operational US spot Bitcoin ETFs . While the overall number is positive, a look under the hood reveals a mixed picture among individual funds. Here’s a snapshot of the performance for the major players: ETF Ticker Provider Net Inflow/Outflow (June 12) IBIT BlackRock +$288.82 million GBTC Grayscale +$5.89 million FBTC Fidelity -$197.19 million ARKB ARK Invest / 21Shares -$10.73 million Other ETFs (BITB, EZBC, BTCO, BRRR, HODL, BTCW) Various $0.00 million (Net Change) As you can see, BlackRock IBIT continued its impressive run, attracting nearly $289 million in fresh capital. This significant inflow more than offset the outflows seen in other funds, driving the overall positive net figure. Notably, Grayscale GBTC , which experienced substantial outflows in the initial weeks after conversion, registered another day of net inflows, albeit a modest one. BlackRock IBIT and Grayscale GBTC: Contrasting Stories of Inflow? The performance of BlackRock IBIT since its launch has been remarkable. It has consistently attracted massive inflows, quickly accumulating billions in assets under management (AUM). This dominance highlights BlackRock’s significant reach and investor confidence in their offering. The $288.82 million inflow on June 12 is a testament to its continued popularity. On the other hand, Grayscale GBTC had a very different start. Having existed as a trust before the ETF conversion, it faced significant redemptions as investors who were previously locked in took profits or moved to lower-fee alternatives. However, in recent weeks, GBTC has seen periods of net inflows, suggesting that the selling pressure may be easing or that new money is starting to find its way into the fund, possibly attracted by its sheer size and liquidity within the US spot Bitcoin ETFs landscape. What Do These Inflows Signal for the Crypto Market? The four consecutive days of positive Bitcoin ETF inflows are generally interpreted as a positive sign for the broader crypto market . While the $86.79 million figure on June 12 isn’t the largest single-day inflow seen, the consistency is encouraging. It suggests underlying demand remains, even amidst price fluctuations. Factors that could influence future flows include: Bitcoin Price Performance: A rising Bitcoin price often attracts more investor interest, potentially leading to increased inflows. Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic stability or instability can impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments: Further clarity or changes in cryptocurrency regulation could influence institutional participation. Competitive Landscape: The performance and fee structures of individual US spot Bitcoin ETFs will continue to play a role in where capital is allocated. Are There Any Challenges or Risks Associated with These Trends? While inflows are positive, it’s crucial to remember the inherent volatility of the crypto market . ETF prices are directly tied to Bitcoin’s price, which can experience rapid and significant swings. Outflows can also occur just as quickly as inflows, potentially putting downward pressure on prices. Furthermore, the concentration of inflows into a few major funds like BlackRock IBIT means that significant redemption activity from these specific ETFs could have a notable impact on the market. Actionable Insight: For investors considering exposure via ETFs, understanding the specific fund’s holdings, fees, and provider is essential. Don’t just look at the total inflow number; analyze the individual ETF data. Conclusion: Momentum Builds Despite Mixed ETF Performance The data from June 12 confirms that positive momentum continues for US spot Bitcoin ETFs , marking a solid four-day streak of net inflows. While giants like BlackRock IBIT are clearly leading the charge and Grayscale GBTC shows signs of stabilizing, outflows from other funds like Fidelity FBTC and ARK ARKB indicate a dynamic market where capital is constantly being reallocated. These inflows are a key indicator of growing institutional and retail interest, providing a positive signal for the overall crypto market , though investors should always remain mindful of the inherent volatility and risks involved.

After weeks of stabilization and momentum building, XRP is now testing key resistance levels, with the daily timeframe hinting at a possible surge above $2.33. XRP Price Gears Up For Major Breakout Dark Defender, an X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst, has revealed in a recent analysis that XRP appears to be setting the stage for a significant price shift, with its daily chart signaling a possible upward breakout. After weeks of consolidation below a descending trendline, the altcoin is now approaching a critical level that could become the trigger point for rapid momentum growth, if confirmed. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Hit $21 This Bull Cycle With 1.618 Fib Level As Next Target Currently, the daily timeframe shows XRP testing a long-term downtrend line that has consistently rejected upward movements since early 2025. This resistance level, marked clearly on the analyst’s chart, hovers just above $2.3. Dark Defender has indicated that a daily candle close above $2.33 could effectively invalidate the downtrend and signal a breakout that may lead to further upside. Notably, the analyst’s 1-day XRP price chart shows an explosive move toward a new high of $3.39—a level not seen since the 2018 bull cycle. With XRP currently trading at $2.1, a successful rally to this bullish target would represent an impressive 61.43% surge in value. Such a move would not only break XRP out of its current consolidation phase but also confirm the emergence of a sustained uptrend. Moreover, if momentum persists, it could set the stage for even higher price levels. RSI And EMA Signals Defend XRP’s Bullish Thesis Supporting Dark Defender’s technical analysis and bullish scenario for the XRP price is a rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has broken above a descending trendline and continues to trend upward. This shift suggests that XRP is building momentum as buyers finally regain control. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Says XRP Is No Longer A Speculative Asset – Here’s What It Is Additionally, the analysis shows that price action remains above key Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), which are beginning to curl upward, signaling that the market trends could be turning in favor of the bulls. Although the Ichimoku Cloud technical indicator is not visible on the chart, Dark Defender notes that it is expected to flip bullish soon, further reinforcing XRP’s bullish thesis. Combined with the support held above the 200-day EMA, highlighted by the blue line on the chart, XRP appears to be entering a favorable technical zone. If price action aligns with the analyst’s projected setup and manages to hold candle closes above $2.33, it could mark the beginning of a stronger uptrend. Dark Defender also notes that “XRP’s slingshot pressure” is intensifying rapidly, further boosting the potential strength of the upcoming bullish wave.

While ADA has ranged between $0.62 and $0.73 so far this month, this quiet accumulation suggests that choppy price action stems from short-term speculative traders, not a broader exodus of value holders. Whales Go on a 310 Million Buying Spree – What do They Know? According to Santiment data , two major groups of Cardano whales are on a 310 million ADA buying spree—fueling speculation of a long-term positioning play. Total Cardano whale holdings. Source: Santiment. Whales holding 100 million to 1 billion ADA have increased their holdings by 4.3% since June 1, now controlling 3.15 billion ADA. More substantially, whales with more than 1 billion ADA have added 10% to 1.97 billion ADA. The transfer of supply into stronger hands could help resist volatility from short-term traders. While this surge in whale activity doesn’t precede a hard fork, it comes on the heels of Cardinal, a new protocol that plans to bring Bitcoin-native DeFi to the Cardano network for the first time. Welcome to the first Bitcoin DeFi protocol developed for Cardano https://t.co/CoYvrYnIfI — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 9, 2025 With Cardinal, Cardano is positioning itself as a serious contender in cross-chain DeFi by bringing Bitcoin’s value and security into the programmable environment of smart contracts. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has also made a bold proposal to convert $100 million in ADA from the protocol’s treasury into USDM—Cardano’s native stablecoin. The strategy centers around a self-reinforcing feedback loop: earn passive income by providing liquidity, then use that income to buy back ADA and refill the treasury. Cardano Founder Proposes Deploying $100M of $ADA Treasury to Boost #Cardano DeFi and Reinvest in $ADA . pic.twitter.com/JSNAIIYfkv — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDaily) June 12, 2025 Hoskinson estimates the strategy could generate $5–$10 million annually, deepen stablecoin liquidity, and encourage DeFi activity to build out the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano Price Analysis: Is a Surge Coming? This accumulation follows new momentum on the Cardano price chart, putting the early May breakout of a massive 7-month falling wedge back in focus. Despite a post-breakout stall, ADA’s return to the pattern’s upper boundary has flipped former resistance into support, holding the line at $0.60, near the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. This zone has marked bottoms since the mid-April market reversal—but momentum indicators now cast doubt over its strength. The RSI has made a sharp reversal after rejection at the neutral line. The Bulls could not capitalise on the seller exhaustion that drove Cardano’s last upwards move, giving way for further decline. The MACD also affirms an early June death cross, widening its gap below the signal line—a move that reflects a more sustained downtrend. With this shaky footing, the stability found around the $0.60 support with today’s downward move stands to be brief, turning focus to the channel’s upper boundary. A decisive breakdown there could invalidate the wedge’s bullish setup, ruling out its $1.44 technical target tied to the 2.618 Fibonacci extension—a 125% rise from current prices. If $0.60 fails to hold, the next key support sits at $0.50, aligning with deeper Fibonacci levels. Still, macro catalysts remain on the horizon. Community traction on the Cardinal protocol, Hoskinson’s proposal, and the July 15 Cardano ETF decision deadline could renew momentum. Altcoins Face Turbulence – Here’s How to Take Advantage Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio, especially as altcoins continue to prove volatile in June. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $7.1 million raised in its ongoing presale , the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 57% APY on staking that rewards early investors. You can keep up with Bitcoin Bull on X and Telegram , or join the presale on the Bitcoin Bull website .

A recent development out of the Middle East highlights just such a potential flashpoint: escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, with significant accusations leveled against the United States. Understanding the Immediate Iran Israel Conflict Spark Reports have surfaced indicating a sharp increase in rhetoric and actions between long-standing adversaries, Iran and Israel. According to Iran Observer, a source with a substantial following on social media, Iran’s Armed Forces have issued a stark warning to Israel. The message is clear: Israel should prepare for severe consequences and a strong retaliation. This warning follows earlier reports, including one from AP News, suggesting that Israel had conducted strikes and specifically targeted Iranian nuclear sites. While details surrounding the alleged Israeli actions and Iran’s potential response remain fluid, the direct targeting of sensitive facilities, if confirmed, marks a significant escalation in the shadow war that has long characterized the Iran Israel conflict . Adding another layer of complexity and tension to this already volatile situation is Iran’s direct accusation against the United States. The statement from Iran’s Armed Forces explicitly claims that the United States is fully cooperating with Israel. This accusation is weighty, as it directly implicates a major global power and suggests a potential widening of the conflict beyond the two primary regional actors. Deep Dive into US Iran Relations and Historical Context The relationship between the United States and Iran has been fraught with tension for decades, marked by periods of diplomatic engagement, sanctions, and proxy conflicts. Understanding this history is crucial to grasping the current dynamics and Iran’s accusation of US cooperation with Israel. Key aspects of US Iran relations include: The 1979 Islamic Revolution: This event fundamentally altered the relationship, turning a close ally into a hostile adversary. Hostage Crisis: The seizure of the US embassy in Tehran and the subsequent hostage crisis cemented mutual distrust. Nuclear Program Concerns: US and international concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions have been a central point of contention for years, leading to sanctions and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or Iran nuclear deal, which the US later withdrew from under the Trump administration. Regional Rivalry: The US is a strong ally of Israel and several Arab states that view Iran as a primary threat in the Middle East. This alignment naturally puts the US at odds with Iran’s regional ambitions and its network of proxy forces. Military Presence: The significant US military presence in the Middle East is often viewed by Iran as a direct threat to its security and sovereignty. Given this backdrop, Iran’s accusation of US cooperation with Israel, while perhaps intended for political messaging, reflects the deep-seated animosity and suspicion that defines US Iran relations . The US provides substantial military and diplomatic support to Israel, and it is widely understood that there is close intelligence sharing and strategic coordination between the two countries, particularly regarding threats emanating from Iran. Why Geopolitical Tension Matters for Global Stability When tensions flare in a region as strategically vital as the Middle East, the impact extends far beyond the immediate borders of the involved nations. Geopolitical tension in this area is particularly significant due to: Energy Supply: The Middle East is a major source of global oil and gas. Conflict here can disrupt supply routes (like the Strait of Hormuz) and lead to significant price spikes, impacting economies worldwide. Global Alliances: The region involves complex alliances and rivalries that draw in major global powers (US, Russia, China), increasing the risk of a wider international crisis. Terrorism and Extremism: Instability can create vacuums or opportunities for extremist groups to flourish, posing security threats globally. Economic Interconnectedness: In an increasingly globalized economy, conflict anywhere can affect supply chains, trade, and investor confidence everywhere. The current escalation in the Iran Israel conflict , coupled with the accusation against the US, heightens global anxieties about the potential for a miscalculation leading to a larger, more destructive conflict. This inherent uncertainty is a key characteristic of significant geopolitical tension . Navigating the Middle East Conflict: Potential Scenarios The situation in the Middle East conflict involving Iran and Israel could evolve along several paths, each with different implications: Scenario 1: De-escalation Intense rhetoric cools down. Back-channel diplomacy or mediation efforts (possibly involving other regional or global powers) succeed in lowering tensions. Actions remain limited to the ‘shadow war’ realm (cyberattacks, proxy skirmishes) without direct state-on-state military engagement. This scenario relies heavily on restraint from all parties and effective communication channels. Scenario 2: Limited Escalation Tit-for-tat strikes continue, potentially involving more significant military targets or infrastructure. Proxy groups linked to Iran in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, or Yemen increase attacks on Israeli or US interests in the region. Naval incidents in the Persian Gulf or Red Sea increase. Conflict remains primarily regional, without direct attacks on the homelands of the US or Iran (beyond proxy actions). Scenario 3: Significant Escalation (Wider Conflict) Direct military confrontation between Iran and Israel. US forces in the region are directly targeted or drawn into combat. Wider regional powers become involved. Potential disruption of major shipping lanes. This scenario carries the highest risk of widespread destruction and significant global market impact . The path taken will depend on numerous factors, including political will, military capabilities, and the potential for miscalculation under pressure. The accusation against the US suggests Iran views this not just as an Israel-Iran issue, but one involving the primary global power allied with its adversary, increasing the stakes within the broader Middle East conflict . Assessing the Global Market Impact One of the most immediate and tangible effects of rising geopolitical tension , particularly in the Middle East, is felt in global financial markets. Investors typically react to uncertainty by moving towards perceived safer assets and away from riskier ones. How might this specific situation impact markets? Oil Prices: The Middle East is central to global oil supply. Any threat to production or transport (like the Strait of Hormuz) can cause prices to surge. Escalation fears often build a ‘risk premium’ into oil prices, making them higher than market fundamentals alone might suggest. A wider conflict could lead to significant and sustained oil price shocks, impacting inflation and economic growth globally. Stock Markets: Increased volatility is common during periods of heightened geopolitical risk. Indices may decline as investors adopt a ‘risk-off’ stance, selling equities and moving into assets like government bonds. Sectors directly exposed to the region (e.g., energy, defense) or sensitive to global economic slowdowns may see significant movements. Safe-Haven Assets: Traditional safe havens like gold and potentially the US dollar may see increased demand, driving up their prices. Bitcoin’s role as a safe haven is debated, but it has shown potential to act as one during certain periods of global uncertainty, independent of traditional financial systems. The severity of the global market impact is directly correlated with the perceived likelihood and potential scale of escalation in the Iran Israel conflict . Cryptocurrency Market Impact: A Unique Perspective For those interested in digital assets, the question arises: how does geopolitical tension , specifically the potential for an expanded Middle East conflict involving the US and Iran, affect the cryptocurrency market? The relationship is complex and not always straightforward, but several factors are at play: Bitcoin as ‘Digital Gold’: The narrative that Bitcoin is a store of value akin to gold, especially during times of economic or political instability, gains traction. As traditional markets show volatility and potential downturns, some investors might look to Bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset or a hedge against traditional financial system risks. However, Bitcoin is still a relatively young and volatile asset class, and its reaction can also be influenced by broader market sentiment and liquidity. Increased Volatility: Geopolitical shocks tend to increase volatility across all asset classes, and cryptocurrencies are no exception. Sudden news developments can lead to rapid price swings as traders react to perceived risks or opportunities. Capital Flows: In regions directly affected by conflict or instability, there might be an increased interest in cryptocurrencies as a way to preserve wealth or facilitate cross-border transactions if traditional banking systems are disrupted or under scrutiny. Conversely, a global ‘risk-off’ move could see investors liquidate crypto holdings alongside other assets to raise cash. Regulatory Uncertainty: Heightened geopolitical tensions can sometimes lead to increased scrutiny on financial flows, potentially impacting cryptocurrency exchanges and transactions as governments look to prevent illicit financing or circumvention of sanctions. While cryptocurrencies exist outside traditional state-controlled financial systems, they are not immune to global events. The scale of the global market impact from the Iran Israel conflict and US Iran relations will undoubtedly influence investor sentiment and capital flows within the crypto ecosystem. Challenges and Uncertainties Ahead Predicting the outcome of the current geopolitical tension in the Middle East is challenging due to several factors: Information Opacity: Details about military actions and political intentions are often unclear or subject to propaganda. Multiple Actors: The involvement of state actors (Iran, Israel, US) and non-state proxies adds layers of complexity. Risk of Miscalculation: In high-tension situations, unintended actions or misinterpretations can trigger rapid escalation. Domestic Politics: Internal political dynamics in each country can influence decision-making. The accusation of full US cooperation by Iran highlights the perception that this is not just a bilateral issue, but one involving the broader strategic competition in the region and the intricate web of US Iran relations . This perception itself can fuel further tension and shape responses. Actionable Insights in Times of Geopolitical Risk While predicting market movements or the course of conflict is impossible, individuals and market participants can focus on managing their response to the uncertainty created by events like the escalating Iran Israel conflict and its potential global market impact . Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources to understand developments, but be critical of information, especially during times of conflict. Understand Risk: Recognize that geopolitical events introduce significant volatility and risk into markets. Review Portfolio: Consider whether your investment portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance, especially in a volatile environment. Diversification across different asset classes and geographies is a common strategy to mitigate risk (Note: This is general information, not financial advice). Avoid Panic Reactions: Emotional decision-making during periods of high tension often leads to poor outcomes. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: Short-term geopolitical shocks can be significant, but long-term investment strategies should ideally be based on fundamental analysis and personal financial goals. The interplay between geopolitical tension , US Iran relations , and the dynamics of the Middle East conflict underscores the interconnectedness of global events and their potential to influence even relatively new markets like cryptocurrency. Summary: Navigating a Volatile Landscape The recent warnings from Iran’s Armed Forces to Israel, coupled with the direct accusation of US cooperation, signal a dangerous uptick in the long-standing Iran Israel conflict . This development is not isolated; it is deeply rooted in complex US Iran relations and contributes to the broader instability characteristic of the Middle East conflict . Such heightened geopolitical tension carries significant risks, not least of which is a potentially severe global market impact . From oil prices and stock market volatility to the performance and perception of assets like Bitcoin, the ripples of conflict in this critical region are felt worldwide. As the situation remains fluid and uncertain, understanding the historical context, potential scenarios, and interconnectedness of global events is crucial for anyone seeking to navigate the complexities of today’s world and its financial markets. The coming days and weeks will be critical in determining whether de-escalation or further confrontation prevails.

Ripple ( XRP ) dropped to a low of $2.0715 on Friday, June 13, down 11% from its highest point this week and 36% below its peak earlier this year. The token declined even as the XRP Ledger network continued to grow following Circle’s expansion of USD Coin ( USDC ) to the network. Data on Circle’s website shows that the total supply of USDC on XRP Ledger has jumped to over $2 million since its incorporation. XRP price also dropped even as Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) expanded its tokenized treasuries to the ledger through a partnership with Guggenheim Partners, a company with almost $350 billion in assets.

Its market cap has climbed to $413 million, up from $309 million on June 1. If this trend continues, it could reach $500 million by the end of this month or in July. Another bullish catalyst is the rising odds that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot XRP exchange-traded fund. Current estimates place the likelihood at 90%. This is notable as the agency faces a June 16 deadline to rule on Franklin Templeton’s ETF application. Odds are that the SEC will postpone the decision, potentially to October. XRP price analysis XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that XRP has remained under pressure over the past few months, falling from $3.40 in January to below $2.20. XRP is now trading below the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages, a sign that bears are gaining momentum. Notably, XRP has formed a descending triangle pattern , a common continuation signal. This pattern includes a descending trendline connecting the highs since January 16 and a horizontal support level at $1.9097, which also aligns with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Therefore, the token is likely to experience a bearish breakout, confirmed if it drops below support at $1.9097. Such a move would increase the odds of a decline toward $1. Conversely, a break above the descending trendline would suggest further gains, potentially back to $3.40.

According to his analysis, XRP could soar to $27 per coin while capturing 27% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, placing its market cap around $1.5 trillion. This ambitious outlook is rooted in historical chart data and a technical pattern that suggests XRP is on the verge of a breakout. Historical Resistance: The Fibonacci 0.5 Level EGRAG’s analysis focuses on XRP’s dominance chart, particularly its interaction with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level. Historically, this level has acted as a major resistance. In both October 2019 and November 2020, XRP dominance hit this barrier before retreating, signaling the start of bearish trends. The same resistance reappeared in January and March 2025, again halting upward momentum. #XRP Dominance 27%, $27 & $1.5 T MC ONLY FEW : Chart Insights & Resistance Levels: Men lie, women lie, but charts and numbers Do not lie.

According to him, the more times an asset tests a key level, the more likely it is to eventually break through. XRP has already knocked on this “macro door” four times. A fifth attempt, he argues, could finally lead to a breakout, one that could send XRP dominance to 27%. The Bull Flag Structure and Breakout Potential EGRAG points to a bull flag pattern forming on the dominance chart. A bull flag is a technical continuation pattern, often appearing after a strong upward move, that indicates potential for further gains. In this case, a breakout from the flag could mark the beginning of a sharp rally in XRP’s share of the overall market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Achieving 27% dominance would be significant. It would signal that XRP holds more than a quarter of the total crypto market cap, an unprecedented level of influence for any asset outside of Bitcoin in recent years. For context, such dominance would place XRP at the forefront of a maturing market increasingly focused on real-world use cases and institutional-grade infrastructure. XRP at $27 and a $1.5 Trillion Market Cap If XRP reaches 27% dominance in a $5.5 trillion total crypto market, it would command a market capitalization of approximately $1.485 trillion. At that valuation, the price per XRP would be around $27 . While this may sound far-fetched to some, EGRAG argues that the projection is mathematically sound and backed by structural chart patterns. This scenario assumes continued growth in the overall crypto market, a likely outcome as tokenization of real-world assets accelerates and institutions increasingly adopt blockchain technologies. Ripple’s global expansion, integration with central banks, and support for stablecoins like RLUSD all add practical momentum to this outlook.

Next week, the Senate will hold its final vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act – the GENIUS Act – bringing this landmark stablecoin legislation one step closer to becoming law. Following Senate passage, the bill will advance to the House for consideration. This marks a significant step forward – not just for the crypto industry, but for American consumers, investors, and the global strength of the U.S. dollar. The numbers tell the story. Today, more than $190 billion in dollar-backed stablecoins are in circulation worldwide, doubling annually. Stablecoins aren't speculative crypto assets – they are digital dollars that enable instant, low-cost transactions anywhere in the world. In regions facing currency devaluation or authoritarian financial controls, stablecoins provide access to the economic stability of the U.S. dollar. Not only is this pro-innovation – it's pro-democracy. The GENIUS Act provides the clarity the industry urgently needs. By establishing sensible guidelines, it ensures stablecoins maintain stable value through high-quality liquid reserves, regular audits, and clear redemption rights. These aren't excessive burdens – they’re reasonable protections already practiced by responsible issuers. Most importantly, what the GENIUS Act provides is certainty, allowing responsible innovation to flourish while preventing bad actors from undermining the system. Passing GENIUS can’t wait. As other nations develop central bank digital currencies and alternative payment systems designed to circumvent dollar dominance, the United States faces a choice: embrace the innovation that's already spreading dollars globally, or cede this ground to other countries. The legislation provides the framework we need – strong reserve requirements, transparency rules, and consumer protections – without stifling the innovation that makes stablecoins so powerful. Progress on stablecoin legislation has been bipartisan, reflecting a growing recognition across the political spectrum that this technology serves American interests. Republicans see free-market innovation and reduced government intervention. Democrats value the financial inclusion and consumer protection aspects. Both parties understand that maintaining dollar supremacy isn't partisan – it's patriotic. Globally, stablecoins are already making a profound difference. In Argentina , where inflation has exceeded 100%, residents use dollar stablecoins to preserve their savings. In Ukraine , humanitarian organizations have used them to deliver aid instantly when traditional banking channels failed. Across Africa and Southeast Asia, entrepreneurs have access to dollar liquidity and can build businesses that connect to the global economy. Each transaction strengthens the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. The technology community knows what's on the line. That's why companies of all sizes – from traditional financial institutions to Silicon Valley startups – want clarity around stablecoins. They're not asking for light-touch regulation or special treatment; they're asking for clear rules that allow them to build in America, serve American interests, and extend American financial leadership globally. Meanwhile, every month that goes by, more stablecoin activity moves offshore, more innovation happens outside our borders, and more ground is ceded to competitors. The European Union has already implemented stablecoin guidelines . Singapore , the UAE , and others are rolling out frameworks to attract this activity. Dollar-backed stablecoins don't compete with the Federal Reserve; they extend its reach. They don't undermine American banking; they create new customers for it. They don't weaken financial oversight; they make it more effective through programmable compliance and real-time transparency. Stablecoins are foundational infrastructure, not ideology. Passing the GENIUS Act requires no vast expenditures or bureaucratic complexity. It simply offers clear rules for American innovation to thrive, safeguards consumers, and fortifies the dollar’s global influence. The message to Congress is clear: Don't let this moment pass. The world won’t pause while America deliberates. With the GENIUS Act, we can ensure that the future of global finance remains dollar-denominated, governed by American values, and powered by our unmatched American ingenuity.",Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-13 15:32:09

The iPhone maker reclaimed the number one position in the Chinese smartphone market in May, which is considered a major rebound in one of its most critical markets. According to new data from Counterpoint Research, global iPhone shipments surged by 15% year-over-year during April and May, marking the strongest two-month performance for Apple since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Price slashes may be part of the reasons for the rise The growth comes largely on the back of renewed momentum in the U.S. and China, Apple’s two biggest markets. In China, where the company has faced fierce competition from domestic giants like Huawei and Xiaomi, Apple’s strategy of aggressive discounting appears to have paid off. To remain competitive, Apple has slashed prices on its flagship iPhone 16 series. Chinese e-commerce platforms were offering discounts of up to 2,530 yuan (approximately $351) during May. According to the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), shipments of foreign-branded phones in the country in April reached 3.52 million units, up slightly from 3.50 million during the same period last year. Apple’s footprint in India is growing Apple’s production ecosystem has been slowly shifting. Once almost entirely reliant on China’s supply chains, the company has been nudging more of its manufacturing into India. Between March and May, Apple’s manufacturing partner, Foxconn, exported $3.2 billion worth of iPhones made in India. Almost all, 97%, were headed for the U.S., a sharp jump from just 50% last year. May alone accounted for nearly $1 billion in shipments, the second-highest monthly total on record. Total exports from India this year have already surpassed 2024’s full-year figure, crossing $4.4 billion. By the end of 2025, India-made iPhones could represent as much as 30% of global iPhone shipments, up from 18% last year. Cook is navigating a maze of tariffs, politics, and bottom-line pressure Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing remain unresolved. President Donald Trump has floated the idea of levying tariffs of up to 55% on Chinese imports, a figure that could have sweeping consequences for Apple’s cost structure if reinstated. However, Apple , with its play in India, is showing that it is not waiting around. The company has deployed tariff-avoidance measures, including chartered flights, to accelerate deliveries and avoid bottlenecks by lobbying Indian authorities to speed up customs clearance at Chennai’s international airport, aiming to slash processing times from 30 hours to just six. Analysts warn that the iPhone maker’s fate remains closely tied to how well it performs in the U.S. and China. In the United States, the Tim Cook-led tech giant faces intensifying scrutiny. President Trump has taken public swipes at the company for its deepening ties to India’s manufacturing sector, and lawmakers are keeping a close eye on Apple’s partnership with Alibaba for AI integration in China, a move some say may pose privacy and security risks.

Recently, a notable blockchain transaction involving the Ethereum Foundation surfaced, prompting discussions across the community. According to reports from Lookonchain on X, the Foundation transferred a sum of 1,000 ETH, valued at approximately $2.47 million at the time of the transaction, to a specific wallet address. While such transfers aren’t uncommon, the sheer volume and the entity involved make it a point of interest for those monitoring the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market . What is the Ethereum Foundation and Why Track Its Moves? Understanding the significance of this transaction requires knowing the role of the Ethereum Foundation . It’s a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum and related technologies. Based in Switzerland, the Foundation plays a crucial role in funding critical development, research, and ecosystem growth initiatives. Its treasury often holds substantial amounts of ETH, which it receives through various means, including the initial coin offering (ICO) and subsequent donations or grants. Tracking the Foundation’s wallet activity is important for several reasons: Transparency: As a key entity in the ecosystem, its financial movements provide insight into its operations and funding distribution. Ecosystem Health: Transfers can signal funding for specific projects, grants to developers, or operational expenses necessary for network maintenance and upgrades. Market Sentiment: While not always a direct market driver, large transfers from prominent entities can sometimes influence sentiment or spark speculation about future plans. It’s crucial to remember that not every transfer is a ‘sale’ or a bearish signal. Often, these are routine operational transfers or allocations for ecosystem support. Decoding the Specific Blockchain Transaction The reported transaction involved 1,000 ETH moving from an address associated with the Ethereum Foundation to a wallet address beginning with 0xc061... . This movement, observed via blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, highlights the inherent transparency of public blockchains. Anyone with the right tools can track the flow of assets, though identifying the *purpose* or the *owner* of the destination address isn’t always straightforward or public. Details of the transaction: Amount: 1,000 ETH Approximate USD Value: $2.47 million (at the time of the report) Source: Wallet associated with the Ethereum Foundation Destination: Wallet address starting with 0xc061... Reported by: Lookonchain on X This specific transfer, while significant in dollar value, represents a relatively small percentage of the Foundation’s total holdings, which are often reported to be in the hundreds of thousands of ETH. This context is vital when assessing its potential impact. Potential Reasons Behind the Transfer: More Than Just a Sale? A single blockchain transaction from the Ethereum Foundation can occur for numerous reasons, most of which are related to its core mission of supporting the Ethereum ecosystem . Without official confirmation from the Foundation regarding this specific transfer, we can only speculate on the possibilities. However, based on past activities and the Foundation’s mandate, common reasons for moving ETH include: 1. Funding Grants and Ecosystem Projects: The Foundation regularly provides grants to individuals and teams working on Ethereum’s core protocol, layer-2 solutions, tooling, research, and various ecosystem initiatives. This is a primary use of its treasury funds. 2. Operational Expenses: Like any organization, the Foundation has operational costs, including salaries, event hosting, legal fees, and infrastructure. These require funding, which may necessitate converting ETH to fiat or transferring ETH to service providers or partners. 3. Treasury Management and Rebalancing: The Foundation might move funds between different internal wallets for security, organizational purposes, or to manage its holdings effectively. 4. Strategic Investments or Partnerships: While less frequent, the Foundation could potentially allocate funds for strategic investments or collaborations that benefit the wider ecosystem. It’s less likely that a transfer of this size to an unknown address is a direct, immediate sale onto an exchange, though that possibility cannot be entirely ruled out without more information. Often, large sales are conducted OTC (Over-The-Counter) or broken into smaller transactions to minimize market impact. Implications for the ETH Price and Broader Crypto Market Does a $2.47 million transfer from the Ethereum Foundation significantly impact the ETH price or the overall crypto market ? In isolation, probably not dramatically. The daily trading volume for ETH often runs into billions of dollars. A $2.47 million transfer, even if it were intended for sale (which is not confirmed), is a small drop in a large ocean. However, these movements are closely watched because: They come from a highly influential entity. They can sometimes precede or coincide with other significant events in the Ethereum ecosystem . Aggregated movements from multiple large holders (whales) can collectively influence market dynamics. For the most part, unless this transfer is part of a much larger series of transactions or is officially announced as funding for a major new initiative, its direct effect on the ETH price is likely minimal. Market movements are influenced by a confluence of factors, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall investor sentiment, far more than a single transfer of this size. Tracking Large Holders: What Can We Learn? The ability to track significant movements on the blockchain is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it offers unprecedented transparency compared to traditional financial systems. On the other hand, it can lead to misinterpretation and speculation. Tracking large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ provides insights into potential shifts in market dynamics. When entities like the Ethereum Foundation , major exchanges, or large investment funds move assets, it can signal: Accumulation/Distribution: Are they buying or selling? Strategic Moves: Are they reallocating assets or preparing for a specific event? Confidence Levels: While subjective, large holders’ actions can sometimes reflect their confidence in the asset’s short-term or long-term prospects. However, it’s crucial to approach whale tracking with caution: Lack of Context: A transfer doesn’t explain the *why*. Is it an internal move, a payment, a sale, or a deposit to a staking contract? Anonymity: While addresses are public, the identity behind them often isn’t, unless the address is publicly associated with an entity like the Ethereum Foundation or a known exchange. Misinformation: Speculation based on incomplete data can spread quickly and be misleading. Tools and platforms exist that aggregate and analyze whale movements, offering valuable data points, but they should be used as part of a broader research strategy, not as definitive trading signals. Actionable Insights: Staying Informed About Ethereum Foundation and Crypto Market Activity For those interested in keeping tabs on significant movements within the Ethereum ecosystem and the wider crypto market , here are some actionable steps: 1. Follow Reputable Blockchain Analytics Accounts: Entities like Lookonchain and others specialize in tracking and reporting large on-chain movements. Follow them on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) or their websites. 2. Utilize Blockchain Explorers: Learn how to use tools like Etherscan.io. If a specific address is known (like some associated with the Ethereum Foundation ), you can directly monitor its activity. Understand how to read transaction details. 3. Seek Official Announcements: The most reliable information about the Ethereum Foundation ‘s activities comes directly from the Foundation itself via its official blog or social media channels. Look for announcements that might correlate with observed on-chain movements. 4. Understand the Broader Context: Don’t view a single transaction in isolation. Consider it within the context of the Foundation’s stated goals, ongoing Ethereum development, and overall market conditions. 5. Be Wary of Speculation: While discussion is healthy, be critical of rapid conclusions drawn solely from on-chain data without confirmed context. Not every large transfer is a market dump. Staying informed requires combining on-chain data with official communications and a solid understanding of how the Ethereum ecosystem functions. Challenges and Benefits of Transparency The transparency of public blockchains, while a core feature, presents both challenges and benefits. The benefit is clear: anyone can verify transactions and track asset flows, promoting accountability, especially for public entities like the Ethereum Foundation . This contrasts sharply with the opaque nature of traditional finance. However, the challenge lies in interpretation. Raw transaction data doesn’t explain intent. A transfer could be a sale, a donation, an internal move, or a payment for services. Without accompanying information, observers are left to speculate, which can lead to: Misinformation and FUD: Unfounded rumors about selling pressure or financial distress can spread based on misinterpreted data. Privacy Concerns: While addresses are pseudonymous, patterns of activity can sometimes be linked to real-world identities or entities. Navigating this requires a nuanced approach – appreciating the transparency while understanding its limitations regarding context and intent. Conclusion: A Routine Move or Something More? The transfer of 1,000 ETH ($2.47 million) by the Ethereum Foundation , as reported by Lookonchain, is a transaction that warrants attention primarily because of the entity involved. While the specific reason for this move remains undisclosed, it likely falls under the umbrella of the Foundation’s ongoing efforts to support the Ethereum ecosystem , whether through grants, operational funding, or treasury management. In the grand scheme of the vast crypto market and the daily volume of ETH traded, this single transfer is unlikely to have a significant, lasting impact on the ETH price . However, it serves as a valuable reminder of the transparency offered by blockchain technology and the importance of monitoring key participants in the space. For enthusiasts and investors, observing these movements, coupled with official announcements and a solid understanding of the Foundation’s role, provides a clearer picture of the health and activity within the Ethereum ecosystem . While the specific destination wallet’s purpose remains unknown, the transaction itself underscores the continuous work being done behind the scenes to build, maintain, and advance Ethereum.

Key Takeaways: Brian Daly’s appointment signals a more industry-savvy approach to fund and crypto regulation. Kurt Hohl returns to the SEC with a focus on strengthening financial reporting standards. The new leadership shift under Chairman Paul Atkins is seen as a positive for digital asset innovation. Brian T. Daly will take over as Director of the Division of Investment Management on July 8, while Kurt Hohl will assume the role of Chief Accountant on July 7. The new appointments come after crypto-friendly Paul Atkins was sworn in as Chairman of the SEC in April, marking a leadership shift that is being welcomed by the digital asset industry. SEC’s Brian Daly Brings Decades of Fund Advisory Experience to Top Role Daly, a seasoned figure in the investment management legal sphere, brings decades of experience advising hedge funds, asset managers, and private investment firms. His background includes senior roles at Akin Gump and Schulte Roth & Zabel, as well as in-house compliance leadership at top-tier funds like Millennium Partners and Raptor Capital. Daly’s appointment signals a potential shift toward rulemaking that is more attuned to industry dynamics, including evolving digital asset strategies within traditional fund structures. “Brian has deep familiarity with all levels of the investment management industry,” said Atkins. Daly added that he is eager to help tailor regulation “within statutory authority” while maintaining strong compliance expectations for advisers and fund managers. His track record suggests a regulatory approach grounded in legal precision and institutional pragmatism, qualities likely to influence how crypto-related fund products, like spot ETH or BTC ETFs, are evaluated moving forward. Alongside Daly, the return of Kurt Hohl as Chief Accountant brings added weight to the SEC’s oversight capabilities. It's personnel day at the SEC. – Jamie Selway has officially been named T&M director. – Akin Gump partner Brian Daly has been picked to lead the agency's Investment Management division. – Kurt Hohl is joining the agency as chief accountant. https://t.co/wu7RQLEAWl — Declan Harty (@declanharty) June 13, 2025 With nearly four decades of auditing experience, including a lengthy tenure as a partner at Ernst & Young, Hohl’s focus will be on strengthening accounting standards and transparency, key issues as more crypto firms seek to go public or comply with U.S. disclosure laws. Hohl previously served at the SEC in the 1990s, where he authored the foundational Financial Reporting Manual. His return signals a renewed focus on rigorous reporting and clarity in financial statements, especially relevant for crypto-native companies navigating IPOs or stablecoin disclosures. “At a time when capital markets are evolving rapidly, these appointments position the SEC to respond more effectively to both innovation and investor protection,” Atkins said. SEC Drops Biden-Era Lawsuits Under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC has already withdrawn or delayed several prominent cases against crypto firms. The agency dropped its lawsuits against Coinbase and Cumberland DRW earlier this year, and a separate investigation into Uniswap Labs closed in February without enforcement action. Last week, the agency also closed its investigation into CyberKongz , a prominent Ethereum-based NFT and gaming project, with no enforcement action taken. More recently, the SEC announced it would not pursue further legal action against Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, the founder of Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX.

Yet, the sheer volume of new projects entering the market demands a sharp, discerning eye. How does one effectively cut through the noise to identify truly promising ventures that stand apart from fleeting hype or, worse, potential pitfalls? As June 2025 unfolds, understanding the subtle yet critical signals that underpin a legitimate and potentially successful crypto presale becomes paramount. This investigative piece will explore five key indicators that seasoned investors and market analysts meticulously scrutinize, offering a framework for navigating this high-stakes landscape. Investor's Compass – Key Indicators in Presale Evaluation 1. Blueprint – Vision and Innovation A truly compelling presale project extends beyond mere tokenization. It presents a clear, innovative vision addressing a tangible problem or introducing a novel solution within the blockchain ecosystem. Is the project merely a derivative, or does it genuinely aspire to carve out new territory, offering unique utility or disrupting existing paradigms? Scrutinize the whitepaper and roadmap for originality, technical depth, and a coherent strategy that demonstrates a clear understanding of market needs and future trends. Vague promises or overly ambitious, unsubstantiated claims should raise immediate flags. 2. Architects – Team Credibility and Transparency Behind every successful crypto project lies a capable and trustworthy team. What is the background of the developers, advisors, and core contributors? Are their identities public, and do they possess relevant experience in blockchain, finance, or the specific industry they aim to disrupt? Transparency extends to how the team communicates, manages funds, and addresses community concerns. A lack of identifiable team members, vague credentials, or a history of unfulfilled promises are significant red flags that demand caution. 3. Economic Engine – Robust Tokenomics The economic framework governing a token's supply, distribution, and utility—known as tokenomics—is a crucial indicator of long-term viability. Is the token distribution fair and transparent, avoiding excessive allocation to private investors or the team that could lead to large sell-offs? Does the token have clear utility within its ecosystem, beyond mere speculation? Look for mechanisms that encourage holding, such as staking, burning, or revenue sharing, which can foster sustainable demand. Ambiguous tokenomics, excessive supply, or a lack of clear use cases often signal a shaky foundation. 4. Collective Force – Community and Ecosystem Momentum A vibrant and engaged community is often the lifeblood of a decentralized project. How active and authentic are the project's social channels? Does the team actively engage with its community, addressing questions and feedback? Beyond social media, examine the broader ecosystem development. Are there partnerships forming? Is there tangible progress in building the platform or product? A strong community and observable development milestones suggest a project with momentum and commitment, while silence or superficial engagement can indicate stagnation. 5. Guardians – Security and Audit Verification In an industry frequently targeted by exploits, the security posture of a project is non-negotiable. Has the project undergone independent security audits by reputable firms? Are smart contracts open-source and verifiable? What measures are in place to protect user funds and data? A project that prioritizes security and openly shares audit reports demonstrates a commitment to safeguarding its ecosystem. Conversely, a lack of transparency regarding audits or an unwillingness to disclose security measures are significant warning signs. Neo Pepe – Challenging Conventional Wisdom with Decentralized Conviction In the context of these critical signals, how does Neo Pepe measure up, and does it confidently challenge the conventional wisdom? Neo Pepe presents itself not merely as a meme coin but as ""DeFi in disguise,"" and its approach directly addresses many of the signals outlined above, albeit with a unique, community-centric philosophy. Vision – Beyond the Meme Neo Pepe's core innovation lies in merging deep meme lore with fully decentralized DeFi governance. Its mission centers on decentralization, community governance, and long-term sustainability. This isn't just about fun; it's about giving real control to the community over the treasury, tokenomics, and future direction. The vision is clear, a community-driven movement where every decision reflects the will of its holders, aiming to be one of the few truly decentralized projects from inception. Could this be one of the hottest presales of June 2025 ? Team – A Trustless Architecture Regarding team credibility and transparency, Neo Pepe boldly challenges the traditional notion of a central ""team"" post-deployment. From day one, all governance is decentralized, with no team overrides and no shortcuts. Once the system is live, even the original developers cannot unilaterally change or control it. This extreme decentralization is a fundamental aspect of its security and transparency. While this might seem counterintuitive to a fixed team, it speaks to an ultimate form of trustlessness, placing control entirely in the hands of token holders. Transparency is built-in, every proposal, vote, and execution step is visible on-chain. Tokenomics – Community-Controlled Economy For robust tokenomics, Neo Pepe offers clarity. A fixed and immutable total supply of 1,000,000,000 $NEOP tokens ensures predictability, scarcity, and long-term sustainability. The token distribution at launch is transparent, with 45% going to presale participants and allocations for liquidity, marketing, and ecosystem incentives. Furthermore, $NEOP has clear utility including voting on DAO proposals, submitting protocol upgrades, paying protocol-level fees, and soon influencing the ""Meme Matrix"". The project also implements a dynamic default 2.5% transaction fee on Uniswap trades (adjustable up to 5% via governance) which is sent directly to the community treasury, reinforcing its self-sustaining ecosystem model. This robust governance makes Neo Pepe a best presale opportunity for those seeking genuine decentralization. Community – Empowered and Engaged Regarding community engagement and ecosystem momentum, Neo Pepe is inherently community-driven. Governance is achieved via on-chain proposals and votes. This focus on collective ownership and decision-making ensures the community is not just engaged but truly empowered. Crypto's Future Belongs to Neo Pepe—Claim Yours Now Neo Pepe stands at the forefront of the digital finance revolution, empowering users to reclaim control from traditional financial systems. With its dynamic auto-liquidity mechanism, community-driven governance, and unmatched commitment to decentralization, Neo Pepe positions itself as the clear leader of tomorrow’s crypto landscape. Analysts are already recognizing this project as a standout among emerging crypto gems . Don't just witness history unfold—actively shape it by securing your Neo Pepe tokens today and solidifying your stake in the future of crypto.

What could possibly go wrong?",https://crypto.news/8-2-million-company-to-invest-500-million-in-crypto/,"Nasdaq-traded company from Austin, Texas, Interactive Strength, made headlines by betting big on AI tokens. It announced setting up a crypto treasury and investing $500 million in Fetch AI token (FET). The problem is that the company is far from being well, the token is far from its winter peak, and the $500 million claim is questionable. Table of Contents New huge corporate treasury? Interactive Strength’s stock TRNR is down The FET token is down A $500 million investment is not guaranteed New huge corporate treasury? More and more public companies are following MicroStrategy’s and Metaplanet’s suit and allocating millions of dollars in cryptocurrency. While most of them view Bitcoin as a viable strategy, a rare few enterprises prefer to dominate the altcoin niche. Interactive Strength, a manufacturer of fancy fitness equipment under the CLMBR and FORME brands, announced on June 11, 2025, that it has entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to raise $500 million to be spent exclusively on $FET tokens, released by Fetch.ai . The sponsors are the private equity firm ATW Partners and DWF Labs, a crypto market maker and web3 investor company. Allegedly, they already delivered $55 million.

The CEO of Interactive Strength, Trent Ward, says: “Fetch.ai is the market leader at the intersection of the two most important technology trends today: artificial intelligence and crypto. We believe our strategy to acquire a significant number of $FET tokens could dramatically accelerate our mission to create significant long-term value for TRNR shareholders.” Fetch AI is a semi-decentralized ecosystem for deploying AI agents. It was founded in the UK in 2019. Fetch’s LLM is designed to work across various industries and execute real-world tasks, such as finding a parking lot or booking goods, in addition to providing answers to requests like other AI agents. Together with Fetch, Interactive Strength will collaborate on creating an AI-based platform for personal training programs. The FET mainnet is built on the Cosmos blockchain. Crypto treasury announcement finds Interactive Strength amidst two pending acquisitions. The company is going to acquire Sportstech and Wattbike. The crypto treasury will be managed via BitGo. The news has been met extremely positively on crypto Twitter, although the FET token’s rally was too short. $FET about to detonate $500M market buy from a NASDAQ co isn’t just bullish it’s historic Chart already coiled now it’s got rocket fuel CT’s gonna chase this 3x too late strap in — Alex RT₿ (@rutradebtc) June 11, 2025 Interactive Strength’s stock TRNR is down Despite the narrative surrounding the pending acquisition of two other companies and the pioneering of AI token treasuries, Interactive Strength faces financial challenges that contrast with the company’s image as a champion. Interactive Strength’s stock, TRNR, hit the market in 2023. The price has been extremely volatile in April and May. It was going from $26,000 to $13,000 and back within mere weeks. However, after peaking at over $28,300 on May 15, 2023, the stock price began to go down. By the end of the year, it had reached around $3,000 and continued to decline in the following months. As of June 12, 2025, the TRNR price is fluctuating below $1 per stock. The Trading View chart displays the all-time TRNR price change as down 100%. The company’s market capitalization is $8.29 million, while its debt stands at $11.25 million. The reported total loss of Interactive Strength in 2024 amounted to over $34.85 million, which is not as bad as the $51.6 million loss in 2023. Some believe that betting big on the crypto treasury is not an elaborate strategy but rather a desperate attempt by the company to pull itself out of the shifting sands. Only time tells if it’s true. The FET token is down While Fetch is a long-standing, evolving company, the FET token’s market performance in the last 12 months leaves little room for optimism. The price peaked in March 2024 at $3.47, and now it’s down 78%. The overall crypto rally that followed Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. election helped FET enjoy another hike in December 2024; however, the price is now fluctuating between 70 and 80 cents. FET is down 9% and Interactive Strength is a 8M market cap company. Do they even have 500M? — GM (@language_birds) June 12, 2025 Even the news of the potential $500 million investment didn’t significantly change the situation. Investing in a token that has been in a downtrend for six consecutive months may seem a counterintuitive move. Fetch AI itself is trying to play it around on Twitter by saying “utility over speculation.” Utility over speculation. Interactive Strength is allocating up to $500M to purchase $FET as a core component of their AI-powered fitness roadmap. This is what real-world AI adoption looks like. https://t.co/XyaZhUTVxm — Fetch.ai (@Fetch_ai) June 12, 2025 A $500 million investment is not guaranteed Steven Ehrlich of the Unchain podcast doubts that $500 million isn’t just smoke and mirrors. In his article, Ehrlich outlines a clause in the deal between the sponsors of the treasury and Interactive Strength that reveals the structure of the agreement is rather a $55,555,555 upfront investment and a possible $444 million extension, which is not guaranteed. Generally, we can’t state that a $55 million investment isn’t viable for Interactive Strength or Fetch AI. However, we should be aware that there is something under the hood of the bullish headlines about the Nasdaq-traded company investing $500 million to set up the largest AI treasury in the world. As of press time, the news about the treasury had not dramatically changed the market performance of FET and TRNR.

In 2025, memes have become money, and meme coins are no longer just a joke—they’re a new financial culture. With viral narratives, strong communities, and explosive price actions, meme coins like Book of Meme, Turbo, Memecoin, Ponke, and Arctic Pablo Coin are dominating headlines and social feeds. If you’re looking for the top meme coins in June 2025, this is where the action is. Leading this new wave is Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), a project rapidly gaining traction through its innovative meme coin presale model and unique burn-based tokenomics. While Book of Meme builds lore and Turbo rides hype cycles, Arctic Pablo is cementing itself with real economic strategy and transparent, community-first growth. In a sea of memes, APC is the one blazing a trail with purpose—and serious profit potential. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin Burn Strategy Unleashed – Top Meme Coins in June 2025 Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t following the meme crowd—it’s redefining it. With a powerful token burn mechanism baked into its meme coin presale, APC is creating a supply crunch week after week. Unsold tokens during the presale are permanently removed from circulation, and those left afterward are also set to be incinerated. This ongoing deflation strategy ensures growing scarcity, which increases value for early holders. All burns are transparently recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), giving investors confidence in every transaction. Arctic Pablo’s approach isn’t just about hype—it’s about long-term sustainability, real asset appreciation, and giving holders an edge in the meme coin wars. But the numbers are what really light up the screen. The presale is now roaring through Stage 27 (Blizzard Borough) at just $0.0003 per token. With over $2.75 million already raised, Arctic Pablo Coin is proving it’s not just trending—it’s surging. The listing price? A staggering $0.008. A $5,000 buy today would net you 16,666,650 tokens. At listing, that could be worth $133,333. That’s a projected ROI of 2,566.66%. Arctic Pablo Coin is more than a meme—it’s a moonshot. With each stage, the price rises, and the window to claim this opportunity narrows. For anyone looking to strike gold in the top meme coins in June 2025 , APC is the name to watch. 2. Book of Meme: Where Lore Becomes Liquidity Book of Meme is carving out a space where meme culture intersects with crypto storytelling. This project has created a decentralized “book” of internet lore, blending NFTs, memes, and tokenized history into a compelling ecosystem. It’s as much a digital archive as it is an investment vehicle. With chapters released as NFT drops and active participation rewarded in tokens, Book of Meme taps into nostalgia, digital art, and interactive investing. The appeal lies in its community-driven storytelling model, turning viral moments into tradable assets. That’s why Book of Meme made it to this list. 3. Turbo: AI-Generated, Investor-Endorsed Turbo’s origin is one of the most unique in crypto—it was created by an AI model (GPT-4) and then crowdsourced for funding. Its launch story alone gave it a massive boost of attention, but it’s the ongoing community and creative branding that have kept it in the spotlight. Turbo doesn’t promise revolution—it offers rapid memes, constant motion, and just enough volatility to keep investors coming back for more. With consistently high volume and meme-fueled momentum, Turbo continues to capture the attention of traders looking for the next viral pump. That’s why Turbo made it to this list. 4. Memecoin: The Meta Meme Project Memecoin is both a joke and a commentary on the space itself—calling itself what it is. This brutally honest branding tactic has actually made it one of the most ironically loved tokens in the meme coin ecosystem. Its simplicity is its genius, backed by well-timed exchange listings and tongue-in-cheek community events. Memecoin proves that in crypto, self-awareness can be a marketing superpower. In 2025, the project is expanding into NFTs and decentralized voting features, giving real utility to a coin that began as pure meme. That’s why Memecoin made it to this list. 5. Ponke: Mischief with Momentum Ponke thrives on unpredictability. Branded as the mischievous meme coin, it leans into chaos, humor, and irony to fuel its market presence. While many projects play safe, Ponke plays wild—dropping surprise updates, meme contests, and unpredictable mechanics that keep traders entertained and engaged. But underneath the fun lies smart contract integrity and community loyalty that rivals more serious projects. This fusion of unpredictability and trust is rare in the meme space, making Ponke one of the most exciting meme coins this summer. That’s why Ponke made it to this list. Verdict: Arctic Pablo Coin Rises to the Top As meme coins continue evolving from pure jokes to powerful investment vehicles, 2025 presents a lineup that blends cultural savvy with economic potential. From lore-driven Book of Meme to AI-born Turbo, there’s no shortage of creativity in the market. But Arctic Pablo Coin rises above with its real-world mechanics—staking via burn, verifiable on-chain scarcity, and a presale with jaw-dropping ROI. For those seeking the top meme coins in June 2025, this meme coin presale is more than an opportunity—it’s a movement. Based on the latest research, the top meme coins in June 2025 are Arctic Pablo Coin, Book of Meme, Turbo, Memecoin, and Ponke. Arctic Pablo Coin leads the pack with unmatched value potential, community incentives, and one of the most explosive meme coin presales in recent history. With its burn model and rapid presale growth, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a next-gen investment vehicle. If you’re hunting for the top meme coins in June 2025, now is the time to act. This meme coin presale is proving to be one of the top meme coins in June 2025, and smart investors are already lining up. Don’t get left behind—Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the top meme coins in June 2025 and the hottest meme coin presale you’ll see this cycle.

How much can I earn if I invest in APC during the presale?

Here is All the Data,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/gold-and-silver-gained-value-while-risky-assets-including-crypto-market-dropped-after-israel-attacked-iran-here-is-all-the-data/,"Cryptocurrency markets fell sharply after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear and missile infrastructure, sparking a broader sell-off in global risk assets. Crypto Markets Fall as Geopolitical Tensions Rise as Israel Attacks Iran While Bitcoin remained stable despite the decline in the overall crypto sector, the SOL ETF lost about 10% of its value despite expectations. Bitcoin (BTC) lost 2.9% and traded around $102,664. In contrast, gold, considered a traditional safe haven, rose 1.3% and approached an all-time high of $3,445 per ounce. The Israeli attack, which reportedly targeted senior Iranian military officials, came shortly after the International Atomic Energy Agency accused Iran of violating limits on uranium enrichment. Iran retaliated by launching 100 suicide drones into Israeli territory. Although the US denied involvement, the attack rattled markets and sent stocks plunging worldwide. Market Impact Across Asset Classes The ripple effect has spread far beyond cryptocurrencies: Japan's Nikkei index fell 0.89%. Euro Stoxx 50 lost 1.37%. U.S. futures were broadly lower, with the E-mini Nasdaq-100 down 1.42%. Oil prices rose and settled after Brent crude gained more than 14%. Gold and silver gained, reflecting the risk aversion trend. In the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum (ETH) was more affected than Bitcoin and fell by 8.81% to $2,523. Solana ETF Momentum Overshadowed The SEC reportedly requested an update to the Solana ETF S-1 filing, causing a brief spike, according to Wintermute OTC trader Jake Ostrovskis. Bloomberg analysts rate the probability of approval by the end of the year at 90%. But the geopolitical shock quickly erased those gains. “Markets appear to be underexposed to SOL and related assets, which could create interesting opportunities once volatility subsides,” Ostrovskis said. Derivatives and the Liquidity Shake There was a significant easing in the derivatives markets: Total open interest (OI) fell from $55 billion to $49.3 billion. Binance alone lost $2.5 billion worth of OI overnight. Put/call ratios on Deribit have risen, indicating a defensive shift among investors (BTC: 1.28, ETH: 1.25) Funding rates turned negative and altcoins like DOT, LINK, and 1000SHIB showed sharp declines. Despite the sell-off, BTC leverage remains high, with $84 million of long-side open positions between $102,000 and $104,000 still at risk if downward pressure resumes. Spot ETF Flows Continue to Support Crypto As markets react to tensions in the Middle East, flows into crypto ETFs remain strong: BTC spot ETFs have seen inflows of $939 million since the beginning of the month. ETH spot ETFs recorded $811 million in inflows, including $112 million on June 12 alone, marking 19 consecutive days of positive flows. *This is not investment advice.

With network upgrades and growing DeFi and NFT activity, Solana appears technically and fundamentally poised for another rally. However, while Solana might offer a strong return, high-growth seekers are increasingly turning to Ozak AI — a rising star in AI-powered finance — currently priced at just $0.005. With real-world utility, advanced infrastructure, and a $1 target, Ozak AI offers a 300x upside that many believe could materialize faster than Solana’s $350 climb. Solana’s Bullish Continuation: Cup and Handle Pattern Solana’s chart currently shows a cup and handle pattern, a bullish continuation setup that often precedes strong price breakouts. This formation consists of a rounded ""cup"" — indicating a period of consolidation and accumulation — followed by a short, downward-sloping “handle,” where sellers take brief control before buyers regain momentum. The pattern is confirmed when the price breaks above the resistance level (the lip of the cup), often resulting in a powerful upward move. Solana’s current handle is nearing completion, suggesting a breakout could be imminent, potentially pushing SOL toward its bullish price targets. Key Resistance and Support Levels for Solana For Solana to successfully reach $350, it needs to conquer the following resistance levels: $210 – The neckline of the cup and immediate breakout point. $265 – A multi-month resistance zone from the last cycle peak. $350 – The macro target that aligns with bullish long-term projections. However, holding critical support levels is equally important for sustaining this bullish structure: $145 – The lower edge of the handle formation. $128 – A key demand zone where institutional buying previously emerged. $98 – A psychological and technical floor that must hold to prevent invalidation of the pattern. While Solana’s upside potential is attractive, it might take time and broader market confirmation. In contrast, Ozak AI’s early-stage valuation presents a faster track to exponential returns. Ozak AI: Real-World Utility With a 300x Potential Ozak AI stands out as a next-gen tech platform combining predictive AI, decentralized analytics, and real-time data solutions for finance. It is built to empower both individuals and enterprises with intelligent tools to make accurate market decisions. Core components of the Ozak AI ecosystem include: Ozak Stream Network (OSN) – Enables ultra-fast data processing with low latency. DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) – Ensures security and resilience through distributed computation and storage. Prediction Agents (PAs) – Customizable AI bots that generate insights tailored to specific trading strategies. Ozak Data Vaults – Decentralized and secure data storage for sensitive financial and analytical data. With over $1 million raised, and listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko , Ozak AI is becoming a serious player in the AI-blockchain convergence space. Why Ozak AI Could Hit $1 Sooner Than Solana Hits $350 While Solana has institutional support and proven scalability, its potential returns are limited compared to Ozak AI . A move from $0.005 to $1 represents a 300x gain — driven by real utility, early entry timing, and growing AI demand in the crypto market. As traders and investors begin to prioritize real-world value over hype, Ozak AI’s model of decentralized, intelligent finance may deliver breakout performance faster than expected. Solana’s cup and handle formation signals a bullish breakout toward $350, but Ozak AI’s 300x path to $1 looks not only more explosive — but also more imminent. For investors seeking massive upside with a solid foundation, Ozak AI may very well be the crypto gem of 2025.

History demonstrates that cryptocurrency has a remarkable power to transform ordinary investors into millionaires, as evidenced by the rise of Dogecoin believers riding the meme magic in 2021 and the emergence of Bitcoin billionaires in 2013. A new generation of tokens is now ready to take center stage. By 2030, which cryptocurrencies have the potential to expand in value by ten times, one hundred times, or even more? We have reduced it to three. One of them, too? It might become very popular this year. $LILPEPE – The Meme Coin With a Masterplan (The One to Watch Now) Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin. It’s a full-fledged Layer 2 blockchain built exclusively for meme culture. Designed to scale Ethereum not just in speed but in spirit, Little Pepe is rewriting the narrative on what meme tokens can do. While others promise utility “someday,” $LILPEPE delivers it on day one—with a fast, secure, ultra-low-fee Layer 2 chain that integrates meme culture directly into its DNA. But it’s not just about speed and smiles. Let’s break it down: What Is $LILPEPE? $LILPEPE is the native utility token of the Little Pepe ecosystem—a next-gen Layer 2 chain tailored for memes, creators, and meme-based assets. It blends: Meme culture with infrastructure-level utility Security at warp speed Finality faster than Elon tweets Zero tax DeFi — Because frogs don’t like friction And unlike other Layer 2s that simply support memes, $LILPEPE was born to meme. Tokenomics That Make Sense 10% Liquidity: Deep pools for smooth trading. No rug pulls—just meme pulls. 26.5% Presale: For the believers who saw the vision before it went viral. 30% Chain Reserves: Powering the L2 engine and future dev. 10% DEX Allocation: Ready for liftoff on Uniswap and top DEXs. 10% Marketing: Strategic, relentless, and sometimes even absurd marketing to saturate every feed. 13.5% Staking & Rewards: Because holding a meme with a soul should pay. 0% Tax: True financial freedom. Buy, sell, hop around, tax-free. Little Pepe Roadmap – From Womb to Moon PREGNANCY : Presale, big-name partnerships, hype overload. BIRTH : Top exchange listings, Uniswap debut, and a push to $1B market cap. GROWTH : Fastest meme chain ever, sniper bot-proof, top 100 CMC contender, Layer 2 built for kings. But what truly sets $LILPEPE apart is its meme-first chain infrastructure. We’re talking: A Layer 2 chain dedicated solely to memes A Meme Launchpad for creators and communities Sniper bot immunity – Little Pepe is the world’s first bot-proof meme chain The cheapest and fastest network in the entire crypto landscape And behind the scenes? A collective of anonymous crypto veterans—the same minds that helped launch and scale many of today’s top meme tokens—are backing and guiding the Little Pepe project. Their fingerprints are all over this roadmap, and the result is a token engineered for hype and longevity. At launch, $LILPEPE will list on two top-tier centralized exchanges (CEXs)—a strategic move to bring instant volume and visibility. And that’s just the beginning. The team already has plans in motion for listing on the world’s largest exchange. The groundwork is laid. The rocket is fueled. It’s just waiting on liftoff. If you missed DOGE in 2015 or SHIB in 2020, don’t miss $LILPEPE in 2025. Chainlink ($LINK) – The Data Oracle for the DeFi Future Chainlink has been DeFi’s unsung hero. As the leading decentralized oracle network, it provides critical real-world data to smart contracts across blockchains. But its time in the shadows is over. With the rise of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization and hybrid smart contracts, Chainlink is becoming the infrastructure layer powering tomorrow’s trillion-dollar use cases. Why Chainlink by 2030? Already partnered with SWIFT, Google, and top banks Dominates the oracle market share across DeFi Poised for explosive growth as tokenized assets go mainstream Chainlink could evolve into a trillion-dollar protocol as the backbone of blockchain data, and $LINK holders could see returns to match. Avalanche ($AVAX) – Scaling Web3 with Subnets Avalanche may have flown under the radar recently, but its vision for scalable, modular blockchain architecture is gaining traction, especially among institutions and gaming giants. Its Subnet technology allows customized chains to run in parallel, unlocking use cases that traditional blockchains struggle with. Why Avalanche by 2030? Unmatched speed and finality Growing partnerships in gaming, finance, and enterprise Positioned as a modular blockchain infrastructure for mass adoption If Web3 goes mainstream the way we expect, Avalanche could become the operating system that powers it. Conclusion The journey to becoming a crypto millionaire doesn’t start with hype—it begins with research and bold, early bets on projects with authentic narratives, strong communities, and forward-looking tech. By 2030, Chainlink and Avalanche could easily be among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. But if you’re looking for the meme coin to end all meme coins, and potentially the fastest way to life-changing gains this year, then $LILPEPE is the only frog you need to bet on.

Recent technical analysis suggests that XRP’s six-year consolidation period mirrors the pattern that led to its dramatic surge in 2017. Could this setup ignite another breakout? XRP Six Years of Compression: A Setup or a Stall? Since 2018, XRP price has traded within a compressed range, fluctuating between $0.20 and $0.60 for long periods. At the time of writing, XRP was priced at around $2.14. This prolonged stagnation has frustrated investors waiting for a decisive move. However, analysts on X argue that extended consolidation phases often precede explosive moves to the long-awaited $10 price. Amelie noted on May 25 that XRP’s chart setup closely mirrors its 2017 breakout pattern. In 2017, XRP skyrocketed from under $0.30 to above $3.30 within weeks, delivering one of crypto’s most dramatic rallies. The principle of “the longer the consolidation, the stronger the breakout” underpins this comparison. XRP’s current consolidation began around early 2018, following the broader crypto market’s correction from its 2017 highs. Unlike then, today’s environment features matured infrastructure, greater regulatory clarity, and expanding use cases for XRP . As noted in the U.S. Faster Payments Council’s 2025 report, Ripple’s partnerships with global financial institutions signal that XRP is not just riding technical patterns but also benefiting from real-world adoption. According to CoinShares’ recent fund flows report (May 20), XRP witnessed $37.2 million in outflows, ending an 80-week inflow streak. This shift in sentiment underscores how external factors, including legal decisions and regulatory actions, continue to impact XRP’s price dynamics . These outflows occurred against a backdrop of consolidation and building momentum, suggesting the market may be repositioning. Key Levels and Market Sentiment XRP’s trading volume jumped 18% over the past week, reflecting growing trader interest. Meanwhile, open interest in XRP futures contracts on major exchanges has risen to $1.5 billion, signaling that leveraged traders are preparing for a potential move. While the echoes of 2017 are undeniable, today’s market is far from identical. Regulatory pressures remain a wildcard, with Ripple’s partial victory against the SEC last year providing some relief but leaving uncertainties unresolved. XRP/USDT| Source: TradingView The broader macroeconomic environment, including U.S. interest rates and Bitcoin’s movements, will also influence XRP’s trajectory. For traders watching XRP, the key lies in whether it can break through its resistance levels and sustain upward momentum. As Amelie’s analysis suggests, the long wait might finally be nearing an inflection point, but traders must remain cautious given the complex interplay of technical, regulatory, and macro factors.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-13 15:48:29

Paul Chan, the Financial Secretary of Hong Kong, has announced that the region will issue its second policy statement on the development of Hong Kong digital assets later this month. This news, reported by China’s local news outlet Shanghai Securities News, signals Hong Kong’s continued commitment to building a robust framework for the future of finance. Understanding Hong Kong’s Digital Asset Strategy This upcoming statement builds upon the foundation laid by Hong Kong’s first digital asset policy statement, released in October 2022. That initial document was a landmark moment, clearly outlining the government’s stance and intentions regarding virtual assets. Key areas covered included: The regulatory approach for virtual asset exchanges, emphasizing investor protection and market integrity. Consideration and potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to virtual assets, opening doors for broader institutional and retail participation. A forward-looking perspective on Web3 and its potential integration into Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem. The first statement was widely seen as a pivot, moving Hong Kong from a more cautious stance to one actively seeking to embrace and regulate the virtual asset space, positioning itself as a competitive player globally. What to Expect from the Second Digital Asset Policy According to Mr. Chan, the second statement will delve into more specific and forward-looking themes. The primary focuses are expected to be: The combination of financial services and innovation: This suggests a deeper look at how digital assets and blockchain technology can integrate with traditional financial infrastructure and services. Think tokenization of real-world assets, blockchain-based settlement systems, and innovative FinTech solutions built on distributed ledger technology. Application scenarios of digital assets: This is a crucial area. The statement is likely to explore the practical uses and potential of various types of digital assets beyond just cryptocurrencies traded on exchanges. This could include discussions around stablecoins, security tokens, utility tokens, NFTs, and their roles in areas like payments, supply chain finance, digital identity, and more. This focus indicates that Hong Kong is moving beyond just regulating trading platforms to understanding and fostering the broader ecosystem and potential economic benefits of digital assets. Why is Hong Kong Embracing Virtual Assets? Hong Kong’s proactive approach to virtual assets Hong Kong is driven by several factors. As a major international financial center, the city recognizes the transformative potential of this technology and the need to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving global landscape. By providing regulatory clarity and support, Hong Kong aims to: Attract leading virtual asset businesses, startups, and talent from around the world. Foster innovation within its own financial sector. Create a safe and regulated environment for investors and users. Position itself as a bridge between the East and West in the digital asset space. The ambition is clear: to become a leading hub for digital asset development and innovation. Potential Impacts of Stronger Hong Kong Crypto Regulation The release of a second, more detailed policy statement on Hong Kong crypto regulation is likely to have several positive impacts: Increased Confidence: Clearer rules reduce uncertainty for businesses and investors, encouraging more participation and investment in the sector. Innovation Boost: By outlining acceptable application scenarios and integration points, the policy can guide developers and entrepreneurs towards building compliant and impactful solutions. Enhanced Investor Protection: Continued focus on regulation helps build safeguards against fraud and market manipulation. Economic Growth: Attracting digital asset companies can lead to job creation, increased tax revenues, and overall economic stimulation. However, challenges remain. Regulators must strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and managing risks. The pace of technological change in digital assets is rapid, requiring agile and adaptable regulatory frameworks. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors For businesses operating or looking to operate in the digital asset space, this second policy statement will be essential reading. It will likely provide insights into specific areas the government is encouraging or planning to regulate further. Staying informed and engaging with the evolving regulatory landscape will be crucial for compliance and strategic planning. Investors should also pay close attention. The policy could signal new opportunities for regulated investment products or highlight areas of risk the government is focused on mitigating. Conclusion: Hong Kong’s Bold Step Forward The upcoming release of Hong Kong’s second policy statement on Hong Kong digital assets is a significant event. It underscores the city’s determination to not just participate in, but lead, the global digital asset revolution. By focusing on the practical integration with financial services and exploring diverse application scenarios, Hong Kong is setting the stage for a future where digital assets play a vital role in its economy. This continued regulatory clarity and proactive approach are key indicators of Hong Kong’s ambition to solidify its position as a premier international financial and innovation hub in the digital age.

45941248,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70899,1749829969,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,270 Million Cardano (ADA) in a Week. Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/270-million-cardano-ada-in-a-week-heres-what-happened/,"Cardano (ADA) is once again in the spotlight, but not for a new upgrade or partnership. This time, it’s about a massive shift in whale behavior. According to on-chain analyst Ali, whales have dumped over 270 million ADA in the past week—a development that has triggered fresh concerns across the market. As of report time, ADA is trading at $0.6364, reflecting a sharp 7.29% drop in the last 24 hours. This significant selloff, paired with the price dip, has led many to question whether this is a sign of deeper market weakness or just strategic repositioning by large holders. Whale Activity Raises Red Flags Ali’s analysis points to aggressive selling from wallets holding between 100,000 and 10 million ADA. This category of investors, often referred to as “whales,” is known for shaping market trends due to the sheer size of their holdings. Their decisions are rarely emotional—they’re typically calculated moves based on insider insights, broader macro analysis, or future expectations. Whales have sold over 270 million #Cardano $ADA in the past week! pic.twitter.com/SKd94mj99J — Ali (@ali_charts) June 13, 2025 The liquidation of over 270 million ADA in just seven days suggests a shift in sentiment among major players. Whether these whales are preparing for a deeper market pullback or reallocating capital to other assets remains unclear. What’s certain, however, is that their actions are weighing heavily on short-term price performance. Market Reacts to Selling Pressure The whale exodus has coincided with notable downward pressure on ADA’s price . The asset is now struggling to hold support above $0.63. Earlier this month, Cardano had shown signs of building upward momentum, but the current downturn has disrupted that narrative. This kind of sharp, large-volume selling often rattles retail investors, potentially setting off a chain reaction of panic-driven exits. If sentiment doesn’t recover quickly, ADA could retest lower support levels, possibly falling back into the $0.58–$0.60 range. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cardano Fundamentals Remain Strong Despite the bearish short-term outlook, Cardano’s fundamentals remain solid. The network continues to see steady developer activity, with more than 1,500 projects currently building on its blockchain. Upgrades, including enhancements through Hydra for scaling and Voltaire, boost long-term network utility. The project’s peer-reviewed development model, while slower than others, has earned it credibility for security and academic rigor. These fundamentals are not shaken by temporary market volatility, but they don’t always shield the price from short-term turbulence either. Strategy or Sentiment? This whale-driven selloff may be part of a strategic rotation. Some analysts believe large holders may be moving capital into stablecoins, Bitcoin, or other trending altcoins, especially amid rising uncertainty in the broader crypto space. Others suggest it may simply be profit-taking following minor rallies in recent weeks. Whatever the reason, such a large-scale selloff is a signal that shouldn’t be ignored. It adds pressure on the market and raises the stakes for ADA in the days ahead. Ali’s report of over 270 million ADA sold by whales has cast a shadow over Cardano’s near-term outlook. With a 7.29% daily drop and ADA trading at $0.6364, market sentiment has shifted into caution mode. Still, Cardano’s long-term fundamentals remain intact. Whether this is a passing storm or the start of a broader trend will depend on how the market—and the whales—move next.

The token had briefly recovered from a sharp overnight crash—bouncing 9.5% from $6.82 to over $8.40—but has since slipped again as risk sentiment deteriorated. In a Truth Social post early Friday, Trump issued his most direct warning yet to Iran, stating, “Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left.” He claimed to have given Iran multiple chances to negotiate, but said their failure to act would result in further “death and destruction.” The message concluded with a stark ultimatum: either Iran reaches an agreement, or it risks being wiped out entirely. The post has amplified investor anxiety across risk markets, including crypto. While UNI had shown strong recovery behavior earlier in the day, the renewed threat of broader Middle East escalation appears to have capped upside momentum. The token is now consolidating near $7.38, with traders watching to see if support near $7.26 can hold under intensifying geopolitical pressure. Technical Analysis Highlights UNI crashed 12.5% from $7.90 to $6.82 on heavy volume (8.48M) before recovering 9.5%. Price action formed a V-shaped reversal, rebounding from $7.21 to $7.35. Volume peaked between 13:31–13:44 UTC as price broke $7.30 resistance. Support formed at $7.26 with multiple successful retests. UNI has since declined to $7.3864, with current resistance near $7.50 and pressure building.

45941814,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=746149,1749830226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45941814.jpeg,OPEC increases output to stabilize market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/the-global-economy-new-risk-iranian-oil-off/,"The global oil market is back in chaos after Israel launched military strikes against Iran on Friday. The move pushed crude oil prices up 8% to $74 a barrel in a matter of hours, shaking up inflation forecasts and triggering panic over future supply. The strike now threatens two critical lifelines: Iran’s own daily crude exports and the Strait of Hormuz, one of the most vital chokepoints for oil tankers in the world. Iran had already been seeing drops in its oil shipments before the attack. In May, the country exported 1.7 million barrels a day, based on figures shared by Bernstein, a brokerage. That’s a small slice—less than 2% of total global oil consumption—but in today’s energy market, even small cuts matter. With rising tensions, those exports are expected to dip further, and there’s no timeline for how long this disruption could last. OPEC increases output to stabilize the market The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), where Iran is a founding member, has already moved to raise production. By the end of June, the group plans to push out an additional 960,000 barrels per day, reversing past cuts. Analysts tracking the cartel expect that to rise further to 2.2 million barrels daily, but that depends on how fast they act and how deep the damage to Iran’s export system goes. Even with that extra oil coming, the current supply balance is fragile. If Iran’s barrels disappear faster than OPEC can fill the gap, prices could shoot higher. Before the attacks, oil was already hovering between $75 and $80 per barrel depending on the month. Now, traders are bracing for those numbers to go out the window. But the much bigger risk lies offshore, not in Iran’s pipelines. The Strait of Hormuz, a narrow sea corridor between Iran and Oman, carries nearly a fifth of all oil traded globally. It’s also a major path for Qatar’s liquefied natural gas exports. If Iran retaliates by disrupting shipping lanes or attacking vessels, the impact would go far beyond Iran’s own oil. JPMorgan analysts warned that if tankers can’t pass through, oil could blow past $130 per barrel. If it hits $120, it could instantly add 1.7 percentage points to US inflation, which is already at 2.4% year-on-year through the end of May. That would hit consumers directly, especially in America, where falling gas prices have helped slow inflation. Trump watches oil closely Despite the risk, Iran has never actually blocked the Strait of Hormuz, though it has threatened to do so many times. The actual logistics of closing the channel would be difficult. But with President Donald Trump now back in the White House, oil prices have once again become a major focus for US foreign policy. Israel is expected to avoid hitting Iran’s oil infrastructure for now, likely out of concern over how Trump would react to another oil shock. Economic growth expectations are already slipping. Higher oil prices could stall recovery plans and force central banks to hold off on any interest rate cuts. That would make borrowing more expensive and slow down job creation. The ripple effect is already being felt, and it’s barely started. A planned US-Iran nuclear negotiation scheduled for Sunday in Oman has already collapsed. Iranian state media confirmed they won’t attend, setting the stage for more escalations. Maksad said that without Iran returning to talks, “Israel will have to take successive rounds of action to take out what’s left of Iran’s nuclear program.” Just one day before the strikes, the IAEA Board of Governors, the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog, formally declared Iran in violation of its nuclear safeguards for the first time in nearly 20 years. That ruling was expected to raise tensions. Instead, it lit the fuse. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, posted a response to the Israeli strikes on X, threatening a violent reaction. “That [Zionist] regime should anticipate a severe punishment,” he wrote, adding that Iran’s Armed Forces “won’t let them go unpunished.” In a second post, Khamenei said, “Several commanders and scientists have been martyred” but promised that their replacements would continue operations without delay.

While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to hover near familiar zones, a new challenger has entered the ring with serious momentum and disruptive potential. That challenger is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — a fresh Ethereum-based meme coin currently selling for under $0.10, and by all accounts, it’s turning heads across the crypto world. This June, with meme season revving up again and crypto sentiment roaring back to bullish, a clear divide is forming: between legacy meme coins that have already reached their highs and new contenders that could 50x, 100x, or more from current levels. LILPEPE fits squarely into the latter category. If there’s one meme coin getting the green light from analysts and even AI, it’s this one. Why the Shift Away From DOGE and SHIB? The Shiba Inu price experienced a 22% decline and is currently trading at $0.00001324. SHIB’s waning movement further aligns with a nearly 100% decline in its intraday burn rate. DOGE price followed, plunging 21% to $0.2 intraday. Let’s face it — at this point, most of the upside may already be priced in. It’s not 2021 anymore, and DOGE hasn’t been able to reclaim its previous all-time highs despite multiple memecoin rallies since. SHIB continues to face tough resistance, and despite a loyal community, the price remains stagnant while new projects steal the spotlight. Enter LILPEPE — the underdog with bite. It’s priced at just $0.0015 during presale and has already raised $200,000 in its first 24 hours, showcasing the kind of community power and speculative excitement usually reserved for breakout tokens. What Makes Little Pepe Different? Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on branding and hype, LILPEPE comes to the scene with infrastructure and intention. It isn’t just a coin; it’s a meme-focused ecosystem with a dedicated Layer 2 blockchain that will be the fastest, cheapest, and most bot-resistant chain built exclusively for meme tokens. That’s right — sniper bots won’t work on this chain, meaning fair launches for future meme coins and a healthy, organic community-driven space. The platform will also feature a Meme Launchpad, offering creators and developers a space to bring their meme token ideas to life without the usual gas fees and network congestion associated with Ethereum. This type of utility is unprecedented in the meme coin sector, and it shows the developers behind LILPEPE aren’t just riding the meme wave — they’re building an entirely new ocean for it. Backed by Anonymous Meme Experts One of the more intriguing parts of the LILPEPE story is the team behind it. While anonymous (as is tradition in meme land), several insiders have confirmed that the project is backed by veterans who helped drive the success of some of the most iconic meme coins in history. These individuals understand what it takes to create viral, community-powered crypto projects—and now, their energy is behind LILPEPE. From branding to tokenomics to timing, the rollout has been surgical. The presale is still live, but with wallet count surging and social media buzz growing exponentially, demand will soon begin to outpace supply. Listing Plans and Future Outlook According to the team, LILPEPE is already locked in for listings on two top centralized exchanges (CEXs) immediately following the presale. That’s more than most meme coins can say before launch. Furthermore, plans are already underway to list the token on the world's largest exchange — a move that could significantly increase visibility and trading volume once confirmed. With a price well below $0.10, the early risk-reward profile is highly compelling. Unlike DOGE and SHIB, which require substantial capital to generate returns at this point, LILPEPE offers everyday investors a chance at life-changing upside, just like early PEPE or DOGE holders once enjoyed. Conclusion In a market driven by narratives, speed, and social momentum, Little Pepe is writing a new story for meme coins — and it’s happening fast. While DOGE and SHIB may continue to have their moments, the largest gains are rarely found in yesterday’s champions. This June, the clearest meme coin opportunity isn't in the top 10 — it’s in the presale phase of a hungry newcomer. With its low entry price, growing community, disruptive Layer 2 tech, and serious industry backing, LILPEPE is the coin to watch — and according to ChatGPT, the one to buy before it’s too late.

45941614,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107352,1749830289,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Solana’s $400 Price Target Gets Bold Confirmation as Analyst Predicts “VIOLENT” Breakout Despite 60% Drop,https://zycrypto.com/solanas-400-price-target-gets-bold-confirmation-as-analyst-predicts-violent-breakout-despite-60-drop/,"Major cryptocurrency Solana is looking to shrug off a recent price pullback to continue its bullish price activity. The 6th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is among the most widely used digital currencies, with significant use cases emerging in recent years. The Solana ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) is slowly inching towards a $10 billion valuation, making it the center of attention for crypto investors. However, despite being one of the most developed and used cryptocurrency networks, SOL is struggling to translate this impressive on-chain performance into price gains. It set a new All Time High (ATH) of around $294 in December, but that came and went, with SOL reporting more than 60% losses in the ensuing months. Currently trading at $147, the digital currency is somewhat in the middle of things, prompting investors to scratch their heads regarding the coin’s future. SOL to Rise to $400? However, a popular crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), @AltcoinGordon, has tweeted that SOL is looking to post a massive price breakout after Bitcoin posted a new ATH earlier this week. He stated: “The next leg up for $SOL is going to be VIOLENT. My blue lines NEVER fail. Bitcoin just made an ATH, but that is NOTHING compared to what is coming for Solana. Do you understand?” SOL Recent Price Action Solana is known as the “blockchain that never sleeps,” but its recent price performance is one to forget, especially in a bullish setup. Here is the graph from the last 30 days: The last four weeks or so have been a story of a dogged price performance. The cryptocurrency was flat for a large part of May, and it had just started to appreciate a week ago, and got close to $190. However, even that bullish action didn’t last long, and the bears forced it back below $180. This happened even as Bitcoin and several altcoins posted new ATHs amid a recent surge in the general altcoin market. SOL is still quite a distance away from its $295 ATH, and even then, it struggles to hold on to any small gains. SOL TVL Forecasts Better Times Ahead The TVL of the SOL’s ecosystem has reached a new high of $9.6 billion and is set to breach the $10 billion valuation in the near future. This important indicator and a string of on-chain analytics show that it is only a matter of time before SOL reignites its much-anticipated bull market.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-13 15:58:09

With volatility squeezed to its narrowest band of 2025, o3 Pro pegs $2.25 as the pivot between a vault toward $2.60 and a fall to $2.10 . Daily turnover still tops $4.53 billion , but sentiment splits down the middle as traders brace for the ruling. Israel’s air-strikes on Iran also sent Brent crude almost 9% higher, unsettling risk assets worldwide. The shock triggered over $1 billion in crypto liquidations and pulled XRP roughly 5% down to about $2.11, just above its $2.07–$2.15 support band. With daily ATR already near 1%, any further escalation could shove XRP cleanly through that floor—or sling it back toward the $2.26 EMA cluster—in a single, volatile burst. The following analysis was done using ChatGPT’s most advanced AI model, the new o3 Pro, and edited together and ‘humanized’ for readability. Overview: AI XRP Price Prediction and Analysis After opening the day closer to $2.19 , a retreat masks a far more intriguing setup beneath the surface. Market depth remains intact, yet key momentum gauges (namely an RSI just above 40 and a negative MACD crossover) suggest traders have throttled back on risk. Meanwhile, volatility indicators are flashing amber: as one TradingView readout notes, “the narrowing Bollinger envelope … warns of a possible volatility expansion” . Compression phases like this typically precede forceful directional moves, turning the next 90 days into a high-stakes window. The fundamental backdrop is equally charged. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has asserted that XRP could “capture 14 % of SWIFT’s volume in the next 5 years,” a claim arriving just days before the anticipated June 16 ruling in the long-running SEC case. Layer in the first-ever $500 million corporate XRP reserve , the launch of USDC and Ripple’s own forthcoming RLUSD stablecoin on the XRP Ledger, and a steady 111,000 active addresses per day, and the ledger suddenly looks busier (and potentially scarcer) than headline prices imply. With technicals coiling, on-chain participation climbing, and sentiment oscillating between cautious and exuberant, XRP’s immediate path hinges on which signal breaks first. Technical Pulse: XRP Price Forecast Hinges on Compressed Indicators The latest daily chart shows XRP wedged into the tightest Bollinger Band spread since February, implying that the market has settled into a holding pattern. Source: TradingView Momentum signals confirm the lull: the Relative Strength Index lingers near 41, a level that rarely sparks trend-defining moves, while the MACD histogram hovers just below zero after a bearish crossover. Traders are also watching a flat EMA cluster between the 50- and 100-day averages around $2.19–$2.22 —historically a zone where price rallies stall if volume fails to expand. RSI below 50 but above oversold keeps momentum neutral rather than outright bearish. MACD line sits beneath its signal line, hinting at latent downside pressure. Average True Range at 0.0204 points to intraday swings of barely 1%—an unusually quiet tape for XRP. Volume-weighted moving average (VWMA-20) turns marginally higher, suggesting selective accumulation even as classic EMAs flash “Sell.” A prolonged squeeze like this typically resolves in a sharp break; volatility gauges alone, however, cannot predict the direction. That job falls to the nearby price structure and order-flow signals. Key Support and Resistance Guide Ripple Volatility Outlook Technicians currently place first-line support at $2.20–$2.23 , just above the Classic Pivot S1 of $2.1327 . Beneath that band sits a broader demand zone stretching to $2.10 , an area that twice capped downside attempts in April. Upside, the initial barrier stands at $2.1521 —Classic Pivot R1—followed quickly by the recent swing‐high supply pocket at $2.33–$2.34 . A clean break above $2.24 would realign price with the Bollinger mid-band at $2.24 , opening room toward $2.60 should volume accompany the move. Failure to defend $2.20 risks a slide to the lower Bollinger band near $2.10 . The flattened EMA50/100 pair at $2.19–$2.22 acts as a pivot: daily closes on either side often dictate the next week’s trend. Low ATR implies that once price escapes this range, the first directional burst is likely to be swift, and amplified by traders front-running the SEC’s mid-June ruling. For now, XRP’s technical canvas paints a picture of potential energy: tightly coiled, evenly balanced, and primed to spring once a catalyst—be it legal clarity or an unexpected macro jolt—tips the scale. Liquidity & Market Depth: Can Bulls Fund the Next XRP Price Forecast Move? Deep Order Books and Capital Inflow A robust $125.92 billion market cap and a fully diluted valuation of $224 billion give XRP some of the deepest books outside Bitcoin and Ether. Source: CoinMarketCap The pair trades most actively on Binance’s spot market, where aggregated bids and asks routinely absorb eight-figure orders without visible slippage—a key buffer if Ripple volatility spikes after the SEC ruling. 24-hour turnover: $4.59 billion , translating to roughly 2% of circulating market cap and indicating healthy day-to-day liquidity. Seven-day turnover: $19.78 billion , evidence that capital has remained engaged even as prices drifted lower. Classic pivot calculations place the session’s volume-weighted point of control just above $2.21 , showing buyers remain active near short-term support. A rising Volume-Weighted Moving Average (VWMA-20) shows steady accumulation beneath the flat EMA cluster. Taken together, these figures suggest that large players can confidently scale positions, long or short, without fear of thin books distorting entries, a prerequisite for any meaningful XRP price forecast over the next quarter. Volume Patterns Show Tactical Accumulation While absolute volume has eased from late-May peaks, its composition has shifted toward spot rather than derivatives, a nuance that often precedes directional trend changes. Coupled with narrowing price ranges, the data implies traders are positioning quietly rather than chasing momentum. Spot markets now account for a growing share of total turnover, a sign that leverage is being dialed back ahead of the SEC decision. 24-hour volume remains well above the 90-day median, illustrating sustained interest despite muted price action. Liquidity nodes on depth charts cluster between $2.14 to $2.22 , suggesting any dip toward that band could be met with sizeable resting bids. Should volume spike in tandem with a close above $2.26 , historical analogues point to follow-through potential toward the mid-$2.60s. In short, the current blend of deep order books and selective spot accumulation provides the raw fuel for a breakout, yet without a volatility trigger, the market continues to tread water. The next sections will examine whether on-chain metrics and social sentiment can supply that missing spark. XRP’s On-Chain Activity: Real Utility or Just Talk? Daily Ledger Usage Points to Sticky Demand Even as Ripple volatility has cooled on price charts, network throughput remains vigorous. About 111,000 active addresses interact with the XRP Ledger each day, well above the 2024 weekly average, suggesting that traders and developers are not merely parking tokens but actively moving value and deploying apps. Active addresses hold steady despite the recent 4% price pullback, indicating user stickiness. Transaction clusters align with stablecoin minting events, hinting at growing DeFi experimentation. Persistent usage during sideways price action contrasts with many alt-chains, where activity often decays alongside volume. The consistency implies that underlying demand may be stronger than surface price action lets on, reducing the odds of a sudden liquidity vacuum if volatility spikes. Fresh Catalysts Could Tighten XRP’s Tradable Float Utility-driven flows are set to expand further. Singapore-based Trident Digital has announced a $500 million corporate XRP reserve , the first of its scale, while Flare’s integration commits $100 million in XRP to cross-chain smart-contract use. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! Singapore-based Trident Digital (NASDAQ: TDTH) plans to raise $500M to establish the world’s first large-scale corporate #XRP reserve! XRP WILL BE THE WORLD'S RESERVE CURRENCY! pic.twitter.com/kr5VwlqA6Y — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 12, 2025 At the same time, stablecoin competition on XRPL is heating up: USDC has gone live, and Ripple’s own RLUSD is preparing to launch. Large-scale reserve holdings indicate that institutions now treat XRP as a strategic treasury asset, not just a speculative trade. Flare’s deployment effectively locks tokens into smart-contract ecosystems, lowering circulating supply on exchanges. Every USDC or RLUSD transfer requires XRP for fees, embedding reflexive token demand into stablecoin growth. Combined, these initiatives could exert upward pressure on price by reducing the float just as macro-level catalysts, like a potential SEC ruling, arrive. Taken together, on-chain metrics paint a picture of genuine, expanding utility, suggesting that any forthcoming surge in XRP price forecasts will rest on more than hype alone. XRP Social Metrics: A Cautiously Bullish Ripple Volatility Gauge LunarCrush’s sentiment dashboards put hard numbers on XRP’s social mood, and the latest readout tilts only modestly positive. The token’s Galaxy Score of 65 sits just above the neutral midpoint, while an AltRank of 291 places it in the middle of the pack among tracked assets. Source: LunarCrush Even so, raw engagement remains formidable: 9.38 million interactions over 24 hours demonstrate an audience that rarely stays quiet when catalysts emerge. Galaxy Score > 50 indicates a mild bullish bias, but not the euphoric conditions that often precede sharp reversals. Mid-tier AltRank suggests XRP is neither the hottest trade nor an ignored laggard—ideal for a breakout if fresh news lands. Engagement volume supports liquidity: active social chatter tends to correlate with tighter spreads on major exchanges. Historical comparisons show that Galaxy Scores above 60, coupled with rising engagements, often precede multi-week rallies, a threshold XRP has not yet crossed. For traders, these numbers imply sentiment is constructive but far from frothy, leaving room for the XRP price forecast to pivot sharply once decisive news reshapes the narrative. Social Media Chatter: High-Stakes Storylines Drive Attention Outside aggregated scores, headlines and Twitter traffic reveal the storylines animating the community. In the past four hours alone, coverage has swung from bullish adoption talk to warnings of deepening bearish bets: “XRP To Capture 14% Of SWIFT’s Volume,” trumpets Bitcoinist, citing CEO Brad Garlinghouse just 34 minutes ago. BeInCrypto counters with “XRP Price Slips as Bears Tighten Grip and Short Bets Surge,” revealing trader caution three hours prior. FXStreet frames the macro picture: “Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP risk further decline amid softer volumes,” four hours back. Twitter amplifies the stakes: Good Morning Crypto flags a $500 million corporate XRP reserve , calling it “BREAKING” . Moon Lambo hails USDC’s launch on XRPL as “incredible news for all $XRP holders,” arguing it will lift total value locked and fee demand. Kraken Exchange stirs the “XRP army” with a watchful emoji, showing exchange-side interest in a potential volatility spike. Collectively, this blend of measured optimism and bearish hedging keeps sentiment balanced, fertile ground for a surprise move once the SEC’s ruling or another headline forces consensus one way or the other. Until then, Ripple volatility remains coiled not only on price charts but also in the social sphere, ready to unwind when conviction finally takes hold. Regulatory Wildcard: SEC Countdown and Its Ripple Effect The legal saga that has shadowed XRP since late 2020 is now on a five-day fuse. Court dockets list June 16 as the next—and potentially final—milestone in the SEC’s enforcement action against Ripple Labs. At stake is whether XRP will be deemed a security under U.S. law, a designation that could limit exchange listings and institutional access. BREAKING: $XRP attorney Bill Morgan says a we could see breakthrough in the Ripple vs. SEC battle within 9 days—as the SEC's 60-day window closes 6/16. Full resolution could be as early as June 13, 2025. This could be the moment the #XRPArmy have for. Bullish pic.twitter.com/WLVIC2Ydmx — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) June 7, 2025 Conversely, a favorable ruling would cement the token’s commodity-like status and pave the way for broader U.S. adoption. The decision lands just as corporate treasuries experiment with a half-billion-dollar XRP reserve and stablecoin issuers migrate onto the ledger, multiplying the impact of any legal clarity. Possible Verdict Paths and Market Repercussions Outright Win for Ripple XRP escapes the securities label, inviting major U.S. exchanges and brokerage apps to restore full trading pairs. Price action tends to accelerate on relief: a clean break above $2.26–$2.27 could target the mid-$2.60s, the next liquidity shelf. Positive precedent could spill over to other payment-focused altcoins, tightening spreads and boosting sector flows. Partial Victory / Settlement A negotiated middle ground may include a penalty without labeling ongoing sales as securities. Markets likely cheer limited retroactive risk, but upside could stall near the Bollinger mid-band at $2.14 until precise terms emerge. Should fines drain Ripple’s treasury less than feared, strategic buybacks or ecosystem grants could follow, supporting demand. SEC Prevails Security status forces delistings on U.S. venues; offshore liquidity dominates. Initial support at $2.15 may fail, exposing the broader demand zone down to $2.10 . Elevated legal uncertainty for comparable tokens could widen risk spreads across the market, amplifying Ripple volatility. Regardless of outcome, the decision is set to trigger a volatility burst far exceeding the 0.020–0.023 ATR baseline, echoing previous litigation-driven price swings. Traders accustomed to XRP’s current quiet tape should brace for order-book whipsaws and slippage as algorithms race to reprice regulatory risk within seconds of the ruling. Three-Month XRP Price Outlook: Scenarios and Key Levels Base Case: Range-Bound Chop Dominates With structural compression still unresolved and no verdict yet from Washington, the most probable path calls for sideways trade inside a broad $2.10–$2.60 corridor. Technical cues lean cautiously bearish—RSI sub-50, MACD under its signal—but neither indicator points to capitulation, while on-chain utility steadily soaks up float. Price faces initial resistance at $2.15 (Pivot R1) and primary supply at $2.26–$2.27. Support sits at $2.13, reinforced by resting bids and a liquidity node clustered on depth charts. Flattened EMA50/100 pair near $2.20–$2.22 functions as a fulcrum; closes above tilt momentum bullish, below tilt bearish. Expected daily range, per ATR 14, remains about 1% until a catalyst widens the bands. This base case envisions choppy action punctuated by brief spikes, rewarding short-time-frame traders more than trend followers. Breakout Triggers and Risk Factors Directional conviction hinges on a handful of clear catalysts. A decisive SEC ruling, expanding stablecoin flows, or a macro risk surge could all snap the current coil, dictating whether bulls or bears seize control. Bullish catalysts Ripple victory in court → immediate relisting on U.S. venues, targeting the Bollinger mid-band at $2.24 and the $2.60 extension. Sustained rise in active addresses plus Flare’s $100 M integration constrict tradable supply. Galaxy Score moves above 60 alongside engagement spikes, echoing prior breakout regimes. Bearish catalysts Security classification forces exchange withdrawals, pressuring $2.13 and exposing $2.10 support. Broader crypto sell-off drags turnover below the 90-day median, widening spreads, and drying liquidity. Negative macro sentiment—higher yields or dollar strength—dampens risk appetite across digital assets. Whichever narrative gains traction, the first close outside the present Bollinger squeeze is likely to set the tone for the full 90-day horizon, transforming today’s Ripple volatility stalemate into a decisive trend. XRP Price Forecast: Converging Signals, Singular Moment Across charts, ledgers, and social feeds, one theme keeps surfacing: compression. Price is hemmed in by a Bollinger squeeze, on-chain supply is thinning as smart-contract projects and corporate treasuries ring-fence tokens, and sentiment sits in a low-heat equilibrium that can flip bullish or bearish on a single headline. That confluence is rare, and it matters because the market is fast approaching an inflection point where legal clarity, liquidity depth, and genuine network demand will either reinforce each other or collide. Over the next 90 days, traders who treat every swing as a data-rich stress test—not a coin-flip—can refine their edge by watching whether XRP keeps closing above the $2.26 ceiling or slips beneath the $2.08 support band; by monitoring if the XRPL’s growing cohort of active receiver addresses continues to expand when volatility spikes; and by tracking whether LunarCrush’s Galaxy Score lifts beyond the mid-50s as trading volume and social engagement rebuild. Tensions in the Middle East have also spurred a flight to safety, lifting oil prices and rattling crypto markets, with cascading liquidations dragging XRP back toward key support levels. As headlines swing between escalation and de-escalation, this geopolitical pulse now rivals legal and technical factors in deciding whether the token rebounds or breaks lower. In short, Ripple volatility is no longer just noise on a candlestick chart; it is the distillation of regulatory risk, real-world utility, and crowd conviction. How those forces resolve will set the tone not only for XRP but for the broader conversation about what gives a digital asset durable value in the first place.

Recently, a significant trend dominating the Forex market trends has been the pronounced US Dollar strength . This shift isn’t random; it’s largely driven by the dollar’s role as a primary safe haven currency during times of uncertainty. What Makes the US Dollar a Safe Haven Currency? The concept of a safe haven currency is simple: it’s an asset that investors flock to when global economic or political risks increase. They seek stability and preservation of capital, even if it means lower returns. The US Dollar has historically filled this role for several key reasons: Liquidity: The US Dollar is the most traded currency globally, offering unparalleled ease of buying and selling. Size of Economy: The United United States boasts the world’s largest economy, providing a perception of underlying stability. Treasury Market: The US Treasury market is deep and liquid, considered one of the safest places to park large sums of money. Global central banks and institutions hold vast reserves in dollar-denominated assets. Global Reserve Status: The dollar remains the dominant reserve currency held by central banks worldwide. When geopolitical tensions rise, or fears of a global economic slowdown surface, the predictable reaction is a move towards perceived safety. This increases demand for the dollar, driving its value up against other currencies. How Are Forex Market Trends Impacting Euro and Sterling? While the dollar gains strength, other major currencies, particularly the Euro and the British Pound (Sterling), have seen significant retreats. This is a direct consequence of the safe-haven flow into the dollar, but also reflects specific challenges within the Eurozone and the UK. The Euro Dollar exchange rate is a prime example. As the dollar strengthens, the Euro weakens relative to it. This can be attributed to several factors: Economic growth concerns in the Eurozone. Differences in monetary policy outlook between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the US Federal Reserve (Fed). If the Fed is perceived as more likely to keep rates higher or hike faster, it makes dollar assets more attractive. Geopolitical proximity to ongoing conflicts or instability. Similarly, the British Pound exchange rate against the dollar has also faced pressure. The UK economy grapples with its own set of challenges, including inflation, growth concerns, and the ongoing adjustments post-Brexit. These domestic issues, combined with the broader rush to the dollar, put downward pressure on Sterling. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of a Strong Dollar? A strong US Dollar strength has varied impacts globally: Benefits: Cheaper Imports for the US: US consumers and businesses can buy imported goods and raw materials at lower dollar costs. Lower Inflation Pressure in the US: Cheaper imports can help temper domestic inflation. Increased Purchasing Power Abroad for US Tourists/Businesses: Travel and investments abroad become less expensive in dollar terms. Challenges: More Expensive US Exports: US goods and services become pricier for foreign buyers, potentially hurting export-oriented businesses. Pressure on Emerging Markets: Countries with significant dollar-denominated debt face higher repayment costs as their local currency weakens against the dollar. Lower Corporate Earnings for US Multinationals: Profits earned abroad translate into fewer dollars when repatriated. Impact on Commodity Prices: Many commodities (like oil and gold) are priced in dollars. A stronger dollar can make them more expensive for buyers using other currencies, potentially dampening demand. Understanding Actionable Insights from Forex Trends While this article is not financial advice, understanding these Forex market trends provides valuable context. For those interested in global markets, including potentially the indirect drivers affecting cryptocurrency sentiment: Monitor Global Events: Geopolitical stability and economic data releases are primary drivers of safe-haven demand. Watch Central Bank Commentary: Signals from the Federal Reserve, ECB, and Bank of England significantly influence currency valuations. Consider Relative Economic Health: The perceived strength or weakness of the US economy versus the Eurozone and UK economies plays a crucial role in the Euro Dollar exchange rate and British Pound exchange rate . Staying informed about these macro-level shifts helps build a more complete picture of the forces shaping the financial world. Looking Ahead: Will Dollar Strength Persist? Predicting currency movements is complex. The current US Dollar strength , driven by its safe haven currency status, could persist as long as global uncertainty remains high. However, shifts in economic outlooks, changes in central bank policies, or resolution of geopolitical tensions could reverse the trend, leading to a rebound in currencies like the Euro and Sterling. The interplay between global risk sentiment, economic fundamentals, and monetary policy will continue to shape the Forex market trends , influencing everything from major exchange rates like the Euro Dollar exchange rate and British Pound exchange rate to broader capital flows. In summary, the recent surge in US Dollar strength is a classic flight-to-safety narrative playing out in the Forex market trends . As a premier safe haven currency , the dollar benefits from global unease, putting pressure on currencies like the Euro and Sterling. Understanding these dynamics is essential for anyone tracking international finance.

The sudden spike in volatility pushed Ethereum away from its recent highs, as it retraced after failing to break above the critical $3,000 resistance level. This marks a pivotal moment for ETH, which had shown strong momentum in recent sessions before being hit by the broader market downturn. Related Reading: Ethereum Repeats History – Key Support Holds Again Ahead Of Potential Rally Despite the sharp correction, top analyst Quinten Francois remains optimistic. He pointed to the ETH/BTC pair, which continues to look strong relative to other assets. According to Francois, this pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle—a pattern that often precedes a breakout to the upside if support holds. With Bitcoin holding near its range highs, Ethereum’s performance against BTC could serve as a leading indicator for the broader altcoin market. Now, Ethereum stands at a crossroads. A bounce from current levels could renew bullish momentum and re-establish the $2,800–$3,000 range as the launchpad for higher prices. But failure to hold support may trigger another wave of downside pressure. All eyes are on ETH/BTC as markets brace for what comes next. Ethereum Holds Key Level Against BTC Ethereum has been leading the crypto market with impressive strength since April, posting a remarkable surge of over 100% from its lows near $1,400. This steep recovery highlights Ethereum’s growing momentum, positioning it as a potential frontrunner in triggering the next altseason. The asset’s consistent performance above key support levels and its resilience during market dips have renewed bullish sentiment, with traders increasingly focusing on ETH as the key asset to watch. Many analysts believe Ethereum could be the spark that reignites capital rotation into altcoins. Its breakout from a month-long range, combined with increasing DeFi activity and improving on-chain metrics, has added to the bullish case. However, caution remains. Ongoing geopolitical tensions—particularly the recent escalation between Israel and Iran—are injecting volatility into global markets, including crypto. These developments have disrupted otherwise promising technical setups across the board, leading to uncertainty and risk-off sentiment. Quinten Francois commented on the current climate, noting that “some charts don’t look good, others are holding on by a thread.” However, he singled out the ETH/BTC pair as a relative strength signal, stating that it “still looks good.” This pair is currently testing the support line of an ascending triangle—a structure that, if defended, could pave the way for a continuation of ETH’s dominance over Bitcoin. In this environment, Ethereum’s performance—especially relative to BTC—could determine the broader market’s next phase. If ETH/BTC holds and breaks higher, the door opens for a full altseason run. But a failure to hold could reinforce caution and signal a pause across the crypto market. For now, Ethereum remains the most important chart to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Tests Previous Resistance As Support – Can Bulls Defend This Level? ETH Faces Sharp Rejection After Tagging Range Highs Ethereum is facing a crucial technical test after a strong rejection near the $2,830 resistance level. The chart shows ETH failing to hold above the highlighted supply zone between $2,700 and $2,830, where sellers stepped in aggressively. This resulted in a sharp breakdown that sliced through the 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) on the 4-hour timeframe, now positioning ETH around $2,512. What’s more concerning is the spike in volume during the breakdown. This confirms the strength behind the move, signaling panic among bulls and potential distribution by short-term holders. ETH is now holding just above a previous support zone from early June, but the current setup suggests uncertainty and risk of further downside. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Tests Ascending Channel Resistance – Breakout Or Breakdown? Unless Ethereum can reclaim the $2,600–$2,620 area soon, the next likely target could be the $2,400 level, where the next strong demand cluster sits. However, if bulls defend current prices and manage a quick recovery back above the SMAs, this recent move could be interpreted as a liquidity sweep before continuation.

The purchase makes the firm the largest ETH holder among publicly traded companies, SharpLink said in a press release . The company tapped its $1 billion at-the-market (ATM) common stock share facility for $79 million to help fund the ETH acquisition. The ETH purchase announcement came on the heels of a Thursday regulatory filing that potentially enabled investors in the firm's private placement round to sell shares, sending stock prices down 70% after market hours. Some speculated that the firm might leaned more heavily into the ATM to announce a bigger larger crypto purchase. Shares remain lower by 66% in Friday action.

Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys CEO Joseph Lubin also joined the firm as board chairman.

The founder of Pomp Investments is reportedly embarking on an ambitious venture aimed squarely at acquiring a substantial amount of Bitcoin. This development signals a potential new avenue for significant Bitcoin investment , particularly through traditional financial structures. Who is Anthony Pompliano and What’s ProCapBTC’s Plan? Anthony Pompliano, widely known as “Pomp,” is a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space. He’s an entrepreneur, investor, and commentator who has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and digital assets for years. His firm, Pomp Investments, focuses on building and investing in companies within the crypto industry. Now, according to a report by the Financial Times, Pomp is set to take the helm as CEO of a new public entity called ProCapBTC . The core mission of ProCapBTC is straightforward yet significant: to raise a substantial war chest specifically for purchasing Bitcoin. The target amount is a staggering $750 million. This move positions ProCapBTC as a dedicated vehicle for large-scale exposure to the leading cryptocurrency, potentially attracting investors who prefer accessing digital assets through publicly traded companies. Leveraging a Crypto SPAC for the Bitcoin Investment How does ProCapBTC plan to raise this considerable sum? The strategy involves merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) named Columbus Circle Capital 1. This mechanism is essentially a shortcut for a private company (ProCapBTC) to become publicly traded without going through the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process. The SPAC merger is intended to facilitate the capital raise in two parts: $500 million: Expected to be raised through equity, likely from investors participating in the SPAC transaction. $250 million: Planned through convertible debt, which can later be converted into equity under certain conditions. This approach highlights the increasing use of financial engineering, including the Crypto SPAC structure, to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset market. SPACs offer speed and a degree of certainty compared to traditional IPOs, although they also come with their own set of risks and complexities. The Significance of a $750M Institutional Bitcoin Purchase A planned $750 million purchase of Bitcoin is a significant event, regardless of who is behind it. When a public company is specifically formed and capitalized with the explicit goal of holding Bitcoin, it underscores the growing trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. This isn’t just another fund allocating a small percentage; it’s a company built around the asset itself. Why is this happening? Several factors likely contribute: Demand: There is clear and growing demand from institutional investors and potentially retail investors via public markets for exposure to Bitcoin. Accessibility: A public company structure makes it easier for many types of investors, including institutions with strict mandates, to gain exposure compared to buying and holding Bitcoin directly. Belief in Bitcoin: Pomp and his associates are strong believers in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and digital gold. If successful, ProCapBTC would join a growing list of publicly traded companies holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets, although its model appears to be primarily focused on being a Bitcoin acquisition vehicle rather than an operating business that happens to hold Bitcoin. Challenges and Opportunities for ProCapBTC While the plan is ambitious, executing a $750 million Bitcoin investment through a SPAC merger isn’t without its hurdles. Potential challenges include: Market Volatility: The price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. The value of ProCapBTC’s holdings would fluctuate significantly, impacting its share price. Regulatory Environment: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and public companies dealing with them is still evolving. Execution Risk: Completing the SPAC merger and successfully raising the targeted $750 million requires navigating complex financial and legal processes. Premium to NAV: Publicly traded Bitcoin holding companies often trade at a premium or discount to the actual value of the Bitcoin they hold (Net Asset Value – NAV), which can add another layer of complexity for investors. However, the opportunities are also significant. If successful, ProCapBTC could become a major player providing accessible exposure to Bitcoin for a wide range of investors. The involvement of a well-known figure like Anthony Pompliano could lend credibility and attract investor interest. What to Watch For For those interested in this development, several key milestones are worth monitoring: Completion of the SPAC merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1. Successful execution of the $750 million capital raise (equity and debt). Confirmation of Pomp’s role as CEO. Details regarding the timing and strategy for the actual Bitcoin investment purchases. This initiative by ProCapBTC , led by Pomp, is a clear indicator of the continued drive to integrate digital assets into traditional financial frameworks and facilitate large-scale Institutional Bitcoin adoption. Conclusion The reported plan for Anthony Pompliano to lead ProCapBTC in a $750 million Bitcoin investment via a Crypto SPAC merger is a compelling development in the ongoing story of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. It represents a bold attempt to create a dedicated, publicly traded vehicle for significant Bitcoin exposure. While challenges exist, the potential for providing traditional investors with easier access to the world’s leading cryptocurrency is substantial. This move underscores the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset and the innovative ways the market is finding to meet investor demand.

The buying wick printed on the latest daily candle confirms a strong reaction from what appears to be a maximum value zone. Pi Network’s ( PI ) price action took a steep hit as it fell below the value area low and traded directly into a macro swing low support. However, this flush was met with immediate demand, leading to a sharp intraday recovery and a strong close back above high-timeframe support. The technical bounce was characterized by a prominent buying tail, a classic signature of value-based demand, now placing Pi in a potential reversal zone Key technical points Break Below Value Area Low: Price dipped under the VAL and found strong buy-side pressure at the swing low region. Impressive Recovery Candle: The wick and close above support confirm aggressive market interest and demand. Reclaiming the Value Area Low: Sustained closes above this level confirm validation of the demand zone. Key Resistance at $0.65: Breaking this dynamic resistance would confirm a trend shift and open room for a move toward $0.80. PiNetwork (6H) Chart, Source: TradingView The drop below the value area low initially looked like a breakdown, but Pi Network’s price quickly reversed after reaching a key swing low, a high-interest liquidity pocket. The strong buying tail formed on the candle reflects not only rejection of lower prices but also signals the presence of maximum value buyers stepping into the market. Price has now closed back above the high-timeframe support and is showing signs of acceptance above the value area low. This reclaim is critical. From a market profile perspective, acceptance back above the value area low after a failed breakdown often signals a trap and provides high-probability long setups.

A clean break above this level would shift short-term market structure into a higher high formation, signaling early-stage reversal potential after the sharp sell-off. If Pi Network can breach this resistance and sustain momentum, the next magnet will likely be the $0.80 level, aligning with the upper boundary of the trading range and value area high. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Pi Network holds above the value area low and builds support on higher time frames, price remains positioned for a move toward $0.65 and then $0.80. The sharp bounce from maximum value confirms that buyers are active, and a structural reversal could be underway if dynamic resistance breaks.

The sentencing was handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Angel Kelley in Boston, following Andriunin’s guilty plea in March 2025 to wire fraud and conspiracy to commit market manipulation. The 26-year-old, a dual citizen of Russia and Portugal, was arrested in Portugal in October 2024 and extradited to the U.S. in February 2025. As part of a plea agreement, Andriunin agreed to forfeit $23 million in stablecoins held in crypto wallets linked to Gotbit. Gotbit Consulting LLC, the firm he founded, was also sentenced to five years’ probation and is required to cease operations. The company admitted to offering wash trading services between 2018 and 2024, manipulating trading volumes to help client tokens appear more active and gain listings on exchanges and CoinMarketCap.

Gotbit’s blockchain evasion Prosecutors said Gotbit used multiple accounts to avoid blockchain detection and received tens of millions of dollars in client payments for these services. Tokens involved in the scheme included Robo Inu and Saitama. Company directors Fedor Kedrov and Qawi Jalili were also indicted. Gotbit is the third crypto market maker charged in relation to illegal trading practices, following actions against MyTrade and CLS Global, according to the Justice Department. The Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a separate civil enforcement action against Gotbit for securities law violations. As part of his sentence, Andriunin will also serve one year of supervised release and is barred from crypto-related activity during that period.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) is going mainstream, as both governments and public companies continue accumulating the asset. On Friday, June 13, Matador Technologies published a weekly report on institutional Bitcoin adoption. According to the Canada-based financial technology firm, public companies are accelerating their Bitcoin accumulation. 1/ 🏛️ Regulatory momentum in U.S. Congress •CLARITY (crypto market structure) and GENIUS (stablecoin framework) bills are advancing, with bipartisan support and a bitcoin‑friendly CFTC chair nominee Brian Quintenz. •This marks a turning point: clearer regulation unlocking… — Matador Technologies (@buymatador) June 13, 2025 The company reports that 22 public firms accumulated approximately $11.3 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past month. GameStop led the wave, acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin with its $1.75 billion convertible note. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet is targeting a 210,000 Bitcoin treasury. According to the Matador Technologies report, the main driver of corporate adoption is the regulatory momentum around crypto in the U.S. Currently, U.S. legislators are reviewing two bills: the CLARITY Act, which addresses the overall crypto market structure, and the GENIUS Act, which focuses on stablecoins.

The U.S. is taking the lead, with President Donald Trump formalizing a Bitcoin strategic reserve on March 6. The federal government currently holds around 200,000 Bitcoin, mostly originating from asset seizures. In addition, U.S. states including Texas and Arizona are considering their own Bitcoin reserves — signaling strong political momentum behind Bitcoin adoption. Other countries, including Japan, Brazil, Czech Republic, Pakistan, are also considering their own Bitcoin treasury allocations. Still, a recent scandal in the Czechia related to a Bitcoin donation highlights the political risk of such moves. Rising adoption, both at the corporate and governmental level, is making Bitcoin increasingly resilient to volatility. Matador Technologies notes that Bitcoin rebounded to the $105,000 level, despite heightened tensions in the Middle East following the Israeli strike on Iran.
