Cardano (ADA) also appears set for a price increase. Investors might find it an opportune moment to consider these digital assets. The forthcoming analysis reveals which cryptocurrencies are primed for a bullish run and why they deserve attention now. Cardano: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels in Focus ADA price action over the past month shows a modest drop of roughly 8%, with weekly declines near 1.22%. Over the last six months, Cardano has surged close to 77%, marking a strong upward push for longer-term holders. This blend of short-term softness paired with solid long-term gains highlights a period of volatility and gradual recovery. Current levels see Cardano trading between $0.47 and $1.02, with resistance around $1.37 and support near $0.27. Technical signals point to a slight bearish leaning without a decisive trend, presenting a range-bound market. Traders might consider buying near support and testing resistance while keeping an eye on any emerging breakouts. Hedera HBAR: Six-Month Surge Meets Short-Term Correction Over the past month, HBAR price declined nearly 9.6%, while the six-month period delivered a robust 219% gain. Prices ranged between $0.117 and $0.248, indicating a volatile swing that contrasts short-term pullbacks with long-term upward momentum. This behavior shows clear recovery potential even amid recent dips. Current price action trades within the $0.117-$0.248 corridor, with immediate resistance at $0.33 and a further hurdle at $0.47. Support appears near $0.07. Despite strong long-term gains, short-term indicators lean slightly bearish with an RSI around 48. Traders may look for a steady break above $0.33 while watching for reversals near support levels. Conclusion ADA and HBAR have shown promising potential for growth. Both coins have unique features and strong communities supporting them. The bullish outlook for HBAR and the anticipated price rise for ADA highlight their attractiveness. This could be a good time to consider investing in these two assets. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With the continued rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the growing adoption of blockchain technology, it’s important to keep an eye on the projects that are standing out. These aren’t just flashy names but solid, long-term alternatives to traditional investment avenues. Among these projects, Qubetics , SEI, and Injective have firmly established themselves as key players. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what each one brings to the table, their milestones, and how they position themselves as alternatives to traditional investments.

They represent the forward-thinking alternatives that discerning crypto backers are turning to, while traditional financial markets continue to rely on outdated models.

43303102,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104907,1744579470,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Tron Founder Celebrates 300 Million Addresses as TRX Crosses $0.25,https://zycrypto.com/tron-founder-celebrates-300-million-addresses-as-trx-crosses-0-25/,"Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to celebrate a major milestone for his digital currency network. The crypto entrepreneur claimed that the programmable blockchain now boasts massive accounts, totaling 300 million worldwide. This figure dwarfs the 1 billion+ figure commanded by Bitcoin, but it is only slightly less than Ethereum’s 321 million public addresses. It is a massive achievement by the Tron Foundation, considering its standing in the charts. In the same tweet, Sun revealed that the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the crypto’s staking and DeFi ecosystem is nearing record highs and hovering just below $20 billion. At the same time, the total transfer volume, another on-chain statistic, is close to $17 trillion. These figures are being used by Sun to drum up support for his altcoin, and the price has since surpassed the resistance at around $0.25. However, the move above this figure has been less than convincing, and the crypto could face some pressure going into the first day of the new week. Does Tron Boast 300 Million Users? Despite Sun’s claim of hundreds of millions of users, on further on-chain investigation, it was found out by the ZyCrypto team that the founder is conflating the number of users with the number of blockchain addresses created on the network. This is often used by promoters looking to get their cryptocurrency into discussion circles on social media. The reality is that this metric is far from a reliable statistic when calculating the number of users of a blockchain network because a single user can create multiple accounts, as they have done for all major blockchains. According to Dune Analytics , this is the graph of active addresses on the TRX blockchain: Image Source: Dune Analytics Currently, the number of active daily addresses on the Tron network hovers around 13.6 million, which is a healthy figure but only a fraction of the figure claimed by Sun. Many users also maintain multiple active addresses, so the actual figure is likely to be even lower. There is no concrete way of knowing the exact number of unique individual users using TRX, but it is expected to be in several million. Is Tron back? Tron has had a strong last two to three quarters as it managed to capture the attention of the market after several years of relative hiatus. The cryptocurrency was launched during the first altcoin boom of 2017-2018 and experienced massive gains before capitulating much of them in a major crash in 2018 that wiped out more than 90% of its value. TRX then had a lacklustre 2020-2021 bull market, fading away in the coin market charts. However, 2024 saw the once-fancied digital cryptocurrency awaken from its deep slumber and post a new All-Time High (ATH) of $0.45 in the buildup of the calendar year. While TRX has lost around 45% of its value ever since amid even deeper short-term plunges, the altcoin could be in for a major end to 2025 if the larger bull market resumes at some point in 2025.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-13 21:24:30

Despite this decline, SHIB has fared better than Dogecoin (DOGE), which has seen a steeper drop of 27% over the same period. The downturn aligns with a broader cryptocurrency market correction, led by Bitcoin’s fall below the $78,000 mark. Notably, even before the latest market decline, on-chain data signaled diminishing interest in SHIB. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted this trend tweeting , “Whale activity on the ShibaInu network has declined by 79% over the past three months.” Despite the recent weakness, some analysts remain optimistic about SHIB’s potential. On Wednesday, analyst Javon Marks pointed to a bullish chart formation that suggests a massive rally could be on the horizon. “SHIB (Shiba Inu) prices maintaining the structure of a large Inverse Head & Shoulder and with the $0.000081 target still in play, an over 402% run to reach it could come out of this.” He tweeted. Meanwhile, other indicators point to signs of accumulation and a possible reversal for SHIB. The price is currently consolidating, with the RSI at 54.72, indicating neutral momentum. While buying pressure is present, it remains insufficient for a breakout. The Stochastic RSI at 54.72/57.76 has cooled off but could signal renewed buying if it turns upward. A move above 60 RSI may spark an uptrend, while a drop below 50 could signal further downside. At the same time, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is flattening from bearish territory, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. Additionally, although trading volume has only increased by 13% in the past 24 hours to $312 million, it still signals ongoing accumulation. Beyond price action, SHIB’s ecosystem continues to expand with key developments aimed at improving liquidity and user experience. Earlier this week, the Shiba Inu team introduced upgraded liquidity pools designed to enhance liquidity management. The update allows users to seamlessly migrate, import, or create liquidity pools, streamlining the process. These advancements have generated significant interest in Shiba Inu, driving a surge in wallet addresses on its Ethereum Layer 2 network. Over the past week, the number of wallet addresses has skyrocketed by around 500%, jumping from approximately 9.4 million on February 17 to over 55.7 million as of February 24. Another bullish factor for SHIB is its increasing token burn rate. On Thursday, the Shiba Inu burn rate spiked by over 1,300%, removing over 30 million SHIB tokens from circulation in just one day. Token burning helps reduce supply, making SHIB scarcer, which could positively impact its price in the long run. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.000012, reflecting a 3.91% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-13 21:37:03

On April 13, Lutnick told ABC News that the reciprocal tariff exemption was temporary until the administration established a sector tariff regime for semiconductor products, which includes phones, graphics processors, and computing chips in a ""month or two."" Lutnick added: ""President Trump has called out pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. He called them sector tariffs, and those are not available for negotiation. They are just going to be part of making sure we ensure core national security items are made in this country."" ""We can't be relying on China for fundamental things we need. Our medicines and our semiconductors need to be built in America,"" Lutnick continued. The official also said he was confident that the US and China would arrive at a trade deal through negotiations. The emphasis on national security and onshoring critical industries could signal that the trade tariffs will be a long-term geostrategic policy and not simply a short-term negotiation tactic to make US exports more attractive, as some analysts have suggested. The Volatility S&P Index (VIX), a measure of the S&P stock index’s volatility, remains elevated amid macroeconomic uncertainty. Source: TradingView Related: Bitcoin ‘decouples,’ stocks lose $3.5T amid Trump tariff war and Fed warning of ‘higher inflation’ Trade war heightens volatility and sends markets tumbling Trump's trade tariffs crashed the stock and crypto markets , wiping away trillions in shareholder value as investors dumped riskier assets on fears of a lengthy trade war between the United States and its trading partners. In an April 10 X Post , Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas cited the SPY US Equity History Volume chart as evidence that the S&P 500 stock market index is now more volatile than Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to the analyst, the S&P 500 Index hit a volatility level of 74 in April, compared to Bitcoin's 71. Stocks and crypto pumped following rumors of the Trump administration initiating a 90-day reciprocal tariff pause. Approximately $2 trillion was pumped into stocks on rumors of softer trade policies. Much of this value was then wiped away when Trump claimed that rumors of a 90-day pause were false and returned once the Trump administration did, in fact, issue a reciprocal tariff pause in the following days.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/stellar-xlm-forms-triangle-pattern-heres-the-implication/,"Stellar (XLM), the digital asset powering cross-border payments and smart contract capabilities on the Stellar blockchain, is currently displaying a technical formation that could ignite a significant price move. According to renowned crypto analyst Ali, who shared the observation via X, XLM is forming a classic triangle pattern, a well-known setup in technical analysis that typically precedes a breakout. #Stellar $XLM is forming a triangle pattern that could lead to a 15% price move! pic.twitter.com/zDUf3weYHe — Ali (@ali_charts) April 12, 2025 Technical Analysis Points to Impending Volatility The triangle pattern indicates market consolidation, where price action narrows as buyers and sellers converge in anticipation of a breakout. In Stellar’s case, the tightening range is likely a prelude to increased volatility. Based on Ali’s assessment, this pattern could result in a price move of approximately 15% once a breakout direction is confirmed. Analysts often regard triangle patterns as continuation or reversal signals depending on the preceding trend. Stellar’s recent tight trading range sets the stage for a potential breakout, which could spark renewed buying or selling momentum. If bulls push the price above the upper trendline with robust volume, XLM could see a rally toward key resistance zones. Conversely, a breakdown could test previous support levels. Broader Market Context and Stellar’s Fundamentals While technical patterns like this triangle provide short-term trading signals, it’s essential to consider the broader market environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum—market leaders—have shown mixed momentum, and their next moves could influence altcoins like Stellar. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory updates, and on-chain developments will influence XLM’s price direction. Stellar remains fundamentally solid, with ongoing development around its smart contract capabilities and cross-border payment utility. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) continues to pursue partnerships in emerging markets and with financial institutions, reinforcing its relevance as a blockchain platform focused on financial inclusion and interoperability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Awaits Breakout Confirmation As the triangle pattern narrows and momentum indicators near neutral, traders are awaiting a breakout or breakdown to confirm the potential 15% move predicted by Ali. Traders and investors alike would do well to monitor volume spikes, candlestick formations, and broader market sentiment to navigate the outcome of this setup.

The findings hint at a sector still in its early phases, shaped largely by enthusiasts and trendsetters rather than the broader mainstream. Who’s Driving Crypto AI Hype According to a recent CoinGecko survey , 59.3% of respondents – nearly three in five – identified as pioneers in the crypto AI space, a group composed of 26.6% self-described ‘Innovators’ and 32.7% ‘Early adopters.’ This high concentration of early-stage adopters deviates from the traditional bell curve of technology adoption and suggests that crypto AI is still largely in the hands of tech-forward enthusiasts rather than the broader market. While this may be partially attributed to self-selection bias, given the survey’s appeal to those already interested in the sector, it may also reflect the current positioning of crypto AI as a niche yet rapidly evolving frontier within the broader crypto ecosystem. On the other hand, 34.7% of respondents viewed themselves as part of the ‘mainstream’ adoption phase, comprising 22.8% ‘Early majority’ and 11.9% ‘Late majority.’ This distribution signals that while interest in crypto AI is growing, wider adoption still hinges on demonstrating real-world utility to more cautious users. The remaining 6.1% of participants identified as ‘Laggards’ – those skeptical or resistant to change – indicating a small but notable segment of the community unconvinced by the crypto AI narrative. Novice Polarized Over Crypto AI Adoption Interestingly, adoption attitudes varied based on user experience levels within the crypto space. Participants in their first market cycle showed the most polarized views, with 31.5% identifying as ‘Innovators’ and 7.4% as ‘Laggards,’ a trend likely driven by newcomers entering the market during a wave of AI-related hype . In comparison, more seasoned participants – those in their second cycle or beyond – showed more balanced adoption patterns, with second-cycle users skewing toward the ‘Early majority’ and veterans leaning more toward ‘Innovator’ status.

43303815,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104912,1744580875,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Pundit Shares What Ripple’s XRP Value Will Be If It Replaces SWIFT,https://zycrypto.com/pundit-shares-what-ripples-xrp-value-will-be-if-it-replaces-swift/,"As the global financial system evolves towards faster and more efficient payment solutions, XRP has emerged as a potential disruptor to SWIFT, the longstanding leader in cross-border transactions. Notably, the latest speculation on XRP’s potential to overtake SWIFT has reignited debate, driven by a bold claim from DigitalIG, a former London-based fund manager and outspoken XRP advocate. “When XRP replaces SWIFT, it will be valued beyond $15,000 per token,” he tweeted Saturday. He highlighted that XRP’s design allows for such valuations, as each token can be divided into 1,000,000 smaller units known as drops. Since its establishment in 1973, SWIFT has been the backbone of global finance, connecting over 11,000 financial institutions across more than 200 countries. It processes over $5 trillion in transactions daily, translating to an annual volume of approximately $1.25 quadrillion. However, SWIFT’s reliance on a correspondent banking network often results in inefficiencies, delays, and high costs. These limitations have led financial institutions to explore alternative solutions, with Ripple and its native asset, XRP , emerging as a strong contender by providing real-time settlement using XRP as a bridge currency. Transactions on RippleNet are completed within seconds at a fraction of the cost associated with SWIFT’s traditional multi-day process. That said, the idea of XRP replacing SWIFT has also been supported by various financial analysts, with some estimating that if XRP were to handle 5-10% of SWIFT’s annual transaction volume, its price and market capitalization would need to rise significantly. In October 2024, global investment bank Houlihan Lokey identified Ripple as one of SWIFT’s strongest competitors, citing its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service as a key advantage. Additionally, in January 2025, Mark Yusko, CEO and CIO of the billion-dollar investment fund Morgan Creek Capital Management, expressed interest in supporting XRP if it replaced SWIFT. However, despite its potential, several hurdles must be overcome for XRP to achieve such a valuation. Regulatory clarity remains a significant obstacle, particularly in the U.S., where Ripple has been engaged in a lengthy legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A favorable resolution could boost institutional confidence in XRP and accelerate adoption. Scalability is another critical factor. SWIFT processes enormous transaction volumes daily, and for XRP to compete at this level, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) must be capable of handling similar loads reliably. While the XRPL already enables rapid settlements, further enhancements in liquidity management and infrastructure would be necessary to match SWIFT’s scale. Ripple’s ODL service is actively addressing these challenges, but more work is required before XRP can fully replace SWIFT.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-13 21:47:55

Among them Ruvi AI has just launched its presale with a great value proposition driven by its AI powered ecosystem, attractive incentive structure and huge growth potential. Token prices start at $0.01 and you can earn up to 100% bonuses. Ruvi AI has already raised over $100,000 with more than 10M sold in just a few days since launch. AI and Blockchain for Real World Impact Ruvi AI stands out by merging AI and blockchain to create solutions for decentralized applications, content creation and analytics. This positions the project to tap into two big areas of the tech space. Unlike speculative assets Ruvi AI brings a tangible use case to the table catering to industries that are increasingly using AI for efficiency and innovation. The presale is priced at $0.01 per token to attract early adopters looking for high ROI from ground floor investment opportunities. Upon successful launch with a projected listing price of $0.07 those who buy in during the presale will get an immediate 600% return. Such numbers show the growth potential of Ruvi AI and why it’s attractive to both institutional and retail investors. Incentive Structure A key feature of the Ruvi AI presale is the tiered VIP bonus structure which rewards early investors with additional tokens based on their contribution level. Bonuses range from 25% to 100% and shows a clear incentive for big capital commitments. For example, an investor that qualifies for the VIP 5 tier with $5,000 investment gets 500,000 tokens at $0.01 each. But with the 100% bonus in this tier the token count doubles to 1,000,000. So at the projected listing price of $0.07 the total value of the tokens would be $70,000. This shows Ruvi AI not only rewards early participation but also the long term confidence Ruvi AI has in the project. These bonuses complement Ruvi AI’s bigger goal of building a collaborative and invested community. By incentivizing immediate and big commitments Ruvi AI aligns its project goals with investor goals. Leaderboard Rewards for Community Engagement To add more structure to its reward system Ruvi AI has introduced a leaderboard rewards program for its top 1,000 holders. This is designed to encourage long term participation and offers fixed token allocations to investors based on their holdings. This ranges from tens of thousands of additional tokens for mid tier positions to much bigger rewards for top ranked participants. What’s unique about this is its inclusive design. Rewards are distributed on top of the VIP bonuses so it’s an additional layer of benefit to those who are committed to Ruvi AI’s long term vision. By combining financial incentives with community building strategies the project is solidifying its commitment to building an engaged investor base. Ruvi AI’s Growth Potential Ruvi AI’s real world utility, innovative technology and well aligned incentive structure makes it a strong player in the crypto space. The project is riding the growing demand for AI driven solutions and the utility and scalability of blockchain. Analysts are getting more and more optimistic about Ruvi AI’s potential with predictions that the token could reach $1 in the near future. Such a milestone would be a 100x return for early investors and shows the project’s strong growth potential. This is because of Ruvi AI’s integrated utility, AI and blockchain technology and robust incentive structures that has caught attention. Conclusion With $0.01 presale and innovative reward mechanisms Ruvi AI is an interesting option for those looking into new projects with high growth potential. Its dual focus on technology and investor incentives is a solid foundation for building short term and long term value.

Despite some market fluctuations, Solana could soar to new heights, potentially reaching over $300 by the time of the next Bitcoin halving. However, the next big disruptor in the crypto market is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.6 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 8200 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 8200 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $6.6 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. MUTM has introduced tangible features, including a new dashboard leaderboard that tracks its top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. As investors grow more utility-focused, MUTM’s rise signals what could be the next win in crypto, substance over spectacle. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. While Solana (SOL) is primed for a potential rebound, reaching over $300 by the next Bitcoin halving, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could outperform expectations with a forecasted 50x growth. The fourth phase of its presale has already raised $6.6 million, with MUTM tokens priced at $0.025 and set to rise to $0.06 at launch. Don’t miss out on this high-growth opportunity.

Bitcoin, widely seen as the bedrock of the digital asset space, has experienced a notable retreat in price and market cap. Ethereum, though still central to DeFi and smart contracts, has taken an even steeper fall. These movements are prompting investors to reconsider where momentum is truly building. That’s where BlockDAG enters the picture. While many projects remain in the concept stage, BlockDAG is actively rolling out products—its Beta Testnet is live, its miner app has attracted hundreds of thousands, and over 19.2 billion coins have already sold during presale. With $214 million raised so far, BlockDAG is shaping the conversation—not just joining it. For a growing number of buyers, this isn’t a Bitcoin or Ethereum replacement—it’s a new contender with something concrete to offer. Bitcoin Faces Pressure, but Remains a Long-Term Anchor As of April 4, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $83,844 with a total market cap of $1.66 trillion. Just three months earlier, BTC was priced at $98,236 and carried a $1.95 trillion market cap. This marks a 14.7% drop in value and a 14.5% market cap decline over the quarter. Despite the correction, Bitcoin still holds firm as a long-term play. Compared to the same time last year, its market cap has grown nearly 28%—a sign of continued institutional and retail belief. As the original cryptocurrency, it maintains its leadership by market size, even during temporary downtrends. Ethereum Sees a 50% Slide, but Fundamentals Remain Solid Ethereum (ETH) currently sits at $1,805 with a market capitalization of $218.4 billion. Three months ago, ETH was trading at $3,658 with a $440.7 billion market cap. That’s a steep drop—down 50.6% in price and 50.4% in market cap during the first quarter of 2025. This pullback follows a strong year in 2024 and reflects wider market corrections. Yet, Ethereum continues to lead in smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi. Its scaling solutions and Layer-2 developments are progressing steadily. Although its market cap has declined about 45% year-over-year, Ethereum still holds a central role in Web3’s future. BlockDAG’s Presale Soars Past $214M After Keynote 3 Rollout BlockDAG’s third Keynote wasn’t just an update—it was a game-changer. The live demo of its Beta “Primordial” Testnet and visuals of 10,000 ASIC miners being shipped sent a strong message: this project is executing. With 750,000 users mining via the X1 App and 400,000 playing Tap Miner, the user base is expanding rapidly. In the days following the Keynote, presale numbers surged. BlockDAG crossed $214 million raised, with over 19.2 billion coins sold. At the current Batch 27 price of $0.0248, early adopters have already realized a 2,380% ROI since Batch 1. These aren’t projected gains—they’re realized returns backed by working tech. This kind of growth, coupled with tangible milestones, has made BlockDAG one of the most talked-about presales in crypto. Its hybrid DAG + PoW structure, active user adoption, and clear development roadmap are building serious momentum. Each batch increases in price, meaning delayed action equals higher cost. Keynote 3, for many, was the clear signal to act. With credible infrastructure, a growing ecosystem, and real-time delivery, BlockDAG is attracting buyer interest not by hype—but by proving value. Buyers Are Watching Where Progress Happens While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant names, their recent pullbacks have prompted investors to explore other options. The focus is now shifting toward projects that are actively building and delivering results—something BlockDAG has made central to its strategy. With a working Testnet, a highly engaged community, and $214 million raised, BlockDAG is moving beyond potential—it’s becoming reality. This isn’t about dethroning the giants, but rather identifying where the next wave of growth may come from. As others consolidate or tread water, BlockDAG is advancing on all fronts. In 2025, that kind of momentum is exactly what forward-looking buyers are tracking.

While the Solana (SOL) price today just spiked to $118 on fresh whale activity and XRP technical analysis points to a bullish breakout after Ripple’s $1.25B Hidden Road acquisition, another opportunity is quietly stacking up returns under the radar. BlockDAG , already climbing presale charts with over $214 million raised, now has users buzzing—not just for its coin, but for its affiliate loop. The model? Earn USDT instantly by referring others, then reinvest it to scoop up more BDAG coins. It’s turning $100 into a snowball effect—“USDT in, BDAG up.” Crypto circles are calling it a launchpad with ROI baked in. It’s the kind of setup that’s catching attention from everyone tracking the next top 10 crypto—and it’s happening while most are still watching charts. The Passive Income Loop That’s Fueling BlockDAG’s Growth BlockDAG’s affiliate program is quickly becoming the easiest passive earning play in crypto. With just one referral link, users are getting paid in USDT instantly every time someone buys BDAG coins. But it’s not just about earning—those rewards can be immediately reinvested, creating a compounding loop where your holdings grow without extra effort. It’s why people are saying, “USDT in, BDAG up.” The program lets you earn 6% to 10% cashback per referral, with no cap on how many people you bring in. What makes it different is how fast it works—rewards hit your wallet right after a qualifying buy, and there’s no waiting period or payout limit. People are literally using the same $100 five times—and getting paid each time. It’s simple: share, earn, reinvest, repeat. BlockDAG’s presale is now in its 27th batch, with BDAG priced at $0.0248. Over 19.2 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $214 million—all without any venture capital. Those who joined early are already up over 2,380%. The presale is tied to key launches too, with a beta testnet live, a 150% retro bonus for all buyers, and listings planned on 10 major CEXs. With momentum this strong, it’s no surprise that BlockDAG is being discussed as a top 10 crypto contender. Its affiliate model is adding fuel to that push, creating a snowball effect of users stacking BDAG while they sleep. For anyone eyeing the next top 10 crypto, this loop might be the real alpha. Solana (SOL) Price Today Spikes After Whale Buy Solana (SOL) price today jumped 8% to $118 after a whale snapped up 32,000 SOL for $3.72 million, according to Lookonchain. This sudden move came after weeks of downward pressure and has put Solana back in focus as traders speculate whether it’s building toward another rally. The same whale had also bought at higher levels before—$157 and $216—suggesting long-term confidence despite market dips. Supporters are watching key technical levels, with $112 recently breaking down and $118 now acting as potential resistance. However, the Firedancer upgrade, expected to improve Solana’s speed and scalability, could be a game-changer. Solana (SOL) price today is still far below its all-time high, but the bullish setup around whale accumulation, ETF rumors, and inclusion in U.S. digital asset funds is creating buzz. If the trend holds, SOL could challenge higher zones soon, especially if it breaks resistance and finds support above key EMAs. XRP Technical Analysis Turns Bullish After SEC Update XRP just jumped 30% after Ripple and the SEC filed a joint motion to pause their legal appeals, hinting that a long-awaited settlement could be close. Adding fuel to the rally, Ripple announced a $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road, a London-based prime brokerage. This move is expected to boost institutional liquidity and support the rollout of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD through Hidden Road’s global network. According to XRP technical analysis, the token has broken above its 50-day moving average for the first time in months and is now trading at $2.00. Analysts are eyeing $2.50 as the next resistance zone, while support holds near $1.50. The RSI is nearing 65, showing bullish strength but hinting at a possible cooldown. Still, with over 70 financial institutions already using Ripple’s cross-border payment network and the legal case nearly resolved, XRP technical analysis now supports a potential breakout scenario in the weeks ahead. Summing Up Solana (SOL) price today is holding above $118 after a major whale buy, with the Firedancer upgrade and ETF speculation keeping bullish interest alive. Meanwhile, XRP technical analysis shows strength after Ripple’s $1.25 billion Hidden Road deal and signs of a legal settlement with the SEC. Both networks are gaining momentum, but they still face short-term resistance and volatility. That’s where BlockDAG shifts the game.

Speaking on ABC's This Week today, Lutnick explained that smartphones, laptops and other key consumer electronics were temporarily exempted from high import tariffs earlier this month, but that the exemption would never become permanent. “All of these products will fall under semiconductors and will have a special focus tariff to ensure the resupply of these products,” Lutnick said.

According to reports from users of the exchanges, the scammers are sending messages that look genuine. Text messages shared by users follow a similar pattern. They call attention to a security issue and require the user to call a number to resolve it. By doing this, they bypass anti-phishing safeguards that detect malicious links but not phone numbers. Users were getting alerts from various issues including reports of log-in from a different location, adding a new 2-factor authentication device, or connecting to a new hardware wallet. So far, there has been no report of any victim, but users on X have alerted others about the risks, noting that Binance will never ask its customers to call a number. Meanwhile, one user mentioned that he called the number. SMS Phishing scam to Binance user (Source: X/ Public_Enemy_01) He said: “New scam @binance …… it came from the same number you text me from aswell. Rang it, spoke to Abdul in Landan, who didn’t like my tone for some reason and hung up. Watch out people.” Interestingly, several users claim the text messages come from the same sender ID Binance uses for communications, leading to more uncertainty among users about the authenticity of the messages. Binance says the data leak is not from its systems Meanwhile, there are speculations about how the scammers got user data. Many believe they bought it from the dark web and are now using it for a targeted campaign. According to one user, an anonymous actor recently offered a database of Gemini and Binance users for sale. The user claimed that a 2019 leak of Binance Know Your Customer (KYC) data is the source of the database. However, Binance has denied this, noting that it examined the hacker’s data and that the records are not connected to Binance. Nevertheless, Binance.US has warned users about phishing sites that impersonate its website. A post on X warned that scammers are using lookalike websites to collect user data. It added that users should always confirm the authenticity of the QR code and website link, as it will never request a multi-factor authentication code outside its platform. Binance CSO warns users about InfoStealers malware A potential explanation also comes from Binance Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su , who said in a recent post that hackers are gaining access to user data due to malware on user devices and not a breach of Binance systems. According to him, the bad actors are using malware known as InfoStealers to collect users’ credentials from their browsers. He claimed the malware collects all information saved on browsers, including passwords and clipboard data. He added that users can unknowingly download the malware through phishing links on social media, unofficial software downloads, and malicious add-ons. Therefore, he advised them to download software only from official sources and avoid saving passwords in browsers. Su said: “This is not an isolated case. Our security team continuously monitors dark web sources and malware campaigns to identify potential threats to our users.” Meanwhile, Binance has now extended an anti-phishing code for SMS to enable users to recognize genuine text messages. The code, which is set by each user, accompanies every authentic text message from the exchange and is reportedly available in all jurisdictions where Binance has a license to operate.

This means that investors will have the chance to tackle both traditional and digital asset markets, including stocks, real-world assets (RWAs) and the successful Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). RCOF holders may also use the platform’s AI-powered Robo Advisor , a one-of-a-kind DeFi tool providing very precise prediction insights.

Despite the statement, the community is still concerned that this might have been a rug pull by the team, which controls a huge amount of the token’s total supply. Mantra Team Responds Following Token Crash In an X post , the Mantra team assured the community that the token is “fundamentally strong” despite the crash that occurred in the last 24 hours. The team blamed the crash on “reckless liquidations” and denied it had anything to do with the project. They further assured that this had nothing to do with the team and revealed that they were looking into the Mantra price crash and would share more details about what happened as soon as possible. In an X post, the project’s co-founder, John Patrick Mullin, further revealed that there was a massive forced liquidation from a large OM investor on a Centralized Exchange (CEX). However, he didn’t reveal whether it was one of the top crypto exchanges . In another X post, Mullin tried to set the record straight. He stated that they didn’t delete the Telegram channel. He further remarked that the team’s tokens all remain in custody and provided a wallet address (mantra…..quam) for community members to verify this claim. The Mantra co-founder added that they are actively figuring out why these massive forced liquidations occurred and will provide more information as soon as possible. He assured that they are still here and not going anywhere. Mantra Price Crashes By Over 80% In 24 Hours CoinMarketCap data shows that the Mantra price has crashed by over 80% in the last 24 hours. The token sharply dropped from an intra-day high of $6.3 to as low as $0.4. However, it has reclaimed the $1 price level following the team’s statement. However, amid this statement, some community members still seem convinced that this was a rug pull, as the team controls a huge amount of the token’s supply. Crypto commentator Sjuul described the OM token as the LUNA of this cycle. He further explained why the community believes the crash was a rug pull, stating that the crash began when a wallet believed to be connected to the team suddenly deposited 3.9 million OM tokens to the OKX crypto exchange. This deposit led to significant selling pressure, which caused the Mantra price to crash. Besides the token’s crash, the broader crypto market is witnessing a downtrend following US President Donald Trump’s statement in which he debunked reports of an exemption. This comes just a day after the crypto market rebounded following reports that the US president had exempted computers, phones, and chips from his tariffs on China and other countries.

According to the data he posted , Uphold has become the largest known XRP holder, overtaking Ripple and major exchanges like Bithumb and Binance in wallet holdings. The exchange’s wallet now holds over 2 billion XRP, with a reported value of approximately $3.7 billion. The address shared by Xaif is confirmed to be associated with Uphold and displays a total XRP balance of 1,833,932,521 XRP. The wallet was last active on April 11, 2025, at 9:54 PM UTC, indicating it is actively maintained. BREAKING: Uphold Surpasses Ripple! Uphold Becomes the Largest $XRP Holder Reveals over 2 Billion XRP in balance — worth $3.7 Billion! pic.twitter.com/Kn1xbTJOyP — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) April 12, 2025 Uphold’s Pro-XRP Stance Reinforced Uphold has long maintained a clear position supporting XRP, notably continuing to list and provide access to the asset during Ripple’s now-concluded legal conflict with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout that period, Uphold did not delist or restrict access to the asset, and that loyalty has not gone unnoticed by the XRP community. Uphold’s accumulation of over 2 billion XRP further reinforces its alignment with long-term XRP holders and confidence in the asset’s future utility. Uphold has consistently supported and encouraged the XRP army and has put its money where its mouth is with its strong support and large holdings. Uphold Surpasses Ripple’s Holdings Although Ripple still controls a large volume of XRP through its escrow mechanisms and company wallets, Uphold holds the most significant number of tokens in a single wallet, with recent data putting Ripple’s holdings as the fourth and fifth largest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Uphold has achieved this feat, Ripple still holds over 36 billion XRP in its escrow system. While Ripple maintains substantial holdings through escrow and company-controlled wallets, this latest development highlights how exchanges like Uphold take the lead among the XRP army. This shift signals a growing role for private platforms in distributing large-scale XRP holdings. Uphold’s accumulation reflects a deliberate approach to long-term positioning within the XRP ecosystem. Implications for XRP’s Future The presence of an exchange at the top of the XRP wallet rankings could influence how institutional and retail participants assess the asset’s distribution. Uphold’s visible support and sustained involvement may strengthen its standing among XRP holders while reinforcing confidence in the token’s infrastructure and accessibility.

According to the analyst, these pools absorb increasing amounts of XRP, effectively removing them from the circulating supply. This observation brings attention to a critical factor in XRP’s evolving market structure. As more liquidity pools go live, the amount of XRP locked in them grows, gradually shrinking the available supply. This shift comes as the XRP Ledger (XRPL) continues to evolve with DeFi capabilities, particularly since the launch of AMM features during an upgrade in 2024. IMPORTANT: I CAN’T STRESS THIS ENOUGH: AMM liquidity pools are the most underrated part of the XRP ecosystem. Why? Because XRP used in these pools is LOCKED UP. It’s not circulating. It’s not selling. It’s gone. And as more assets get tokenized… That locked supply… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 12, 2025 Supply Reduction via Liquidity Pools The design of AMM pools on the XRP Ledger requires participants to commit XRP in exchange for yield. Once deposited, that XRP remains in the pool and cannot be used elsewhere unless withdrawn. The longer this XRP stays in AMMs, the less of it remains in active circulation. This is particularly relevant as many participants provide liquidity for extended periods to earn passive income. While the digital asset’s total supply remains fixed at 100 billion tokens, only a portion is circulating due to Ripple’s large holdings of escrowed XRP. Liquidity pools now introduce a mechanism by which even circulating XRP becomes temporarily inaccessible. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This effectively functions as a supply reduction mechanism. As the tokenization of assets grows on the XRPL, more users are expected to provide liquidity across a range of asset pairs, which may further expand the number of tokens locked away. Impact of the Increased Demand On XRP With tokenization gaining traction across institutional and retail segments, demand for XRP’s underlying infrastructure may increase. If this growth coincides with a shrinking liquid supply due to liquidity pooling, the balance between supply and demand could shift. “When demand rises while supply falls… price has to move,” All Things XRP noted. This scenario depends on the broader adoption of the AMM system and the continued growth of tokenized asset markets using the XRP Ledger. If both trends hold, the XRP locked in pools could play a more direct role in supporting upward price movement by limiting immediate sell pressure. Before the launch, Ripple CTO David Schwartz stated that he was personally excited about the AMM upgrade, and the positive effects show that Ripple’s development team is making the best moves for the digital asset’s long-term future.

Meanwhile, BONK and PEPE are staging their own rallies — but there’s a new viral memecoin quickly stealing the spotlight: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves as what many are calling the next breakout meme project of 2025 . DOGE AND SHIBA INU: STILL LEGENDS, BUT ARE GAINS CAPPED? DOGE and SHIBA INU remain cultural icons in crypto. SHIBA INU’s 60,000% surge from its lows is still one of the most remarkable price movements in digital asset history. But both coins are now massive in market cap, and while they’re gaining holders again, upside expectations are far more modest. That’s why investors looking for the next 100x altcoin are scouting fresh opportunities — and that’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE NEXT 100X ALTCOIN? Launched just weeks ago, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already hit major milestones. With Stage 6 SOLD OUT , and Stage 7 now LIVE , momentum is building fast — and analysts are buzzing. This early-stage opportunity offers a current presale price under $0.0003 , with a listing target of $0.007 . That’s a potential 25x ROI , or a 2,300% gain , for early backers entering before exchange listings. FROM SHIBA’S PLAYBOOK TO MAGACOIN’S TRAJECTORY MAGACOIN FINANCE follows a similar launch arc as SHIBA INU in its early days — low entry price, high community growth, and a strong focus on viral spread across Telegram and X. Just like SHIBA hit 60,000% from low to high , some are speculating MAGACOIN FINANCE could chart a similar path — especially with its stage-based pricing that creates FOMO and rewards the earliest supporters. In under a month, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn in a loyal army of holders. Its meme-driven identity backed by a structured tokenomics plan is proving to be the winning formula in 2025 ’s meme coin resurgence. From trader Telegrams to top crypto X threads, sentiment is heating up. With Stage 7 LIVE and prices still under $0.0003 , many believe now is the moment to act — before listings go live and early ROI windows close. FINAL THOUGHTS: IS MAGACOIN FINANCE THE NEW KING? 🔥 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X While DOGE and SHIBA INU continue to gain holders and BONK and PEPE rally in their wake, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as the next viral chapter in meme coin history . Stage 7 LIVE Listing at $0.007 25x ROI potential Now featured by major crypto publishers Explosive growth backed by analyst predictions If SHIBA’s 60,000% surge proved anything, it’s that meme coins with strong narratives and early support can flip the market overnight.

Fartcoin, a Solana-based meme coin, has outperformed expectations with a 135% year-to-date rise and promising on-chain metrics like falling exchange reserves and steady whale holdings. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has dropped 20% in just 24 hours but now sits at a critical price level that could shape its near-term future. And in the background, BlockDAG is focusing less on short-term buzz and more on execution. With 10,000+ X-Series miners nearly ready for shipment and a presale already up 2,380%, raising $214 million, BDAG appears to be building its own momentum. Real-world applications, product rollout, and exchange readiness place it in a different conversation. Among all the buzz, BlockDAG may be one of the few turning intent into action. Fartcoin Resists Downtrend—Could It Push Toward $1.22? In a market that has mostly dipped, Fartcoin has moved against the trend. The price has jumped 35% from its monthly low and is now trading at $0.4755. Compared to its YTD low, the coin is up 135%. Data shows rising confidence among investors—exchange balances are down 3.62% over the past week, and 2 million tokens have moved into self-custody wallets, hinting at reduced sell pressure. The holder count now stands at more than 113,000, and key profit-taking wallets remain untouched. Technically, a cup and handle pattern is forming—often viewed as a sign of potential upside. If it plays out, the target sits around $1.22, nearly 160% above the current price. Still, a drop below $0.355 could challenge the bullish case and pull prices toward $0.20. For now, Fartcoin is attracting attention for holding up in a weak market—but whether it can break out remains to be seen. DOGE at $0.13—Can the Original Meme Coin Find Its Footing? Dogecoin recently fell by more than 20%, hitting $0.1300 as wider crypto markets experienced heavy selling. However, many are pointing to this level as a potential support zone. If DOGE can hold here, it might set the stage for a bounce. Momentum indicators suggest this scenario is possible. RSI is back above 50, and MACD has flipped bullish. Resistance is expected between $0.1400 and $0.1450. But if the price dips below $0.1350, more losses could follow. Since Dogecoin’s moves are often tied to Bitcoin’s direction, market sentiment will likely be the deciding factor. Traders looking for a low-entry position may be watching this closely. If price holds and volume returns, the stage could be set for a rebound. But for now, confirmation is still needed. BlockDAG’s Mining Rollout Approaches—Could This Be the Moment? BlockDAG is preparing for a major phase. Nearly 10,000 X-Series miners—including the X30 and X100 models—are ready for distribution ahead of its mainnet. This rollout marks a big leap in growing its ecosystem. The X30 model is designed for individuals and can mine up to 600 BDAG daily with low energy use. The X100, aimed at high-capacity miners, produces up to 2,000 BDAG per day. At the current price of $0.0248, and with a $1 target set for 2025, projected returns could reach 3,900%. BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $214 million, selling more than 19 billion coins across 27 batches. Since launching at $0.001, the price has risen by 2,380%, with each batch pushing the price higher. With exchange listings on the horizon and hardware rolling out, this moment may prove timely for new participants. For anyone wondering what the best crypto to mine in 2025 might be, BlockDAG’s combination of speed, utility, and upward projections makes it one to seriously consider. Wrapping Up! Dogecoin still has its meme-driven appeal, and Fartcoin may surprise in the short term. But when it comes to a full-package offering—utility, delivery, and long-term planning—BlockDAG stands apart. While DOGE awaits market movement and Fartcoin depends on sentiment, BlockDAG is deploying miners, running a live testnet, and setting the stage for centralized exchange listings. The foundation it’s building goes beyond speculation. With miners earning up to 2,000 BDAG daily at a low price point of $0.0248, the upside is hard to ignore. If BDAG reaches the $1 target, early adopters could see returns nearing 4,000%. This is not just about betting on the next hype wave—it’s about backing a roadmap already in motion.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 243,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on the memecoin Bonk ( BONK ). The trader shares a chart suggesting that BONK will face resistance at the $0.000012 level before printing a bullish higher low setup and rallying to his target above $0.0000145. “BONK is looking strong in the short term, and should go higher. Should be a pullback around the 200 EMA (exponential moving average) on the four-hour chart but still, I think this has pulled back enough to where any buying down here is probably reasonable.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.00001376. Turning to the low-cap altcoin Alchemist AI ( ALCH ), the analyst says the coin appears to be in an uptrend and that he’s waiting for potential dips to accumulate the asset. ALCH is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based crypto project that allows users with no coding skills to generate codes by providing natural language descriptions. Says Altcoin Sherpa, “ALCH still seems like a really strong chart, don’t see it being mentioned much. I think it’s basically taken the place of ARC; a super volatile AI coin that moves 20% a day. Not in it but traded it a lot before; will look to buy dips.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, ALCH is the 431st-largest crypto asset by market cap, trading at $0.109. Looking at Bitcoin, Altcoin Sherpa thinks that BTC will continue to consolidate within a large trading range in the short to mid-term. “Expecting there is some sort of chop between $70,000-$90,000 over the next several weeks for BTC. Relative bottom probably in, but still some more consolidation to come.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $85,366.

Citing unnamed sources, the WSJ also alleged that Binance executives are lobbying the US Treasury to reduce its oversight of the exchange’s operations. In a post on the social media platform X, CZ wrote that the “WSJ is really TRYING here,” downplaying the claims made in the report. According to the Binance co-founder, he wouldn’t have served any jail time, assuming he indeed became a government witness and provided information on Sun. Zhao knew the report was coming, as he already indicated that the “WSJ is writing another baseless hit piece” in an April 11 post on X. In the latest post, CZ reiterated his belief about the report being artificially motivated, claiming someone paid the Wall Street Journal to lead a smear campaign against him. In a response to BlockTower Capital founder Ari Paul, CZ clarified the charges brought against him by the DoJ. Zhao said: To be clear, there were NO “money laundering” or “fraud” charges. You are confusing “ANTI-money laundering” to “money laundering”. One is a failure to prevent/police. One is doing it yourself. Two very different things. CZ was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 after pleading guilty to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations as Binance CEO. The co-founder was released from US federal prison in September 2024 and has since been involved in other endeavors in and outside the cryptocurrency industry. Justin Sun Downplays CZ Plea Deal Rumor In a post on X , Sun tried to play down WSJ’s allegations against CZ, saying he is not aware of the circulating rumors. “CZ is both my mentor and a close friend—he has played a crucial role in supporting me during my entrepreneurial journey,” the TRON founder said. Sun also maintained that he has a direct and honest communication line with both CZ and the US Department of Justice. He highlighted this by mentioning that the DoJ is one of the closest and most trusted partners of T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU) — a blockchain security initiative co-founded by TRON, Tether, and TRM Labs.",Binance|binance|Changpeng “CZ” Zhao|Justin Sun|tron|US DOJ,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-14 00:30:29

With Cardano (ADA) hovering around $0.6, there’s growing anticipation surrounding its potential to rebound, driven by ongoing developments and bullish market sentiment. Yet, while Cardano maintains its place in the spotlight, there’s a new contender emerging that is quickly capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The Phase 4 presale of MUTM tokens costs $0.025 token price per token and takes place during the current period. The price of MUTM tokens will escalate to 0.03 dollars when phase 4 transitions into phase 5. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gathered $6.6 million by attracting 8200 holders since its inception. Mutuum Finance could hit $3. The Mutuum Finance team has recently introduced a new dashboard featuring a leaderboard that highlights the top 50 holders. Investors will earn bonus tokens for maintaining their position in the top 50. Mutuum Finance: Paving the Way for the Future of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance has gained rapid investor interest from its pioneering dual-lending system. Mutuum Finance uses both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems to establish its revolutionary dual-lending system within decentralized finance. Smart contracts running on P2C guide the platform to issue loans supported by ETH tokens by receiving USDT stablecoins into its lending pools. Users can use P2P system functionality to control their loan arrangements independently and maintain both privacy protections and security features. Mutuum Finance runs adaptive operations that allow profitability through interest rates exceeding 10% for users providing liquidity to their system. Although Mutuum Finance conducts all processes through third-party audits the platform places a strong emphasis both on security and transparency. Open-source smart contracts operate on the platform to create trust between users. The operating stability of the platform will increase through the introduction of a USD-pegged stablecoin and a fee-moderated program to repurchase platform tokens and enhance price stability. Through financial incentives for liquidity stakeholders who place funds on the platform the ecosystem develops stronger confidence among its members. More than 8,200 investors currently use the platform while user numbers continue to increase rapidly. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Engagement Mutuum Finance strengthens adoption by offering a $100,000 token distribution giveaway. The giveaway includes ten prize recipients who will each get $10,000 MUTM tokens. The initiative gives financial benefits to users while it inspires them to welcome more investors into the community which strengthens the overall platform engagement. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity in Phase 4 Presale Mutuum Finance offers an exclusive opportunity for early investors during its Phase 4 presale. The price of MUTM tokens is currently set at $0.025, with the price set to rise progressively from $0.025 to $0.06 over the course of the 11-stage sale. This offers up to 140% in potential gains before the token hits the market. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens could reach $3 after launch, positioning them as a major player in the DeFi market in 2025. Currently, the total market capitalization of MUTM tokens exceeds $6.6 million, showing strong investor confidence. While Cardano (ADA) is positioning itself for a potential rebound, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a serious performer in the DeFi market. With its innovative dual-lending system, strong security measures, and a rapidly growing community of over 8,100 users, Mutuum Finance is gaining significant attention. The Phase 4 presale offers an exclusive opportunity to invest at just $0.025 per token, with the price expected to rise to $0.06, presenting potential gains of up to 140%. With a $100,000 giveaway further fueling interest, Mutuum Finance could see its value soar, possibly reaching $3 post-launch. For those looking to capitalize on the next big DeFi project, Mutuum Finance offers a better opportunity.
