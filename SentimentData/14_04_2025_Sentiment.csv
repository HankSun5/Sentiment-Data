Cardano (ADA) also appears set for a price increase. Investors might find it an opportune moment to consider these digital assets. The forthcoming analysis reveals which cryptocurrencies are primed for a bullish run and why they deserve attention now. Cardano: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels in Focus ADA price action over the past month shows a modest drop of roughly 8%, with weekly declines near 1.22%. Over the last six months, Cardano has surged close to 77%, marking a strong upward push for longer-term holders. This blend of short-term softness paired with solid long-term gains highlights a period of volatility and gradual recovery. Current levels see Cardano trading between $0.47 and $1.02, with resistance around $1.37 and support near $0.27. Technical signals point to a slight bearish leaning without a decisive trend, presenting a range-bound market. Traders might consider buying near support and testing resistance while keeping an eye on any emerging breakouts. Hedera HBAR: Six-Month Surge Meets Short-Term Correction Over the past month, HBAR price declined nearly 9.6%, while the six-month period delivered a robust 219% gain. Prices ranged between $0.117 and $0.248, indicating a volatile swing that contrasts short-term pullbacks with long-term upward momentum. This behavior shows clear recovery potential even amid recent dips. Current price action trades within the $0.117-$0.248 corridor, with immediate resistance at $0.33 and a further hurdle at $0.47. Support appears near $0.07. Despite strong long-term gains, short-term indicators lean slightly bearish with an RSI around 48. Traders may look for a steady break above $0.33 while watching for reversals near support levels. Conclusion ADA and HBAR have shown promising potential for growth. Both coins have unique features and strong communities supporting them. The bullish outlook for HBAR and the anticipated price rise for ADA highlight their attractiveness. This could be a good time to consider investing in these two assets. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With the continued rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the growing adoption of blockchain technology, it’s important to keep an eye on the projects that are standing out. These aren’t just flashy names but solid, long-term alternatives to traditional investment avenues. Among these projects, Qubetics , SEI, and Injective have firmly established themselves as key players. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what each one brings to the table, their milestones, and how they position themselves as alternatives to traditional investments.

They represent the forward-thinking alternatives that discerning crypto backers are turning to, while traditional financial markets continue to rely on outdated models.

43303102,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104907,1744579470,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Tron Founder Celebrates 300 Million Addresses as TRX Crosses $0.25,https://zycrypto.com/tron-founder-celebrates-300-million-addresses-as-trx-crosses-0-25/,"Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to celebrate a major milestone for his digital currency network. The crypto entrepreneur claimed that the programmable blockchain now boasts massive accounts, totaling 300 million worldwide. This figure dwarfs the 1 billion+ figure commanded by Bitcoin, but it is only slightly less than Ethereum’s 321 million public addresses. It is a massive achievement by the Tron Foundation, considering its standing in the charts. In the same tweet, Sun revealed that the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the crypto’s staking and DeFi ecosystem is nearing record highs and hovering just below $20 billion. At the same time, the total transfer volume, another on-chain statistic, is close to $17 trillion. These figures are being used by Sun to drum up support for his altcoin, and the price has since surpassed the resistance at around $0.25. However, the move above this figure has been less than convincing, and the crypto could face some pressure going into the first day of the new week. Does Tron Boast 300 Million Users? Despite Sun’s claim of hundreds of millions of users, on further on-chain investigation, it was found out by the ZyCrypto team that the founder is conflating the number of users with the number of blockchain addresses created on the network. This is often used by promoters looking to get their cryptocurrency into discussion circles on social media. The reality is that this metric is far from a reliable statistic when calculating the number of users of a blockchain network because a single user can create multiple accounts, as they have done for all major blockchains. According to Dune Analytics , this is the graph of active addresses on the TRX blockchain: Image Source: Dune Analytics Currently, the number of active daily addresses on the Tron network hovers around 13.6 million, which is a healthy figure but only a fraction of the figure claimed by Sun. Many users also maintain multiple active addresses, so the actual figure is likely to be even lower. There is no concrete way of knowing the exact number of unique individual users using TRX, but it is expected to be in several million. Is Tron back? Tron has had a strong last two to three quarters as it managed to capture the attention of the market after several years of relative hiatus. The cryptocurrency was launched during the first altcoin boom of 2017-2018 and experienced massive gains before capitulating much of them in a major crash in 2018 that wiped out more than 90% of its value. TRX then had a lacklustre 2020-2021 bull market, fading away in the coin market charts. However, 2024 saw the once-fancied digital cryptocurrency awaken from its deep slumber and post a new All-Time High (ATH) of $0.45 in the buildup of the calendar year. While TRX has lost around 45% of its value ever since amid even deeper short-term plunges, the altcoin could be in for a major end to 2025 if the larger bull market resumes at some point in 2025.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-13 21:24:30

Despite this decline, SHIB has fared better than Dogecoin (DOGE), which has seen a steeper drop of 27% over the same period. The downturn aligns with a broader cryptocurrency market correction, led by Bitcoin’s fall below the $78,000 mark. Notably, even before the latest market decline, on-chain data signaled diminishing interest in SHIB. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted this trend tweeting , “Whale activity on the ShibaInu network has declined by 79% over the past three months.” Despite the recent weakness, some analysts remain optimistic about SHIB’s potential. On Wednesday, analyst Javon Marks pointed to a bullish chart formation that suggests a massive rally could be on the horizon. “SHIB (Shiba Inu) prices maintaining the structure of a large Inverse Head & Shoulder and with the $0.000081 target still in play, an over 402% run to reach it could come out of this.” He tweeted. Meanwhile, other indicators point to signs of accumulation and a possible reversal for SHIB. The price is currently consolidating, with the RSI at 54.72, indicating neutral momentum. While buying pressure is present, it remains insufficient for a breakout. The Stochastic RSI at 54.72/57.76 has cooled off but could signal renewed buying if it turns upward. A move above 60 RSI may spark an uptrend, while a drop below 50 could signal further downside. At the same time, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is flattening from bearish territory, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. Additionally, although trading volume has only increased by 13% in the past 24 hours to $312 million, it still signals ongoing accumulation. Beyond price action, SHIB’s ecosystem continues to expand with key developments aimed at improving liquidity and user experience. Earlier this week, the Shiba Inu team introduced upgraded liquidity pools designed to enhance liquidity management. The update allows users to seamlessly migrate, import, or create liquidity pools, streamlining the process. These advancements have generated significant interest in Shiba Inu, driving a surge in wallet addresses on its Ethereum Layer 2 network. Over the past week, the number of wallet addresses has skyrocketed by around 500%, jumping from approximately 9.4 million on February 17 to over 55.7 million as of February 24. Another bullish factor for SHIB is its increasing token burn rate. On Thursday, the Shiba Inu burn rate spiked by over 1,300%, removing over 30 million SHIB tokens from circulation in just one day. Token burning helps reduce supply, making SHIB scarcer, which could positively impact its price in the long run. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.000012, reflecting a 3.91% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-13 21:37:03

On April 13, Lutnick told ABC News that the reciprocal tariff exemption was temporary until the administration established a sector tariff regime for semiconductor products, which includes phones, graphics processors, and computing chips in a ""month or two."" Lutnick added: ""President Trump has called out pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. He called them sector tariffs, and those are not available for negotiation. They are just going to be part of making sure we ensure core national security items are made in this country."" ""We can't be relying on China for fundamental things we need. Our medicines and our semiconductors need to be built in America,"" Lutnick continued. The official also said he was confident that the US and China would arrive at a trade deal through negotiations. The emphasis on national security and onshoring critical industries could signal that the trade tariffs will be a long-term geostrategic policy and not simply a short-term negotiation tactic to make US exports more attractive, as some analysts have suggested. The Volatility S&P Index (VIX), a measure of the S&P stock index’s volatility, remains elevated amid macroeconomic uncertainty. Source: TradingView Related: Bitcoin ‘decouples,’ stocks lose $3.5T amid Trump tariff war and Fed warning of ‘higher inflation’ Trade war heightens volatility and sends markets tumbling Trump's trade tariffs crashed the stock and crypto markets , wiping away trillions in shareholder value as investors dumped riskier assets on fears of a lengthy trade war between the United States and its trading partners. In an April 10 X Post , Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas cited the SPY US Equity History Volume chart as evidence that the S&P 500 stock market index is now more volatile than Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to the analyst, the S&P 500 Index hit a volatility level of 74 in April, compared to Bitcoin's 71. Stocks and crypto pumped following rumors of the Trump administration initiating a 90-day reciprocal tariff pause. Approximately $2 trillion was pumped into stocks on rumors of softer trade policies. Much of this value was then wiped away when Trump claimed that rumors of a 90-day pause were false and returned once the Trump administration did, in fact, issue a reciprocal tariff pause in the following days.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/stellar-xlm-forms-triangle-pattern-heres-the-implication/,"Stellar (XLM), the digital asset powering cross-border payments and smart contract capabilities on the Stellar blockchain, is currently displaying a technical formation that could ignite a significant price move. According to renowned crypto analyst Ali, who shared the observation via X, XLM is forming a classic triangle pattern, a well-known setup in technical analysis that typically precedes a breakout. #Stellar $XLM is forming a triangle pattern that could lead to a 15% price move! pic.twitter.com/zDUf3weYHe — Ali (@ali_charts) April 12, 2025 Technical Analysis Points to Impending Volatility The triangle pattern indicates market consolidation, where price action narrows as buyers and sellers converge in anticipation of a breakout. In Stellar’s case, the tightening range is likely a prelude to increased volatility. Based on Ali’s assessment, this pattern could result in a price move of approximately 15% once a breakout direction is confirmed. Analysts often regard triangle patterns as continuation or reversal signals depending on the preceding trend. Stellar’s recent tight trading range sets the stage for a potential breakout, which could spark renewed buying or selling momentum. If bulls push the price above the upper trendline with robust volume, XLM could see a rally toward key resistance zones. Conversely, a breakdown could test previous support levels. Broader Market Context and Stellar’s Fundamentals While technical patterns like this triangle provide short-term trading signals, it’s essential to consider the broader market environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum—market leaders—have shown mixed momentum, and their next moves could influence altcoins like Stellar. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory updates, and on-chain developments will influence XLM’s price direction. Stellar remains fundamentally solid, with ongoing development around its smart contract capabilities and cross-border payment utility. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) continues to pursue partnerships in emerging markets and with financial institutions, reinforcing its relevance as a blockchain platform focused on financial inclusion and interoperability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Awaits Breakout Confirmation As the triangle pattern narrows and momentum indicators near neutral, traders are awaiting a breakout or breakdown to confirm the potential 15% move predicted by Ali. Traders and investors alike would do well to monitor volume spikes, candlestick formations, and broader market sentiment to navigate the outcome of this setup.

The findings hint at a sector still in its early phases, shaped largely by enthusiasts and trendsetters rather than the broader mainstream. Who’s Driving Crypto AI Hype According to a recent CoinGecko survey , 59.3% of respondents – nearly three in five – identified as pioneers in the crypto AI space, a group composed of 26.6% self-described ‘Innovators’ and 32.7% ‘Early adopters.’ This high concentration of early-stage adopters deviates from the traditional bell curve of technology adoption and suggests that crypto AI is still largely in the hands of tech-forward enthusiasts rather than the broader market. While this may be partially attributed to self-selection bias, given the survey’s appeal to those already interested in the sector, it may also reflect the current positioning of crypto AI as a niche yet rapidly evolving frontier within the broader crypto ecosystem. On the other hand, 34.7% of respondents viewed themselves as part of the ‘mainstream’ adoption phase, comprising 22.8% ‘Early majority’ and 11.9% ‘Late majority.’ This distribution signals that while interest in crypto AI is growing, wider adoption still hinges on demonstrating real-world utility to more cautious users. The remaining 6.1% of participants identified as ‘Laggards’ – those skeptical or resistant to change – indicating a small but notable segment of the community unconvinced by the crypto AI narrative. Novice Polarized Over Crypto AI Adoption Interestingly, adoption attitudes varied based on user experience levels within the crypto space. Participants in their first market cycle showed the most polarized views, with 31.5% identifying as ‘Innovators’ and 7.4% as ‘Laggards,’ a trend likely driven by newcomers entering the market during a wave of AI-related hype . In comparison, more seasoned participants – those in their second cycle or beyond – showed more balanced adoption patterns, with second-cycle users skewing toward the ‘Early majority’ and veterans leaning more toward ‘Innovator’ status.

43303815,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104912,1744580875,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Pundit Shares What Ripple’s XRP Value Will Be If It Replaces SWIFT,https://zycrypto.com/pundit-shares-what-ripples-xrp-value-will-be-if-it-replaces-swift/,"As the global financial system evolves towards faster and more efficient payment solutions, XRP has emerged as a potential disruptor to SWIFT, the longstanding leader in cross-border transactions. Notably, the latest speculation on XRP’s potential to overtake SWIFT has reignited debate, driven by a bold claim from DigitalIG, a former London-based fund manager and outspoken XRP advocate. “When XRP replaces SWIFT, it will be valued beyond $15,000 per token,” he tweeted Saturday. He highlighted that XRP’s design allows for such valuations, as each token can be divided into 1,000,000 smaller units known as drops. Since its establishment in 1973, SWIFT has been the backbone of global finance, connecting over 11,000 financial institutions across more than 200 countries. It processes over $5 trillion in transactions daily, translating to an annual volume of approximately $1.25 quadrillion. However, SWIFT’s reliance on a correspondent banking network often results in inefficiencies, delays, and high costs. These limitations have led financial institutions to explore alternative solutions, with Ripple and its native asset, XRP , emerging as a strong contender by providing real-time settlement using XRP as a bridge currency. Transactions on RippleNet are completed within seconds at a fraction of the cost associated with SWIFT’s traditional multi-day process. That said, the idea of XRP replacing SWIFT has also been supported by various financial analysts, with some estimating that if XRP were to handle 5-10% of SWIFT’s annual transaction volume, its price and market capitalization would need to rise significantly. In October 2024, global investment bank Houlihan Lokey identified Ripple as one of SWIFT’s strongest competitors, citing its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service as a key advantage. Additionally, in January 2025, Mark Yusko, CEO and CIO of the billion-dollar investment fund Morgan Creek Capital Management, expressed interest in supporting XRP if it replaced SWIFT. However, despite its potential, several hurdles must be overcome for XRP to achieve such a valuation. Regulatory clarity remains a significant obstacle, particularly in the U.S., where Ripple has been engaged in a lengthy legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A favorable resolution could boost institutional confidence in XRP and accelerate adoption. Scalability is another critical factor. SWIFT processes enormous transaction volumes daily, and for XRP to compete at this level, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) must be capable of handling similar loads reliably. While the XRPL already enables rapid settlements, further enhancements in liquidity management and infrastructure would be necessary to match SWIFT’s scale. Ripple’s ODL service is actively addressing these challenges, but more work is required before XRP can fully replace SWIFT.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-13 21:47:55

Despite some market fluctuations, Solana could soar to new heights, potentially reaching over $300 by the time of the next Bitcoin halving. However, the next big disruptor in the crypto market is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.6 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 8200 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 8200 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $6.6 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. MUTM has introduced tangible features, including a new dashboard leaderboard that tracks its top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. As investors grow more utility-focused, MUTM’s rise signals what could be the next win in crypto, substance over spectacle. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. While Solana (SOL) is primed for a potential rebound, reaching over $300 by the next Bitcoin halving, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could outperform expectations with a forecasted 50x growth. The fourth phase of its presale has already raised $6.6 million, with MUTM tokens priced at $0.025 and set to rise to $0.06 at launch. Don’t miss out on this high-growth opportunity.

Among them Ruvi AI has just launched its presale with a great value proposition driven by its AI powered ecosystem, attractive incentive structure and huge growth potential. Token prices start at $0.01 and you can earn up to 100% bonuses. Ruvi AI has already raised over $100,000 with more than 10M sold in just a few days since launch. AI and Blockchain for Real World Impact Ruvi AI stands out by merging AI and blockchain to create solutions for decentralized applications, content creation and analytics. This positions the project to tap into two big areas of the tech space. Unlike speculative assets Ruvi AI brings a tangible use case to the table catering to industries that are increasingly using AI for efficiency and innovation. The presale is priced at $0.01 per token to attract early adopters looking for high ROI from ground floor investment opportunities. Upon successful launch with a projected listing price of $0.07 those who buy in during the presale will get an immediate 600% return. Such numbers show the growth potential of Ruvi AI and why it’s attractive to both institutional and retail investors. Incentive Structure A key feature of the Ruvi AI presale is the tiered VIP bonus structure which rewards early investors with additional tokens based on their contribution level. Bonuses range from 25% to 100% and shows a clear incentive for big capital commitments. For example, an investor that qualifies for the VIP 5 tier with $5,000 investment gets 500,000 tokens at $0.01 each. But with the 100% bonus in this tier the token count doubles to 1,000,000. So at the projected listing price of $0.07 the total value of the tokens would be $70,000. This shows Ruvi AI not only rewards early participation but also the long term confidence Ruvi AI has in the project. These bonuses complement Ruvi AI’s bigger goal of building a collaborative and invested community. By incentivizing immediate and big commitments Ruvi AI aligns its project goals with investor goals. Leaderboard Rewards for Community Engagement To add more structure to its reward system Ruvi AI has introduced a leaderboard rewards program for its top 1,000 holders. This is designed to encourage long term participation and offers fixed token allocations to investors based on their holdings. This ranges from tens of thousands of additional tokens for mid tier positions to much bigger rewards for top ranked participants. What’s unique about this is its inclusive design. Rewards are distributed on top of the VIP bonuses so it’s an additional layer of benefit to those who are committed to Ruvi AI’s long term vision. By combining financial incentives with community building strategies the project is solidifying its commitment to building an engaged investor base. Ruvi AI’s Growth Potential Ruvi AI’s real world utility, innovative technology and well aligned incentive structure makes it a strong player in the crypto space. The project is riding the growing demand for AI driven solutions and the utility and scalability of blockchain. Analysts are getting more and more optimistic about Ruvi AI’s potential with predictions that the token could reach $1 in the near future. Such a milestone would be a 100x return for early investors and shows the project’s strong growth potential. This is because of Ruvi AI’s integrated utility, AI and blockchain technology and robust incentive structures that has caught attention. Conclusion With $0.01 presale and innovative reward mechanisms Ruvi AI is an interesting option for those looking into new projects with high growth potential. Its dual focus on technology and investor incentives is a solid foundation for building short term and long term value.

Bitcoin, widely seen as the bedrock of the digital asset space, has experienced a notable retreat in price and market cap. Ethereum, though still central to DeFi and smart contracts, has taken an even steeper fall. These movements are prompting investors to reconsider where momentum is truly building. That’s where BlockDAG enters the picture. While many projects remain in the concept stage, BlockDAG is actively rolling out products—its Beta Testnet is live, its miner app has attracted hundreds of thousands, and over 19.2 billion coins have already sold during presale. With $214 million raised so far, BlockDAG is shaping the conversation—not just joining it. For a growing number of buyers, this isn’t a Bitcoin or Ethereum replacement—it’s a new contender with something concrete to offer. Bitcoin Faces Pressure, but Remains a Long-Term Anchor As of April 4, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $83,844 with a total market cap of $1.66 trillion. Just three months earlier, BTC was priced at $98,236 and carried a $1.95 trillion market cap. This marks a 14.7% drop in value and a 14.5% market cap decline over the quarter. Despite the correction, Bitcoin still holds firm as a long-term play. Compared to the same time last year, its market cap has grown nearly 28%—a sign of continued institutional and retail belief. As the original cryptocurrency, it maintains its leadership by market size, even during temporary downtrends. Ethereum Sees a 50% Slide, but Fundamentals Remain Solid Ethereum (ETH) currently sits at $1,805 with a market capitalization of $218.4 billion. Three months ago, ETH was trading at $3,658 with a $440.7 billion market cap. That’s a steep drop—down 50.6% in price and 50.4% in market cap during the first quarter of 2025. This pullback follows a strong year in 2024 and reflects wider market corrections. Yet, Ethereum continues to lead in smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi. Its scaling solutions and Layer-2 developments are progressing steadily. Although its market cap has declined about 45% year-over-year, Ethereum still holds a central role in Web3’s future. BlockDAG’s Presale Soars Past $214M After Keynote 3 Rollout BlockDAG’s third Keynote wasn’t just an update—it was a game-changer. The live demo of its Beta “Primordial” Testnet and visuals of 10,000 ASIC miners being shipped sent a strong message: this project is executing. With 750,000 users mining via the X1 App and 400,000 playing Tap Miner, the user base is expanding rapidly. In the days following the Keynote, presale numbers surged. BlockDAG crossed $214 million raised, with over 19.2 billion coins sold. At the current Batch 27 price of $0.0248, early adopters have already realized a 2,380% ROI since Batch 1. These aren’t projected gains—they’re realized returns backed by working tech. This kind of growth, coupled with tangible milestones, has made BlockDAG one of the most talked-about presales in crypto. Its hybrid DAG + PoW structure, active user adoption, and clear development roadmap are building serious momentum. Each batch increases in price, meaning delayed action equals higher cost. Keynote 3, for many, was the clear signal to act. With credible infrastructure, a growing ecosystem, and real-time delivery, BlockDAG is attracting buyer interest not by hype—but by proving value. Buyers Are Watching Where Progress Happens While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant names, their recent pullbacks have prompted investors to explore other options. The focus is now shifting toward projects that are actively building and delivering results—something BlockDAG has made central to its strategy. With a working Testnet, a highly engaged community, and $214 million raised, BlockDAG is moving beyond potential—it’s becoming reality. This isn’t about dethroning the giants, but rather identifying where the next wave of growth may come from. As others consolidate or tread water, BlockDAG is advancing on all fronts. In 2025, that kind of momentum is exactly what forward-looking buyers are tracking.

While the Solana (SOL) price today just spiked to $118 on fresh whale activity and XRP technical analysis points to a bullish breakout after Ripple’s $1.25B Hidden Road acquisition, another opportunity is quietly stacking up returns under the radar. BlockDAG , already climbing presale charts with over $214 million raised, now has users buzzing—not just for its coin, but for its affiliate loop. The model? Earn USDT instantly by referring others, then reinvest it to scoop up more BDAG coins. It’s turning $100 into a snowball effect—“USDT in, BDAG up.” Crypto circles are calling it a launchpad with ROI baked in. It’s the kind of setup that’s catching attention from everyone tracking the next top 10 crypto—and it’s happening while most are still watching charts. The Passive Income Loop That’s Fueling BlockDAG’s Growth BlockDAG’s affiliate program is quickly becoming the easiest passive earning play in crypto. With just one referral link, users are getting paid in USDT instantly every time someone buys BDAG coins. But it’s not just about earning—those rewards can be immediately reinvested, creating a compounding loop where your holdings grow without extra effort. It’s why people are saying, “USDT in, BDAG up.” The program lets you earn 6% to 10% cashback per referral, with no cap on how many people you bring in. What makes it different is how fast it works—rewards hit your wallet right after a qualifying buy, and there’s no waiting period or payout limit. People are literally using the same $100 five times—and getting paid each time. It’s simple: share, earn, reinvest, repeat. BlockDAG’s presale is now in its 27th batch, with BDAG priced at $0.0248. Over 19.2 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $214 million—all without any venture capital. Those who joined early are already up over 2,380%. The presale is tied to key launches too, with a beta testnet live, a 150% retro bonus for all buyers, and listings planned on 10 major CEXs. With momentum this strong, it’s no surprise that BlockDAG is being discussed as a top 10 crypto contender. Its affiliate model is adding fuel to that push, creating a snowball effect of users stacking BDAG while they sleep. For anyone eyeing the next top 10 crypto, this loop might be the real alpha. Solana (SOL) Price Today Spikes After Whale Buy Solana (SOL) price today jumped 8% to $118 after a whale snapped up 32,000 SOL for $3.72 million, according to Lookonchain. This sudden move came after weeks of downward pressure and has put Solana back in focus as traders speculate whether it’s building toward another rally. The same whale had also bought at higher levels before—$157 and $216—suggesting long-term confidence despite market dips. Supporters are watching key technical levels, with $112 recently breaking down and $118 now acting as potential resistance. However, the Firedancer upgrade, expected to improve Solana’s speed and scalability, could be a game-changer. Solana (SOL) price today is still far below its all-time high, but the bullish setup around whale accumulation, ETF rumors, and inclusion in U.S. digital asset funds is creating buzz. If the trend holds, SOL could challenge higher zones soon, especially if it breaks resistance and finds support above key EMAs. XRP Technical Analysis Turns Bullish After SEC Update XRP just jumped 30% after Ripple and the SEC filed a joint motion to pause their legal appeals, hinting that a long-awaited settlement could be close. Adding fuel to the rally, Ripple announced a $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road, a London-based prime brokerage. This move is expected to boost institutional liquidity and support the rollout of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD through Hidden Road’s global network. According to XRP technical analysis, the token has broken above its 50-day moving average for the first time in months and is now trading at $2.00. Analysts are eyeing $2.50 as the next resistance zone, while support holds near $1.50. The RSI is nearing 65, showing bullish strength but hinting at a possible cooldown. Still, with over 70 financial institutions already using Ripple’s cross-border payment network and the legal case nearly resolved, XRP technical analysis now supports a potential breakout scenario in the weeks ahead. Summing Up Solana (SOL) price today is holding above $118 after a major whale buy, with the Firedancer upgrade and ETF speculation keeping bullish interest alive. Meanwhile, XRP technical analysis shows strength after Ripple’s $1.25 billion Hidden Road deal and signs of a legal settlement with the SEC. Both networks are gaining momentum, but they still face short-term resistance and volatility. That’s where BlockDAG shifts the game.

Speaking on ABC's This Week today, Lutnick explained that smartphones, laptops and other key consumer electronics were temporarily exempted from high import tariffs earlier this month, but that the exemption would never become permanent. “All of these products will fall under semiconductors and will have a special focus tariff to ensure the resupply of these products,” Lutnick said. Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Praises This Altcoin Unknown to Most New duties targeting semiconductors and electronic components are expected to be implemented next month, and additional duties on pharmaceuticals will follow in one to two months, Lutnick added. The administration’s overall goal is to bolster domestic manufacturing in sectors vital to national security, including chipmaking and flat-panel manufacturing. “We need chips, we need flat panels, we need them made in America,” Lutnick said. The statements came just days after U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a bulletin late Friday confirming temporary exemptions for a number of electronics from reciprocal tariffs that President Donald Trump announced at the beginning of the month. *This is not investment advice.

According to reports from users of the exchanges, the scammers are sending messages that look genuine. Text messages shared by users follow a similar pattern. They call attention to a security issue and require the user to call a number to resolve it. By doing this, they bypass anti-phishing safeguards that detect malicious links but not phone numbers. Users were getting alerts from various issues including reports of log-in from a different location, adding a new 2-factor authentication device, or connecting to a new hardware wallet. So far, there has been no report of any victim, but users on X have alerted others about the risks, noting that Binance will never ask its customers to call a number. Meanwhile, one user mentioned that he called the number. SMS Phishing scam to Binance user (Source: X/ Public_Enemy_01) He said: “New scam @binance …… it came from the same number you text me from aswell. Rang it, spoke to Abdul in Landan, who didn’t like my tone for some reason and hung up. Watch out people.” Interestingly, several users claim the text messages come from the same sender ID Binance uses for communications, leading to more uncertainty among users about the authenticity of the messages. Binance says the data leak is not from its systems Meanwhile, there are speculations about how the scammers got user data. Many believe they bought it from the dark web and are now using it for a targeted campaign. According to one user, an anonymous actor recently offered a database of Gemini and Binance users for sale. The user claimed that a 2019 leak of Binance Know Your Customer (KYC) data is the source of the database. However, Binance has denied this, noting that it examined the hacker’s data and that the records are not connected to Binance. Nevertheless, Binance.US has warned users about phishing sites that impersonate its website. A post on X warned that scammers are using lookalike websites to collect user data. It added that users should always confirm the authenticity of the QR code and website link, as it will never request a multi-factor authentication code outside its platform. Binance CSO warns users about InfoStealers malware A potential explanation also comes from Binance Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su , who said in a recent post that hackers are gaining access to user data due to malware on user devices and not a breach of Binance systems. According to him, the bad actors are using malware known as InfoStealers to collect users’ credentials from their browsers. He claimed the malware collects all information saved on browsers, including passwords and clipboard data. He added that users can unknowingly download the malware through phishing links on social media, unofficial software downloads, and malicious add-ons. Therefore, he advised them to download software only from official sources and avoid saving passwords in browsers. Su said: “This is not an isolated case. Our security team continuously monitors dark web sources and malware campaigns to identify potential threats to our users.” Meanwhile, Binance has now extended an anti-phishing code for SMS to enable users to recognize genuine text messages. The code, which is set by each user, accompanies every authentic text message from the exchange and is reportedly available in all jurisdictions where Binance has a license to operate.

By using the power of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, RCO Finance is positioned as a future-ready fintech solution aiming to democratize access to both conventional and decentralized finance. Among the many financial products the platform offers are staking, yield farming, loans, borrowing, token trading, and more all within a safe and decentralized environment. RCOF Token Presale’s Unique Opportunities Currently in stage five of the token presale, there are still abundant opportunities for those looking to participate. Having raised nearly $15 million, RCO Finance has also decided to launch its beta platform – a rare move in the DeFi space. This choice increases RCO Finance’s attractiveness by giving users the opportunity to try a broad spectrum of tools and solutions before the expected complete launch later this year. The platform’s utilities, which motivate user involvement in the governance model by compensating holders for voting on marketplace choices, help to encourage institutional interest in the token presale even more. By use of staking, RCOF owners may receive a 10% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). RCO Finance takes a different strategy than conventional staking pools with set quantities of liquidity. The next platform distributes 20% of every new RCOF deposit straight to liquidity. This suggests that you gain advantages, and your investments help the platform’s continuous enhancements. Holders of RCOF also receive notable trading fee savings. Holding and using RCOF for trading operations becomes financially beneficial since the more tokens a user owns, the greater the discount they get. Discover The Potential Of RCO Finance’s AI Power For anyone wishing to engage in RCO Finance’s token presale now and join over 10,000 users already enjoying such improvements, these advantages are only the tip of the iceberg. RCOF investors get free access to RCO Finance’s AI-powered analytical tools, which let them examine more than 150,000 distinct asset classes using sophisticated data-driven insights and performance criteria. This means that investors will have the chance to tackle both traditional and digital asset markets, including stocks, real-world assets (RWAs) and the successful Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). RCOF holders may also use the platform’s AI-powered Robo Advisor , a one-of-a-kind DeFi tool providing very precise prediction insights. By use of machine learning algorithms, this tool creates tailored investment plans and modifies asset allocations to maximize performance, hence providing specific financial goals matching personal investment and trading suggestions. With the Robo Advisor, investors may control their portfolios efficiently across both conventional and cryptocurrency markets since it removes emotional biases and finds market trends human experts could miss. Investors can thus grab early chances in trendy cryptocurrencies, much as memecoins with possible exponential growth, as possibilities can be exploited only by traders using the advanced technologies of the Robo Advisor. The crypto market offers comparable possibilities around the clock, all year long; the Robo Advisor can assist in capturing them, maybe changing a $500 portfolio into $1 million in a fairly short period. Time Is Running Out The privacy-first atmosphere is another major advantage for investors taking part in RCOF’s token presale. Prioritizing user privacy and anonymity, RCO Finance runs in a know-your-customer (KYC)-free environment. Plus, continuous smart contract audits conducted by SolidProof, a leader in this space, ensures global regulatory compliance and the seamless operation of RCO Finance’s ecosystem for users worldwide. Since the first stage of the token presale, early investors have already witnessed a 700% rise in their investments. Those lucky enough to buy RCOF coins at this moment, however, are still set for significant short-term returns. Experts forecast a 600% growth for RCOF and its investors once listed on major crypto exchanges this year, as the token is expected to climb from $0.10 to $0.60, driven by increasing institutional interest and the platform’s services. This indicates that there is still an opportunity to engage. Participate in RCO Finance’s token presale now to be ahead of the curve before it is too late.

Bitcoin (BTC) , sitting above $81,000 , still has long-term potential—but at most, analysts are projecting a 2x–3x return from here. Compare that with MAGACOINFINANCE , which is priced at just $0.0002909 and targeting a confirmed listing at $0.007 . That’s a 25x return locked in before public launch .

Despite the statement, the community is still concerned that this might have been a rug pull by the team, which controls a huge amount of the token’s total supply. Mantra Team Responds Following Token Crash In an X post , the Mantra team assured the community that the token is “fundamentally strong” despite the crash that occurred in the last 24 hours. The team blamed the crash on “reckless liquidations” and denied it had anything to do with the project. They further assured that this had nothing to do with the team and revealed that they were looking into the Mantra price crash and would share more details about what happened as soon as possible. In an X post, the project’s co-founder, John Patrick Mullin, further revealed that there was a massive forced liquidation from a large OM investor on a Centralized Exchange (CEX). However, he didn’t reveal whether it was one of the top crypto exchanges . In another X post, Mullin tried to set the record straight. He stated that they didn’t delete the Telegram channel. He further remarked that the team’s tokens all remain in custody and provided a wallet address (mantra…..quam) for community members to verify this claim. The Mantra co-founder added that they are actively figuring out why these massive forced liquidations occurred and will provide more information as soon as possible. He assured that they are still here and not going anywhere. Mantra Price Crashes By Over 80% In 24 Hours CoinMarketCap data shows that the Mantra price has crashed by over 80% in the last 24 hours. The token sharply dropped from an intra-day high of $6.3 to as low as $0.4. However, it has reclaimed the $1 price level following the team’s statement. However, amid this statement, some community members still seem convinced that this was a rug pull, as the team controls a huge amount of the token’s supply. Crypto commentator Sjuul described the OM token as the LUNA of this cycle. He further explained why the community believes the crash was a rug pull, stating that the crash began when a wallet believed to be connected to the team suddenly deposited 3.9 million OM tokens to the OKX crypto exchange. This deposit led to significant selling pressure, which caused the Mantra price to crash. Besides the token’s crash, the broader crypto market is witnessing a downtrend following US President Donald Trump’s statement in which he debunked reports of an exemption. This comes just a day after the crypto market rebounded following reports that the US president had exempted computers, phones, and chips from his tariffs on China and other countries.

According to the data he posted , Uphold has become the largest known XRP holder, overtaking Ripple and major exchanges like Bithumb and Binance in wallet holdings. The exchange’s wallet now holds over 2 billion XRP, with a reported value of approximately $3.7 billion. The address shared by Xaif is confirmed to be associated with Uphold and displays a total XRP balance of 1,833,932,521 XRP. The wallet was last active on April 11, 2025, at 9:54 PM UTC, indicating it is actively maintained. BREAKING: Uphold Surpasses Ripple! Uphold Becomes the Largest $XRP Holder Reveals over 2 Billion XRP in balance — worth $3.7 Billion! pic.twitter.com/Kn1xbTJOyP — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) April 12, 2025 Uphold’s Pro-XRP Stance Reinforced Uphold has long maintained a clear position supporting XRP, notably continuing to list and provide access to the asset during Ripple’s now-concluded legal conflict with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout that period, Uphold did not delist or restrict access to the asset, and that loyalty has not gone unnoticed by the XRP community. Uphold’s accumulation of over 2 billion XRP further reinforces its alignment with long-term XRP holders and confidence in the asset’s future utility. Uphold has consistently supported and encouraged the XRP army and has put its money where its mouth is with its strong support and large holdings. Uphold Surpasses Ripple’s Holdings Although Ripple still controls a large volume of XRP through its escrow mechanisms and company wallets, Uphold holds the most significant number of tokens in a single wallet, with recent data putting Ripple’s holdings as the fourth and fifth largest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Uphold has achieved this feat, Ripple still holds over 36 billion XRP in its escrow system. While Ripple maintains substantial holdings through escrow and company-controlled wallets, this latest development highlights how exchanges like Uphold take the lead among the XRP army. This shift signals a growing role for private platforms in distributing large-scale XRP holdings. Uphold’s accumulation reflects a deliberate approach to long-term positioning within the XRP ecosystem. Implications for XRP’s Future The presence of an exchange at the top of the XRP wallet rankings could influence how institutional and retail participants assess the asset’s distribution. Uphold’s visible support and sustained involvement may strengthen its standing among XRP holders while reinforcing confidence in the token’s infrastructure and accessibility.

According to the analyst, these pools absorb increasing amounts of XRP, effectively removing them from the circulating supply. This observation brings attention to a critical factor in XRP’s evolving market structure. As more liquidity pools go live, the amount of XRP locked in them grows, gradually shrinking the available supply. This shift comes as the XRP Ledger (XRPL) continues to evolve with DeFi capabilities, particularly since the launch of AMM features during an upgrade in 2024. IMPORTANT: I CAN’T STRESS THIS ENOUGH: AMM liquidity pools are the most underrated part of the XRP ecosystem. Why? Because XRP used in these pools is LOCKED UP. It’s not circulating. It’s not selling. It’s gone. And as more assets get tokenized… That locked supply… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 12, 2025 Supply Reduction via Liquidity Pools The design of AMM pools on the XRP Ledger requires participants to commit XRP in exchange for yield. Once deposited, that XRP remains in the pool and cannot be used elsewhere unless withdrawn. The longer this XRP stays in AMMs, the less of it remains in active circulation. This is particularly relevant as many participants provide liquidity for extended periods to earn passive income. While the digital asset’s total supply remains fixed at 100 billion tokens, only a portion is circulating due to Ripple’s large holdings of escrowed XRP. Liquidity pools now introduce a mechanism by which even circulating XRP becomes temporarily inaccessible. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This effectively functions as a supply reduction mechanism. As the tokenization of assets grows on the XRPL, more users are expected to provide liquidity across a range of asset pairs, which may further expand the number of tokens locked away. Impact of the Increased Demand On XRP With tokenization gaining traction across institutional and retail segments, demand for XRP’s underlying infrastructure may increase. If this growth coincides with a shrinking liquid supply due to liquidity pooling, the balance between supply and demand could shift. “When demand rises while supply falls… price has to move,” All Things XRP noted. This scenario depends on the broader adoption of the AMM system and the continued growth of tokenized asset markets using the XRP Ledger. If both trends hold, the XRP locked in pools could play a more direct role in supporting upward price movement by limiting immediate sell pressure. Before the launch, Ripple CTO David Schwartz stated that he was personally excited about the AMM upgrade, and the positive effects show that Ripple’s development team is making the best moves for the digital asset’s long-term future.

Meanwhile, BONK and PEPE are staging their own rallies — but there’s a new viral memecoin quickly stealing the spotlight: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves as what many are calling the next breakout meme project of 2025 . DOGE AND SHIBA INU: STILL LEGENDS, BUT ARE GAINS CAPPED? DOGE and SHIBA INU remain cultural icons in crypto. SHIBA INU’s 60,000% surge from its lows is still one of the most remarkable price movements in digital asset history. But both coins are now massive in market cap, and while they’re gaining holders again, upside expectations are far more modest. That’s why investors looking for the next 100x altcoin are scouting fresh opportunities — and that’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE NEXT 100X ALTCOIN? Launched just weeks ago, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already hit major milestones. With Stage 6 SOLD OUT , and Stage 7 now LIVE , momentum is building fast — and analysts are buzzing. This early-stage opportunity offers a current presale price under $0.0003 , with a listing target of $0.007 . That’s a potential 25x ROI , or a 2,300% gain , for early backers entering before exchange listings. FROM SHIBA’S PLAYBOOK TO MAGACOIN’S TRAJECTORY MAGACOIN FINANCE follows a similar launch arc as SHIBA INU in its early days — low entry price, high community growth, and a strong focus on viral spread across Telegram and X. Just like SHIBA hit 60,000% from low to high , some are speculating MAGACOIN FINANCE could chart a similar path — especially with its stage-based pricing that creates FOMO and rewards the earliest supporters. In under a month, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn in a loyal army of holders. Its meme-driven identity backed by a structured tokenomics plan is proving to be the winning formula in 2025 ’s meme coin resurgence. From trader Telegrams to top crypto X threads, sentiment is heating up. With Stage 7 LIVE and prices still under $0.0003 , many believe now is the moment to act — before listings go live and early ROI windows close. FINAL THOUGHTS: IS MAGACOIN FINANCE THE NEW KING? 🔥 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X While DOGE and SHIBA INU continue to gain holders and BONK and PEPE rally in their wake, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as the next viral chapter in meme coin history . Stage 7 LIVE Listing at $0.007 25x ROI potential Now featured by major crypto publishers Explosive growth backed by analyst predictions If SHIBA’s 60,000% surge proved anything, it’s that meme coins with strong narratives and early support can flip the market overnight.

Fartcoin, a Solana-based meme coin, has outperformed expectations with a 135% year-to-date rise and promising on-chain metrics like falling exchange reserves and steady whale holdings. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has dropped 20% in just 24 hours but now sits at a critical price level that could shape its near-term future. And in the background, BlockDAG is focusing less on short-term buzz and more on execution. With 10,000+ X-Series miners nearly ready for shipment and a presale already up 2,380%, raising $214 million, BDAG appears to be building its own momentum. Real-world applications, product rollout, and exchange readiness place it in a different conversation. Among all the buzz, BlockDAG may be one of the few turning intent into action. Fartcoin Resists Downtrend—Could It Push Toward $1.22? In a market that has mostly dipped, Fartcoin has moved against the trend. The price has jumped 35% from its monthly low and is now trading at $0.4755. Compared to its YTD low, the coin is up 135%. Data shows rising confidence among investors—exchange balances are down 3.62% over the past week, and 2 million tokens have moved into self-custody wallets, hinting at reduced sell pressure. The holder count now stands at more than 113,000, and key profit-taking wallets remain untouched. Technically, a cup and handle pattern is forming—often viewed as a sign of potential upside. If it plays out, the target sits around $1.22, nearly 160% above the current price. Still, a drop below $0.355 could challenge the bullish case and pull prices toward $0.20. For now, Fartcoin is attracting attention for holding up in a weak market—but whether it can break out remains to be seen. DOGE at $0.13—Can the Original Meme Coin Find Its Footing? Dogecoin recently fell by more than 20%, hitting $0.1300 as wider crypto markets experienced heavy selling. However, many are pointing to this level as a potential support zone. If DOGE can hold here, it might set the stage for a bounce. Momentum indicators suggest this scenario is possible. RSI is back above 50, and MACD has flipped bullish. Resistance is expected between $0.1400 and $0.1450. But if the price dips below $0.1350, more losses could follow. Since Dogecoin’s moves are often tied to Bitcoin’s direction, market sentiment will likely be the deciding factor. Traders looking for a low-entry position may be watching this closely. If price holds and volume returns, the stage could be set for a rebound. But for now, confirmation is still needed. BlockDAG’s Mining Rollout Approaches—Could This Be the Moment? BlockDAG is preparing for a major phase. Nearly 10,000 X-Series miners—including the X30 and X100 models—are ready for distribution ahead of its mainnet. This rollout marks a big leap in growing its ecosystem. The X30 model is designed for individuals and can mine up to 600 BDAG daily with low energy use. The X100, aimed at high-capacity miners, produces up to 2,000 BDAG per day. At the current price of $0.0248, and with a $1 target set for 2025, projected returns could reach 3,900%. BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $214 million, selling more than 19 billion coins across 27 batches. Since launching at $0.001, the price has risen by 2,380%, with each batch pushing the price higher. With exchange listings on the horizon and hardware rolling out, this moment may prove timely for new participants. For anyone wondering what the best crypto to mine in 2025 might be, BlockDAG’s combination of speed, utility, and upward projections makes it one to seriously consider. Wrapping Up! Dogecoin still has its meme-driven appeal, and Fartcoin may surprise in the short term. But when it comes to a full-package offering—utility, delivery, and long-term planning—BlockDAG stands apart. While DOGE awaits market movement and Fartcoin depends on sentiment, BlockDAG is deploying miners, running a live testnet, and setting the stage for centralized exchange listings. The foundation it’s building goes beyond speculation. With miners earning up to 2,000 BDAG daily at a low price point of $0.0248, the upside is hard to ignore. If BDAG reaches the $1 target, early adopters could see returns nearing 4,000%. This is not just about betting on the next hype wave—it’s about backing a roadmap already in motion. For those thinking about where real value might emerge in 2025, BlockDAG may not just follow the trend—it might lead it.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 243,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on the memecoin Bonk ( BONK ). The trader shares a chart suggesting that BONK will face resistance at the $0.000012 level before printing a bullish higher low setup and rallying to his target above $0.0000145. “BONK is looking strong in the short term, and should go higher. Should be a pullback around the 200 EMA (exponential moving average) on the four-hour chart but still, I think this has pulled back enough to where any buying down here is probably reasonable.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.00001376. Turning to the low-cap altcoin Alchemist AI ( ALCH ), the analyst says the coin appears to be in an uptrend and that he’s waiting for potential dips to accumulate the asset. ALCH is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based crypto project that allows users with no coding skills to generate codes by providing natural language descriptions. Says Altcoin Sherpa, “ALCH still seems like a really strong chart, don’t see it being mentioned much. I think it’s basically taken the place of ARC; a super volatile AI coin that moves 20% a day. Not in it but traded it a lot before; will look to buy dips.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, ALCH is the 431st-largest crypto asset by market cap, trading at $0.109. Looking at Bitcoin, Altcoin Sherpa thinks that BTC will continue to consolidate within a large trading range in the short to mid-term. “Expecting there is some sort of chop between $70,000-$90,000 over the next several weeks for BTC. Relative bottom probably in, but still some more consolidation to come.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $85,366.

With Cardano (ADA) hovering around $0.6, there’s growing anticipation surrounding its potential to rebound, driven by ongoing developments and bullish market sentiment. Yet, while Cardano maintains its place in the spotlight, there’s a new contender emerging that is quickly capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The Phase 4 presale of MUTM tokens costs $0.025 token price per token and takes place during the current period. The price of MUTM tokens will escalate to 0.03 dollars when phase 4 transitions into phase 5. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gathered $6.6 million by attracting 8200 holders since its inception. Mutuum Finance could hit $3. The Mutuum Finance team has recently introduced a new dashboard featuring a leaderboard that highlights the top 50 holders. Investors will earn bonus tokens for maintaining their position in the top 50. Mutuum Finance: Paving the Way for the Future of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance has gained rapid investor interest from its pioneering dual-lending system. Mutuum Finance uses both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems to establish its revolutionary dual-lending system within decentralized finance. Smart contracts running on P2C guide the platform to issue loans supported by ETH tokens by receiving USDT stablecoins into its lending pools. Users can use P2P system functionality to control their loan arrangements independently and maintain both privacy protections and security features. Mutuum Finance runs adaptive operations that allow profitability through interest rates exceeding 10% for users providing liquidity to their system. Although Mutuum Finance conducts all processes through third-party audits the platform places a strong emphasis both on security and transparency. Open-source smart contracts operate on the platform to create trust between users. The operating stability of the platform will increase through the introduction of a USD-pegged stablecoin and a fee-moderated program to repurchase platform tokens and enhance price stability. Through financial incentives for liquidity stakeholders who place funds on the platform the ecosystem develops stronger confidence among its members. More than 8,200 investors currently use the platform while user numbers continue to increase rapidly. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Engagement Mutuum Finance strengthens adoption by offering a $100,000 token distribution giveaway. The giveaway includes ten prize recipients who will each get $10,000 MUTM tokens. The initiative gives financial benefits to users while it inspires them to welcome more investors into the community which strengthens the overall platform engagement. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity in Phase 4 Presale Mutuum Finance offers an exclusive opportunity for early investors during its Phase 4 presale. The price of MUTM tokens is currently set at $0.025, with the price set to rise progressively from $0.025 to $0.06 over the course of the 11-stage sale. This offers up to 140% in potential gains before the token hits the market. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens could reach $3 after launch, positioning them as a major player in the DeFi market in 2025. Currently, the total market capitalization of MUTM tokens exceeds $6.6 million, showing strong investor confidence. While Cardano (ADA) is positioning itself for a potential rebound, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a serious performer in the DeFi market. With its innovative dual-lending system, strong security measures, and a rapidly growing community of over 8,100 users, Mutuum Finance is gaining significant attention. The Phase 4 presale offers an exclusive opportunity to invest at just $0.025 per token, with the price expected to rise to $0.06, presenting potential gains of up to 140%. With a $100,000 giveaway further fueling interest, Mutuum Finance could see its value soar, possibly reaching $3 post-launch. For those looking to capitalize on the next big DeFi project, Mutuum Finance offers a better opportunity.

Despite the market struggles faced by projects like Kaspa and Aptos, BlockDAG reinvigorates the PoW concept with a fresh, hardware-focused strategy. At its third Keynote event, the team announced the shipping of 10,000 mining devices, affirming their dedication to enhancing PoW beyond traditional boundaries. With an impressive $214 million secured during its presale and an astonishing 2,380% return since the initial batch, BlockDAG (BDAG) concentrates on substantial growth over mere market buzz. This strategic infrastructure underscores its commitment to a long-term vision and durability, differentiating it from fleeting crypto trends. Kaspa (KAS): Recent Market Trends and Valuation As of April 4, 2025, Kaspa (KAS) is valued at approximately $0.0668, with a market capitalization nearing $1.73 billion and a circulating supply close to 25.97 billion coins. The past three months have seen Kaspa undergo a significant decline. Priced around $0.127978 on January 4, 2025, it has since plummeted by about 47.8%. This price reduction coincides with a substantial market cap drop from around $3.33 billion at the start of January to its present figure—a 48% decrease. This continuous downturn in both price and market valuation signifies a challenging quarter for Kaspa, creating concerns amongst market observers and stakeholders. The steep fall emphasizes the broader volatility in the crypto market and indicates a need for Kaspa to regain momentum and fortify its market stance. Currently, it persists in a recovery phase, managing through these tough times. Aptos (APT) Struggles with Sharp Decline in Q1 2025 As of April 4, 2025, Aptos (APT) trades at roughly $5.06, with a market capitalization of about $3.05 billion and a circulating supply nearing 604.53 million coins. Over the past three months, Aptos has witnessed a notable decline in value. Initially priced at around $10.62 on January 4, 2025, it has decreased by nearly 52.3%. This price drop is echoed by a significant reduction in market cap, which has decreased from approximately $6.42 billion to its current level—a roughly 52.5% fall. These parallel reductions in both price and valuation highlight a tough quarter for Aptos, marked by market unpredictability and cautious buyer sentiment. This sharp decline underscores the broader instability within the crypto sphere and accentuates the pressure on projects like Aptos to adapt and regain traction. Currently, the project is navigating a difficult market environment amidst fluctuating buyer attitudes. BlockDAG Elevates PoW: Shipping 10,000 Miners to Boost True Capability BlockDAG is not merely discussing Proof-of-Work; it is actualizing it. During Keynote 3, the team heralded the official shipment of 10,000 mining units in 2025, initiating one of the most ambitious PoW infrastructure expansions since the early days of Bitcoin. However, unlike Bitcoin, which struggles with scalability and speed, BlockDAG advances PoW with cutting-edge, high-throughput hardware and a directed acyclic graph architecture that facilitates parallel processing. This implementation reflects action, not just theory. BlockDAG’s presale has successfully raised over $214 million, marking it as one of the most notable funding achievements lately. Over 19.2 billion coins have been sold through 27 presale batches, with the latest batch priced at $0.0248. Remarkably, early participants from batch 1 have witnessed a phenomenal 2,380% gain, a significant achievement in any industry, especially in crypto. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s hardware development is more than a showcase—it’s a strategic move against the constraints of traditional PoW networks. While Bitcoin still depends on outdated consensus mechanisms and excessive energy requirements, BlockDAG’s architecture manages high transaction volumes with quicker confirmation times, maintaining decentralization and security. In essence, this is PoW redefined for speed, scalability, and practical applicability. With the ongoing shipment of miners and substantial financial support, BlockDAG isn’t just promising innovation—it’s constructing it, one ASIC at a time. Hardware Leads, Hype Fades Kaspa and Aptos have endured a challenging quarter, with market caps nearly halved and prices significantly reduced. Although they remain relevant, their recent performances mirror the uncertainties faced by projects that heavily depend on speculation without significant infrastructure advancements. In contrast, BlockDAG opts for a different path, focusing on tangible hardware, measurable returns, and strategies to scale Proof-of-Work without sacrificing speed or decentralization. As 10,000 miners begin their distribution and presale enthusiasm persists, BlockDAG demonstrates the impact of prioritizing execution over mere discussion. In a domain driven by narratives, it’s the tangible actions that establish lasting success.

Recently, established entities like Maker and Injective have seen significant reductions in both their market value and price, signaling a shift within the sector. Amid these changes, emerging entities like BlockDAG are gaining attention with their recent Keynote 3 presentation. This update serves as more than just a status check; it’s a strategic plan for the evolution of Web3, prioritizing simplicity, efficiency, and scalability. BlockDAG’s strategy is part of a larger industry trend that focuses on creating lasting value rather than short-term gains. Looking ahead, BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming a key player in the race to develop scalable Web3 solutions that facilitate widespread use and maximize the technology’s potential. Maker (MKR): Analysis of Market Cap and Decline As of April 4, 2025, Maker’s trading price stands at $1,317.85, peaking at $1,347.92 and dropping to a low of $1,228.70 within the same day. Currently, its market capitalization is about $1.12 billion, based on 848,074 MKR tokens in circulation. This is a noticeable decrease from three months prior when MKR was priced at $1,593.11—a 17.3% fall in value. This decline in market cap reflects ongoing market instability and the challenges faced by established cryptocurrencies like Maker. The decrease also serves as a caution that without continual innovations or scalable solutions, even prominent tokens can face difficulties. As new platforms with robust frameworks come forward, older projects like MKR may have to evolve swiftly to stay relevant in the dynamic Web3 environment. Injective (INJ): In-Depth Look at Market Challenges and Price Drop As of April 4, 2025, Injective is priced at $8.35, with its daily high at $8.62 and low at $7.99. Its market cap now sits around $835 million, calculated from a circulating supply of 99,970,935 tokens. This represents a drastic fall from three months earlier, when INJ was valued at $23.60, a 64.6% drop. This severe decline has significantly affected Injective’s total market value, reflecting a broader trend of market volatility impacting well-known Web3 projects. This downturn emphasizes the need for continual innovation and adaptability among older platforms, especially as the market shifts toward new projects with solid fundamentals and scalability promises. BlockDAG Unveils Its Vision for an Advanced Web3 Ecosystem BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 transcended a typical product launch, presenting a robust declaration of purpose. From groundbreaking architecture to user-centric development tools, the presentation outlined a future where scalability, security, and simplicity converge as fundamental elements.

Qubetics Could Be the Cardano-Level Comeback,https://thecoinrise.com/the-best-crypto-presale-to-join-now-qubetics-could-be-the-cardano-level-comeback/,"What happens when a digital asset once worth fractions of a penny hits over $3 per token? That’s not fiction—it’s the actual trajectory of Cardano (ADA), which launched in 2017 with an ICO price of just $0.0024. Many overlooked it, and by 2021, ADA had crossed the $3 mark, delivering an ROI of over 124,000%. Cardano’s early backers didn’t just participate in an offering—they became part of a long-term blockchain evolution focused on security, sustainability, and academic rigor. But like all rare entries, that moment is now historical. For those who missed that breakout window, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges not as a replacement but as a modern continuation of what early-stage participation can achieve. Backed by real-world use cases and bold technical foundations, Qubetics is currently in its 30th presale stage , offering access to early participants at just $0.1730 per token . The protocol doesn’t rely on promises; it delivers blockchain tools that solve interoperability problems affecting millions—starting with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet making it one of the best crypto presale to join this year. Qubetics Isn’t Just a Coin—It’s the Second Chance You Missed with Cardano Remember when Cardano’s ICO quietly came and went, and only a few believed in its potential? Fast forward, it turned early believers into millionaires. That kind of moment doesn’t come around often—but Qubetics might just be it. Unlike older blockchain systems that forced users into complex, chain-specific setups, Qubetics delivers real usability. Its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet is a breakthrough solution that lets users manage assets across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and others—all from one seamless, private interface. No third-party apps, no juggling plugins, and no waiting for bridges to sync. Just pure, direct control over your assets—instantly. In real-world terms, this means a freelancer can invoice in one token and receive payment in another, with no extra fees or technical headaches. Everything stays secure, transparent, and fast. The wallet is already live and gaining traction among users who want simplicity without sacrificing sovereignty. Presale Details You Can’t Afford to Ignore Now here’s the math that’s catching serious attention. At the current presale price of $0.17305, a $100 investment gives you approximately 578 tokens. If $TICS reaches just $1, that investment becomes $578. But if it hits $5, you’re looking at $2,890. Should it climb to $10, the return is $5,780, and at $15, that same $100 explodes into $8,670. These aren’t inflated numbers—they’re real-time projections based on current presale pricing and token output. Qubetics is currently in its 30 crypto presale stage. Over 507 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $16 million from 24,600+ participants. The current token price is $0.1730, and it increases by 10% every Sunday without fail. This means every delay costs you more entry and fewer tokens—while the upside remains massive. Now is the time to act before the next price hike hits. Cardano: A Foundational Milestone That Redefined Blockchain Participation Cardano’s initial coin offering (ICO) launched in September 2017 through a presale campaign that lasted nearly two years, mostly targeting Japanese markets. The presale price was a mere $0.0024 , and it successfully raised over $62 million , making it one of the most high-profile blockchain fundraising events of its time. What set Cardano apart was its rigorous academic foundation and peer-reviewed protocol development. Built by IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong), Cardano emphasized scalability, interoperability, and formal methods in its coding structure. Its Ouroboros consensus mechanism became the first blockchain consensus algorithm mathematically proven to be secure. This made it highly attractive to those prioritizing security and decentralization over short-term trends. Over the years, Cardano integrated Plutus smart contracts, launched native tokens, and gradually shifted into a fully decentralized framework. The project’s rollout, often criticized for its slow pace, has remained deliberate to ensure robust layer-by-layer development. ADA, the native token, reached its all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021, marking over 124,000% growth since its ICO. That meteoric rise turned early participants into long-term ecosystem contributors, validating the importance of technical depth over marketing hype. Cardano laid down the blueprint for academically driven blockchain infrastructure. Its early ICO proved that long-term value can emerge when a project is grounded in rigorous research and practical design—even if the early market ignored it. Final Analysis Cardano’s story is a lesson in patience and design-first architecture. Those who joined early witnessed exponential growth and became part of one of blockchain’s most transformative networks. But those who missed that ICO aren’t without options. The emergence of Qubetics—equipped with real-world solutions like its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet—presents a clear next chapter in the evolution of blockchain utility. For community participants looking for projects with both functional value and presale potential, Qubetics is the best crypto presale to join . Its growth is driven not by speculation, but by tools that solve real technical challenges. And for those who value purpose-driven innovation, that’s where the next wave of long-term value may already be forming.

Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows the purchase was made on April 12 by one of WLFI’s trading wallets using USDC transferred from the project’s main wallet. It’s the same trading wallet previously used by WLFI to accumulate other altcoins. WLFI holds a diversified portfolio, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), and a larger number of altcoins, such as Tron ( TRX ), Ondo Finance ( ONDO ), Avalanche ( AVAX ) and now Sei ( SEI ). According to blockchain researcher Lookonchain, WLFI has spent a total of $346.8 million accumulating 11 different tokens, but as of April 12, it has yet to see a profit on any of them. The project’s Ethereum investments alone are currently down over $114 million. Overall, Lookonchain says WLFI’s portfolio is down $145.8 million. World Liberty Financial’s current on-paper profit/loss on its altcoins. Source: Lookonchain Only two months ago, in a Feb. 3 X post, Donald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, urged his followers to buy Ether, writing : “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH.” Originally, the tweet also included “you can thank me later,” but it was edited to remove those five words. At the time of writing, data from CoinGecko showed ETH’s price had fallen 55% since Eric Trump’s tweet, currently trading at $1,611, down from the Feb. 3 close of $2,879.

WLFI has made no official announcement about USD1’s logo. Observers speculate this is USD1’s new logo. Source: Binance Trump’s involvement with USD1 has attracted criticism from lawmakers on both sides of US politics. At an April 2 US House Financial Services Committee hearing on stablecoin legislation , Democratic Representative Maxine Waters suggested President Trump may be ultimately planning to use USD1 to replace the US dollar. “Trump likely wants the entire government to use stablecoins, from payments made by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to Social Security payments to paying taxes. And which coin do you think Trump would replace the dollar with? His own, of course.” The committee’s Republican chair, French Hill, aired similar concerns. “If there is no effort to block the president of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers.” Magazines: 3 reasons Ethereum could turn a corner: Kain Warwick, X Hall of Flame",,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|REGULATION|ONDO|SEI,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-14 02:46:36

The app layer is where developers build decentralized applications on top of Ethereum’s base infrastructure and where they make decisions about how these programs operate. In an April 12 post on the social media platform Warpcast, Buterin responded to a user’s argument that Ethereum needs a new generation of developers rooted in Ethereum’s core values to renew itself. He argued that it’s the app layer that needs this more. “Apps are 80% special purpose. What apps you build depends heavily on what ideas you have of what Ethereum apps, and Ethereum as a whole, are there to do for the world. And so having good ideas on this topic out there becomes crucially important,” Buterin said. Source: Vitalik Buterin In comparison, Buterin says a programming language like C++ may not be as influenced by the creator’s ideology, as it is a general-purpose tool that doesn’t have much surface to be made worse or improved by social philosophy. “Imagine that C++ had been made by a totalitarian racist fascist. Would it be a worse language? Probably not,” he said. Ethereum’s layer 1 is similar to an extent, argued Buterin, though it is more exposed to philosophical influence, citing its move to proof-of-stake (PoS) and supporting light clients as examples. “Someone who doesn’t believe in decentralization would not add light clients, or good forms of account abstraction,” he said. “Someone who doesn’t mind energy waste would not spend half a decade moving to PoS, but the Ethereum Virtual Machine opcodes might have been roughly the same either way. So Ethereum is perhaps 50% general-purpose,” Buterin added. Apps with good social philosophy vs bad In a follow-up post, Buterin told a user that in his opinion, crypto privacy protocol Railgun, Web3 social protocol Farcaster, decentralized prediction market Polymarket and messenger app Signal are examples of apps with a good social philosophy. Source: Vitalik Buterin “You build apps that do the right thing behind the scenes by default. Signal is a reasonably good example of this, though it has significant flaws of its own. Farcaster is also a good example of this,” Buterin said . Related: Vitalik Buterin criticizes crypto’s moral shift toward gambling On the other hand, Buterin said the memecoin platform Pump.fun, the collapsed crypto ecosystem Terra, its native token Terra ( LUNA ), and the collapsed crypto exchange FTX are examples of bad social philosophy. “The differences in what the app does stem from differences in beliefs in developers’ heads about what they are here to accomplish,” he said.

According to data from Tokenomist, on Apr. 18, the project will release 40 million tokens, worth over $320 million at current prices, to its team. This is TRUMP’s first major unlock and will add roughly 20% of the current circulating supply to the market. Following the event, 493,000 TRUMP, around $4 million, will be unlocked daily until the next major unlock in July. The upcoming unlocks have raised concerns over potential price impact due to increased token supply. TRUMP is trading at $8.27 as of press time, down more than 5% over the past day. The token is now 88% below its all-time high of $73.43 set on January 19, as per CoinGecko data . Due to increased market activity before the unlock, trading volume has increased 23% to $476 million in the past 24 hours. On-chain data points to a decline in investor interest. Data from a Dune dashboard shows that the total number of wallet holders has decreased to 638,000, a 0.3% decrease this week and a huge decrease from over 800,000 holders recorded in January. Less than 13,000 wallets hold more than $1,000 in TRUMP, indicating that a large percentage of users have modest, speculative holdings. You might also like: McGregor’s REAL memecoin flops after missing the $1M minimum presale goal by 61% Technical indicators point to bearish pressure on the token. The majority of important moving averages are below TRUMP’s current price, with the 20- and 50-day exponential moving averages are indicating further declines. A weak bullish crossover in the moving average convergence/divergence suggests a possible but uncertain recovery, while the relative strength index is near oversold territory at 37.37. TRUMP price analysis. Credit: TradingView Support is located close to $7.50, where TRUMP has previously seen buying interest. The price might move toward $6.80 if it breaks below this level. Resistance is expected on the upside near $9.20 and $10.90, which correspond to longer-term moving averages. Even though Trump-affiliated merchandise retailers like GetTrumpSneakers.com can use the memecoin, its price movement indicates that investors are more interested in speculation than in real-world uses. As the unlock gets closer, traders will be keeping an eye on market sentiment and price movement.

We have yet to see that.” Cipolaro said crypto perpetual futures rates have “been persistently positive,” with liquidations spiking on April 6 and 7 in the days after Trump first announced the tariffs on April 2 but only to a total of $480 million, which he added “was well below other notable liquidation events.” He noted that the price of Tether ( USDT ), a US dollar-tracking stablecoin widely used token in crypto trading, was below $1 but had “not experienced a sharp decline.” Trump unveiled a sweeping tariff regime on April 2 that lumped various levies on every country before pausing them for 90 days just hours after they came into effect on April 5 and instead charging a base tariff of 10%, besides China, which currently has tariffs of up to 145%. Traditional and crypto markets tanked after Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement, and many assets haven’t recovered to the same level as before their unveiling. Stocks, bonds and foreign exchange volatility rates all rose after Trump’s tariffs announcement. Source: NYDIG Over the weekend, the Trump administration caused more confusion with its tariffs, saying on April 13 that an April 11 decision to exempt many electronics from tariffs was temporary and they would still be hit with levies. Bitcoin fares well, declining volatility to make it widely attractive Cipolaro said that Bitcoin ( BTC ) didn’t escape the market volatility, “but at current prices has fared far better than many other asset classes.” He added that Bitcoin’s volatility hasn’t risen to historic levels, unlike the traditional markets, and “has been relatively stable” despite instability instigated by the Trump administration. “Perhaps investors are increasingly searching for stores of value not tied to sovereign countries and thus not affected by the trade turmoil.” Bitcoin is down 22.5% from its mid-January peak of over $108,000 and has traded flat over the past 24 hours at $84,730, according to CoinGecko. Cipolaro said the narrowing gap between Bitcoin’s volatility and other assets makes it “increasingly more appealing” to funds with risk parity portfolios — those that use risk to choose asset allocations. He added that investors are likely reducing their risk exposure but “perhaps some reallocation of asset mix to Bitcoin is one of the reasons it has been more buoyant.” Related: S&P 500 briefly sees ‘Bitcoin-level’ volatility amid Trump tariff war “Risk parity funds allocating to Bitcoin can help dampen its volatility — making the asset more attractive and potentially reinforcing a virtuous cycle of increased adoption and stability,” Cipolaro said. However, YouHodler chief of markets Ruslan Lienkha told Cointelegraph in an April 12 note that despite a wider market rebound, “technical indicators are painting a concerning picture.” He said a “death cross,” when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, is potentially forming on Bitcoin and the S&P 500. Lienkha said the pattern is “generally considered a bearish signal for the medium term, suggesting that markets may struggle to sustain upward momentum without a clear catalyst or a stream of positive macroeconomic developments.” Magazine: Financial nihilism in crypto is over — It’s time to dream big again",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-14 03:31:26

Dubbed as “Liberation Day, “ the action was designed to bring new life to American manufacturing, but instead set off a financial chain reaction that spilled well outside of conventional markets right into the center of crypto. Global Market reaction on Tariffs The initial response was pandemonium in all financial markets worldwide. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index dropped more than 3%, and the Shanghai Composite plummeted by 4.7% an indication of serious investor nervousness in China. European markets were not immune either: Germany’s DAX and the UK’s FTSE 100 fell under the weight of dented export expectations. On the other side of the Atlantic, American indices plummeted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 600 points, while the NASDAQ dipped close to 2.5%. The hardest hit were semiconductor and electronics firms depending heavily on Chinese production. Fear drove investors into havens, driving gold to a 12-month high and sending U.S. Treasury yields down. Crypto Market Reacted The crypto space, which many at one time praised as a hedge against macro dislocation, wasn’t immune. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped close to 9% in the first 48 hours after the news. Ethereum (ETH) followed suit, dropping more than 8%. Risk sentiment had well and truly turned, and the digital asset market, inextricably linked to global investor sentiment, was subjected to sharp liquidation. Asia-specific tokens such as NEO (baptismally referred to as the “Chinese Ethereum”) and VeChain (VET), which is associated with larger Chinese logistics and supply chain companies, experienced gruesome declines falling 12% and 15% respectively. Even US-preferred instruments were not exempt: Solana (SOL) fell by 10%, most of its drop coming courtesy of its extreme vulnerability to DeFi and institutionality trading. While it was Layer-1 blockchains that bore the bulk of the blow, stablecoins were not spared either. Tether (USDT) redemption volumes spiked, particularly on Asian exchanges such as Binance and OKX, indicative of a flight to cash. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap, on the other hand, experienced major volume declines, indicating that retail investors were taking liquidity out of the market instead of trading the dip. So why did stocks and crypto sell off in sync? For one, crypto remains a speculative asset class. During periods of uncertainty, speculative assets are the first to be dumped. Second, big institutionals now control a significant proportion of crypto volume. These institutions play macro strategies—when fear increases, their capital reverses and moves to safer bets such as cash, gold, or short-term government bonds. Worsening the situation further were early rumors of capital controls in Hong Kong and Singapore two key crypto hubs. Speculation that regulators might restrict crypto transactions to control capital flight led to further panic, especially among investors based in Asia. As Bitcoin struggled, gold shone again. The Gold Shares (GLD) ETF recorded its largest one-day inflow in half a year. U.S. manufacturing ETFs experienced fleeting optimism, but most high-growth technology stocks particularly chipmakers such as Nvidia and TSMC got hammered. In the cryptocurrency universe, those with lesser geographic and trade exposure performed better. Chainlink (LINK), which is decentralized in its oracle infrastructure, lost less than most, and some investors predicted that utility-based tokens would provide more stability in macro-driven routs. Tariffs drama continuous The tariff drama is more than politics it’s a stress test of the old and new economy. It demonstrated to us that crypto isn’t this digital island nation that is in some way proof against real world events. Whenever systemic risk beckons, any asset be it fiat, gold, or crypto adapts. It also reshaped the narrative around Bitcoin’s “digital gold” thesis. While it has outperformed in some local crises (like inflation in Argentina or sanctions on Russia), in a globally synchronized panic, Bitcoin failed to serve as a safe haven. That doesn’t diminish its long-term value proposition, but it’s a reminder: we’re not there yet. While the world grapples with this latest kick in the teeth of the U.S.–China dynamic, investors and crypto fans will have to reset expectations. Volatility is the new normal, yet in that chop is opportunity. Builders will redouble efforts on decentralization. Regulators will catch up on how essential good crypto standards are. And investors if smart will learn to hedge risk, control emotions, and diversify better. After all, Bitcoin was the product of a crisis. Perhaps this one will be the crucible out of which fresh innovation emerges once more.",Research Report|Insights,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 03:53:05

Crypto analysts Sjuul from AltCryptoGems and StarPlatinum have detailed the events revealing how red flags, team control, and behind-the-scenes deals contributed to what some call “LUNA 2.0.” Is it an inside job? Let’s unpack the details. However, in an official statement, the firm clarified that the sell-off was not an insider job, and they are working to resolve the matter soon. MANTRA’s co-founder, John Patrick Mullin, also said that there is no need to panic and that they are investigating the matter. MANTRA community – we want to assure you that MANTRA is fundamentally strong. Today’s activity was triggered by reckless liquidations, not anything to do with the project. One thing we want to be clear on: this was not our team. We are looking into it and will share more details… — MANTRA | Tokenizing RWAs (@MANTRA_Chain) April 13, 2025 Sjuul’s Breakdown: Manipulation and OTC Deals Led to Collapse According to Sjuul, the crash was triggered when a wallet linked to the MANTRA team suddenly deposited 3.9 million OM tokens onto OKX. This raised immediate concerns, as the team is known to control nearly 90% of the token’s total supply. With such control, any sell-off could crash the market, and that’s exactly what happened. 4/ So when that large token deposit hit OKX, people started to worry that a big sell-off was coming. And they were right. Selling pressure began shortly after. — Sjuul | AltCryptoGems (@AltCryptoGems) April 13, 2025 Sjuul highlighted that trust had already been broken in the OM community over the past year. The team allegedly manipulated the market using market makers, secretly altered tokenomics, and repeatedly delayed a promised community airdrop. These actions had already put the community on edge. But the real shock came with rumors of OTC deals, mainly private sales, where tokens were reportedly offered at massive discounts, some up to 50% off. When the token’s price began to slide, even these investors rushed to exit, causing a chain reaction. Stop-losses were triggered, leveraged positions liquidated, and within an hour, the price plummeted 90%, burning countless investors. StarPlatinum’s Analysis: Airdrop Scandal and Vanishing Act Another crypto analyst StarPlatinum, echoed the alarm, calling it a disaster on the scale of LUNA. He pointed to the team’s controversial airdrop incident just a month ago, where over 50% of eligible wallets were suddenly blacklisted without explanation. This move alienated the community and created deep suspicion. It all started when a wallet linked to MANTRA sent 3.9M $OM to OKX That caught attention fast Because the team controls 90% of the supply Meaning they can crash the price anytime (2/9) pic.twitter.com/wMCZpt4Ant — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinumSOL) April 13, 2025 He also highlighted the team’s quiet changes to tokenomics, founder inactivity, and rumors of price control through market makers. When the wallet transfer to OKX happened, it triggered widespread fear. As news of the OTC deals spread, panic selling began. In one hour, OM crashed from $7 to just $0.50. What made things worse, according to StarPlatinum, was the OM Telegram group getting deleted right after the crash. The final message before deletion likened the event to “LUNA 2.0.” Since then, the team has gone silent, adding to the chaos. Don’t Ignore Red Flags Both analysts agreed on one thing that when a token is overly centralized, lacks transparency, and constantly shifts its rules, danger is never far behind. The OM crash serves as a brutal reminder to always research before investing.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,LUNA|MARKET|TRADING|OM|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 04:00:28

The Company’s Risky Capital Model Under Scrutiny,https://coinpedia.org/research-report/can-strategy-survive-a-bitcoin-crash-the-companys-risky-capital-model-under-scrutiny/,"The post Can Strategy Survive a Bitcoin Crash? The Company’s Risky Capital Model Under Scrutiny appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy Incorporated, recently renamed as Strategy, is the largest publicly traded corporate owner of Bitcoin, with 528,185 BTC purchased at an average price of $67,458, with total acquisition cost of $35.63 billion. As of April 2025, its Bitcoin holdings are worth around $41.3 billion, with the most recent purchase of 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion on March 30 at $86,969 per BTC. Bitcoin is now Strategy’s main treasury reserve asset, and its BTC Yield—a key performance indicator measuring Bitcoin per share—rose 11% YTD during Q1, aiming for 15% annually to 2027. Microstrategy SEC filing SEC filings in recent times point to the volatility that comes with Strategy’s Bitcoin model. During Q1 2025, the firm had a $5.91 billion unrealized loss caused by a price fall to $77,351, which was offset by a $1.69 billion tax benefit. The capital structure of the company is comprised of $8.65 billion raised in the form of equity and debt since 2020, for funding continuous Bitcoin acquisitions. The highlight was raising $2 billion in February 2025 using zero-coupon convertible notes that are due in 2030. Strategy also went public with a preferred stock (STRK) offering during Q4 2024 and raised $584 million. In spite of volatility, the firm’s overall Bitcoin holding is still in profit with an unrealized gain of 14.62%. Its software segment still lags behind, reporting $120.7 million in Q4 2024 revenue, down 3% YoY, and failing to produce positive operating cash flow. The firm depends greatly on financing for its operations and Bitcoin acquisitions, having done a 10-for-1 stock split in July 2024 to increase share availability. Liquidation risk is contained at present. With $8.2 billion in unsecured loans and no collateralized loans for Bitcoin , Strategy could potentially repay all of its debt by selling 15% of its BTC at current market prices. Bitcoin through shares Executive Chairman Michael Saylor’s 46.8% voting share guarantees continuation of the Bitcoin-first strategy, and he asserts even a decline in Bitcoin’s price wouldn’t lead to a selloff. Strategy’s equity and debt offering-based fund conversion strategy—using stock and note issuance to purchase BTC has been referred to as an “infinite money glitch.” Strategy purchases additional Bitcoin by issuing stock and notes at a premium, driving both BTC and MSTR’s stock upward. This model relies on investor faith and sustained appreciation of Bitcoin. Any extended decline in Bitcoin’s price may test its capacity to raise capital or service its obligations. Critics point to centralization risks, possible tax burdens on $18 billion of unrealized gains, and regulatory attention from organizations such as the SEC. At the same time, the stock of the company experienced a 336% jump in 2024, although it dropped by 55% from a high of $543 in November to $250 by February 2025. In summary, Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin approach continues to provide returns but with high risk of exposure to market volatility, debt risk, and regulatory issues. Its success will depend on Bitcoin’s long-term trend and Saylor’s dogged adherence to the “never sell” mantra.",Research Report|Insights,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 04:05:05

Russian Economist: Crypto May Be Driving De-dollarization Vyugin, the former head of the Russian Federal Financial Markets Service and the ex-Chairman of the Moscow Exchange, was speaking at a conference on investments and trading. Russian Economist Oleg Vyugin. (Source: Viktoria PRO invest/YouTube/Screenshot) The Professor said that a “possible” rise in “foreign trade settlements” made by “Russian companies in cryptocurrency” could have helped stabilize the RUB. Vyugin explained that crypto deals make no use of “hard currencies.” That could be one reason why the demand for USD and other fiats was dropping, he remarked. The economist said: “We need to take settlement factors. into account. For example, we have information that Russia uses cryptocurrency in settlements with China. That is, this means that there is no demand for dollars. The dollar is not needed to carry out these settlements.” He remarked that while settlements remained “very difficult” to process, it was hard to see “what the point of [the] dollar” was in such trade deals. Vyugin added: “Using alternative forms of payment can reduce demand for hard currencies, and it is possible that this factor is also at play.” Russia's oil exports slipped to their lowest in a month in the four weeks to April 6, dropping 220,000 barrels a day from their recent peak, writes @JLeeEnergy https://t.co/BXGwBJfmEm — Bloomberg (@business) April 8, 2025 Yuan and USD Demand Falling? The Russian economist conceded that his claims amounted to “an assumption.” But he also suggested that crypto adoption may also be impacting the demand for other fiats. These include the Chinese yuan, Vyugin said. The newspaper noted that the yuan exchange rate on the Moscow Exchange has” been steadily declining for several months.” The exchange’s data shows that yuan prices have fallen by 22.4% from their closing levels in November last year. At that point, they stood at 14.5 rubles ($0.17). At the end of trading on Friday April 11, the Chinese currency was officially trading for around 11.25 rubles ($0.14) in Moscow. The newspaper also noted that the official dollar exchange rate, as set by the Russian Central Bank, has also fallen from RUB 109.58 (currently $1.32) to 84 rubles in the same period.

The Central Bank, meanwhile, remains vehemently opposed to crypto adoption . It wants to restrict companies to trading within the confines of its official crypto pay sandbox. But a growing chorus of domestic companies – including a major logistics player – have asked Moscow to roll out legal framework that would allow more firms to use crypto as a settlement tool for international trade. Observers think that Russian firms first began using crypto in earnest in response to the US, UK, and EU-led sanctions packages first launched after the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022.

Starting the year trading close to just $1, the token jumped to an all-time high of about $260 by November—a startling 25,000% growth in less than a year. Solana’s high-speed blockchain, low fees, and developer-friendly environment drove adoption and firmly placed it in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, transcending mere hype. By December 2024, Solana had a market value of over $103.5 billion, with a price holding robust around $217.33. Its popularity prepared the ground for a further generation of altcoins meant to follow its path. One project— Rexas Finance (RXS)—is today making comparisons to Solana’s early run. With a real-world use case, rapid presale growth, and a community-first model, RXS could be next to skyrocket into the crypto elite. How Rexas Finance (RXS) is changing real-world asset investment Rexas Finance is not only another DeFi token offering significant profits. Focusing on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs)—transforming typically illiquid markets, including real estate, commodities, and financial securities, into fractional, transferable digital tokens—gives the blockchain area actual usefulness. For investors, this is revolutionary. With just a few hundred dollars, a picture has a share in a multimillion-dollar commercial property, rare artwork, or high-yield commodity fund. Rexas exposes these doors to ordinary people, providing access to wealth-creation opportunities outside top institutional investors. The project’s infrastructure is developed considering usability and scale. Anyone can design blockchain tokens with the Rexas Token Builder without knowing one line of code. Combining the QuickMint Bot with platforms like Telegram and Discord allows users to instantly launch tokens, substantially simplifying worldwide blockchain access points. Rexas also uses the vibrant DeFi ecosystem by providing liquidity pools, staking, and yield farming. These services offer RXS members broader interaction with the platform and passive earning possibilities. Additionally, distributed governance enables token holders to influence the direction of the protocol. The Rexas Launchpad helps startups by streamlining financing and project screening through on-chain validation, fostering investor confidence and creative output. Rexas AI Shield also provides real-time smart contract monitoring, therefore strengthening the ecosystem against fraud and exploitation. Supported by a finished Certik audit, Rexas shows its dedication to security and openness—qualities essential for long-term development. Rexas Finance (RXS) presale: the next big crypto opportunity The numbers speak for themselves. In Stage 12 of its presale, Rexas Finance boasts 91.58% of tokens sold. Initially costing $0.03 in Stage 1, RXS has jumped to $0.20—a 567% rise. The project has raised $46.8 million in presale funding, a strong indicator of growing market excitement ahead of its launch. Rexas is laying the conditions for explosive expansion with a verified listing price of $0.25 on at least three top-tier exchanges on June 19, 2025. Echoing the size of Solana’s iconic breakthrough, analysts estimate that once RXS goes live, the mix of immense publicity, community involvement, and desire for real-world asset access could drive a 40,000% surge. Rexas Finance did things differently than many hyped-up tokens supported by venture funding. Free of VC money, this is a community-first project. That implies no artificial inflation, early-stage token dumping, and a better route for natural price discovery. The forthcoming Tier-1 exchange listings—massive catalysts—are rumored to include sites like Binance and Coinbase. They could quickly boost liquidity and global visibility. Concurrently, the continuous $1 million RXS token giveaway has evolved into a viral campaign, attracting over 1.8 million participants and increasing brand recognition. Rexas Finance meets every need investors search for in the next great breakthrough initiative, thanks to its strong foundation of creativity, community involvement, and practical value. The last chance to catch the next 100,000% crypto surge? Opportunities like Solana’s 2021 run are rare—but not impossible to catch. Rexas Finance could be the next altcoin to soar into the top 10 following Solana’s path. Its momentum, technology, and goal make it among the most exciting initiatives for 2025. Rexas Finance may just be the second shot for individuals who missed out on the early waves of Solana, but the window is closing rapidly as the presale concludes. Should RXS live up to expectations, this could be the most noteworthy success narrative of the year.

The recent formation of a Golden Cross on the MACD has sparked optimism among traders, indicating that a bullish phase could be underway. Currently priced at $2.1413, XRP is trading with mild gains as the market absorbs a potential breakout from its prolonged consolidation. Market sentiment is gradually shifting in favor of bulls, and all eyes are on the next move. Golden Cross on Daily Chart Strengthens Bullish Sentiment The daily chart shows a powerful signal in the form of a MACD Golden Cross, which typically signifies the beginning of a sustained upward trend. The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and the histogram is printing green bars (suggesting momentum is tilting upward). This formation, combined with XRP trading above the 20-day simple moving average (SMA), adds further weight to the bullish case. Historically, such signals have led to substantial rallies, and current price action mirrors similar pre-rally behavior seen in past cycles. Bollinger Bands Suggest Volatility Breakout Is Near The Bollinger Bands are transitioning from a squeeze phase to expansion, implying an impending spike in volatility. XRP has rebounded from the lower band and is now pushing against the midline, with the upper band in sight around $2.35. A daily close above the midline could set the stage for a surge toward resistance. The narrowing of the bands earlier this month reflected low volatility, but the current widening suggests that a strong directional move is brewing. Momentum traders should prepare for a possible breakout in the coming sessions. 4-Hour Chart Confirms Rounded Bottom Pattern Zooming into the 4-hour chart, XRP appears to be forming a rounded bottom, a textbook reversal pattern that often precedes bullish continuation. The MACD on this timeframe is also bullish, with a steady upward trajectory and positive histogram bars. The price is making higher lows and has tested the resistance zone around $2.16 multiple times (an early sign of breakout strength). If bulls can secure a close above that mark with increased volume, it could trigger a rally toward $2.25–$2.30 within hours.

Stronger support levels sit at $2.00 and $1.83, which have held firm during recent corrections. Resistance is now building at $2.35, followed by $2.50, and the psychological barrier of $3.00. If XRP breaks through $2.35 with strong volume, a rally toward $2.50 may unfold quickly. Volume confirmation will be key to validating any breakout and ensuring momentum is sustained rather than rejected. Prediction For Today With both the daily and 4-hour charts showing synchronized bullish signals, XRP is likely to trade within a projected range of $2.20 to $2.35 today. If buying pressure intensifies and resistance at $2.35 is broken, the rally could extend toward $2.45 by day’s end. However, if momentum stalls, a retracement to $2.09 could occur before another bullish attempt. Overall, indicators favor continued upside as market sentiment improves and technical patterns align.

43316337,https://invezz.com/?p=2669608,1744606210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Solana’s next big move: will it break $200 or fall to $94?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/14/solanas-next-big-move-will-it-break-200-or-fall-to-94/,"Solana (SOL) stays under significant bearish pressure even as the crypto market recovers gradually after a notable drop over the past month. Intense market sell-offs last week caused SOL’s stock to tumble about 10%. It has struggled to keep an optimistic momentum. Solana has had a significant rejection at the $145 barrier and trades below the $130 support level. The urgent question remains: Will Solana plummet below $94 or push toward the $200 mark while traders carefully observe its next significant movement? Will Solana price break $200 or fall to $94? The price of Solana has been erratic; from its peak of $294 on January 19, 2025, the token dropped a startling 57%. Despite this sharp drop, the general crypto market is still developing, which gives SOL a chance to recover. With a 1.30% rise in the past 24 hours, today’s global crypto market capitalization is $2.69 trillion. This increase suggests possible market stability, which would help Solana’s price movement. Market activity has also exploded, reflecting a notable 35.83% increase; the total crypto trading volume in the past 24 hours exceeds $76.09 billion. The leading player in the crypto market, Bitcoin, is currently hovering at about $83,000. Given the past correlation between BTC and SOL, additional price increases for Bitcoin could spark Solana’s comeback. Moreover, conjecture about accepting an ETF based on Solana has generated market hope. SOL’s price jumped by 8% in just 24 hours upon word of a possible Solana ETF surfaced, clearly showing the significant influence of institutional interest. Polymarketcap reports that Solana’s expected growth rate is 82%, supporting the likelihood of a substantial price increase. Source: Polymarket Notwithstanding these positive signs, Solana still has a downside risk. Should the general attitude toward the market weaken, SOL might suffer more losses. Macroeconomic uncertainty plus declining investor confidence could cause Solana’s price to drop to $94. Whether SOL has a bullish breakout or suffers more losses will depend mainly on the market’s direction in the following weeks. Source: TradingView Solana must first break over the $150 resistance level to restore strength. Should it succeed, the primary goals would be $170, $180, and the crucial $200 mark. Still, a lack of sustaining buying demand can cause more falls. Should the pessimistic attitude increase, SOL could test support at $100 and show a significantly more declining trend into $94 below $120. While Solana faces uncertainty in its price movement, Rexas Finance (RXS) has emerged as the altcoin poised for an explosive rally. Rexas Finance (RXS): the altcoin set to outperform Solana Rexas Finance empowers people to own or tokenize actual assets, including real estate, artwork, goods, and intellectual property. This creative asset tokenization method transforms investment behavior and makes worldwide smooth ownership transfers possible. Currently in its 12th and final presale stage, RXS is priced at just $0.20. The presale has already raised an impressive $47.79 million, filling 91.80% of its allocation, with the launch price at $0.25. Investors have been flocking to RXS due to its rapid growth, soaring over 500% from its initial presale price to its current valuation. Adding to its appeal, Rexas Finance is conducting a $1 million giveaway, attracting over 1.82 million entries. The giveaway will reward 20 winners with $50,000 worth of RXS each. To participate, investors must contribute at least $100 in the presale, complete specific tasks, and refer others to gain bonus entries. One key factor boosting investor confidence in RXS is its successful audit by Certik, a leading blockchain security firm. This validation increases trust among investors, further solidifying Rexas Finance as a strong contender in the market. With its presale momentum and innovative real-world asset tokenization model, RXS is projected to skyrocket to $150 post-launch, marking an astounding 750x surge from its current price. This positions Rexas Finance as a more lucrative investment opportunity than Solana, offering significantly higher returns. Conclusion Solana still has development potential, but its short-term price behavior is under doubt. For those seeking exponential returns, though, Rexas Finance (RXS) offers a convincing alternative. With its creative asset tokenizing approach, explosive presale momentum, and Certik-audited security, RXS is positioned for a considerable rise, possibly exceeding $150. Rexas Finance is the altcoin with the highest growth potential in the following months, while Solana struggles with market pressure.

43315326,https://coinpaper.com/8494/sec-and-binance-extend-legal-pause-as-cz-denies-wsj-allegations,1744606800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,SEC and Binance Extend Legal Pause as CZ Denies WSJ Allegations,https://coinpaper.com/8494/sec-and-binance-extend-legal-pause-as-cz-denies-wsj-allegations,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and cryptocurrency exchange Binance have requested a second 60-day pause in their nearly two-year legal battle, citing ongoing discussions and recent internal regulatory developments. The extension comes as former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao publicly denied a report alleging he agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun in connection with his own plea agreement with the Department of Justice. SEC and Binance Seek Additional Two-Month Pause in Prolonged Legal Battle as Crypto Task Force Reframes Case Strategy The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, have jointly requested another 60-day pause in their long-running legal battle, signaling a possible shift in the regulator’s approach to crypto enforcement under new leadership and the recently formed Crypto Task Force. According to a joint status report filed on April 11 with the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the SEC and Binance have engaged in “productive discussions” since the last court-approved stay in February. The talks reportedly include analysis of how the task force’s evolving mandate may impact the SEC’s original claims against the crypto giant. “Since the Court stayed this case, the Parties have been in productive discussions, including discussions concerning how the efforts of the crypto task force may impact the SEC’s claims,” the filing reads. The SEC initiated the extension request, and Binance agreed to it. The joint request is framed as being “in the interest of judicial economy,” reflecting a desire to avoid unnecessary litigation while both sides reassess the scope and direction of the case. This marks the second 60-day stay jointly requested by the SEC and Binance this year. The first was granted in February, just days after crypto critic Gary Gensler stepped down as SEC Chair on Jan. 20. His departure was swiftly followed by the appointment of Commissioner Mark Uyeda—a known crypto-friendly voice within the agency—as acting chair. Uyeda’s leadership appears to have catalyzed a broader rethinking of the agency’s crypto enforcement playbook, particularly as the newly formed Crypto Task Force takes shape. Crypto Task Force Reshaping Strategy A key factor behind the extension request is the SEC’s internal restructuring through its newly established Crypto Task Force. Formed on Jan. 21—just one day after Gensler’s resignation—the task force has been tasked with modernizing the SEC’s approach to regulating digital assets. Its priorities include clarifying registration pathways, designing rational disclosure regimes, and ensuring enforcement actions are proportionate and well-targeted. This evolving strategy could significantly impact the SEC’s original case against Binance. Filed in June 2023, the lawsuit accused Binance and its founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, of 13 violations including the unregistered sale of BNB and Binance USD tokens, unauthorized operation of staking services like Simple Earn and BNB Vault, and failures related to customer protections. The establishment of the task force is seen by many in the crypto community as a potential turning point in the regulatory landscape. By reevaluating legacy lawsuits under new guidelines, the SEC may be moving away from the combative tone that characterized Gensler’s tenure—marked by sweeping enforcement actions and a contentious relationship with the industry. Broader SEC Retreat from Aggressive Enforcement The Binance case isn’t the only one facing delays or withdrawals. Over the past month, the SEC has either dropped or paused lawsuits against other major players in the crypto space, including Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, and Consensys. These decisions suggest a possible coordinated de-escalation across the board, reflecting both political pressures and internal reevaluation. With Binance now operating under tighter compliance frameworks and having undergone significant restructuring since its early run-ins with US regulators, the possibility of a negotiated resolution or narrowed enforcement scope appears increasingly likely. Still, legal uncertainty looms large. Binance’s former CEO, CZ, pleaded guilty to separate federal charges in late 2023 and stepped down from his role, adding further complexity to the case. The SEC’s civil action, however, is distinct from the DOJ’s criminal proceedings. As part of their filing, the SEC and Binance committed to submitting another joint status report at the end of the new 60-day period. The next update is expected by mid-June, and will likely offer deeper insight into whether a resolution is imminent or whether the litigation will continue to drag on. Crypto watchers are cautiously optimistic. With Uyeda at the helm and a task force focused on pragmatic regulation, there is hope that a new chapter of SEC -crypto relations may be unfolding—one rooted less in sweeping enforcement and more in negotiated compliance and constructive dialogue. CZ Denies Cooperating Against Justin Sun, Calls WSJ Report a “Smear Campaign” Amid Rising Crypto Lobbying Tensions In related news, CZ has forcefully denied explosive allegations that he agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with the US Department of Justice (DOJ). The claims, published by The Wall Street Journal on April 11, cite anonymous sources suggesting that Zhao’s cooperation was a previously undisclosed element of his 2023 settlement with US prosecutors. In a sharp rebuke on social media, Zhao took to X to deny the accusations, accusing The Wall Street Journal of running a “hit piece” and implying that the outlet’s journalists may have been bribed. “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn't,” Zhao posted on April 12. “People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.” Zhao, who was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations, was released on Sept. 27 of the same year. Despite the jail time, he remains one of the wealthiest individuals in the world—with an estimated net worth of $60 billion at the time of his release—making him the richest person to ever serve a US prison sentence. The allegations have sent shockwaves through the crypto community, particularly because of the close public association between Zhao and Justin Sun, the Chinese-born entrepreneur who founded the TRON blockchain and has also been the subject of several US regulatory investigations. Sun recently said he was unaware of any such deal and dismissed the rumors. “CZ is my mentor and close friend,” he said, emphasizing that he had no reason to believe Zhao would provide evidence against him. The denial by Sun adds another layer to an already controversial situation and raises questions about the credibility and motive of the WSJ report, which relies heavily on anonymous sources and has not been corroborated by any formal statements from the DOJ. Allegations of Lobbying and Political Targeting Zhao’s fiery response also included a broader critique of what he described as targeted political lobbying within the US aimed at undermining Binance and himself personally. “I also heard some rumors about some players ‘lobbying’ against us again in the US,” he wrote, alluding to potential coordinated efforts by competitors or regulatory influencers to reignite scrutiny on Binance. This isn’t the first time Zhao has raised such claims. In late 2023, he accused collapsed crypto exchange FTX of lobbying US regulators to take action against Binance, pointing to a Federal Newswire report that claimed FTX leadership had sought regulatory pressure on rivals to bolster its own market position. Such accusations are part of a growing narrative in the crypto industry that suggests policy and enforcement decisions are increasingly being shaped by corporate lobbying rather than transparent regulatory processes. CZ’s recent remarks come at a time when political influence in the crypto sector is under intense scrutiny. According to a March report by the Center for Political Accountability (CPA), crypto companies poured over $134 million into the 2024 US elections through Political Action Committees (PACs) like Fairshake, raising concerns about “unchecked political spending.” While many in the industry argue that such donations are necessary to secure fair and balanced regulation, critics warn that it risks undermining public trust. The Wall Street Journal report on Zhao’s alleged cooperation with the DOJ comes just weeks after these revelations, leading some observers to question whether the timing of the article was influenced by broader political and regulatory battles. Legal Context and Lingering Questions CZ’s legal troubles began in earnest in November 2023, when he entered a plea agreement with the DOJ related to systemic AML failures at Binance. The settlement included a $4.3 billion penalty—the largest in crypto history—and his resignation as CEO. However, the plea deal, as publicly disclosed at the time, made no mention of any cooperation agreement involving Justin Sun. The DOJ has so far declined to comment on the WSJ report or provide clarification on whether Zhao’s plea deal includes a clause requiring him to testify against other industry figures. Meanwhile, Justin Sun continues to face legal headwinds. He was charged by the SEC in March 2023 for unregistered securities offerings and fraud relating to the TRX and BitTorrent tokens. While Sun remains active in the crypto space, his legal status within the United States remains unclear, with some reports suggesting he is avoiding US jurisdiction.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB|BTT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-14 05:00:00

From trading above $6.30, OM nosedived to below $0.43 on April 13, erasing nearly $6 billion in market capitalization and sparking a wave of speculation across crypto circles. Traders were quick to voice their concerns, with some drawing grim parallels to the infamous collapses of LUNA and FTX. A market participant known as Gordon posted on X, “The team needs to address this or OM looks like it could head to zero, biggest rug pull since LUNA/FTX?” At the time of publication, the exact cause of the price implosion remains unclear. The Mantra team has yet to issue an official detailed statement, although co-founder JP Mullin attempted to calm the waters by confirming that the team’s OM holdings remain intact and verifiable. “We are here and not going anywhere,” Mullin wrote , directing users to a blockchain address tied to the team’s holdings. MANTRA Community Scrambles for Clarity In an initial response to the growing panic, the Mantra team claimed the collapse was not the result of internal malfeasance but rather “triggered by reckless liquidations.” The statement, shared on social media, emphasized that the core infrastructure of the project remains intact and that the community Telegram group is still active. However, the broader crypto community has grown wary of such assurances. 2025 has already seen multiple high-profile collapses, from the Libra memecoin’s implosion to a $1.4 billion hack at Bybit —leaving investors on edge and increasingly skeptical. Tokenization Ambitions Now in Jeopardy Just months ago, Mantra was making headlines for very different reasons. In January, the platform signed a $1 billion deal with investment conglomerate DAMAC to bring its real estate and data assets onto the blockchain. By February, Mantra had secured a coveted Virtual Asset Service Provider license from Dubai’s VARA, positioning itself as a serious player in the UAE’s booming crypto scene. The project had been riding a wave of optimism from real estate investors looking to leverage blockchain for capital formation, citing faster settlement times and reduced costs. But following the OM token’s plunge, the future of those ambitions now hangs in the balance.

Over the weekend , Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the White House’s decision to exempt items like smartphones, computers, and the semiconductors that power them from tariffs was a temporary measure. President Trump confirmed it later in a press briefing , stating that the tariff rate would be announced next week, but there would be some ""flexibility"" on the matter. ""The market saw a material rebound as popular consumer electronics categories were exempted from the 125% tariffs on China,"" BTSE COO Jeff Mei told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""Even after Trump mentioned that they would simply be moving to another bucket of tariffs rather than exempted altogether, markets held their gain amidst rumors that business leaders were able to convince the Trump administration to peel back some of their highest tariffs."" ""From our side, we believe there will be challenges to shift global supply chains away from China overnight and that low-end, low-margin manufacturing is most likely going to shift to other Asian countries after they broker trade deals. That being said, we do think that this rally looks temporary and that markets will continue to be volatile in the short term,"" Mei added. Meanwhile, China has announced its own tariffs on semiconductors, hitting U.S.-origin chips with a 34% tariff. However, China counts origin as where the chip was fabricated, not designed. As the majority of U.S. chip companies, like AMD and Nvidia, don't operate their own fabs and instead rely on Taiwan's – which China counts as its own territory – TSMC, they would be effectively exempt from these tariffs. Analysts in China acknowledge short-term disruptions from the semiconductor tariffs but broadly view them as an opportunity to accelerate domestic innovation, localization, and supply-chain restructuring, ultimately benefiting China's semiconductor industry in the long run. Local media in Taiwan report that TSMC is accelerating the construction of another fab in Arizona in order to be able to provide more U.S. fabricated chips as a cloud of uncertainty hangs above the sector. Within China, equity traders seem to be waiting on the final tariff news in order to make their next move. Shanghai's SSE composite index is up 0.8%, while Shenzhen's tech-heavy SZSE is up 0.9%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng is up 2.4%. Elsewhere in crypto, Hong Kong's Bosera HashKey Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been approved to offer staking services. This comes after the city's market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, issued guidance on offering staking services in Hong Kong. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X that the market hasn't taken to ether ETFs very kindly. The best-performing ETFs on the market, he wrote, have been those that are short ether ETFs. Ether has been down 47% over the last year, according to CoinDesk market data , while CoinDesk 20 is up 14%.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-14 05:01:11

43316338,https://invezz.com/?p=2669606,1744607100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,PepeX ICO raises $1.35M as Trump’s crypto push fuels market attention,https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/14/pepex-ico-raises-1-35m-as-trumps-crypto-push-fuels-market-attention/,"PepeX’s initial coin offering (ICO) has now surpassed $1,352,050 in funding, as interest accelerates in its fair-launch model aimed at everyday investors. Built on Solana, the PepeX platform is gaining ground at a time when Donald Trump’s expanding presence in crypto—from NFTs to memecoins and stablecoins—is intensifying market speculation. While Trump-linked tokens generate headlines and volatility, retail traders are increasingly turning to platforms like PepeX that focus on transparency, anti-manipulation measures, and long-term potential. With the current presale price set at $0.0268 and just hours left before the next stage increase to $0.0281, momentum is building behind one of the year’s most closely watched launchpad tokens. Presale gains speed with retail support PepeX has captured attention with a presale model that combines urgency and structure. The ICO, now in its 20th stage, has raised more than $1.35 million with just 6 hours left until the next price hike. The token, currently trading at $0.0268, will increase to $0.0281 in the following stage, maintaining a consistent 5% step-up model across 30 phases. This pricing structure, paired with a transparent fundraising countdown, has attracted a growing community of investors. The launchpad itself offers early access to new meme coin projects, providing regular investors a chance to get in before major listings or venture capital allocations—an approach often lacking in previous meme coin cycles. By ensuring fair allocation, PepeX is presenting itself as a secure way to explore high-risk assets with clear checks in place. Anti-sniping and locked liquidity features What sets PepeX apart is its built-in protocol to prevent common manipulation tactics. The platform uses anti-sniping technology to block automated bots that often hijack token launches. It also limits founders to no more than 5% of the token supply, a safeguard designed to reduce the risk of insider dumping once a coin begins trading. PepeX locks and absorbs liquidity if a project’s core team exits unexpectedly, a protection measure rarely seen on other meme coin launch platforms. Transparent wallet tracking and enforced 72-hour holding periods for project creators ensure accountability, tying rewards directly to a token’s performance over time. This structure appeals to traders who are seeking reliable project frameworks after a turbulent year across the broader crypto space. Trump’s crypto ventures boost industry spotlight Donald Trump’s growing footprint in the crypto world is also drawing more eyes to the sector. His ventures span NFTs, Bitcoin mining, DeFi projects, and the TRUMPo/USD memecoin. In January, one Trump-linked token briefly reached a market value of $10 billion, highlighting the power of celebrity-backed assets to drive investor attention. The broader Trump crypto ecosystem is now estimated to be worth close to $1 billion. These developments, combined with executive orders supporting blockchain innovation, have made digital assets a key feature of Trump’s economic platform. His campaign’s promotion of memecoins on Truth Social is reshaping how political capital intersects with speculative trading. Investors turn to structure amid hype Amid the Trump-fuelled frenzy, many investors are moving towards platforms like PepeX for a more structured entry into the market. With its presale progressing steadily, the platform is benefitting from a shift in sentiment: away from unpredictable meme coins and towards projects that prioritise fairness and transparency.

The purchase was made at an average price of 11.8 million yen per BTC, totaling 3.78 billion yen. This brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin stash to 4,525 BTC, bought at an average price of 12.8 million yen per BTC, worth approximately 58.1 billion yen in total. Despite the crypto downturn, Metaplanet’s stock has shown steady performance this year, with a 0.57% gain. With each new acquisition, Metaplanet strengthens its position in the crypto space, signaling strong confidence in BTC’s future value. Metaplanet has acquired 319 BTC for ~$26.3 million at ~$82,549 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 108.3% YTD 2025. As of 4/14/2025, we hold 4525 $BTC acquired for ~$386.3 million at ~$85,366 per bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/aN0Jz9SgwQ — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) April 14, 2025 The company made it happen with a special metric called BTC Yield to measure the success of its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This yield shows how much more Bitcoin they hold compared to their shares in circulation. From January to March 2025, their BTC Yield was a solid 95.6%, and between April 1 to April 14, it was 6.5%, showing continued growth despite a shorter period. How They’re Funding the Buying Spree Metaplanet has been funding its massive Bitcoin purchases by teaming up with EVO FUND, a major investor. Instead of taking regular loans that require interest payments, the company has been issuing zero-coupon bonds, which don’t need interest to be paid. Along with that, EVO FUND gets the right to buy Metaplanet shares at the market price. Moreover, when they buy those shares, Metaplanet receives cash. That cash is then used to either repay the bonds or buy more Bitcoin. Between January and March 2025, Metaplanet rolled out several rounds of these bonds worth 2 to 4 billion yen each, all to support its ongoing Bitcoin investment strategy. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Prediction: Will BTC, ETH, and XRP See a Bullish Week Ahead? , Aggressive Expansion With Minimal Dilution Despite issuing millions of shares, Metaplanet claims it’s carefully managing dilution, which means shareholders aren’t losing too much ownership percentage in the company. The company uses a calculation of “Bitcoin per fully diluted share” to show that each share is becoming more valuable in terms of Bitcoin. The Bigger Picture Metaplanet is following the playbook of U.S.-based Strategy , aggressively turning its treasury into a Bitcoin reserve. By mixing creative finance and strategic share issuance, it’s doubling down on Bitcoin as a long-term asset. With Japan’s growing crypto interest , Metaplanet is positioning itself as a corporate BTC pioneer in Asia. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A clear move above the $2.250 resistance might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance or even $2.50 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.550. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.10 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.080 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.920 swing low to the $2.244 high.

On April 11, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman drafted the bill , seeking to curb emissions from crypto mining and AI data centers. The legislation aims to impose fines on facilities that use non-renewable energy sources, by 2035. The bill also mandates annual reporting from mining facilities and data centers that use over 100 kilowatts of power. Further, the facilities must also provide details of electricity sources, consumption data, and the intensity of emissions. “There is a lack of transparency regarding the energy sources used to power domestic crypto mining and many data center operations,” the bill read. Data Centers Account for 4% US Electricity Use: Congress Finds According to Congress estimates, US-based data centers are projected to account for up to 12% of the nation’s electricity use by 2028. “The total network hash rate for Bitcoin mining in the US has increased 739% between September 2020 and January 2022.” The findings also said that data centers are estimated to account for approximately 1% of global electricity demand, and 4% of US electricity usage. Bill Aims to Lower Mining Emissions to Zero by 2035 The draft bill amends the initial Clean Air Act requiring facilities to adhere to different emissions caps as laid out in the Department of Energy’s National Transmission Needs Study . The emission caps would be set by the end of this year, the bill said, adding that it would lower by 11% each year until reaching zero in 2035. Those facilities that exceed the emissions caps would be imposed with inflation-adjusted fees. The penalty depends on how much their emissions exceeded the caps, the legislation noted. These fees would then be used to reduce increases in residential electricity costs through grants to states and local municipalities. “Crypto & AI data centers can support clean energy, but they’re burning more fossil fuels & driving up families’ energy prices instead,” Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, wrote on X. “We can lead on AI & climate safety with Senate White House’s Clean Cloud Act, which ensures that the industries profiting also pay their own way.” Crypto & AI data centers can support clean energy, but they're burning more fossil fuels & driving up families’ energy prices instead.

President Trump stressed last year that he wants all future Bitcoin to be minted in the U.S. Further, Trump’s eldest sons are involved in the crypto mining industry as well.

However, with the strong rise in recent days, Bitcoin has risen above the $85,000 level. Following this jump, a new assessment came from Wedson. Wedson stated in a statement on social media that many people asked him if he had changed his mind and included the following statements: “We still do not rule out the possibility of Bitcoin falling below $65,000. Many metrics show this level as a strong support area. In particular, True Market Mean Price and Alpha Price are positioned exactly around $64,700.” Wedson also noted that the CVDD Channel is showing support at $66,300, with the next important level being around $61,000. He noted that the Active Realized Price, which has been working as support throughout 2024, is currently at $70,200. Related News: Ripple (XRP) Price at Critical Crossroads: Analyst Says What It Takes to Rally to $2.5 Drawing attention to market behavior, Wedson made the following assessments: “Miners and short-term investors are selling. We have not yet seen a clear accumulation signal. This suggests that the process we are in may be a redistribution phase.” Emphasizing that his views on the altcoin season have not changed, the Alphractal CEO stated that Bitcoin will probably reach its peak in mid-October and altcoins may continue to rise until November or even December. Wedson noted that the Alpha metrics they use in their analyses are generally based on institutional-level analyses that are not publicly available, and drew attention to this with the following words: “We caught the bottom of the FTX crash and the recent peak of Bitcoin on the exact day. We shared them with our community in real time.” He gave a message of cautious optimism for altcoins: “Many altcoins may still decline due to long accumulation. However, some new projects may start to rise at any time.” *This is not investment advice.

For the first time in weeks, the MACD histogram has flipped green, and the MACD line has crossed above the signal line—indicating strengthening upward momentum. This is a classic early signal of a potential rally continuation . Bollinger Bands are beginning to widen after a period of contraction, suggesting volatility is returning to the market. BTC is also trading above the midline of the Bollinger Bands, reinforcing short-term bullish control. Consolidation Base Formed Near $77,000 From a price structure perspective, Bitcoin has formed a strong support base of around $77,000. This level has held firm through several re-tests, forming a horizontal accumulation zone. The current breakout attempt above $82,800, the middle band of the Bollinger setup, is notable. If Bitcoin maintains closes above this zone, the next logical move could be a test of the upper Bollinger Band near $88,000, followed by the psychological barrier at $90,000. Buyers appear to be absorbing supply, and higher lows continue to build a bullish structure. 4-Hour Chart Supports Breakout Thesis with Bull Flag Pattern Zooming into the 4-hour chart, BTC is carving out a bull flag formation—a bullish continuation pattern. After an impulsive leg up, the price entered a tight channel, consolidating in a downward-sloping structure. This pattern often precedes further rallies, especially when confirmed by volume expansion and MACD strength. The 4-hour MACD also reflects bullish control, with rising histogram bars and expanding separation between the MACD and signal lines. If Bitcoin breaks above $85,000 in the short term, it may rapidly climb toward $87,500–$88,000 before facing resistance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Support and Resistance Zones to Monitor Closely On the downside, immediate support lies at $82,800, followed by the demand-rich zone of $80,000–$77,500. These areas have provided structural integrity and will likely serve as re-entry zones if the price dips. On the upside, Bitcoin must reclaim and sustain above $88,200, which marks the top of the current Bollinger range. A decisive breakout beyond that level could open the path toward $92,000–$95,000, a region where prior selling pressure emerged. Volume confirmation and market sentiment will be essential in validating these levels. Price Prediction For Today Given the confluence of bullish indicators on both daily and 4-hour charts, Bitcoin is likely to trade between $83,500 and $88,000 today. If momentum accelerates and volume picks up during the U.S. session, BTC could tag the $89,000 mark intraday. Conversely, if the price faces rejection around $85,000, a short-term pullback to $82,800 is possible before resuming upward movement. The prevailing structure suggests any dips are likely to be bought aggressively, as bulls prepare for a broader breakout. Bitcoin is showing clear signs of a trend reversal, supported by a bullish MACD crossover, Bollinger Band expansion, and stable support formation. Both intraday and macro indicators align in favor of buyers, increasing the probability of an upward breakout in the near term. As market sentiment improves and technical strengthen, BTC could be on track for a rally toward the $90,000 region—setting the stage for a potentially explosive second quarter. Traders should monitor the $85,000 breakout zone closely for directional confirmation. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Now, well known people in the industry like Adam Back and Joe Burnett are still bullish, and predict long-term price targets as high as $2.1 million by 2035. Meanwhile, Bitcoin adoption continues to expand, with Scotland’s Lomond School becoming the UK’s first to accept BTC for tuition and introducing a curriculum on Bitcoin and Austrian economics in partnership with author Saifedean Ammous. Michael Saylor Signals Bitcoin Buying Spree Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, signaled the company's intention to resume its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy after a brief two-week pause. On March 31, Strategy made its latest purchase of 22,048 BTC, which brought up its total holdings to 528,185 BTC. According to data from SaylorTracker , the firm’s Bitcoin investment is currently up by around 26%, translating to over $8.6 billion in unrealized gains. Despite the recent downturn that saw Bitcoin's price dip below $80,000, Strategy was able to maintain its accumulation pace. This proved that there is still strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin. Strategy Bitcoin (Source: SaylorTracker ) Bitcoin demonstrated resilience despite the recent macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly as global markets reacted to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff orders triggered a historic $5 trillion sell-off in global equities, and cryptocurrencies were not immune. Data from Total3 , which is a market cap tracker excluding BTC and ETH, revealed that altcoins have lost more than 33% of their value since peaking in December of 2024. In contrast, Bitcoin dropped approximately 22% from its January 2025 high of over $109,000, but is holding relatively steady around the $84,000 level. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) This price stability fueled the narrative of Bitcoin as a store-of-value asset, distinct from traditional risk-on investments. At Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and well known cypherpunk, suggested that Bitcoin's appeal as digital gold is growing in light of persistent macroeconomic threats. Back anticipates inflation rates could surge to between 10% and 15% over the next decade, putting pressure on returns from conventional asset classes like stocks and real estate. He believes in Bitcoin’s potential to compete directly with gold, and explained that it could begin to take over gold’s traditional use cases as more investors look for protection against monetary debasement. Analysts Stick to Bold Bitcoin Predictions Bitcoin is still on a long-term bullish trajectory despite recent price corrections and weakening investor sentiment that was triggered by escalating global trade tensions. Joe Burnett , director of market research at Unchained, shared his perspective during a live show , and predicted that Bitcoin could still reach $1.8 million by 2035. He mentioned two models he considers credible: the ”parallel model,” which forecasts Bitcoin at $1.8 million, and Michael Saylor’s “Bitcoin 24” model, which projects a $2.1 million price point in the same timeframe. Burnett believes that both serve as realistic base cases, but Bitcoin’s future value could surpass them depending on broader macroeconomic shifts. The ongoing trade war climate, spurred by President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff threats since taking office in January, dented risk appetite across equities and crypto markets. While physical and tokenized gold emerged as beneficiaries of this risk-off sentiment, Bitcoin’s store-of-value appeal remains intact. Burnett compared Bitcoin’s potential to the technological shift from horse-and-buggy to automobiles, and argued that Bitcoin’s properties will allow it to eventually eclipse gold’s $21 trillion market capitalization. If Bitcoin were to match that valuation today, it would be worth $1 million per coin. Despite short-term weakness and falling ETF inflows, Bitcoin’s volatility continues to decline in both bull and bear markets, which he believes is a sign of growing maturity in the asset class. Burnett acknowledged that another steep drawdown of up to 80% could still happen during future bear cycles, but he sees these periods as strategic entry points for long-term holders with strong conviction. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes shares a similar opinion, and predicted Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2025 if the US Federal Reserve shifts back to quantitative easing. (Source: Arthur Hayes ) However, in the immediate term, uncertainty surrounding global trade negotiations continues to pressure market sentiment. Enmanuel Cardozo , a market analyst at tokenization platform Brickken, pointed out that investors are reluctant to take on big positions over the next 90 days as they await more clarity on the tariff landscape. With capital flowing out of Bitcoin ETFs, many are reallocating funds into traditional safe havens like gold and strong national currencies. UK School Adds Bitcoin and Austrian Economics Curriculum In other Bitcoin-related news, a private educational institute in Scotland announced that it will begin accepting Bitcoin for tuition payments starting in the autumn semester of 2025. This will make it the first school in the United Kingdom to adopt BTC as a payment method. Interestingly, the school also partnered with Saifedean Ammous , the well-known author of The Bitcoin Standard, to develop a new curriculum that is focused on Bitcoin and Austrian economics. Ammous is very excited for the initiative, and stated that his goal is to make the material widely accessible to students all around the world. Claire Chisholm , Principal of Lomond School, confirmed the collaboration. She looks forward to working with Ammous and appreciates the strong support from the broader Bitcoin community. The forthcoming curriculum is expected to provide students with a foundational understanding of Bitcoin’s principles and the economic theories that underpin it, particularly those rooted in Austrian economics. This is a school of thought known for advocating sound money and limited government intervention. Ammous’s book The Bitcoin Standard was first published in 2018, and played a pivotal role in popularizing Bitcoin’s monetary philosophy. More than one million copies have been sold in 38 languages. Now, the collaboration with Lomond School is a major milestone in the expanding relationship between Bitcoin and mainstream education. Across the world, academic institutions have increasingly embraced Bitcoin as both a topic of scholarly inquiry and a practical financial tool. The University of Nicosia in Cyprus was one of the first to offer a Master’s in Digital Currency back in 2013. This was followed by courses at major US universities like NYU’s Stern School of Business, which introduced a course on the law and business of cryptocurrencies in 2014, and Stanford University’s Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies course that was launched in 2015. More recently, the University of Austin unveiled a $5 million Bitcoin investment fund in February of 2025 as part of its larger $200 million endowment, making it the first of its kind. Before that, it was revealed that Emory University invested more than $15 million into Bitcoin through Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-14 05:28:51

OM plunged from over $6 to just over 40 cents late Sunday to early Monday in typically low liquidity hours for the crypto market — where outsized volumes can trigger massive price movements in either direction. “We want to assure you that MANTRA is fundamentally strong,” the team said in an X post following the price drop. “Today’s activity was triggered by reckless liquidations, not anything to do with the project. One thing we want to be clear on: this was not our team. We are looking into it and will share more details about what happened as soon as we can.” Mantra lets users tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and commodities, enabling compliant digital investments in tangible assets. Its OM token facilitates transactions and governance. In January 2025, Mantra partnered with DAMAC Group, a UAE-based conglomerate, to tokenize $1 billion in assets, including real estate, hospitality, and data centers. OM was among the biggest market gainers in 2024, rising more than 400% on relatively low public conversation on crypto-related social media - which intrigued traders and investors alike on the strength of the move. Meanwhile, co-founder John Patrick Mullin alleged the movement was likely due to exchanges closing OM positions, which impacted all market exposure. “We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders,” Mullin said in an X post . “The timing and depth of the crash suggest that a very sudden closure of account positions was initiated without sufficient warning or notice.” He further alleged “intentional market positioning taken by centralized exchanges.” OM-tracked futures recorded over $50 million in liquidations on the long side, a record figure for the tokens. Open interest slumped from $345 million to just over $130 million, indicating a quick exit for unsettled futures bets. Some prominent crypto voices aren’t buying that narrative, however, with scores of dismissive replies under Mullin’s posts . OKX founder Star Xu added in a response to a separate post that flagged over $220 million in token deposits to exchanges before the price crash. ""It’s a big scandal to the whole crypto industry. All of the onchain unlock and deposit data is public, all major exchanges’ collateral and liquidation data can be investigated. OKX will make all of the reports ready,"" Xu said.",Markets|MANTRA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LUNA|MARKET|TRADING|OM,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-14 05:39:06

With a price of $0.0268 in its ongoing 30-stage, 90-day presale, PepeX is drawing comparisons to established meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and PepeCoin (PEPECOIN), igniting discussions about its competitive edge. As the market remains volatile, investors are scrutinizing PepeX’s value proposition against its peers, though the establishment narrative of inevitable meme coin success warrants skepticism. PepeX’s presale began at $0.02, with a 5% price increase per stage, reaching $0.0268 by Stage 6, with 75 days remaining, as noted by the official PepeX account on X. This gradual rise has attracted significant interest, with 45% of its 2.25 billion token supply sold, per CoinJournal on April 10, 2025. Why PepeX is popular? Its AI-driven platform aims to revolutionize meme coin launches, offering fairness and reducing pump-and-dump risks seen in 99% of Pump.fun projects, aclaim that challenges the hype-driven model of many rivals. In contrast, Pepe (PEPE), an Ethereum-based meme coin, trades at $0.00000739, with a $3.1 billion market cap, per Bybit on April 12, 2025. Despite a 7.55% daily gain, it remains 75% below its $0.000028 all-time high from December 2024, per CoinMarketCap, reflecting stagnation after its 2023 surge. PepeCoin (PEPECOIN), another contender, sits at $0.5114 with a $54.7 million market cap, up 9.52% in 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap on April 13, 2025, but trails its $7.51 peak by 93%. Both coins lack the utility PepeX promises, relying on community hype and token burns, which may not sustain long-term value. PepeX’s $0.0268 price is significantly higher than PEPE’s micro-value and aligns closer to PEPECOIN’s range, reflecting its early-stage premium. PepeX set for a surge Analysts suggest PepeX could see a 332% presale surge to $0.0836 if momentum holds, outpacing PEPE’s modest recovery and PEPECOIN’s volatility. However, its unproven status and reliance on AI adoption raise risks, especially in a market where 45% bearish sentiment persists for similar coins, per Bitget on April 13, 2025. Posts found on X show 28% bullish sentiment, but the lack of exchange listings post-presale could limit liquidity compared to PEPE’s established presence on Binance and PEPECOIN’s LBank trading. The establishment narrative of meme coin dominance often overlooks utility gaps—PEPE’s no-tax appeal and PEPECOIN’s burning mechanism haven’t prevented declines, suggesting PepeX’s AI focus could be a differentiator if executed well. Investors should weigh PepeX’s growth potential against PEPE’s stability and PEPECOIN’s recovery, monitoring presale progress and market trends for informed decisions.

43316489,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149058,1744609397,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Smart Empire Play: Decoding Musk’s xAI Merger and its Crypto Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/musk-xai-merger-crypto-empire/,"Elon Musk’s recent move to merge his AI venture, xAI, with X (formerly Twitter), has sparked intense debate in tech and finance circles, particularly within the cryptocurrency community. Was this an ingenious maneuver to solidify his tech empire, or just another audacious gamble by the enigmatic billionaire? For those invested in the crypto ecosystem and the broader narrative of decentralized technologies, understanding the implications of this Musk xAI merger is crucial. Let’s unpack this complex deal and see what it truly means for investors and the future of AI. Decoding the Musk xAI Merger: A Strategic Masterstroke? When the news broke that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock deal, the immediate reaction was mixed. On the surface, it appeared unconventional. However, digging deeper reveals a potentially calculated strategy. Here’s a breakdown of why this Musk xAI merger might be more strategic than it seems: Synergy and Integration: Grok, xAI’s chatbot, was already interwoven with X. Formalizing the merger streamlines operations and deepens this Twitter integration . Financial Restructuring: X’s financial performance has been challenging. Integrating it with the potentially high-growth xAI could reframe X as an integral part of a larger, more valuable AI-driven entity. AGI Ambitions: Musk has consistently voiced his ambition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This merger positions X as a vital data source and distribution platform for xAI’s AGI development, fueling his broader vision for his tech empire. Yoni Rechtman from Slow Ventures aptly summarizes the essence of Musk’s conglomerate: “All of Elon’s companies today are basically one company… It’s all already Elon, Inc.” This perspective suggests the merger is less about two separate entities joining forces, and more about formalizing the already deeply interconnected nature of Musk’s ventures. The Allure of the Elon Musk Empire: Beyond Quick Returns Investing in any of Musk’s companies, including those involved in the Musk xAI merger , is often perceived differently from traditional investments. It’s less about immediate ROI and more about buying into a grander narrative. Investors are drawn to Musk’s persona, his audacious goals, and the overarching story of disruptive innovation he projects. This approach to AI investment is narrative-driven, where faith in Musk’s vision often outweighs conventional financial metrics. Ron Baron of Baron Capital highlights this ecosystem effect: “every single thing [Musk] does is helping everything else he does.” This interconnectedness extends across Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, creating a powerful crypto ecosystem (in a broader sense of interconnected assets and valuations) around Musk’s leadership. Consider these interconnected elements within the Elon Musk empire : Company Contribution to the Ecosystem Tesla EV technology, autonomous driving, humanoid robots, data for AI training. SpaceX Space infrastructure, potential for global internet, resource sharing. X (Twitter) Vast real-time data, distribution platform for AI, social media reach. xAI AI research and development, Grok chatbot, AGI pursuit. Neuralink Brain-computer interfaces, long-term potential for human-AI synergy. Valuation in the Musk Era: Hope Over Hard Numbers? The financial details of the Musk xAI merger raised eyebrows. Questions arose about X’s $33 billion valuation and xAI’s $80 billion valuation, especially given xAI’s limited revenue. However, in the “Muskverse,” valuations are often future-oriented, fueled by investor expectations rather than current financials. This mirrors Tesla’s long-standing high valuation, justified by the promise of future breakthroughs in self-driving technology and robotics. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management explains Tesla’s valuation premium: “people are making a bet on the long term, and it’s not about what happens to numbers this year.” This long-term faith is “one of Elon’s superpowers,” enabling him to maintain investor engagement and support for ambitious, long-horizon projects. This investor sentiment is crucial for understanding the dynamics of AI investment in Musk’s ventures. Risks and Realities: Navigating the Musk Ecosystem While the potential of the Musk xAI merger is compelling, it’s essential to acknowledge the risks. Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School, points out immediate concerns like the SEC lawsuit against X, user privacy issues related to AI data collection, and the evolving regulatory landscape for AI. Key risk factors to consider: SEC Lawsuit: The ongoing legal battle over Musk’s Twitter acquisition adds uncertainty. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increasing attention on AI regulation, particularly in Europe, could impact xAI and X’s operations. User Privacy: Data collection practices for AI training on X are already under investigation. Musk’s Focus: Rechtman raises a valid point about Musk’s potentially shifting priorities, citing his recent focus on non-business ventures. Despite these risks, Munster remains optimistic, viewing them as minor compared to the transformative potential of AI and xAI’s role in it. He sees xAI as potentially “one of the four brains that the world is going to run on,” a powerful statement underscoring the high-stakes, high-reward nature of AI investment in Musk’s vision. Betting on Elon: A Leap of Faith? Ultimately, investing in the Musk xAI merger , or any part of Musk’s empire, requires a degree of faith. Rechtman suggests Musk bulls are not blindly loyal but rather trust in his ability to “bend capital markets to his will.” This unique capability allows him to pursue projects and build businesses that defy conventional limitations. For many investors, gaining access to the Musk ecosystem is a strategic goal in itself. As Rechtman notes, “SpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public… the only way to invest in SpaceX is to get access to the tenders. And the only way to get access to the tenders is to be in Elon’s good graces.” This exclusivity further fuels the allure of investing in Musk’s broader ventures, even seemingly speculative ones like X post-acquisition. Conclusion: The Smart Gamble on Musk’s Vision The Musk xAI merger is more than just a corporate transaction; it’s a reflection of a unique investment paradigm centered around Elon Musk’s vision and execution. Whether it’s a brilliant strategic move or a high-stakes gamble remains to be seen. However, for those already invested in the Elon Musk empire and the future of AI investment , it represents a deepened commitment to a narrative of unprecedented technological advancement and market disruption. The merger underscores the intertwined nature of Musk’s companies and the unique dynamics of investing in his ambitious endeavors. It’s a bet not just on xAI and X, but on the enduring power of the Musk mystique and his ability to shape the future of technology.

Binance Points to Liquidations and Token Supply Changes,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-did-mantra-om-crash-binance-points-to-liquidations-and-token-supply-changes/,"The post Why Did Mantra (OM) Crash? Binance Points to Liquidations and Token Supply Changes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The market capitulation for the Mantra (OM), a first-level layer 1 project focused on real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, has attracted significant attention. The previously highly decorated project has now been likened to the Tera Luna (UST) crash due to the similarity of the situation. Moreover, both projects had gained significant trust from both retail and institutional investors to scale to a market cap of over $7.4 billion before dropping to around $782 million on Monday, April 14, during the early European trading session. Binance Take on Mantra Crash With more than $71 million liquidated from the leveraged OM markets in the past 24 hours, mostly from Bybit, Binance stepped in to clear the air. Binance announced that cross-exchange liquidation was a major contributor to the OM price crash today . According to Binance, the significant change in OM tokenomics is also a major contributor to today’s capitulation. Moreover, the MANTRA team increased the circulating supply of OM from 888,888,888 to 1,777,777,777. Additionally, the MANTRA team uncapped the supply of OM and introduced an annual inflation of around 3 percent to enhance staking rewards. “Since October of last year, Binance has implemented various risk control measures including reducing the leverage levels, with regard to the $OM token. Since January this year, Binance has also issued a pop-up warning for $OM on its spot trading page to inform users that the token has undergone significant changes to its tokenomics increasing its supply,” Binance noted . What Next? Following the selloff of more than 43.6 million OM coins, worth over $227 million earlier today, attention has shifted to the team allocation. Although the Mantra core developers have attempted to reassure investors of a stable project, a buyback from the secondary market is the only option to regain user trust. Moreover, the RWA space is fast growing and competition is stiff for investors to be trapped in a poorly managed project amid the anticipated altseason. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43316658,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149078,1744609756,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Shocking U-Turn: Trump Tariffs Slam Tech, Security Probe Intensifies",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-tariffs-tech-security-probe/,"The tech world is reeling from a dramatic policy reversal as former U.S. President Donald Trump clarified his stance on tariffs, sending ripples of uncertainty through the electronics industry. Just when it seemed like tech devices had dodged a tariff bullet, Trump’s recent statements on Truth Social have confirmed that there will be no tariff exceptions for the tech sector. This sudden shift has sparked concerns about the future of the electronics supply chain and national security. Why the Sudden Shift on Trump Tariffs? In a move that has caught many off guard, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to set the record straight. His message was clear: reports of tariff exceptions for tech products were premature. According to Trump, these products aren’t getting a free pass; instead, they are being reclassified under the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs. This isn’t a new tax, but rather a reassignment to a different tariff “bucket,” as Trump put it. This clarification effectively means that tech devices, including smartphones and computers, are indeed subject to tariffs, contrary to earlier indications from Customs and Border Protection guidance released on April 11. Key Takeaways from Trump’s Statement: No Exceptions: Trump explicitly stated, “there was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday” for tech products. Fentanyl Tariffs Apply: Tech products are now subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs. Reclassification, Not Relief: The products are simply “moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket,'” indicating no actual reduction in tariff pressure. This abrupt change in messaging highlights the volatile nature of trade policy and its immediate impact on industries heavily reliant on global supply chains. For the tech sector, which had briefly anticipated relief, this news brings renewed challenges and necessitates a swift reassessment of strategies. Electronics Supply Chain Under Scrutiny: What Does a Security Probe Mean? Beyond the immediate tariff implications, Trump’s statement hinted at a more profound concern: national security. He announced that “we are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” This signals a significant escalation beyond mere trade disputes, delving into the realm of national security implications within the tech sector. Understanding the National Security Angle: Semiconductor Focus: Semiconductors, the bedrock of modern electronics, are specifically highlighted for investigation. Broad Scope: The probe extends to the “WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN,” suggesting a comprehensive review from raw materials to finished products. National Security Justification: Framing tariffs under the umbrella of national security adds a layer of complexity and potential long-term implications. A national security investigation into the electronics supply chain could trigger far-reaching consequences. It could lead to stricter regulations, increased scrutiny of foreign manufacturers, and potentially incentivize domestic production of semiconductors and other critical electronic components. For businesses operating within this space, this means preparing for potential disruptions and adapting to a landscape where national security considerations are paramount. Impact on Semiconductor Tariffs and the Tech Industry The semiconductor industry, already navigating global chip shortages and geopolitical tensions, now faces another layer of uncertainty with the renewed focus on semiconductor tariffs . Trump’s emphasis on semiconductors within the national security investigation underscores the strategic importance of this sector. Tariffs on semiconductors can have a cascading effect throughout the tech industry, impacting everything from smartphone production to automotive manufacturing and beyond. Potential Impacts of Semiconductor Tariffs: Increased Costs: Tariffs directly increase the cost of imported semiconductors, potentially leading to higher prices for consumer electronics. Supply Chain Disruptions: Changes in tariff policies can disrupt established supply chains, forcing companies to seek alternative sources or absorb increased costs. Innovation Slowdown: Higher component costs and supply chain instability can hinder innovation and R&D investments in the tech sector. Competitive Disadvantage: U.S. tech companies may face a competitive disadvantage if tariffs raise their production costs compared to international rivals. For investors and industry stakeholders, monitoring developments related to semiconductor tariffs and the national security probe is crucial. The outcomes of these investigations could reshape the global electronics market and redefine international trade relationships. Navigating the New Tariff Landscape: Actionable Insights In the face of these evolving Trump tariffs and security probes, businesses in the tech and electronics sectors need to adopt a proactive and adaptable approach. Here are some actionable insights: Scenario Planning: Develop multiple scenarios based on different tariff outcomes and security regulations to prepare for various possibilities. Supply Chain Diversification: Explore diversifying supply chains to reduce reliance on any single region and mitigate tariff risks. Domestic Production Review: Assess the feasibility of increasing domestic production or sourcing components from countries less likely to be affected by tariffs. Lobbying and Advocacy: Engage in industry advocacy and lobbying efforts to communicate concerns and seek favorable policy adjustments. Cost Optimization: Identify areas for cost optimization within the supply chain and operations to absorb potential tariff impacts. The renewed tariff focus and national security probe represent significant challenges for the tech industry. However, by understanding the evolving landscape and taking strategic actions, businesses can navigate these uncertainties and position themselves for resilience in a dynamic global market. Conclusion: A Volatile Future for Tech and Trade? Donald Trump’s latest pronouncements have injected a fresh dose of volatility into the tech industry and the broader landscape of international trade. The clarification that tech tariffs are indeed in effect, coupled with the looming national security investigation into the electronics supply chain, signals a potentially turbulent period ahead. Businesses must remain vigilant, adaptable, and strategic to weather these policy shifts and capitalize on any emerging opportunities. The coming months will be critical in determining the long-term impact of these policies on the tech sector and the global economy.

You’re not alone. The crypto market’s temperature gauge, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , has just taken a significant dip, falling a sharp 14 points to land at 31. This movement, reported on April 14th, pushes the index deeper into the ‘Fear’ zone, signaling a palpable shift in crypto market sentiment . Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Sentiment Thermometer Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a sentiment thermometer for the often-turbulent cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, it offers a snapshot of the prevailing emotions driving investor behavior. A score of 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’, suggesting investors are overly worried and potentially selling off their assets, while a score of 100 reflects ‘Extreme Greed’, pointing to a market brimming with exuberance and potential overbuying. This index isn’t pulled from thin air; it’s a carefully calculated metric that blends six key factors to paint a comprehensive picture of market sentiment. Let’s break down what fuels this index: Volatility (25%): Large swings in the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, can trigger fear. The index measures current and maximum drawdowns to gauge volatility-driven fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Strong buying volume indicates greed, while weak volume during price rallies might suggest fear and a lack of conviction in the market’s upward trajectory. Social Media (15%): Analyzing social media sentiment, particularly on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, provides insights into the general mood surrounding cryptocurrencies. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, periodic crypto surveys gauge investor sentiment directly, contributing to the overall index score. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear as investors flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin during market uncertainty. Conversely, decreasing Bitcoin dominance might suggest a risk-on sentiment favoring altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzing Google Trends for crypto-related search terms helps understand general public interest and curiosity, reflecting potential shifts in sentiment. Index Value Market Sentiment 0-24 Extreme Fear 25-49 Fear 50-74 Greed 75-100 Extreme Greed Why Does a ‘Fear’ Zone Matter for Your Crypto Investments? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dips into the ‘Fear’ zone, it’s more than just a number – it’s a potential indicator of market opportunities and risks for your crypto investment strategy . Historically, periods of high fear can present compelling buying opportunities. Why? Because fear often leads to undervaluation. When everyone is panicking and selling, asset prices can drop below their intrinsic value, creating a chance for savvy investors to accumulate crypto at discounted prices. However, it’s crucial to remember that the Fear & Greed Index is not a crystal ball. It’s a sentiment indicator, not a precise predictor of future price movements. A ‘Fear’ zone doesn’t guarantee an immediate price rebound. It simply suggests that market sentiment is leaning towards fear, which can be driven by various factors, including: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, inflation concerns, and interest rate hikes can all contribute to market fear. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory attention or negative pronouncements from government bodies can dampen market enthusiasm. Black Swan Events: Unexpected events like exchange collapses or major hacks can trigger sharp drops in market confidence and a surge in fear. Market Volatility: As highlighted earlier, increased market volatility itself feeds into fear. Sharp price drops can trigger stop-loss orders and panic selling, further exacerbating the downward pressure. Navigating Market Anxiety: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, the index is flashing ‘Fear’ – what should you do? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Don’t Panic Sell: Resist the urge to make emotionally driven decisions. Fear can be contagious, but panic selling often locks in losses. Review Your Portfolio: Use this as an opportunity to reassess your portfolio. Are your holdings aligned with your long-term investment goals? Is your risk tolerance appropriate for the current market conditions? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider implementing a DCA strategy. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. This can help smooth out volatility and potentially lower your average entry price over time. Do Your Research (DYOR): ‘Fear’ periods can be a good time to research fundamentally strong crypto projects. Look for projects with solid technology, strong teams, and real-world use cases that are likely to weather market downturns. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news and developments. Understanding the underlying reasons for market fear can help you make more informed decisions. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Tool, Not a Rule The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool for gauging crypto market sentiment and understanding the prevailing emotions driving the market. However, it’s essential to use it as one data point among many in your overall crypto investment strategy . Don’t rely solely on the index to make buy or sell decisions. Combine it with your own research, fundamental analysis, and risk management strategies to navigate the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of cryptocurrency investments. Remember, market cycles are a natural part of the crypto landscape. Periods of fear are often followed by periods of greed, and vice versa. By understanding market sentiment and adopting a rational, long-term approach, you can position yourself to potentially benefit from both the highs and the lows of the crypto market.

Chainlink addition Perhaps the biggest X channel dedicated to covering Pi Network news, dubbed with the simple Pi News nickname, outlined a significant integration for the protocol’s native token. Chainlink, arguably the most notable blockchain oracle network, has added Pi Network to its 22 new data streams. According to the Pi News team, this is a ‘huge leap’ for underlying asset’s integration into the broader crypto ecosystem. BREAKING: Chainlink just added #PiNetwork to its 22 new Data Streams!

Real-time, reliable data = next-level utility pic.twitter.com/nF7Aohsb7r — Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) April 13, 2025 Pi ad network pilot completed Previously, the team announced that the Pi Ad Network finished its pilot phase, which allows developers to apply and join it now. The system allows advertisers to use Pi to place ads in the ecosystem and native apps. It began with a pilot launch to 5 community apps and was ‘iterated along with these developers’ within the test phase. “The Ad Network is the first instantiation of a platform-level utility that leverages Pi Network’s collective resources to bring real, organic use cases to the Pi cryptocurrency,” reads the blog post . Most notably, the team informed that the first group of Pi Adds that operated in the pilot has now started to generate and receive ad revenue. Nevertheless, the ‘premise of selection is to be listed in the Mainnet Ecosystem Interface and compliant with developer ecosystem guidelines.’ The project’s disclaimer warned that simply applying does not guarantee the app in question will be included in the Pi Ad Network, as all requirements of the Mainneet ecosystem listing must be met. More on those – here . PI price recovery Following an extended turbulent and painful period for the protocol’s native token, in which its price tumled by over 80% within a month or so to an all-time low of $0.4, the asset has began an impressive recovery that rages on even today. It marked double-digit price increases for a few consecutive days, which could be attributed to positive developments, such as the ones mentioned above, or the overall market resurgence. However, PI is up by 2-3% today as well, even though most alts and BTC have retraced slightly. As a result of the bullish performance in the past week, PI has almost doubled its value since the ATL and now sits above $0.75. Its market cap has pushed the token within the top 30 alts by that metric. PI Token Price.

You’re not alone. The Altcoin Season Index, a key metric for gauging the pulse of the cryptocurrency market, has just flashed a signal, and it’s pointing straight to Bitcoin Season . According to CoinMarketCap (CMC), as of 00:34 UTC on April 14th, the index sits at a low 15, unchanged from the previous day. But what exactly does this mean for you, and is it time to rethink your crypto strategy? Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Crypto Market Weather Vane Think of the Altcoin Season Index as your crypto market weather vane. It’s a fascinating tool that helps us understand whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, or if Bitcoin is taking the center stage. Tracked diligently by CoinMarketCap, this index cuts through the noise to give a clear snapshot of market momentum. Let’s break down what makes this index tick: What it Measures: The index meticulously compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure reflection of market sentiment towards true crypto assets. The Score Spectrum: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger ‘Altcoin Season,’ while a lower score points towards ‘Bitcoin Season.’ Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially in ‘Altcoin Season,’ a significant majority – at least 75% – of the top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This signifies broad-based growth across the altcoin spectrum. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ emerges when Bitcoin’s dominance shines. This happens when 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins have managed to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. The current reading of 15 firmly places us in this territory. Why Bitcoin Season Matters in the Crypto Market So, the Altcoin Season Index is flashing ‘Bitcoin Season’ – but why should you care? Understanding these market phases is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto landscape and making informed investment decisions. Here’s what Bitcoin Season typically implies for the crypto market : Bitcoin Dominance Reigns: During Bitcoin Season, Bitcoin tends to outperform a vast majority of altcoins. This often signals a market-wide trend where investors gravitate towards the perceived safety and established reputation of Bitcoin, especially during times of uncertainty or market correction. Altcoin Underperformance (Relatively): While altcoins might still experience growth during Bitcoin Season, their gains are generally less pronounced compared to Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are declining, but rather that Bitcoin is capturing a larger share of market momentum and investor attention. Capital Flow Dynamics: Bitcoin Season often sees capital flowing from altcoins back into Bitcoin. Investors might reduce their altcoin holdings to increase their Bitcoin positions, seeking refuge in the original cryptocurrency amidst market fluctuations or anticipation of Bitcoin-led rallies. Market Sentiment Shift: A prolonged Bitcoin Season can sometimes indicate a broader shift in market sentiment, potentially suggesting increased risk aversion or a flight to quality within the crypto space. Navigating Bitcoin Dominance: Opportunities and Strategic Moves While Bitcoin dominance might seem like altcoins are taking a backseat, astute crypto enthusiasts know that every market phase presents unique opportunities. Bitcoin Season is no exception. Let’s explore both the potential advantages and challenges this phase brings: Opportunities in Bitcoin Season: Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to strategically accumulate more Bitcoin. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value, this period might offer chances to increase your holdings, potentially at more favorable prices relative to altcoins. Focus on Altcoin Gems: With the spotlight on Bitcoin, it’s an excellent time to delve deeper into researching fundamentally strong altcoins. Identify projects with solid technology, strong teams, and real-world use cases that might be undervalued during Bitcoin Season. These could be poised for significant growth when altcoin season eventually returns. Portfolio Rebalancing: Bitcoin Season provides a chance to re-evaluate your portfolio allocation. If you were heavily weighted in altcoins, you might consider rebalancing to increase your Bitcoin exposure, aligning your portfolio with the current market trend. Considerations During Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Portfolio Performance: Be aware that your altcoin portfolio might experience slower growth or even temporary declines during Bitcoin Season compared to Bitcoin’s performance. This is a natural part of market cycles and not necessarily a cause for alarm if you’ve invested in fundamentally sound projects. Market Cycle Awareness: Recognize that Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season are cyclical. Market dynamics are constantly shifting. Bitcoin Season is not permanent, and altcoins will likely regain momentum in future cycles. Patience and a long-term perspective are key. Actionable Insights: Thriving in a Bitcoin Season So, the Altcoin Season Index is at 15, confirming Bitcoin Season is upon us. What practical steps can you take to navigate this phase effectively and potentially even thrive? Here are some actionable insights: Portfolio Review and Adjustment: Take a close look at your current crypto portfolio. How is it performing in the current Bitcoin-dominant market? Is your asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals in this phase? Consider adjustments, such as strategically increasing your Bitcoin allocation. In-depth Altcoin Research: Use this time to conduct thorough research on altcoins. Identify projects with strong fundamentals, innovative technologies, and dedicated communities. Look for altcoins that have the potential to outperform when market sentiment shifts back towards altcoins. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto market is incredibly dynamic. Stay updated on market trends, news, and the Altcoin Season Index . Be prepared to adapt your strategies as market conditions evolve. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Market cycles can evoke emotions. Resist the urge to make impulsive decisions based on short-term price fluctuations. Stick to your long-term investment strategy and make informed choices based on research and analysis, not fear or hype. Conclusion: Riding the Bitcoin Wave with Wisdom The Altcoin Season Index registering 15 is a clear indicator: we are currently navigating a Bitcoin Season in the crypto market . While the allure of altcoins might seem temporarily dimmed, this phase is far from a setback. It’s a natural rhythm in the ever-evolving crypto symphony, presenting savvy investors with unique opportunities. By understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin Season, making strategic portfolio adjustments, and staying informed, you can not only weather this phase but also position yourself for potential gains in the exciting cycles to come. Remember, in the world of crypto, knowledge and adaptability are your most powerful assets.

This fast-growing altcoin project has caught the attention of analysts for its rapid community growth, aggressive presale rollout, and unusually high upside potential for a coin still in its early stages. With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , the presale has become one of the most talked-about events in the altcoin space this quarter. ANALYST PREDICTIONS PUT MAGACOIN FINANCE ON THE MAP While XRP remains under its long-term resistance and Solana retraces from its highs, analysts are turning to smaller caps for early-stage opportunity . MAGACOIN FINANCE is now appearing in multiple April watchlists, with experts citing its ability to offer substantial returns with lower capital entry. The presale price of $0.0002908 (mentioned across recent reports) stands in stark contrast to its confirmed listing target of $0.007 — which represents a 25x ROI potential or more than 2,300% upside. In a market searching for the next wave of winners, those numbers are impossible to ignore. MAGACOIN FINANCE VS. LEGACY ALTCOINS Both XRP and Solana have proven themselves in past bull markets — XRP achieving legendary returns in 2017 and again in 2021 , while Solana’s meteoric rise brought it from obscurity to a top 10 coin in just months. But with those gains largely in the rearview, attention is shifting to emerging plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE , now considered a top altcoin to watch , offers a rare chance to enter before the open market does — something XRP and SOL holders can no longer access. More than 12,500 holders have already taken advantage of the early access, further strengthening the project’s community foundation. As one top trader noted in a recent forecast: “You don’t see this kind of momentum at this price point often. MAGACOIN FINANCE looks like it’s setting up for a 30x+ run if it follows through post-listing.” FINAL THOUGHTS: APRIL’S ALTCOIN STAR? 🔓 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! Forecasts can change quickly in crypto, but one thing is clear — MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum fast, and seasoned investors are taking notice. With Stage 7 now LIVE , a growing community, and strong analyst predictions , this project is positioning itself as one of the strongest next 100x altcoin contenders of 2025 . Whether you’re diversifying beyond XRP or SOL, or just seeking the next breakout token before it lists, MAGACOIN FINANCE deserves a spot on your radar this April.

Keeping a close eye on broader economic indicators and events is equally, if not more, crucial . This week is packed with potentially market-moving announcements and speeches from key figures at the Federal Reserve and other central banks. For crypto investors, understanding these economic events is paramount to anticipate market shifts and make informed decisions. Let’s dive into the key events happening this week that could ripple through the crypto sphere. Navigating the Week’s Economic Calendar: Why it Matters for Crypto Why should crypto enthusiasts care about traditional economic events ? The answer is simple: correlation and market sentiment. While cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 and are often perceived as detached from traditional finance, they are increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors. Interest rate decisions, inflation data, and statements from central bankers can significantly impact investor risk appetite, which in turn affects the flow of capital into and out of crypto assets. This week’s calendar is particularly dense with events that could provide clues about the future direction of monetary policy and economic health, both of which are vital for cryptocurrency market trends. Here’s a breakdown of the key economic events scheduled this week, with timings in UTC to keep you synchronized: Monday, April 14: FOMC Voices Begin to Speak The week kicks off with a trio of speeches from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. These speeches are closely watched as they can offer insights into the Fed’s thinking on the current economic situation and potential future policy moves. 16:00 UTC: FOMC Member Barkin Speaks – Thomas Barkin, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, will be sharing his perspectives. Market participants will be keen to analyze his remarks for any hints about the Fed’s stance on inflation and interest rates. 22:00 UTC: FOMC Member Harker Speaks – Patrick Harker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, follows later in the day. His views, particularly on regional economic conditions and labor markets, can provide a broader understanding of the US economic landscape. 23:40 UTC: FOMC Member Bostic Speaks – Raphael Bostic, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, concludes Monday’s FOMC speaker lineup. Bostic’s commentary is often scrutinized for his perspectives on economic inequality and inclusive growth, alongside traditional monetary policy views. Tuesday, April 15: More Fed Insights The FOMC speaker circuit continues into Tuesday, offering further opportunities to gauge the Fed’s current sentiment. 15:35 UTC: FOMC Member Barkin Speaks (Again) – Another appearance from Thomas Barkin might offer further clarity or elaboration on points he raised on Monday. Consistent messaging or shifts in tone will be closely monitored. 23:10 UTC: Fed Governor Lisa Cook Speaks – Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook’s speech is particularly noteworthy. As a Governor, her views carry significant weight in shaping Fed policy. Her insights on inflation, employment, and financial stability will be keenly analyzed by the markets. Wednesday, April 16: Powell’s Address – Will it Set the Tone? Wednesday brings the most anticipated event of the week – a speech from the top central banker himself. 17:15 UTC: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Speaks – Jerome Powell’s speech is the headline event. His words have the power to move markets significantly. Traders and investors across all asset classes, including cryptocurrency, will be hanging on every word for signals about the Fed’s future policy path, particularly regarding interest rates and inflation control. Will he maintain a hawkish stance, hinting at further rate hikes, or will he lean dovish, suggesting a pause or even potential rate cuts in the future? The market’s reaction will be immediate and potentially volatile. Thursday, April 17: Interest Rates and Jobless Data in Focus Thursday is a crucial day with two major interest rate decisions and key employment data releases. 01:00 UTC: South Korea Interest Rate Decision (Apr.) – While geographically distant, South Korea’s interest rate decision can offer insights into global economic trends and central bank thinking. Emerging market rate decisions can sometimes foreshadow broader global monetary policy shifts. 12:30 UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims – U.S. jobless claims are a timely indicator of the health of the labor market. Higher-than-expected claims could signal a slowing economy, potentially leading to a more dovish stance from the Fed, which could be positive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, lower claims could reinforce the Fed’s hawkish stance. 13:15 UTC: EU ECB Interest Rate Decision (Apr.) – The European Central Bank’s (ECB) interest rate decision is a major event for global markets. The Eurozone’s economic health and the ECB’s monetary policy significantly impact global financial conditions. Any surprises in the ECB’s decision or forward guidance can trigger volatility across markets, including crypto. 15:45 UTC: Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr Speaks – Michael Barr, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision, will be speaking later in the day. His remarks are particularly relevant for the financial sector, and any comments on financial stability and regulation could indirectly impact cryptocurrency markets, especially concerning regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. Friday, April 18: Good Friday – A Quieter Day? Friday marks Good Friday in the U.S., a public holiday. This typically means reduced trading volumes in traditional markets, but cryptocurrency markets remain open 24/7. However, the holiday in traditional finance centers could still lead to lower liquidity and potentially increased volatility in crypto markets due to thinner order books. Holiday U.S. Good Friday – U.S. markets are closed. Be mindful of potentially lower liquidity in crypto markets. 15:00 UTC: FOMC Member Daly Speaks – Even on a holiday, FOMC members continue to engage. Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is scheduled to speak. Her perspectives on the labor market and inflation, particularly from a West Coast perspective, can add further nuance to the overall Fed outlook. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how can crypto investors use this information to their advantage? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on financial news outlets for real-time updates and analysis of these economic events . Manage Risk: Be prepared for potential market volatility around these announcements, especially Powell’s speech and the interest rate decisions. Consider adjusting your trading positions and risk management strategies accordingly. Listen for Nuances: Pay attention to the tone and language used by FOMC members. Are they sounding more hawkish or dovish? Look for keywords and phrases that might indicate future policy shifts. Consider Global Impact: Remember that these events have global repercussions. The US Fed and ECB’s actions influence global financial conditions, which in turn affect cryptocurrency markets worldwide. Conclusion: Navigating Economic Winds in the Crypto Seas This week presents a wealth of economic events that could significantly influence the cryptocurrency market. From FOMC member speeches to crucial interest rate decisions and jobless claims data, staying informed and understanding the potential impact of these events is vital for navigating the crypto seas. Jerome Powell’s speech on Wednesday stands out as a potentially market-moving event. By closely monitoring these developments and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can better position yourself to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

In Taiwan, shares in Foxconn, Apple’s largest iPhone assembler, rose about 4% during Monday morning trading. Contract laptop maker Quanta showed an even stronger jump, up 7%. Inventec, which produces artificial intelligence servers and other electronics, also rose by 4%. Their gains helped lift the broad index by around 1%. China-based Apple suppliers Goertek and Lens Tech experienced increases of 3% and 1.1%, respectively. Further north in South Korea, Samsung Electronics, which supplies Apple and holds the second spot in the U.S. smartphone market, advanced by 2%. Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei added 1.81%, although it has swung between sharp ups and downs in recent days due to changing headlines about the tariff situation. Japan’s Nikkei 225. Source: Google Finance The weekend development signaled a temporary easing of the pressure created by steep tariffs that threatened to drive up the prices of many electronic products. Reports also emerged that Apple chartered cargo flights last week to move 600 tons of iPhones—estimated to be as many as 1.5 million units—from India to the United States. This effort appeared to be a move to reduce any potential shortages or sudden price spikes in the event that the tariff situation deteriorated. Trump clarified that electronics and semiconductors will be excluded from tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump took to social media on Sunday to clarify that the electronics products excluded from the reciprocal tariffs “are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’” He added they would be reviewed, along with semiconductors, in a national security trade investigation on that sector. Although some investors found hope in the president’s comments, others remained cautious, particularly after Trump said aboard Air Force One that a tariff rate on imported semiconductors would be announced over the next week. He did note there could be flexibility for some companies, but the market reaction was mixed, reflecting uncertainty over how the final measures would play out. Amid that uncertainty, certain chipmakers went against the broader positive trend. TSMC, the largest contract chipmaker worldwide, dipped into negative territory despite an initial jump at the start of the day. TSMC stock price. Source: Google Finance Memory chip supplier SK Hynix in South Korea declined by 0.2%. Alex Huang, vice president of Mega International Investment Services, said the early Monday momentum might be premature. He pointed out that the specifics of Trump’s exemption plan were not yet fully disclosed, making it difficult for markets to price in the possible impact. He suggested it would be unlikely for semiconductors to receive a broad exemption from tariffs since any comprehensive relief would remove a critical bargaining chip in discussions with Washington. TSMC is scheduled to announce its first-quarter earnings on Thursday. It could offer more clues about how the tariff environment is affecting chip orders and production plans. In Europe, the euro edged up to $1.1384, just below the three-year high of $1.1474. Traders were keeping a close watch on the European Central Bank’s meeting slated for Thursday. Market participants consider it a certainty that the ECB will cut rates by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%. Also on tap is the Bank of Canada’s rate decision this week, where there is around a one-in-three chance of a cut from 2.75%.

The price of Mantra ( OM ) plunged over 90% on Apr. 13, falling from around $6.30 to below $0.50 within hours. In an Apr. 14 post on X, Mullin said the sharp drop in OM’s price was caused by forced liquidations triggered by centralized exchanges. He explained that these actions were taken suddenly and during low-liquidity hours on Sunday evening UTC, which may have amplified the market impact. Mullin clarified that the sell-off was not due to any token sales by the Mantra team or its investors, noting that OM tokens remain locked according to the project’s vesting schedule. He also reaffirmed the project’s long-term commitment and called for continued support from the community.

OM’s trading volume has jumped more than 2,500% in the last 24 hours, reaching $1.9 billion, as per crypto.news price tracker . Launched as a regulatory-compliant real world asset-focused layer-1, Mantra has made headlines in recent months for its partnerships and regulatory progress. In January, it signed a $1 billion deal with real estate giant DAMAC to tokenize assets. Mantra was also greenlighted to operate lawfully in the UAE after being granted a virtual asset service provider license by Dubai’s VARA in February. Even so, the crash has renewed earlier criticism of the project. Wu Blockchain, a popular X news channel, reposted a 2021 warning about Mantra’s founding team, linking them to a gambling website and previous false investment claims. Some traders have expressed concerns about transparency and exchange processes, comparing the crash to past collapses like that of Terra.

In an Apr. 13 post , CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson noted that the gap between Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) futures price and its spot price on Binance is starting to shrink. This gap, known as the perpetual-spot gap, shows the difference between what traders are paying in futures contracts versus the actual price of Bitcoin. Given that the gap is currently negative, futures market participants may be exercising caution or taking profits following Bitcoin’s previous surge to almost $90,000. However, the narrowing gap may indicate that selling pressure is easing. In the past, Bitcoin’s price often experienced a significant increase when this gap turned positive. This occurred in 2020 and early in 2024. Despite Bitcoin falling over 22% from its all-time high of $108,786 in January, on-chain accumulation signals remain strong. According to an Apr. 11 post on X by Glassnode, around 40,000 BTC has been purchased near the $79,000 level, while roughly 51,000 BTC was accumulated at around $82,080. If prices decline once more, these levels might serve as support. Looking at Cost Basis Distribution, #Bitcoin has built notable support at $79K, with ~40K $BTC accumulated there. It has also worked through the $82.08K cluster (~51K $BTC ). If this level holds, the next to test is $83.5K, with 48.5K $BTC positioned: https://t.co/YqeQ2uWJlV pic.twitter.com/9aE3UdsT2O — glassnode (@glassnode) April 11, 2025 You might also like: If the Fed prints more money, what’s at stake for Bitcoin?

On April 13, Mantra ( OM ) price dropped from $6.30 to below $0.50 , rapidly shedding over 90% of its $6 billion market cap. “We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders,” Mantra co-founder John Mullin wrote in an April 13 statement on X. “The timing and depth of the crash suggest that a very sudden closure of account positions was initiated without sufficient warning or notice,” he added. Source: John Mullin “That this happened during low-liquidity hours on a Sunday evening UTC, early morning Asia time, points to a degree of negligence at best, or possibly intentional market positioning taken by centralized exchanges.” Mullin told an X user they believe one exchange “in particular” was to blame but said they were still “figuring out the details.” He told others that the centralized exchange in question wasn’t Binance. Mantra has an upcoming community connect on X, where Mullin says the team would share more information. Source: John Mullin Some traders allege the token collapse was a rug pull , while others are speculating the Mantra team had used their tokens as collateral to take out a massive loan from a centralized exchange and the team fell prey to a loan risk parameter change, then a margin call. Mullin denied these theories in follow-up X posts, saying , “The team did not have a loan outstanding” and haven't orchestrated a rug pull. “Tokens remain locked and subject to the published vesting periods. OM’s tokenomics remain intact, as shared last week in our latest token report. Our token wallet addresses are online and visible,” Mullin said. Source: John Mullin The price of OM staged a minor recovery in the aftermath of the price collapse, briefly returning above $1, but it is back down and currently trading around $0.7894, according to CoinGecko. The token hit an all-time high of just under $9 on Feb. 23 and is now down over 91% from that figure. Source: Star Xu Millions of Mantra tokens moved in the week prior to collapse Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain said in an April 14 post to X that some OM whales moved 14.27 million tokens to the crypto exchange OKX three days before the crash. In March, the same whales picked up 84.15 million OM for $564.7 million. “Now, after a brutal 90% drop, their remaining 69.08 million OM is worth just $62.2 million, putting their total estimated loss at a staggering $406.3 million,” Spot On Chain said. “However, they may have hedged the position elsewhere, and it’s possible they contributed to the sharp drop.” Source: Spot On Chain At the same time, blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain said that since April 7, at least 17 wallets deposited 43.6 million OM into crypto exchanges, representing 4.5% of the circulating supply.

Investors and traders are keenly watching the token unlock schedule, and this week is packed with significant events! A massive $330 million worth of TRUMP tokens is leading the charge, alongside unlocks for other notable projects like STRK, ARB, and ZKJ. Understanding these crypto unlock events is crucial for navigating the market effectively. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for your portfolio. What are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Before we delve into this week’s specific unlocks, let’s quickly recap what token unlocks are and why they’re such a hot topic in the crypto space. When new cryptocurrency projects launch, they often allocate a portion of their total token supply to the team, advisors, investors, and for ecosystem development. To prevent market dumps and ensure gradual decentralization, these tokens are usually locked up for a certain period, following a vesting schedule. A token unlock event is when these previously locked tokens become available and are released into circulation. Why does this matter? Increased token supply can potentially lead to increased selling pressure, which can impact the token’s price. However, unlocks can also be viewed positively as they represent a distribution of tokens to stakeholders who are often incentivized to contribute to the project’s long-term success. The market reaction to a crypto unlock can vary depending on factors like the project’s fundamentals, market sentiment, and the size of the unlock relative to the circulating supply. Key Token Unlocks This Week: A Detailed Schedule According to data from DropsTab, this week’s token unlock schedule is quite busy. Here’s a breakdown of the major unlocks you need to be aware of: Token Amount Unlocked Value (USD) Circulating Supply (%) Unlock Time (UTC) WLD 5.02 million $3.72 million 0.40% April 15, 00:00 STRK 128.05 million $16.17 million 4.41% April 15, 12:00 ARB 93.65 million $28.18 million 2.03% April 16, 00:00 VANA 1.24 million $6.57 million 4.14% April 16, 00:00 PRCL 161.70 million $9.59 million 58.88% April 16, 00:00 DBR 1.23 billion $27.83 million 68.38% April 17, 00:00 APE 15.38 million $6.52 million 2.04% April 17, 06:00 UXLINK 33.33 million $16.24 million 9.86% April 18, 00:00 IMX 27.31 million $11.28 million 1.52% April 18, 05:00 TRUMP 40.00 million $330.80 million 20.00% April 18, 06:00 ZKJ 15.50 million $35.17 million 25.66% April 19, 00:00 XDAO 6.44 million $332.76 million 25.29% April 20, 00:00 Data Source: DropsTab TRUMP Token Unlock: A Mammoth Event to Watch Undoubtedly, the most significant token unlock this week is for TRUMP. A staggering 40 million TRUMP tokens, valued at approximately $330.80 million, are set to be released on April 18th. This represents a substantial 20% of the current circulating supply! Such a large unlock can create considerable market volatility. Traders and investors will be closely monitoring the price action around this event. Will the market absorb this influx of tokens, or will we see a price dip? STRK and ARB Unlock: Layer-2 Tokens in Focus Alongside TRUMP, we have notable unlocks for layer-2 scaling solutions, STRK and ARB. STRK will see 128.05 million tokens unlocked (4.41% of circulating supply) on April 15th, while ARB will unlock 93.65 million tokens (2.03% of circulating supply) on April 16th. These unlocks, although smaller in dollar value compared to TRUMP, are still significant. STRK unlock and ARB unlock events are important for those invested in the layer-2 ecosystem. Keep an eye on how these unlocks impact the price and network activity of these tokens. Other Notable Token Unlocks: ZKJ, XDAO, and More While TRUMP, STRK, and ARB grab headlines, several other tokens have substantial unlocks scheduled this week. ZKJ, for instance, will unlock 15.50 million tokens (25.66% of circulating supply) on April 19th. XDAO’s unlock of 6.44 million tokens on April 20th is also noteworthy due to its high dollar value. Projects like PRCL and DBR are unlocking a very large percentage of their circulating supply, 58.88% and 68.38% respectively. These larger percentage unlocks, even with lower dollar values, can also lead to price fluctuations, especially for tokens with lower liquidity. Navigating Token Unlock Events: What Should You Do? So, how should you approach these crypto unlock events as an investor or trader? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of the token unlock schedules using resources like DropsTab and other crypto data providers. Do Your Research: Understand the tokenomics of the projects undergoing unlocks. Consider the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked and the project’s overall health. Manage Risk: Be prepared for potential price volatility around unlock dates. Consider adjusting your trading strategies or portfolio allocations accordingly. Look for Opportunities: Unlock events can sometimes create buying opportunities if the market overreacts negatively. Conversely, if the unlock is perceived positively and the project is strong, it could signal further growth potential. Conclusion: A Week of Critical Token Unlock Events This week is shaping up to be a crucial period for the crypto market, primarily due to the sheer volume and value of token unlocks scheduled. The $330 million TRUMP token unlock is the headline event, but unlocks for STRK, ARB, ZKJ, and others should not be overlooked. By staying informed, doing your research, and managing risk, you can navigate these events effectively and potentially capitalize on the opportunities they present. Keep a close watch on market movements and be ready to adapt your strategies as needed.

43317512,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149093,1744611542,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive Growth: Metaplanet Amasses 319 More Bitcoin in Strategic Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-adds-bitcoin-holdings/,"In a bold move signaling continued institutional interest in Bitcoin, Metaplanet, a publicly traded company based in Japan, has announced another significant purchase of Bitcoin. The company revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that it has acquired an additional 319 BTC. This latest acquisition dramatically increases Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin treasury to an impressive 4,525 BTC. For those closely watching corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies, this news is a powerful indicator of Bitcoin’s enduring appeal as a strategic asset. Why is Metaplanet Investing Heavily in Bitcoin? Metaplanet’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin investment raises an important question: What’s driving this Japanese company’s aggressive accumulation strategy? To understand this, we need to delve deeper into Metaplanet’s rationale and the broader context of Bitcoin adoption in Japan and globally. Here are some potential reasons behind Metaplanet’s strategic Bitcoin accumulation: Diversification and Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a valuable asset for portfolio diversification, offering a hedge against traditional market volatility and inflation. In an era of economic uncertainty, companies are looking for alternative stores of value, and Bitcoin fits the bill. Long-Term Value Proposition: Metaplanet likely views Bitcoin as a long-term investment with significant growth potential. Despite market fluctuations, the fundamental principles of Bitcoin – decentralization, scarcity, and increasing adoption – remain strong. Strategic Corporate Treasury Management: Holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet can be a strategic move for companies seeking to optimize their treasury management. In a low-yield environment, Bitcoin offers the potential for higher returns compared to traditional cash reserves. First-Mover Advantage in Japan: As a publicly listed Japanese company, Metaplanet’s foray into Bitcoin could position it as a leader in the emerging digital asset space within Japan. This first-mover advantage can attract investors and enhance the company’s brand image. Metaplanet’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: A Closer Look Let’s break down the numbers and understand the scale of Metaplanet’s BTC holdings : Metric Value Latest Bitcoin Purchase 319 BTC Total Bitcoin Holdings 4,525 BTC Company Status Publicly Listed (Japan) This table highlights the substantial nature of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin investment. Adding 319 BTC is not a trivial amount; it represents a significant commitment and belief in Bitcoin’s future. The fact that Metaplanet is a publicly listed company in Japan further underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional financial ecosystems. The Broader Picture: Institutional Bitcoin Investment is on the Rise Metaplanet’s actions are not isolated. They are part of a larger trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin investment globally. Major corporations, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds are starting to allocate portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This trend is fueled by several factors: Maturing Market: The Bitcoin market has matured significantly over the past decade. Improved infrastructure, regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions, and the emergence of institutional-grade custody solutions have made it easier and safer for institutions to invest in Bitcoin. Growing Acceptance: Bitcoin is moving from the fringes to the mainstream. Increased media coverage, educational resources, and endorsements from prominent figures in finance and technology are contributing to its growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): As Bitcoin’s price appreciates and institutional adoption accelerates, there’s a growing fear of missing out among traditional investors. Companies don’t want to be left behind as Bitcoin potentially becomes a more integral part of the global financial system. What Does Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Buy Mean for the Market? Metaplanet’s latest Bitcoin news and acquisition have several implications for the cryptocurrency market: Positive Sentiment Boost: Significant purchases like this tend to inject positive sentiment into the market. It reinforces the narrative of institutional adoption and can encourage further investment. Demand Pressure: Large Bitcoin purchases reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially putting upward pressure on the price, especially if this trend of institutional accumulation continues. Validation for Bitcoin Strategy: Metaplanet’s continued investment serves as validation for other companies considering a Bitcoin treasury strategy. It demonstrates a real-world example of a publicly listed company embracing Bitcoin. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Considerations While the benefits of Metaplanet Bitcoin investment and institutional adoption are clear, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Companies investing in Bitcoin must be prepared for potential short-term price swings and have a long-term investment horizon. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies need to navigate regulatory uncertainties and ensure compliance in their respective jurisdictions. Security and Custody: Securing and safely custodying large amounts of Bitcoin is paramount. Companies must employ robust security measures and consider using institutional-grade custody solutions. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting standards for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still developing. Companies need to address the complexities of accounting and financial reporting for their Bitcoin holdings. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from Metaplanet? Metaplanet’s strategic move offers valuable insights for both individual investors and other companies considering Bitcoin: Long-Term Perspective: Metaplanet’s actions underscore the importance of a long-term perspective when it comes to Bitcoin investment. Focus on the fundamental value proposition and potential for future growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. Diversification Benefits: Consider Bitcoin as a diversification tool within a broader investment portfolio. Its unique characteristics can help mitigate risk and enhance returns over the long run. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in the cryptocurrency space, including regulatory changes, institutional adoption trends, and technological advancements. Bitcoin news and analysis are crucial for making informed decisions. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Bet Signals a Powerful Trend Metaplanet’s latest acquisition of 319 BTC is more than just a news headline; it’s a significant event that underscores the growing institutional embrace of Bitcoin. As Japan Bitcoin adoption gains momentum and companies like Metaplanet lead the charge, the future of Bitcoin as a mainstream asset class looks increasingly bright. This strategic accumulation highlights the explosive growth potential and the enduring appeal of Bitcoin in the evolving global financial landscape. Metaplanet’s bold move serves as a compelling example of how forward-thinking companies are positioning themselves for the digital future, with Bitcoin playing a central role.

Dù bạn chỉ mới bắt đầu với phân tích kỹ thuật hay là một trader lão luyện đang mài lợi thế cạnh tranh, hiểu đường trung bình động là một kỹ năng nền tảng có thể nâng cấp các quyết định giao dịch của bạn. Hãy bắt đầu với những điều cơ bản: SMA vs EMA. Đường Trung Bình Động là Gì? Chart giá có thể rối như tơ vò. Mỗi giây, giá nhảy nhót lên xuống, tạo ra một cơn lốc dữ liệu có thể nuốt chửng ngay cả những trader dày dạn kinh nghiệm. Đường trung bình động giúp bạn lùi lại khỏi sự hỗn loạn và bắt được xu hướng thực. Chúng làm mượt dữ liệu giá trong một khoảng thời gian cụ thể, giúp bạn dễ dàng xác định xem thị trường đang có xu hướng tăng, giảm hay chỉ đơn giản là đi ngang. Về bản chất, đường trung bình động được dùng để: Xác định hướng đi của thị trường Highlight các vùng vào/ra lệnh tiềm năng Xác nhận tín hiệu từ các chỉ báo khác Tránh giao dịch theo cảm xúc dựa trên biến động ngắn hạn Có hai loại đường trung bình động chính mà bạn sẽ thấy trên bất kỳ nền tảng giao dịch nào: Đường Trung Bình Động Giản Đơn (SMA) và Đường Trung Bình Động Luỹ Thừa (EMA). Hãy cùng mổ xẻ chúng. Đường Trung Bình Động Giản Đơn (SMA): Ống Kính Bình Tĩnh, Dài Hạn Trên Bitfinex, nó hiện lên là: Đường Trung Bình Động (MA) SMA lấy giá đóng cửa trong một số giai đoạn nhất định (ví dụ: 10, 50 hoặc 200), cộng chúng lại và chia cho số đó. Mọi mức giá đều có trọng lượng như nhau. SMA không phản ứng với mọi rung lắc, chỉ cho bạn hướng đi trung bình theo thời gian. Ví dụ: SMA 50 ngày cộng dồn giá đóng cửa của 50 ngày qua và chia cho 50. Các Trường Hợp Phổ Biến Được Sử Dụng: Swing trader thường dùng SMA 50 ngày và 200 ngày để đánh giá động lượng dài hạn. Trend follower theo dõi giá cắt lên hoặc xuống SMA để báo hiệu khả năng đảo chiều. Ưu điểm: Mượt mà và ổn định Tuyệt vời để lọc bỏ nhiễu ngắn hạn Xác nhận xu hướng dài hạn mạnh mẽ Nhược điểm: Phản ứng chậm với các thay đổi giá đột ngột Có thể bỏ lỡ các tín hiệu sớm trong các thị trường biến động nhanh Đường Trung Bình Động Luỹ Thừa (EMA): Thần Theo Dõi Xu Hướng Nhanh Nhạy Đường Trung Bình Động Luỹ Thừa cũng tính giá trung bình, nhưng nó ưu ái giá gần đây hơn , khiến nó nhạy hơn với các biến động thị trường hiện tại. Ví dụ: EMA 20 ngày vẫn bao gồm giá của 20 ngày qua, nhưng dữ liệu hôm nay ảnh hưởng đến nó nhiều hơn dữ liệu từ hai tuần trước. EMA được dân day trader và scalper ưa chuộng, những người cần phản ứng nhanh với sự thay đổi động lượng. Các Trường Hợp Sử Dụng Phổ Biến: Trader ngắn hạn dựa vào EMA 9 ngày, 12 ngày hoặc 20 ngày để bắt các xu hướng di chuyển nhanh. EMA thường được dùng trong các chiến lược giao cắt , trong đó EMA ngắn hạn cắt EMA dài hạn có thể báo hiệu tín hiệu vào hoặc ra lệnh. Ưu điểm: Phản ứng nhanh hơn với hành động giá gần đây Hữu ích để phát hiện sớm các đảo chiều xu hướng Được ưa chuộng trong môi trường giao dịch nhịp độ nhanh Nhược điểm: Có thể tạo ra nhiều tín hiệu sai hơn trong các thị trường chập chờn Có thể quá phản ứng trong các thị trường đi ngang SMA vs EMA – Nên Dùng Cái Nào? Không có câu trả lời một kích thước vừa vặn tất cả. Lựa chọn tốt nhất phụ thuộc vào phong cách giao dịch, khung thời gian và mục tiêu của bạn. Hầu hết các trader có kinh nghiệm đều dùng cả hai .

According to SoSoValue data , the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $713.3 million pulled out, over 300% more than the $172.7 million outflows from the week before. Every single day from April 7 to 11 saw money being pulled, continuing a streak that began on April 3. The biggest drop came on Tuesday, with $326.27 million in outflows, while Friday ended the week with just over $1 million leaving. BlackRock’s IBIT took the hardest hit with $342.6 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC with $160.9 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $74.6 million per Faside data . Other ETFs, like BITB, BTCO, ARKB, EZBC, BTCW, and HODL, also saw outflows ranging from about $11 million to $38 million. The only ETF to buck the bearish trend was Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin Trust, which recorded $2.4 million in net inflows, while Valkyrie’s BRRR saw no flows during the week. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs didn’t fare much better than their Bitcoin counterparts, with outflows jumping 65% to $82.47 million last week. It’s now the seventh straight week of Ethereum ETF withdrawals, adding up to more than $877 million in total. You might also like: Bitcoin nears breakout confirmation, enters new technical uptrend: analysts The main driver behind all this seems to be the uncertainty around Trump’s new tariff plans. He originally announced a 10% flat tariff on all imports starting in April, with even higher rates for major trading partners. Markets cooled off a bit on April 9, when he paused the tariff hikes for 75 allied countries. That relief didn’t last long . The U.S. then raised some tariffs on Chinese goods to as high as 145%, accusing China of unfair trade. In response, China hit back with tariffs of up to 125% on U.S. goods and stopped exporting rare-earth minerals. This ramped up fears of a full-blown trade war and made investors nervous about riskier assets like Bitcoin. At the time of writing, the overall crypto market was down around 2.1% in the past day. Despite this, Bitcoin has bounced from last week’s low of $74,773 to nearly $84,500 by Monday, April 14. According to some analysts , Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on the verge of breaking out of its long downtrend. They note that the price is just hours away from making the first key move that could kick off a new uptrend phase.

Does this mean Ethereum price has bottomed? Here are three reason why ETH could drop lower. 3 Reasons Why Ethereum Price Could Continue its Descent Ethereum price has tagged the 2018 ATH of $1,385, which has many believing that this could be the bottom. However, there are three critical reasons why a further crash could be possible for ETH. Reason 1: Weekly Price Chart Shows Key Resistance Level The 1-week TradingView chart shows that Ethereum price is revisiting $1,630, which is the highest volume traded level since February 2021. Since the recent crash pushed ETH below it, it is upon bulls to flip this hurdle into a support floor. As long as this resistance level stands, there is a good chance ETH’s value will continue to depreciate. Moreover, the intermediate demand zone at $1,280 is the next Ethereum price support floor that could absorb selling pressure. After this area from, $1,280 to $1,160, was fromed in December 2022, the price of ETH shot up more than 40% in the next three to four weeks without any pullbacks. Hence, a revisit of this zone is also likely. The absolute key support or demand zone extends from $890 to $715, which is a weekly buy-side imbalance that led to near 50% weekly candlestick. ETH/USDT 1-week chart Reason 2: RSI Yet to be Oversold On the weekly chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not yet hit oversold territory. All the major rallies for Ethereum price have begun after RSI tagged an oversold level. Hence, the chances of a further drop are likely for ETH, potentially into the $1,280 to $1,160 and $890 to $715 zones. ETH 1-week RSI Reason 3: Uncertain Macroeconomic Conditions From a macroeconomic perspective, the Trump and Xi trade war between the US & China has caused additional volatility in the stock and crypto markets. This has left Ethereum price prediction bearish due to fears of recession. Additionally, this week has two major events: Fed Chair Powell’s speech and the March inflation announcement. The outcome of both critical news events could induce additional volatility that could kickstart a messy collapse. So, overall, the outlook for Ethereum price remains neutral-to-bearish. However investors need to be more cautious ahead of the upcoming events amid Trump-Xi trade war.

During the same period, imports declined 4.3% to $211.3 billion, leaving a trade surplus of $102.6 billion. Businesses rushed to ship goods before higher U.S. tariffs took effect. The jump in exports reflects efforts by Chinese companies to counter a series of tariff hikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump initially imposed a 10% increase in tariffs on imports from China after taking office. He later raised that figure to 20% and has now pushed it to 145% on most Chinese exports bound for the U.S. That situation has driven Chinese exporters to accelerate shipments to American buyers, hoping to evade the latest rises in import duties. China’s trade balance has been in the spotlight for some time. In 2024, the country’s trade surplus soared to a record $992.2 billion, with exports up 5.4%. Customs Administration data shows China’s trade surplus with the United States stood at $27.6 billion in March, boosted by a 4.5% rise in exports to that market. Over the first quarter, the surplus reached $76.6 billion, despite only a 2.3% increase in exports for the first two months of the year. “Export growth accelerated in March, as manufacturers rushed to ship goods to the U.S. ahead of ‘Liberation Day,’” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, in a note to clients. “But shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,” he added. “We think it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.” Observers also point to domestic factors undermining import growth, highlighted by the 4.3% drop in overall imports. While Chinese imports of crude oil rose in March, imports of soybeans, coal, iron ore, and unwrought copper declined. Imports from the United States may be feeling the effects of the tariff dispute, with total soybean imports diving 36.8% year-on-year in March. China wants to fight “to the end” Beijing has vowed to keep fighting U.S. tariffs “to the end.” It wants to protect the economy from “external shocks.” On Friday, President Xi Jinping reportedly told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Beijing that China and the European Union should work together to oppose “unilateral acts of bullying,” according to the Xinhua news agency. The CSI300 Index modestly increased by 0.3% on Monday. Analysts say mixed signals from President Trump about possible exemptions on selected consumer electronics contributed to the slight uptick. Economists have revised their outlook for China’s full-year growth. Goldman Sachs reduced its 2025 GDP forecast to 4% from 4.5%. On the other hand, Citi reduced its projection from 4.7% to 4.2%. These revised numbers fall short of the government’s official target of “around 5%.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Since the market has been low over the past few months, investors unsurprisingly took this as an opportunity to get out at a somewhat higher price. This has led to more negative networks over the last few days, adding even more red to the month of April that has been dominated by outflows. XRP’s April Outflows Cross $300 Million According to data from Coinglass, XRP has been struggling with negative net flows for the better part of April, recording more red days than green. Even the green days have been quite muted and have fallen short of the volumes recorded on the red days. With only 13 days gone out the month so far, there has already been more than $300 million in outflows recorded for the month already. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out: Chart Pattern Targets $96,200 To $102,100 As Next Big Test Zone So far, only four out of the 13 days have ended with positive net flows, coming out to $56.08 million in inflows for the month. In contrast, the other nine days have been dominated by outflows, coming out to $311 million by Sunday. This consistent outflow suggests that sellers are still dominating the market, which explains why the XRP price has continued to remain low throughout this time. Additionally, if this negative net flow trend continues, then the XRP price could suffer further crashes from here. However, in comparison to the last three months, the month of April seems to be recording a slow down when it comes to outflows. For example, months of January and March recorded $150 million outflow days, whereas the highest so far in April has been $90 million, which occurred on April 6. One More Dip Coming? While there has been a return of positive sentiment among XRP investors, bearish expectations still abound, although mainly for the short-term. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, a known XRP bull, has pointed out that the altcoin is likely to see another dip in price before a recovery. Nevertheless, the expectations for the long-term are still extremely bullish. Related Reading: Expert Analyst Warns Bitcoin/VIX Is Not Bullish: Bear Market Signals The crypto analyst highlights the possibility for the XRP price to dip to $1.4, but explains that he continues to hold his position.

Amidst this uncertainty, the American businessman advocates investing in Bitcoin, gold, and silver as a shield against the economic disaster. Robert Kiyosaki Advocates Buying Bitcoin, Here’s Why In his latest X post, Robert Kiyosaki warned against the impending economic recession, highlighting the US Dollar’s vulnerable position. Reiterating his previous predictions of the “biggest stock and bond market crash in history,” he cited, “That giant crash has arrived.” To safeguard against the looming economic downturn, Robert Kiyosaki recommends allocating assets to Bitcoin, gold, and silver as a protective measure. His words read, “Those who take action and acquire real gold, silver, and Bitcoin….MAY come out of this premeditated disaster… the new rich and the new leaders of the world.” Is the US Dollar Crash Imminent? According to Robert Kiyosaki, the biggest economic crash has begun. The recent fall in the stock and bond markets following US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement validates his statement. What Happened to the Stock Market? During the first week of April, the stock market saw its highest fall since 2020, casting shadows over the trajectory of Bitcoin. Highlighting Bitcoin’s strong correlation with the stock market, experts predicted Bitcoin’s short-term correction. Though Bitcoin stood resilient to the broader negative trends on the day, BTC plummeted to a four-month low of $74k the next day. However, the downturn was brief, and Bitcoin’s price rebounded sharply the next day. This sudden resurgence of Bitcoin also bolsters Robert Kiyosaki’s bullish stance on Bitcoin. Adding more insights into his analysis, Robert Kiyosaki posited that the US Dollar’s value is under threat. He wrote on his X thread, “The corrupt and crooked US dollar is being wiped out.” Moreover, traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds are losing wealth due to the global banking system’s manipulation. He specifically points to central banks, including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements, as key players in this dynamic. Bitcoin Recovers, What’s Next? Currently, Bitcoin is on a positive track, recovering from the recent lows. As of press time, BTC is trading at $84,402, marking a notable 12% surge over the past week and a 0.54% uptick over the past month. The 24-hour trading volume has also seen a surge of 6%, currently at $31.17 billion. Driven by this positive sentiment, experts believe that BTC could retain its all-time high of $108k in the near future. However, as per CoinGape’s Bitcoin price prediction , the crypto’s highest point in 2025 is 84,590.98 The post Dollar Crash: Here’s Why Robert Kiyosaki Believes Bitcoin Is the Best Investment appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin VS US Dollar|Robert Kiyosaki,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|BTG,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-14 07:03:50

Pseudonymous analyst Jack tells his 268,200 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Bitcoin will not print a new all-time high this year after US President Donald Trump instigated a global trade war and created uncertain market conditions. The trader shares a chart suggesting that Bitcoin will create a durable bottom between $66,000 and $80,000 for the rest of the year before launching a new bull run in 2026. “Trump path clearly is contraction for now. But in that world of less globalization and trust, Bitcoin is a good asset to have, becoming a ball held under water. Similar to how 2013 saw a short bear [market].” Source: Jack/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that Bitcoin will rally to as high as $297,000 by November of 2026. Jack says that one catalyst that could send Bitcoin flying is the potential capital rotation from gold to BTC. According to the trader, gold investors will eventually come to know that Bitcoin is far better than the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. “What if Gold is trading like it is because everyone is scrambling to redeem paper for physical, of which there is a scarcity, vs. all the paper that has been issued, essentially catching up to its true value that has been diluted with paper Bitcoin doesn’t have this issue and will rally once people realize it is the better alternative for trade due to this very specific property.” “Paper” gold refers to financial instruments that allow investors to gain exposure to the precious metal without having to deal with the expenses or logistics of physically possessing the commodity. Jack appears to be highlighting Bitcoin’s portability as BTC holders can easily store, access and transfer their coins as long as they have the keys to their wallet.

Here Are the Details…",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/mantra-om-ceo-made-a-statement-about-the-fall-targeted-a-stock-exchange-here-are-the-details/,"The sharp declines in altcoins listed on Binance such as ACT, TST, MASK and LEVER in the past weeks created a bomb effect on the market. After these declines, the altcoin named Mantra (OM), which is also listed on Binance, fell by 87% today. While this decline has a shocking effect on investors, everyone is asking why. At this point, MANTRA CEO John Patrick Mullin said in a statement that no team member or partner has sold OM tokens. Speaking at the 2025 BTCON RWA Summit in Seoul and making statements from his X account, MANTRA CEO touched on the recent drop in the price of the OM token. Mullin did not say that the drop was an exploit or an attack, but rather that they determined that the drop was triggered by centralized exchanges recklessly instituting forced shutdowns of OM account holders. Claiming that a large investor on a centralized exchange experienced a forced liquidation of their OM token, Mullin told an X user that they believe one exchange in particular is to blame but are still trying to sort out the details. He told another user that the centralized exchange in question was not Binance. The CEO emphasized that neither he, nor his team, nor the Swiss team, nor advisors, nor key partners sold any OM tokens, saying: “The timing and depth of the collapse suggest that account positions were closed very abruptly without adequate warning or notification. The fact that this occurred during low liquidity hours, Sunday evening UTC Asian time, suggests at best negligence or deliberate market positioning by centralized exchanges.” “Mantra's Decline is a Huge Scandal!” While the suspicion on the stock exchanges continues, a comment also came from OKX, one of the leading stock exchanges. Accordingly, OKX founder and CEO Star Xu said that the MANTRA collapse was a 'big scandal' and promised to release related reports soon. He emphasized that all on-chain data regarding token unlocks and deposits are publicly available, and collateral and liquidation data from major exchanges can be reviewed. He added that OKX will make all relevant reports available. Binance stated in its statement that initial findings showed that the sudden drop in the price of the OM token was due to liquidations between exchanges. OM continues to trade at $0.77 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Mantra (OM) CEO Made a Statement About the Fall, Targeted a Stock Exchange!

Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Dalio said the economy is at a critical juncture. “I think that right now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession,” he said. “And I’m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn’t handled well.” The billionaire hedge fund manager responded to a question about whether Trump’s return to aggressive tariffs could push the US economy into a downturn. Dalio pointed to what he called a breakdown in the global monetary system and drew comparisons to the 1930s, a period marked by economic depression, rising nationalism and global instability. “I’m worried about something much worse than a recession. We have something that is much more profound.” – Ray Dalio pic.twitter.com/fV20L5lFs9 — Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) April 14, 2025 “We are having profound changes in our domestic order and we’re having profound changes in the world order. Such times are very much like the 1930s,” he said. Tariff Escalation and Debt Exposure Leave US Economy Vulnerable, Dalio Cautions He pointed to the convergence of high debt levels, geopolitical tensions and aggressive tariff use as destabilizing factors. In particular, Dalio has expressed concern over mounting US debt and the heavy exposure of foreign creditors, including China, to that debt. Trump recently raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, citing concerns over unfair trade practices and lack of market reciprocity. A universal 10% baseline tariff on most foreign goods, excluding those from USMCA partners, took effect on April 5. Just days later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on elevated tariffs for most countries, except China, rolling them back to the 10 per cent rate to allow time for trade negotiations. Dalio warned that the way these issues are handled could lead to outcomes far worse than a typical economic contraction. “How that’s handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession,” he said. Investor Veteran Sees Echoes of 2008, But Warns Today’s Crisis May Run Deeper He also cautioned that internal political conflict, weakening trust in money and rising international tensions could worsen the global fallout. “That is not the normal democracy as we know it,” he said, referring to political risks at home. In recent commentary, Dalio said a systemic economic breakdown is already underway. He pointed to current market volatility as a clear warning sign. Dalio, who correctly anticipated the 2008 financial crisis, has consistently advised investors to diversify away from debt-based assets. He has previously suggested gold and Bitcoin as potential hedges in a time of growing uncertainty and shifting global power dynamics.

Kang Doubles Down on Bitcoin After Trump’s ‘Great Time to Buy’ Post The move comes just days after Kang initiated his first $100 million long on April 9, following a post by U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social that declared, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.” Shortly after the post, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on its recently imposed global tariffs, reversing the negative market reaction from just hours earlier when the tariffs went into effect. In a separate post on April 12, Kang described the current environment as an ideal setup for Bitcoin, citing the Trump administration’s apparent shift in trade policy and what he referred to as a “Trump put”—a belief that Trump will prioritize market growth. According to Kang, these factors create “the perfect combination for BTC to reverse a multi-month downtrend.” Trump Put potentially in pic.twitter.com/hYkgbYTECr — Andrew Kang (@Rewkang) April 9, 2025 However, the situation has stirred controversy. On April 11, Senate Democrats urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate potential insider trading and market manipulation linked to Trump’s social media post, which they argue may have foreshadowed the tariff rollback. Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated amid the ongoing tariff uncertainty, swinging more than 2% in the past 24 hours. After dipping to $83,197, Bitcoin rebounded and was trading around $85,000 at press time, according to CoinGecko. In a follow-up post on April 13, Trump clarified there was no tariff “exception” but indicated that Chinese electronics would be reassigned to a new 20% tariff category—further fueling speculation and market volatility. Bitwise Sticks to $200K Bitcoin Price Target Despite mounting global trade tensions and economic uncertainty, institutional crypto investment firm Bitwise remains confident in its bold year-end Bitcoin price forecast. Last week, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan reiterated his December prediction that Bitcoin could hit $200,000 before the close of 2025. Hougan argued that recent developments in U.S. trade policy, particularly under former President Donald Trump’s renewed tariff push, could act as tailwinds for Bitcoin. According to Hougan, the administration’s apparent willingness to weaken the U.S. dollar—despite risking its role as the world’s reserve currency—could ultimately benefit decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Over the long run, Hougan envisions a move away from a single global reserve currency toward a diversified system. In this future, he sees Bitcoin and gold playing a more prominent role in international finance. “If the dollar’s stability comes into question, governments and corporations will have to look elsewhere,” he added.

Without active participation, even cutting-edge technology gathers dust. Ever heard of a blockchain that no one uses? It happens more often than you think. While the cryptocurrency space is full of innovation, but not every blockchain finds its tribe. Some are ghost towns with zero transactions, no developers and just a handful of holders stuck with worthless tokens . So, what makes a blockchain go quiet? And can they ever come back to life? Not all blockchains are built to last. Some blockchains, like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, have survived harsh market conditions, proving their resilience. Terra, however, plummeted from top-tier status to near oblivion in 2022 after its algorithmic stablecoin imploded. Even well-intentioned projects can fail. Without ongoing development, user incentives or a strong community, blockchains can become unusable. Once the validators stop running nodes, the network effectively turns into a broken time capsule. Blockchain adoption challenges in 2025 Blockchain adoption in 2025 still faces hurdles like unclear regulation, fragmented developer tooling, infrastructure gaps and the struggle to attract real users over bots despite some chains like Ethereum and Solana paving the way forward. Regulatory uncertainty is one of the biggest roadblocks. Governments are still figuring out how to regulate crypto, and inconsistent or overly restrictive rules can strangle innovation before it takes root. Beyond policy, a thriving developer ecosystem is non-negotiable. Jumping between languages such as Solidity, Rust and Move-based systems demands versatility, and not every blockchain can lure the talent it needs to grow. Then there’s the user problem — chains are overrun with bots chasing airdrops instead of real people engaging with the tech. Without authentic activity, a network’s bustling metrics are just smoke and mirrors. Infrastructure is another major hurdle. Strong blockchains need robust tooling, high-quality remote procedure call (RPC) services and a decentralized validator set that ensures uptime and security. In the context of blockchains, RPC services refer to a mechanism that allows applications (like wallets, DApps or developer tools) to communicate with a blockchain network remotely. On top of that, a thriving blockchain must rally a strong community of users, builders and commentators who genuinely believe in its long-term success. Handling fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, credibly is another test, especially when negative narratives arise; how a blockchain ecosystem responds can make or break trust. Keeping user loyalty while maintaining a sense of novelty is a delicate balance. Ethereum has mastered this across multiple market cycles, evolving while retaining its core developer and user base. Since the FTX collapse in 2022, Solana has demonstrated resilience , overcoming reputational damage to rebuild its ecosystem, attract developers, and drive real usage through improvements in speed, efficiency and community support. Did you know? Blockchain nodes expose RPC endpoints (often via HTTP or WebSocket protocols) that handle these requests. For example, when you use a decentralized app (DApp) on Ethereum, it might connect to an RPC service like Infura or Alchemy to fetch data or broadcast transactions. What blockchains are still active in 2025? As of April 2025, Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Near, Sui and Tron stand out as active blockchains, each excelling in distinct niches — DApps, speed, value storage, affordability, interoperability or scalability. Active chains show daily user engagement, developer momentum and sustained transaction volume, while inactive ones become digital graveyards. Not all blockchains are dead, but not all are thriving, either. Below are the insights into the standout survivors shaping the crypto landscape as of April 2025: Bitcoin: Bitcoin focuses on value storage, with a $1.636-trillion market capitalization on April 6, 2025, and regular transactions. The 2024 Bitcoin halving and approvals of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) keep it relevant. About 960 developers work on scalability, like Lightning Network, despite limited smart contract features. Ethereum: It powers decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and DApps, processing millions of daily transactions via layer 2s like Arbitrum as of April 2025. It had over 5,900 monthly active developers in June 2023. High total value locked (TVL) persists, though gas fees are a challenge without layer 2s. Solana: According to DefiLlama, Solana’s daily active addresses reached 3.68 million as of April 8, 2025. The surge is likely supported by its fast transactions and low fees. After the 2022 FTX dip, it recovered, supporting gaming and DeFi. It had over 1,400 developers in June 2023, with past outages noted as a concern. Also, the TRUMP token’s crash in March 2025, dropping over 85% from its January peak, strained Solana’s momentum. BNB Chain: Binance’s BNB Chain has 1.93 million daily users as of April 1, 2025, with affordable transactions. It shows notable TVL and volume, mainly in DeFi and gaming, though its centralized nature is debated. Polkadot: Polkadot connects blockchains, with over 1,900 developers in June 2023 working on interoperability. It supports multiple parachains , with moderate but growing activity as of April 2025, though it’s less accessible to casual users. Near Protocol: Near logs 3.18 million daily addresses as of April 1, 2025, using sharding for scalability. It supports DeFi and gaming, with developer tools aiding growth, but it’s still proving itself against larger chains. Sui: Sui , with 2.46 million daily users as of April 1, 2025, uses an object-oriented model for speed. Active in DeFi and gaming, it’s newer and lacks the ecosystem depth of older networks. Tron: Tron has 2.45 million daily addresses as of April 1, 2025, focusing on stablecoin transfers like Tether USDt ( USDT ). It handles high throughput but has limited DApp variety compared to others. Inactive chains like EOS and Terra, impacted by governance or collapse, contrast with the above blockchains. So, a blockchain’s success hinges on its daily activity. How many people are actually transacting on a blockchain every day? Are developers still building new DApps? Is there any meaningful transaction volume? If the answer to these questions is “not much,” the chain might be on its way to becoming a digital graveyard. Did you know? According to Santiment, the top five Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies by development activity in March 2025 were Chainlink ( LINK ), Starknet ( STRK ), Ether ( ETH ), EigenLayer ( EIGEN ) and Fuel Network (FUEL). This ranking reflects the volume of development work, a key indicator of potential growth and innovation in the crypto market. Blockchains that faded: What went wrong? Blockchains like EOS and Terra teach us that hype isn’t enough. A blockchain needs real utility, trust and continuous innovation to survive. Cases like EOS and Terra show that initial excitement isn’t enough to sustain a blockchain. Long-term survival seems tied to practical utility, trust and ongoing development rather than just hype. Some blockchains started with potential but struggled to maintain traction. EOS, once called an “Ethereum killer,” raised $4 billion in its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). By 2025, it saw minimal use, affected by governance challenges and low adoption. Terra and its LUNA token faced a steeper drop in 2022 when its algorithmic stablecoin unraveled, erasing billions in value. These examples suggest hype alone doesn’t ensure staying power — blockchains appear to need real use cases, solid security and active evolution. Community often marks the divide between a blockchain that endures and one that fades. Ethereum has weathered multiple downturns, supported by a large developer base and active users. Developers building DApps draw in users, creating a cycle of growth. Validators and stakers enhance trust, boosting liquidity. Without this participation, even technically advanced chains struggle to remain relevant. How to spot a living blockchain Metrics like transaction volume, TVL, developer activity and validator count are essential signs of whether a blockchain is alive and trusted. How can you tell if a blockchain is healthy? Transaction velocity and volume are major signs. A strong, active blockchain sees consistent transactions, while low activity is a red flag. Total value locked (TVL) is another critical metric because if DeFi users trust a chain, they’ll lock funds into its protocols. A declining TVL suggests that users are leaving. Developer activity is also crucial. Are new projects launching? Is there ongoing development? A stagnant developer ecosystem often signals trouble. Validator and node count matter, too. A high number of validators shows decentralization and network security. And finally, liquidity and the onchain economy play a big role. If liquidity is drying up, so is the chain’s future. Developers and founding teams move across blockchains if they can’t scale from where they are originally based. It comes with a cost, often to rebuild skills and user base. But multiple projects moving out of a chain can indicate a bearish trend for the chain, and vice versa could also be true. For example, on April 3, 2025, the gaming project Infecteddotfun announced that it was shifting from Base to Solana due to scaling struggles. The project’s viral speculative simulation game drew 130,000 signups in 48 hours, overwhelming Base with transaction demand, spiking gas prices and halting gameplay. The team pointed to Ethereum Virtual Machine chain limitations, favoring Solana’s user-centric culture and robust user base. What brings a blockchain back to life? Inactive chains can return if they find compelling use cases, have a strong community, offer strong incentives, or evolve into new forms like layer-2 solutions. So, can a dead blockchain come back to life? Sometimes. The key is finding a reason for people to return. A new use case can revive interest, especially if it solves a real problem. Protocol upgrades that improve scalability, fees or interoperability can also rekindle activity. Strong incentives, such as grants, airdrops or liquidity rewards, can attract developers and users back to a network. In some cases, struggling projects pivot into layer-2 solutions or merge with more active ecosystems to stay relevant. But most of all, a thriving community that has a high conviction on the future of a chain can lead to its resurgence from the worst. Solana’s rise from the FTX debacle due to a committed community is a case study in that respect. The blockchain world moves fast. Some networks thrive, and some fade into obscurity. The ones that last are those with strong community support, real-world utility and continuous innovation. If a blockchain is silent today, it doesn’t mean it’s gone forever, but reviving it takes more than just wishful thinking.",blockchain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-14 07:15:00

The possible gains come as Ripple rebounded over the weekend after reports that the Federal Reserve may intervene if financial markets experience more turmoil due to tariffs. XRP bounced from a crucial support level of $2 to a weekly high of $2.23. XRP Price in Focus Amid Potential SWIFT Partnership Speculation is rife across the crypto industry that the SWIFT global payments network could tap Ripple’s blockchain technology. Per market analyst John Squire, SWIFT will announce this deal within the next seven days. He opined, “In recent weeks, several influential voices have pointed to a possible announcement from SWIFT. It could be the official confirmation that XRP—through Ripple—will become part of SWIFT’s global payment infrastructure, used by over 11,000 financial institutions worldwide.” If Ripple partners with SWIFT for cross-border payments, the blockchain will be accessed by the top global financial institutions globally. Such a deal will bode well for the XRP price, making a $3 target likely. Squire added that this would not be the first time that Ripple was working with SWIFT. He noted that in 2023, Ripple participated in interoperability pilot programs conducted by SWIFT to integrate blockchain in cross-border payments. Hence, XRP price will rally to new highs past $3 in the near term if the deal with SWIFT materializes. Ripple Technical Analysis as XRP Teases Bullish Breakout XRP price is teasing a bullish breakout on its daily price chart after bouncing from the support level of $1.79. Ripple is currently attempting to flip resistance at the upper trendline of a descending parallel channel. If it is successful and creates a higher low, it will reverse the current trend from a downtrend to an uptrend. The next barrier that the XRP price faces is at the PoC line, where a lot of trading activity happened in the past. If it flips this resistance, the market structure will favor bulls, which will then trigger an upswing to $2.60. However, the RSI shows that the buying pressure is still weak. Unless buyers start accumulating Ripple aggressively, the lack of buying momentum may stall the rally and prevent an upswing to all-time high prices above $3. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart Considering the speculation around a partnership deal between Ripple and SWIFT, there might be a surge in buying activity in the near term. Therefore, it is likely that the XRP price will continue with its uptrend and reach $3 before the end of the month. Some analysts are also optimistic that Ripple will reach $45 if it follows past price actions.

But this time, it’s not just the traditional yellow metal that’s winning attention, its digital versions are catching fire too. Recently, Gold-backed cryptocurrencies like Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) have been on a strong rally this year, climbing over 23% year-to-date. These digital tokens are pegged to physical gold and move in sync with its price. Khi thị trường vàng truyền thống tăng trưởng, các nhà đầu tư tiền điện tử cũng đang tìm đến các đồng tiền điện tử có tài sản bảo chứng vàng như Paxos Gold (PAXG) và Tether Gold (XAUT), với mức tăng trên 24% trong năm nay, tương đương với hiệu suất của vàng… pic.twitter.com/Pwgbv2dfid — CoinPhoton Việt Nam (@coinphoton_vn) April 14, 2025 In early 2025, both tokens touched new all-time highs above $3,300 before settling slightly lower. In comparison, Bitcoin has dropped over 11% this year, and the overall crypto market is down more than 30%, according to the CoinDesk 20 index. That’s why many investors are now turning to tokenized gold to protect their money. While Trump’s tariff war crashed the entire crypto market, Gold ETFs stayed strong and proved it’s still a valuable investment option. Why Tokenized Gold is Getting Attention The two top gainers PAXG and XAUT has become popular because they offer the best of both worlds, real-world asset backing and the flexibility of crypto. These tokens are backed by actual gold stored in vaults, but they can be traded easily on the blockchain . This makes them more liquid than traditional gold while still offering the same safe-haven qualities. With growing uncertainty in global markets, especially due to rising tensions between the U.S. and China, more investors are looking for stability, and gold is a natural choice. Big Money is Also Moving into Gold ETFs The rising interest in gold isn’t limited to the crypto space. Traditional investors are pouring money into gold ETFs as well. In the first quarter of 2025, inflows into gold ETFs reached 226.5 tonnes, the highest level in three years, according to the World Gold Council. North America led the trend, accounting for nearly 60% of that demand. This shows a broader shift toward gold as a safer investment option. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Price Today : Mantra OM Crash, Bitcoin Price,Gold Price, Metaplanet INC And More , Token Minting Adds to the Momentum Meanwhile, backing the rally in tokenized gold is a wave of new token minting.

This warning comes as Donald Trump’s new tariff rules are creating more problems around the world. Despite this turmoil, Kiyosaki says it’s not too late to act—but only if people act fast and turn to gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Well-Planned Crash Happening According to Kiyosaki, the crash he predicted in his past books is now becoming a reality. He points out that the value of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs is quickly dropping, causing many people to lose their savings. PLEASE LISTEN to Gold, Silver, & Bitcoin. What are they telling you? Gold is at an all time high, demand for silver is exploding, and Bitcoin is roaring. Are you listening? REPEATING MYSELF, I warned of the biggest stock and bond market crash in history was coming in my… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 13, 2025 Kiyosaki suggests that this isn’t just a normal market dip. Instead, he believes it’s a planned disaster caused by powerful central banks. He specifically blames the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world for the crisis. Meanwhile, these banks are “corrupt and crooked,” and they are destroying the value of the U.S. dollar. By printing too much money and keeping interest rates low, they’ve caused inflation, which weakens the value of the U.S. dollar. People who thought their savings were safe are now losing money because the banks’ actions are slowly destroying the financial system. Can Bitcoin Save Your Savings? With traditional investments dropping, Kiyosaki suggests looking at gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Gold has hit $3,200 , silver demand is rising, and Bitcoin is climbing again, reaching $86,000. While Bitcoin has always been viewed as a hedge against inflation. With the fiat currency weakening, Kiyosaki suggests it’s time to focus on this digital asset . As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $84,614 refleitng a slight rise seen in the last 24 hours. However, Bitcoin is now facing resistance at the $88k level, and a breakout will push it towards $100k. Experts are going bullish because the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a key indicator of market momentum, remains above 60, suggesting that the price could continue to rise. Why Bitcoin Kiyosaki trust Bitcoin now? Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as digital gold, making it a good hedge against inflation and crashing markets. Is now a good time to invest in Bitcoin? Kiyosaki thinks so, as Bitcoin is near $85,000 and gaining strength.

Within a few hours, the popular altcoin crashed by nearly 90%, leaving holders with losses. Although the issues have been identified, the downfall remains, leaving a group of investors in a $400M loss and many others. Mantra Price Crash Pushed Crypto Traders Into $400M Loss Amid the crypto market’s high volatility due to the US- China war , the Mantra price crash left investors with massive losses. This includes a group of 19 fresh crypto wallets or traders who moved 14.27M OM equivalent to $91M just three days before the crash. Spotonchain X’s post revealed that these investors have scooped a massive OM tokens holding, i.e., 84.15M ($564.7M) from Binance just three days ago. Now, with the OM price crash, their remaining 69.08M OM are worth only $62.2M, leaving them in a staggering $406.3M loss. Interestingly, crypto experts also anticipate that these investors could have contributed to the crash. Forced Liquidation Led to Mantra Price Crash The Mantra price crash has resulted in wiping out nearly $6 billion from the crypto market. Crypto experts like StarPlatinum have compared it to the LUNA crash, which affected the entire market. In a detailed analysis, StarPlatinum revealed that the crypto whales, failed Mantra airdrop, and investors’ panic resulted in the crash. The Mantra co-founder John Patrick Mullin and the team clarified that forced liquidators from OM crypto investors on centralized exchanges resulted in the crash. More importantly, he clarified that the team is not behind the crash. To be clear, this dislocation was not caused by the team, the MANTRA Chain Association, its core advisors, or MANTRA’s investors selling tokens. Tokens remain locked and subject to the published vesting periods. OM’s tokenomics remain intact, as shared last week in our latest token report. Our token wallet addresses are online and visible. A Lookonchain post also brought clarity to the situation, revealing that 17 crypto traders deposited nearly 4.5% of the OM’s circulating supply, equivalent to 227M participating in the crash. At the time of writing, the OM token price is still down, trading at $0.8 with a market capitalization of $761.45M. Investors are now eyeing the experts’ Mantra predictions to witness recovery.

In an April 14 X post , Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said the company now holds 4,525 BTC, worth roughly $386.3 million, at an average cost of around $85,366 per coin The announcement followed Metaplanet’s latest purchase of 319 BTC for approximately ¥3.78 billion (or $26.3 million), acquired at an average price of ¥11.85 million (~$82,549) per Bitcoin. To track the effectiveness of its treasury strategy, Metaplanet relies on BTC Yield, a metric that measures the growth of its Bitcoin holdings relative to its fully diluted share count. As previously reported by crypto.news, the metric surged 309.8% in Q4 2024 and 95.6% in the first quarter of 2025. Earlier this month, the Tokyo-listed firm added 160 BTC to its treasury for around $13.4 million. Metaplanet is aiming to accumulate over 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and ultimately reach 21,000 BTC by 2026. To support this aggressive strategy, Metaplanet has been raising funds through a mix of equity and debt, including a series of zero-coupon bond issuances and stock acquisition rights with EVO FUND. Since January, it has issued 21 million shares across five tranches under its “210 Million Plan.” You might also like: New Bitwise ETF targets Bitcoin-heavy firms like MicroStrategy, MARA Most recently, it exercised 8.6 million and 4.2 million shares under its 14th and 17th stock rights series, raising over ¥35 billion to date, which accounts for roughly 42% of the planned 21 million share issuance. The company has completed early redemptions on several bond tranches, including its 9th Series, which was fully repaid ahead of schedule. Originally maturing in September 2025, the ¥2 billion issuance was redeemed using proceeds from EVO FUND’s exercise of the 13th to 17th stock rights series. Last month, it announced plans to raise ¥2 billion ($13.3 million) through its 10th Series of Ordinary Bonds issued on March 31. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, Metaplanet is currently the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in Asia. Globally, U.S.-based Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of the flagship crypto with 528,185 BTC worth approximately $44.5 billion in their stash. However, the company recently alerted share holders it may have to sell part of its Bitcoin stash to meet financial obligations if it fails to raise fresh capital.

Mainly because Mantra was considered one of the fundamentally strong tokens and ranked number 1 in Real World Assets (RWA) tokens. In times when the markets are recovering from the latest bearish action, such events raise huge suspicion. The OM price was trading above $6, while the trading volume remained constrained below $100 million. In no time, the volume rose above $2 billion, which slashed the price by over 93% to as low as $0.43 in no time. Why Mantra (OM) Price Drop Drastically? Was it a Pre-Planned Rug-Pull? It all started when a single transaction was processed of a wallet linked to the Mantra team that sent over 3.9M OM to Okex. This raised huge concerns as 90% of the token supply is controlled by the insiders, which could hurt the token’s value anytime, which cropped up. The OM price dropped from $6 to $0.48, whipping over $6 billion from the markets. A month ago, the platform launched an airdrop and before this, they had blacklisted more than 50% of wallets, calling them ‘bots’ without any transparency. This followed a series of rumors that shook the confidence over the token. Insiders were allegedly running OTC token deals at 50% discounts, which triggered panic selling, stop-loss cascades and leverage liquidations, while most of them had no idea of what was going on behind the scenes. The OM price crash has shaken the entire crypto market with the excessive greed of the Mantra team. Since Q3, 2023, the OM token has been surging with a 200x upswing and the reason behind this jump was not fundamental but market manipulation. The changed tokenomics, controlled 90% supply, delayed community airdrop, OTC deals and Tier-1 market makers who inflated prices over the past 2 years. What’s Next for the Mantra (OM) Price? Will it Recover or be the Next LUNA? Initially, the dump was triggered by the sale of 4 million tokens, and as the liquidity was low on weekends, the price dropped below $3, pushing the OTC buyers into a loss. In no time, the liquidation cascade happened, and the MMs & OTC buyers rushed to sell first, causing the 90% dump. During all this, the second-largest wallet was delegating and sending OM tokens to exchanges. It points towards a perfectly planned dump to rug the community that was executed. The Terra ecosystem created a new token to revive the platform but failed. The same thing happened with the FTT token as well. This suggests that once the investors lose their confidence, the token’s future remains in the dark. While the people behind the Terra & FTX collapse were put on trial, the founders and CEOs of Mantra may also face a similar consequence.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|OM|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 07:26:20

This latest purchase brings the company's total bitcoin holdings to 4,525 BTC, with an aggregate cost basis of $408.1 million and an average acquisition price of $90,194. This move is part of Metaplanet’s broader bitcoin treasury operations strategy, launched in December 2024, aimed at using digital assets to enhance shareholder value. The company evaluates its performance through BTC Yield, a measure of bitcoin holding growth relative to share outstanding. For Q1 2025, its BTC yield reached 95.6%, with a year-to-date figure of 6.5% as of April 14.

While ETH trades at $1,556, PEPE holds around $0.000007, and MUTM remains under-the-radar, analysts say it’s these very price points that are setting the stage for major upside. The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.65 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 8200 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06. Here’s what investors need to know before the crowd catches on. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 8200 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $6.65 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. MUTM has introduced tangible features, including a new dashboard leaderboard that tracks its top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. As investors grow more utility-focused, MUTM’s rise signals what could be the next win in crypto, substance over spectacle. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Whale activity around Ethereum (ETH), Pepe (PEPE), and especially Mutuum Finance (MUTM) signals growing confidence in their upside potential. With ETH at $1,556, PEPE at $0.000007, and MUTM priced at $0.025 in Phase 4, raising $6.65 million from 8,200+ investors, the opportunity is clear. Early buyers stand to gain 140% when MUTM hits its $0.06 launch price, with forecasts aiming as high as $5. Secure your position now in the Mutuum Finance presale before the next price jump.

According to Sun, the firm, along with a network of partners including Dubai-based Aria DMCC, deceived the stablecoin’s issuer into wiring the funds to an unrelated entity. He claims the money was re-routed through a fraudulent address switch and partially deposited into a Hong Kong account called “Glass Door.” You might also like: ‘Typical Justin Sun smear campaign’: First Digital denies allegations, threatens legal action Sun named several individuals allegedly involved and called the scheme a “major international financial fraud,” comparing it to a classic crypto wallet exploit.

The stablecoin, backed by U.S. Treasuries and managed by custodian BitGo, is part of WLFI’s effort to establish a regulated dollar-pegged digital asset. WLFI’s growing presence in the stablecoin space has not gone unnoticed by lawmakers. At an April 2 hearing before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee , Democratic Representative Maxine Waters expressed concern that Trump may seek to make USD1 a replacement for the U.S. dollar in federal transactions.

With tools like OpenAI’s Custom GPTs, it is now possible for beginners and enthusiasts to create intelligent trading bots capable of analyzing data, generating signals and even executing trades. This guide analyzes the fundamentals of building a beginner-friendly AI crypto trading bot using Custom GPTs. It covers setup, strategy design, coding, testing and important considerations for safety and success. What is a custom GPT? A custom GPT (generative pretrained transformer) is a personalized version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT . It can be trained to follow specific instructions, work with uploaded documents and assist with niche tasks, including crypto trading bot development. These models can help automate tedious processes, generate and troubleshoot code, analyze technical indicators and even interpret crypto news or market sentiment, making them ideal companions for building algorithmic trading bots. What you’ll need to get started Before creating a trading bot, the following components are necessary : OpenAI ChatGPT Plus subscription (for access to GPT-4 and Custom GPTs). A crypto exchange account that offers API access (e.g., Coinbase , Binance, Kraken ). Basic knowledge of Python (or willingness to learn). A paper trading environment to safely test strategies. Optional: A VPS or cloud server to run the bot continuously. Did you know? Python’s creator, Guido van Rossum, named the language after Monty Python’s Flying Circus, aiming for something fun and approachable. Step-by-step guide to building an AI trading bot with custom GPTs Whether you’re looking to generate trade signals, interpret news sentiment or automate strategy logic, the below step-by-step approach helps you learn the basics of combining AI with crypto trading . With sample Python scripts and output examples, you'll see how to connect a custom GPT to a trading system, generate trade signals and automate decisions using real-time market data. Step 1: Define a simple trading strategy Start by identifying a basic rule-based strategy that is easy to automate. Examples include: Buy when Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) daily price drops by more than 3%. Sell when RSI (relative strength index) exceeds 70. Enter a long position after a bullish moving average convergence divergence (MACD) crossover. Trade based on sentiment from recent crypto headlines. Clear, rule-based logic is essential for creating effective code and minimizing confusion for your Custom GPT. Step 2: Create a custom GPT To build a personalized GPT model: Visit chat.openai.com Navigate to Explore GPTs > Create Name the model (e.g., “Crypto Trading Assistant”) In the instructions section, define its role clearly. For example: “You are a Python developer specialized in crypto trading bots.” “You understand technical analysis and crypto APIs.” “You help generate and debug trading bot code.” Optional: Upload exchange API documentation or trading strategy PDFs for additional context. Step 3: Generate the trading bot code (with GPT’s help) Use the custom GPT to help generate a Python script. For example, type: “Write a basic Python script that connects to Binance using ccxt and buys BTC when RSI drops below 30. I am a beginner and don’t understand code much so I need a simple and short script please.” The GPT can provide: Code for connecting to the exchange via API. Technical indicator calculations using libraries like ta or TA-lib. Trading signal logic. Sample buy/sell execution commands. Python libraries commonly used for such tasks are: ccxt for multi-exchange API support. pandas for market data manipulation. ta or TA-Lib for technical analysis. schedule or apscheduler for running timed tasks. To begin, the user must install two Python libraries: ccxt for accessing the Binance API, and ta (technical analysis) for calculating the RSI. This can be done by running the following command in a terminal: pip install ccxt ta Next, the user should replace the placeholder API key and secret with their actual Binance API credentials. These can be generated from a Binance account dashboard. The script uses a five-minute candlestick chart to determine short-term RSI conditions. Below is the full script: ==================================================================== import ccxt import pandas as pd import ta # Your Binance API keys (use your own) api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY' api_secret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET' # Connect to Binance exchange = ccxt.binance({ 'apiKey': api_key, 'secret': api_secret, 'enableRateLimit': True, }) # Get BTC/USDT 1h candles bars = exchange.fetch_ohlcv('BTC/USDT', timeframe='1h', limit=100) df = pd.DataFrame(bars, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']) # Calculate RSI df['rsi'] = ta.momentum.RSIIndicator(df['close'], window=14).rsi() # Check latest RSI value latest_rsi = df['rsi'].iloc[-1] print(f""Latest RSI: {latest_rsi}"") # If RSI if latest_rsi order = exchange.create_market_buy_order('BTC/USDT', 0.001) print(""Buy order placed:"", order) else: print(""RSI not low enough to buy."") ==================================================================== Please note that the above script is intended for illustration purposes. It does not include risk management features, error handling or safeguards against rapid trading. Beginners should test this code in a simulated environment or on Binance’s testnet before considering any use with real funds. Also, the above code uses market orders, which execute immediately at the current price and only run once. For continuous trading, you’d put it in a loop or scheduler. Images below show what the sample output would look like: The sample output shows how the trading bot reacts to market conditions using the RSI indicator. When the RSI drops below 30, as seen with “Latest RSI: 27.46,” it indicates the market may be oversold, prompting the bot to place a market buy order. The order details confirm a successful trade with 0.001 BTC purchased. If the RSI is higher, such as “41.87,” the bot prints “RSI not low enough to buy,” meaning no trade is made. This logic helps automate entry decisions, but the script has limitations like no sell condition, no continuous monitoring and no real-time risk management features, as explained previously. Step 4: Implement risk management Risk control is a critical component of any automated trading strategy . Ensure your bot includes: Stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. Position size limits to avoid overexposure. Rate-limiting or cooldown periods between trades. Capital allocation controls, such as only risking 1–2% of total capital per trade. Prompt your GPT with instructions like: “Add a stop-loss to the RSI trading bot at 5% below the entry price.” Step 5: Test in a paper trading environment Never deploy untested bots with real capital. Most exchanges offer testnets or sandbox environments where trades can be simulated safely. Alternatives include: Running simulations on historical data (backtesting). Logging “paper trades” to a file instead of executing real trades. Testing ensures that logic is sound, risk is controlled and the bot performs as expected under various conditions. Step 6: Deploy the bot for live trading (Optional) Once the bot has passed paper trading tests: Replace test API keys: First, replace your test API keys with live API keys from your chosen exchange’s account. These keys allow the bot to access your real trading account. To do this, log in to exchange, go to the API management section and create a new set of API keys. Copy the API key and secret into your script. It is crucial to handle these keys securely and avoid sharing them or including them in public code. Set up secure API permissions (disable withdrawals): Adjust the security settings for your API keys. Make sure that only the permissions you need are enabled. For example, enable only “spot and margin trading ” and disable permissions like “withdrawals” to reduce the risk of unauthorized fund transfers. Exchanges like Binance also allow you to limit API access to specific IP addresses, which adds another layer of protection. Host the bot on a cloud server: If you want the bot to trade continuously without relying on your personal computer, you’ll need to host it on a cloud server. This means running the script on a virtual machine that stays online 24/7. Services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), DigitalOcean or PythonAnywhere provide this functionality. Among these, PythonAnywhere is often the easiest to set up for beginners, as it supports running Python scripts directly in a web interface. Still, always start small and monitor the bot regularly. Mistakes or market changes can result in losses, so careful setup and ongoing supervision are essential. Did you know? Exposed API keys are a top cause of crypto theft. Always store them in environment variables — not inside your code. Ready-made bot templates (starter logic) The templates below are basic strategy ideas that beginners can easily understand. They show the core logic behind when a bot should buy, like “buy when RSI is below 30.” Even if you’re new to coding, you can take these simple ideas and ask your Custom GPT to turn them into full, working Python scripts. GPT can help you write, explain and improve the code, so you don’t need to be a developer to get started. In addition, here is a simple checklist for building and testing a crypto trading bot using the RSI strategy: Just choose your trading strategy, describe what you want, and let GPT do the heavy lifting, including backtesting, live trading or multi-coin support. RSI strategy bot (buy Low RSI) Logic : Buy BTC when RSI drops below 30 (oversold). if rsi place_buy_order() Used for: Momentum reversal strategies. Tools: ta library for RSI. 2. MACD crossover bot Logic : Buy when MACD line crosses above signal line. if macd > signal and previous_macd place_buy_order() Used for: Trend-following and swing trading. Tools : ta.trend.MACD or TA-Lib. 3. News sentiment bot Logic : Use AI (Custom GPT) to scan headlines for bullish/bearish sentiment. if “bullish” in sentiment_analysis(latest_headlines): place_buy_order() Used for: Reacting to market-moving news or tweets. Tools: News APIs + GPT sentiment classifier. Risks concerning AI-powered trading bots While trading bots can be powerful tools, they also come with serious risks : Market volatility : Sudden price swings can lead to unexpected losses. API errors or rate limits : Improper handling can cause the bot to miss trades or place incorrect orders. Bugs in code : A single logic error can result in repeated losses or account liquidation. Security vulnerabilities : Storing API keys insecurely can expose your funds. Overfitting : Bots tuned to perform well in backtests may fail in live conditions. Always start with small amounts, use strong risk management and continuously monitor bot behavior. While AI can offer powerful support, it’s crucial to respect the risks involved. A successful trading bot combines intelligent strategy, responsible execution and ongoing learning. Build slowly, test carefully and use your Custom GPT not just as a tool — but also as a mentor.

Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-binance-made-a-statement-about-om-token-which-had-a-big-drop-here-are-the-details/,"Binance has released a statement acknowledging the recent price volatility surrounding the MANTRA project’s native token, OM, attributing the move to cross-exchange liquidations and significant changes to the token’s supply structure. Binance Announces OM Token Amid Cross-Exchange Liquidations and Tokenomics Shift The exchange stated risk control measures and ongoing monitoring following sharp price fluctuations in MANTRA’s native token. According to the exchange, its internal analysis shows that the price fluctuations observed over the past 24 hours were largely the result of gradual liquidations across multiple trading platforms. OM experienced sharp price movements that caught the attention of investors and led to the platform reaffirming its risk management practices. “Since October last year, Binance has proactively implemented various risk control measures, including reducing the available leverage for OM. These actions are part of our ongoing efforts to adjust risk exposure in response to evolving market conditions,” the company said in a statement. The exchange also noted that in January, OM published an alert message on its spot trading page to inform users about significant changes in token supply dynamics. This message refers to changes to OM’s tokenomics that have increased the circulating supply. In light of recent price action, Binance has updated this alert to highlight the token’s high volatility. Despite the turbulence, Binance reiterated its commitment to protecting users through continuous monitoring and responsive platform management. “We are committed to monitoring the situation closely and will continue to take appropriate measures to protect our users and preserve the integrity of our platform,” the exchange said. OM’s recent volatility highlights the broader risks associated with tokenomic changes and leveraged trading, particularly when amplified by fragmented liquidity across exchanges. Binance’s public statement and additional measures reflect increasing pressure on major trading platforms to improve transparency and risk mitigation in the face of increased market scrutiny. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, the scheme involved using translation and chat software to befriend foreigners, gain their trust and trick them into investment by defrauding their money. Over 66,000 Indians Fell To the Scam The case handled by the People’s Court of Heze Economic Development Zone in Shandong Province involved a total of 517 million Indian rupees which is about 40 million RMB targeting 66,800 Indians. The nine fraudsters were sentenced to prison and fined for their involvement in the large-scale scam targeting Indians. He Moutian was the mastermind behind the scam. In May 2023 he set up an office in Heze, China and formed a fraud gang with several other people. The group used overseas servers, appeared to be large investors, and targeted Indians through a fake investment platform called SENEE. Scammers Promised 8%-15% Returns, Stole Millions for USDT Conversion They pretended to be friendly investors on chat apps, offering high monthly returns of 8%-15% on smaller investments like 1,000 rupees. Once people put in larger sums of money, the gang would shut the platform and freeze the funds. The stolen money was then used to buy USDT through a third-party payment platform which was later converted into RMB or US dollars, with the group keeping 15% as profit. Scammers Used Fake Identities and Coordinated Closely One of the scammers, Li Mouwang, admitted to pretending to be a rich Indian woman who made money through smart investments. She used chat apps to build trust and fake relationships with Indian men and lured them into investing in the fake SENEE fund. Furthermore, the gang also posted fake lifestyle photos like gym selfies and travel pics and also set their app location to Indian cities. A fake company website with edited licenses, registration certificates and business documents was also created to make the investment platform seem genuine and gain customer trust. The court found that the group was highly organised with clear roles and tight coordination. All the nine members were sentenced to 5 to nearly 15 years in prison and fined. The Judge noted that although this case targeted foreigners, however online scams are common inside China too. It warned the public to not fall for promises of easy money, special insider tips or cashbacks for placing orders as they are all signs of scams. The authorities are increasingly cracking down on telecommunications network fraud and the judge has urged the fraudsters to surrender for lighter punishment.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Hack,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 07:42:37

Thank you for your continued trust in Binance,” said the Binance Help Desk account. At press time, the Mantra token has experienced a near 90% drop in the past 24 hours. Its market cap stands at $764 million, plummeting from a previous $6 billion high. The token is currently trading hands at $0.79, down 91% from its earlier all-time high of $8.99 from last February.

In addition, Binance also stated that it had decreased leverage levels for the OM token since October last year. Despite this fact, many traders in the comments section criticized the exchange for not delisting the token before the incident occurred. On the other hand, OKX CEO Star deemed the OM price drop as “a big scandal to the whole crypto industry.” Star also assured the crypto exchange will be preparing reports based on the incident, as all the information is available on-chain. “All of the on-chain unlock and deposit data is public, all major exchanges’ collateral and liquidation data can be investigated. OKX will make all of the reports ready!” stated Star in a recent post . On-chain data from CryptoNinjas revealed that 127 million OM or 13% of the token’s circulating supply has been withdrawn from Binance in the past month. Meanwhile, OKX has seen nearly 70 million token deposits, which was more than 50% of the amount withdrawn from Biannce. What happened to OM? Last weekend, OM experienced a major price crash by 90%, falling from $6.30 to under $0.50 in the span of just a few hours. Mantra chief executive officer JP Mullin alleged that OM’s recent price crash was due to “reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders.” Mullin claimed that the sell-off was not due to token sales by either the internal team or investors, stating that the OM tokens remain under lock based on the project’s vesting timeline. “Centralized exchange partners play an important role in providing liquidity to projects like ours. We work closely with them, however they continue to exercise enormously high levels of discretion,” said Mullin. However, on-chain analysts seem to disagree, with many stating that the sell-off began when 3.9 million OM was deposited on OKX by a wallet linked to the Mantra team.

Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,710.66 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price increased over the last 24 hours towards the resistance at $597. Buyers stepped in to buy the assets; However, the support floor at that level seems stable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is now trading below the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,710.66 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB was trading near the psychological mark of $600, which it still continues to do so in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-14 07:45:00

BTC has bounced to over $84,000 since probing lows under $75,000 last week. The recovery comes as the bond market chaos supposedly forced President Donald Trump to capitulate on tariffs just days after announcing sweeping import levies on several nations, including China. Late Friday, The Trump administration issued new guidelines, sparing key tech products like smartphones from his 125% China tariff and baseline 10% global levy. Hours later, Trump refuted the news, suggesting no relief on tariffs. Still, the price recovery saw emboldened traders chase upside in BTC through the Deribit-listed call options. A call gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, looking to profit from an expected price rise. A put buyer is said to be bearish, looking to hedge or profit from price swoons. ""Trump's bond-market-crisis fueled tariff-walkback flipped the vocal narrative from aggression to capitulation, and the markets from capitulation to aggressive bounce. Protective/Bear play BTC $75K-$78K [strike] Puts were dumped, and $85K-$100K [strike] Calls were lifted as BTC surged from $75K-$85K,"" Deribit said in a market update. The pivot to upside calls has normalized the options skew, which reflected strong put bias or downside fears early last week, according to data tracked by Amberdata. The skew measures the implied volatility (demand) for calls relative to puts and has been a reliable market sentiment indicator for years. The 30-, 60-, and 90-day skews have rebounded to just above zero, up from deeply negative levels a week ago, indicating a decrease in market panic and a resurgence of upside interest. Although the seven-day gauge remains negative, it reflects a notably weaker put bias than a week ago when it dropped to -14%. $100K is the most popular bet Another data point likely to energize the recently battered market participants is the distribution of open interest, highlighting the resurgence of the $100K call as the most favored options bet on Deribit, which accounts for over 75% of global options activity. As of writing, the $100K call boasted a cumulative notional open interest of nearly $1.2 billion. The notional figure represents the U.S. dollar value of the number of active option contracts at a given time. Calls at $100K and $120K were popular early this year before the market swoon saw traders deploy money in the $80K put last month. The chart shows the concentration of open interest in calls at strikes ranging from $95,000 to $120,000. Meanwhile, the $70K put is the second-most popular play with an open interest of $982 million.",Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-14 07:47:43

According to the team, several centralized exchanges closed the accounts of OM holders without thinking about the negative impact on the token’s price. The crash of Mantra (OM) was not due to the token’s ecosystem, but was probably due to the actions of centralized exchange operators. John Patrick Mullin, the project’s CEO, wrote a statement on the probable reason for the crash. “We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders. The timing and depth of the crash suggest that a very sudden closure of account positions was initiated without sufficient warning or notice.” ~ wrote Mullin in a post on X. The statement arrived just hours after the crypto community set out doubts on the team’s involvement with the market crash. OM was already sliding in the days before the crash, and there were rumors of insider selling and an eventual rug-pull. Mullin explained the crash was partially due to the low liquidity late on Sunday, which coincided with the most inactive hours on the Asian market. He admitted centralized exchanges had their internal rules, but in the case of OM, the account closures were not coordinated with the team. Whale selling preceded OM crash, but CEO denies insider trading The crash did not happen due to the sale of OM tokens by the team, the MANTRA Chain Association, advisors, early backers, or any other entities selling tokens, added Mullin. A big part of the OM supply remains locked with a long-term vesting schedule. However, according to Arkham, in the days before the crash, several wallets deposited OM to exchanges. One of the wallets sent over 470K OM to Binance, while another address made a series of deposits to OKX. One of the wallets was tagged as belonging to Laser Digital , or LD Capital, one of the early backers of Mantra. The attempted selling also happened during low liquidity periods, meaning the insiders only realized a fraction of their value on paper. Laser Digital has also invested in Berachain (BERA), Plume Network (PLUME), Illuvium (ILV) and other high-profile Web3 projects. One of the high-profile sales happened just hours before the OM crash. A wallet linked to influencer and VC investor Shane Shin deposited 2M OM after a year of holding the tokens. Shin had mentioned OM multiple times and shilled the Mantra project. The selling was relatively minor compared to the subsequent loss of value for OM. The Mantra community relied on most of OM being locked and held closely, not expecting a rug pull from a well-established project. ZachXBT raised hypothesis of OM wallet exploits One of the hypotheses on the price effects for OM is that the selling was not intended, but a possible result of a hack. On-chain investigator ZachXBT claimed Mantra was not easily researched, since it is a Cosmos chain project, with limited tools for tracking and exploration. However, he allows the possibility for a hack or an exploit to explain the token sales. There’s no question it was a heavily manipulated token via MMs / supply control — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) April 13, 2025 Whatever the cause, the effect on OM was outsized. Hours after the crash, OM regained some of its positions, up to $0.80, but there are still doubts about the project’s soundness. The Mantra DAO is also suffering, remaining with just $1.9M in its reserves, as 99.7% of the treasury was held in OM tokens. Even during the OM market rally, there were rumors that the token’s price action was due to the influence of market makers . The rapid rise of OM and the chart’s rapid rise have led to risk warnings in the past few months. The existing doubts amplified the effect of the initial selling, leading to the erasing of over 98% of OM’s market capitalization. OM has been around since the 2020 market lows, trading at around $0.40 for years. The token only broke out during the 2024 bull cycle, when RWA tokenization became a hot narrative. Mantra (OM) erased most of its gains from the past years, raising suspicions the price growth was the effect of market makers. The Mantra project has taken a long time before its big rally, while the initial team and backers held at least 30% of the supply. The Mantra project launched with $11M from fundraising rounds, but the token’s value expanded to as much as $6B. The crash of OM wiped out the entire RWA token narrative. The collective tokens are now valued at $35B, with Chainlink (LINK) as the leading asset. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Speaking to ABC News on April 13, Lutnick said the exemption was short-lived and would soon give way to a broader, more targeted tariff regime focused on semiconductors, smartphones, and computing components. “President Trump has called out pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos,” Lutnick said, pointing to the administration’s sector-based tariff plans. “These aren’t bargaining chips. These are strategic industries that must be rebuilt here at home.” The quick reversal underscores the administration’s firm stance on economic nationalism, particularly regarding goods seen as vital to national security. While the initial exemption had raised hopes of easing tensions with China, Lutnick made it clear the administration isn’t budging on critical supply chains. “We can’t be relying on China for the things we fundamentally need,” he added, drawing a sharp line around sectors the White House deems non-negotiable. Policy Confusion Sends Markets Into a Tailspin The inconsistency in communication over tariff policy didn’t go unnoticed by investors. Stocks and crypto both surged after initial rumors of a 90-day tariff pause began circulating earlier in the week, pumping nearly $2 trillion back into markets. But the rally was short-lived. President Trump later denied the pause, sparking a rapid sell-off. Then, when the administration did in fact issue a reciprocal exemption—albeit briefly—markets bounced again, only to falter once more after Lutnick’s clarification on April 13. “Markets hate uncertainty, and this is a case study in it,” said one Wall Street analyst. “Every time they say one thing and do another, traders get burned.” Strategic or Chaotic? Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas pointed out that the S&P 500 had surpassed Bitcoin in volatility. According to him, the index hit a volatility score of 74 in April—higher than Bitcoin’s 71. While some see the administration’s tariff flip-flop as poor messaging , others believe it signals a calculated pivot toward long-term economic restructuring. With semiconductors and other tech products becoming modern-day lifelines, Lutnick’s remarks suggest the U.S. is preparing for a more entrenched and strategic trade stance—one that may continue to rattle markets before any sense of clarity returns.

Reveals Indicator to Follow for Risks in Altcoins!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-founder-cz-comments-on-mantra-om-crash-reveals-indicator-to-follow-for-risks-in-altcoins/,"A new one was added to the altcoins that have experienced sharp declines in recent weeks. Accordingly, Mantra (OM), listed on Binance, fell by more than 80% in seconds. While this decline has a shocking effect on investors, everyone is wondering why. At this point, MANTRA CEO John Patrick Mullin said that no team member or partner had sold OM tokens, while claiming that the decline was due to the deliberate action of centralized exchanges against OM account holders. While these claims continue to be debated in the crypto community, OKX founder and CEO Star Xu said that the MANTRA crash was a ‘big scandal’ and promised to release related reports soon. Binance stated in its statement that initial findings showed that the sudden drop in the price of the OM token was due to liquidations between exchanges. While the sharp decline in Mantra is still awaiting clarification, a statement came from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). CZ commented, “Like everyone else, I'm wondering 'what happened to this?' I didn't know about the project until the crash.” He responded to questions about whether Binance was doing its due diligence on OM. CZ stated that Binance has been paying due attention, referring to Binance’s statement regarding the OM token. In its statement, Binance stated that it has implemented various risk control measures, including reducing leverage levels, regarding the OM token since October of last year. CZ said that neither CEXs nor DEXs should set up a listing process, access to all tokens should be allowed, and the investment process should be decided by users. Regarding how to understand the risks of projects like OM, CZ said that the “number of real users” is generally a good indicator of the risk situation in altcoins. Finally, CZ added that investors should focus on fundamentals such as user growth, revenue, and profitability when investing in altcoins rather than chasing hype or rumors. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) price led the wider altcoin market in a mild recovery last week. With on-chain data showing significant confidence from whale investors, the crazy crypto speculation is likely to happen in the coming weeks. XRP Price on the Rise As Bitcoin price rallied towards $85k last week, XRP price recorded a 28 percent surge to trade at about $2.12 on Monday, April 14 during the early London session. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $211 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $3.8 billion, has seen its total Futures Open Interest (OI) rise from $2.87 billion on April 9 to about $3.41 billion on Monday. Technical Analysis From a technical analysis standpoint, XRP price has been retesting the bullish breakout from the 2021 all-time high of about $1.9. In the weekly timeframe, XRP price has been forming a falling wedge, amid the macro bullish outlook. As a result, a consistent close above the falling logarithmic trend line, which was established since the beginning of this year, will trigger the next XRP price parabolic rally toward price discovery.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/expert-projects-10-to-20-xrp-price-heres-the-timeline/,"XRP is once again under the spotlight as renewed optimism surrounds its potential for exponential price growth. In a recent X post, prominent crypto voice BarriC projected an ambitious timeline that places XRP at a price range of $10 to $20 in the coming months, with longer-term expectations soaring toward $1,000 in a utility-driven run. Currently trading at $2.20, XRP has already begun to show signs of resurgence. According to BarriC , short-term projections are bullish, with $3 expected within weeks and $5 becoming the new “cheap” XRP by May. These forecasts align with the broader market’s anticipation of an altseason—a cyclical surge in altcoin valuations that historically follows Bitcoin’s major rallies. $XRP is $2.20 right now In a few weeks we could see $3 $XRP By May the new “cheap” #XRP could easily be $5 In the next few months cheap $XRP could easily be $10-$20 And that’s just within the parameters of an alt season In a utility run Cheap $XRP will be closer to $1,000… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) April 13, 2025 XRP’s Momentum in the Context of Altseason BarriC attributes the near-term rally expectations to the parameters of an altseason, which often sees capital rotation from Bitcoin to alternative digital assets. As institutional interest grows and retail investors re-enter the market, XRP could benefit significantly from this cyclical momentum. A move to $10–$20 within a few months, according to BarriC, falls well within this framework. Market indicators seem to support this bullish sentiment. Liquidity across exchanges is deepening, trading volumes are on the rise, and sentiment around Ripple’s ecosystem continues to improve as regulatory pressures ease following significant legal victories in the Ripple vs. SEC case. Beyond Hype: The Utility Narrative What makes BarriC’s prediction even more notable is his distinction between speculative cycles and the utility run—a potential future scenario where crypto valuations are driven not by hype but by widespread adoption and real-world usage. In that context, XRP’s role as a bridge asset for global liquidity becomes central. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 BarriC argues that if and when the market shifts its focus toward real-world application, “cheap XRP” could be redefined at $1,000. While this may appear extreme, the rationale lies in XRP’s utility as the native currency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), designed for fast, cost-efficient, and scalable cross-border payments. As global financial institutions and enterprises continue exploring blockchain integration, the XRPL’s inherent features—such as built-in decentralized exchange, minimal fees, and instant settlement—make XRP a unique asset in the space. The Road Ahead While exact timelines remain speculative, XRP’s upward potential is increasingly difficult to ignore. With momentum building, a clearer regulatory path emerging, and influential analysts like BarriC laying out structured price trajectories, XRP holders may be entering a defining phase in the asset’s journey. If BarriC’s forecast proves accurate, today’s $2.20 price tag may soon be seen as a historical bargain. Whether through altseason speculation or utility-based adoption, XRP appears poised for a dramatic repricing—and investors are watching closely.

Most altcoins have also taken a breather after the weekend gains, aside from SOL, which continues its gradual ascent. BTC Dominance Above 60% The primary cryptocurrency began the previous trading week on the wrong foot, with its price dumping twice to a five-month low of just over $74,000. This came after the rising political tension between the US and essentially the rest of the world. After Trump eased off the tariffs against every other nation except for China on Wednesday, BTC went on the run and skyrocketed past $83,000. This rally was also supported by favorable US CPI data. The asset faced some more volatility by the end of the trading week, due to new moves on the China-US Trade War front, but managed to recover the losses by the weekend and entered it at $83,000. It actually climbed on Saturday and Sunday morning to an 11-day peak of $86,000 where it faced a rejection. As of now, BTC trades at just under $85,000, which marks a 12.7% weekly surge. Its market cap has risen above $1.680 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is at 60.5% there and 63.4% on TradingView. Such high levels were last seen back in 2021. Bitcoin Dominance on TradingView OM Crashes The big news from the altcoin space today came from Mantra, as the project’s native token crashed by over 90% at one point. The CEO explained that the painful market moves ‘were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders.’ Most larger-cap alts are also slightly in the red, but nothing close to the OM decline. XRP, BNB, DOGE, ADA, TON, and LINK have marked minor losses, while TRX and SOL are up by around 3% each. As a result, TRX trades above $0.25, while SOL is close to $135. ETH has gained just over 1% over the past 24 hours, and stands above $1,600. The total crypto market cap has failed to overcome the $2.9 trillion obstacle and is down by $20 billion since yesterday.

Valued at approximately $775,000, the purchase was executed on April 12 using USDC, according to onchain data from Arkham Intelligence. The SEI acquisition was made by one of WLFI’s active trading wallets, which has previously been used to amass a wide range of tokens. WLFI’s current portfolio is broad, featuring staples like Bitcoin and Ether, alongside a mix of altcoins including Tron (TRX), Avalanche (AVAX), Ondo Finance (ONDO), and now Sei. Yet despite the diversification, performance is lagging. Data from blockchain analyst Lookonchain reveals that WLFI has spent a total of $346.8 million across 11 tokens—without turning a profit on any. Its Ethereum exposure alone is down over $114 million, with the full portfolio reportedly underwater by $145.8 million. A Social Media Misfire The poor timing of some investments has drawn attention, especially after Eric Trump’s controversial February 3 post on X, where he encouraged followers to buy Ether. “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH,” he wrote. The original version of the post included the phrase “you can thank me later,” which was later deleted . Unfortunately for those who followed the suggestion, ETH has since nosedived. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $1,611—down a staggering 55% from its $2,879 close on the day of Eric’s tweet, according to CoinGecko. WLFI’s Stablecoin USD1 Raises Red Flags Meanwhile, WLFI’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD1, is beginning to gain visibility. Its logo has quietly surfaced on Coinbase, Binance, and CoinMarketCap—fueling speculation about a possible launch campaign. But the political response has been far from quiet . During an April 2 hearing, Representative Maxine Waters accused Donald Trump of plotting to push USD1 as a replacement for the U.S. dollar in federal transactions, from Social Security to tax payments. Republican Representative French Hill echoed those concerns, warning that any legislation permitting a sitting president to control a stablecoin could be disastrous. “We must not allow policy to be shaped around personal financial gain,” Hill said. As WLFI’s influence grows, so does the political scrutiny —and with it, the tension over who controls the future of money.

According to the reputed platforms and community pages, various top exchanges are set to launch this token this April, raising the expectation from the PAWS token price. Let’s discuss the key details of the launch, airdrop, token price, and other information. PAWS Airdrop Listing Date, Allocation, and Other Key Details PAWS, a renowned Telegram mini-app, is launching its Solana meme coin on April 16, 2025. After much anticipation and delays, the token is finally going live with a massive PAWS airdrop. Various popular crypto exchanges like KuCoin, Bybit, and others are supporting the token and are all set to list the token on April 16. According to the official PAWS announcement, 62.5% of the token supply is allocated to the users. Interestingly, the allocation and eligibility criteria for the PAWS Coin distribution have already been revealed to the investors, per a CoinGape blog. More importantly, the platform has raised more than $2 billion from investors to support the token launch. With that, the eyes are now on the PAWS token and the potential price at launch. What will be the PAWS Token Price at Launch? Since the PAWS Coin airdrop allocation stats have been revealed, investors have been waiting for the launch. Although the details around the PAWS token price at launch are uncertain, experts and the PAWS community anticipate it to come around $0.2 or $0.5. Experts even anticipate the price to go higher, but the crypto’s meme coin status limits the possibility. Besides, a significant rally is expected under the influence of the exchange listing. However, the US-China trade war could affect the performance. More importantly, the aidrop-fueled volatility could break the bullish momentum. Interestingly, despite the odds, it is one of the best crypto airdrops in 2025.

Billions of dollars in BTC, ETH, and USDT move across these platforms as users try their luck on virtual blackjack tables and slot machines. The popularity of these digital casinos stems from their ability to streamline the traditional online casino model with cryptocurrency payments, less extensive KYC procedures, and faster payouts. The crypto casino market is vast, and finding a platform that meets specific needs can be overwhelming. Fortunately, a select few platforms combine substantial sign-up bonuses, numerous games, excellent customer support, and rapid payouts. This guide introduces the top 5 crypto casinos for 2025 and explains why they provide users with a superior blockchain gambling experience. Sign Up Today For A Welcome Package Up To $2,500 Top 5 Online Crypto Casinos The Top 5 Crypto Casinos in 2025 Reviewed 1. Cloudbet Cloudbet is arguably the most established and respected crypto casino on the market. Launched in 2013, it was a trailblazer in blockchain-based gambling. Since then, the platform has significantly expanded its game selection, improved its interface, and dramatically increased the number of accepted cryptocurrencies. The crypto casino market has changed considerably since 2013, driven by substantial trading volume and the increasing global adoption of cryptocurrencies. Cloudbet has maintained its leading position by consistently improving its services and adapting to evolving market conditions. Cloudbet offers over 3,000 different games, ranging from live dealers to slots, gameshows, and roulette. All the games are provably fair. This diverse selection caters to both serious gamblers and those looking to place casual bets. Arguably, Cloudbet’s most valuable features include a $2,500 welcome package, no minimum deposit, a withdrawal limit of $2,200 without KYC, unlimited withdrawals for VIPs, and a user-friendly interface. These elements contribute to an accessible and rewarding gaming experience. In addition to these benefits, Cloudbet is fully licensed and offers 24/7 customer service chat. This is particularly valuable for newcomers to crypto casinos who may require support, and it adds a touch of professionalism to the site . Sign Up Today For A Welcome Package Up To $2,500 2.TG Casino Launched in 2023, TG Casino is among the first crypto casinos to integrate with Telegram. The platform capitalizes on Telegram’s popularity within the crypto trading and investment community to create an interconnected digital gambling ecosystem. Users interact with the platform through a Telegram bot, which assists with account setup and initial deposits. Beyond the Telegram integration, this crypto casino offers several features that make it a notable option. These include 200% rakeback on bets and up to 50 free spins. While this sign-up offer is less substantial than Cloudbet’s $2,500, it remains a competitive incentive. The site also features a near-instant sign-up process, with extensive KYC only required for users withdrawing significant cryptocurrency amounts. Furthermore, the platform provides access to a broad range of sports betting options and has established a partnership with the Italian football club AC Milan. 3.Cryptorino Cryptorino emphasizes near-instant sign-ups with minimal KYC requirements. The platform provides an anonymous gambling experience, featuring a 100% sign-up bonus and opportunities for weekly cashback rewards. Users can sign up with an email address or crypto wallet and access hundreds of different games, including live casino options and automated games. With over 6,000 slot games available, the primary selling point of Cryptorino is its rapid sign-up and immediate access to its extensive game library. Users should be aware that Cryptorino does not hold a gambling license, which may be a security concern for some, especially those wagering substantial sums of cryptocurrency. 4.1WIN 1WIN, established in 2018, has expanded its platform significantly in recent years, adding thousands of new games and offers. The platform maintains a professional aesthetic, and new users can receive up to a 200% sign-up bonus. The site is accessible in over ten languages, and its official gambling license provides reassurance to more cautious players. The casino boasts over 7,000 games, ensuring a wide variety of options for all users. Additionally, it is fully optimized for PC, Android, and iOS devices, although the mobile experience can feel slightly cramped on smaller screens. An interesting feature offered by 1WIN is the 30% cashback on losses, available weekly for users experiencing a streak of unfavorable outcomes. Furthermore, the site has a reliable customer service system and numerous positive reviews. One of the potential issues with the site is that the registration process is considerably more time-consuming than on Cloudbet and Cryptorino. 5.Instant Casino Instant Casino offers a variety of live games, slots, and a well-designed website. The platform claims to process withdrawals almost instantly and provides very high betting limits for those looking to place larger wagers. Arguably, these features are intended to compensate for some of the casino’s shortcomings, including the absence of 24/7 customer support and a game selection that is limited compared to its direct competitors. Registering with the site requires an email address, and deposits can be made using Apple Pay, Google Pay, Visa, Mastercard, and Bitcoin. Interestingly, the site claims to process bank card withdrawals faster than BTC, with bank transfers processed instantly and crypto payments taking up to 48 hours. Overall, Instant Casino provides a decent range of games and a solid website design, but its limited game library and, for crypto casino enthusiasts, the restricted number of crypto deposit options may be discouraging. How to Sign Up for a Crypto Casino? Generally, signing up for a crypto casino is a straightforward process that can be completed with the following steps: Choose a Crypto Casino: Select a reputable platform with favorable reviews, a valid gaming license, and a diverse range of games, ensuring it supports the desired cryptocurrencies. Create an Account: Register on the casino’s website by providing the required information, such as an email address or crypto wallet details, depending on the casino’s requirements. Sign Up Here For A Welcome Package Up To $2,500 Deposit Crypto: Transfer cryptocurrency to the casino’s provided wallet address from a personal crypto wallet, allowing for funds to be used for betting. Start Playing: Explore the casino’s game selection, place bets, and engage in the available gambling activities. Withdraw Winnings: Request a withdrawal to a personal cryptocurrency wallet by specifying the desired amount and wallet address, adhering to the casino’s withdrawal policies. Final Thoughts on the Top 5 Crypto Casinos in 2025 The crypto casino market has grown into a multi-billion-dollar pillar of the gaming industry. The potential of crypto to enhance online casinos is evident with faster deposits and withdrawals, along with the ability to operate with greater privacy. While many crypto casinos launched in recent years have attempted to carve out a portion of this expanding market, platforms that have spent years refining their model remain the dominant forces in the industry. Cloudbet remains a top choice due to its $2,500 welcome package, professional customer service, extensive range of deposit options, and rapid withdrawals. Sign Up Today For A Welcome Package Up To $2,500 FAQs Which is the best crypto casino? Determining the “best” crypto casino depends on individual preferences. However, Cloudbet is often cited as a leading choice due to its established reputation, extensive game selection, and substantial welcome package. It combines a user-friendly interface with reliable customer support and a wide array of cryptocurrency deposit options, making it a strong contender for those seeking a comprehensive crypto gambling experience. How Do Crypto Casinos Work? Crypto casinos function similarly to traditional online casinos, but they use cryptocurrencies for deposits, withdrawals, and betting. Users create accounts, deposit crypto into their casino wallets, and then use these funds to play various games like slots, poker, or blackjack. Winnings are also paid out in cryptocurrencies. Where can you buy crypto for online crypto casinos? Cryptocurrencies for online gambling can be purchased from various cryptocurrency exchanges. Popular options include Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and KuCoin. These exchanges allow users to buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DOGE using fiat currencies or other cryptos.",Crypto News|Press Release|casino wallets|Crypto casino|CRYPTOCURRENCY|gambling,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-04-14 09:12:44

According to an X post by the exchange on Monday, OM price has crashed alarmingly due to massive cross-exchange liquidations. Meanwhile, other on-chain trackers have also highlighted massive token dumps into exchanges, which rationalizes the ongoing price slump. OM token exchanged hands at $0.7162 at the time of reporting, erasing nearly 90% intraday. Binance Issues Statement Amid Mantra (OM) Price Crash of 90%, Here’s What Traders Should Know Binance revealed in an X post on Monday, April 14, that it is aware of the severe price crash witnessed by Mantra. The CEX informed that its initial findings conclude – “this crash is primarily attributed to cross-exchange liquidations.” Since October of last year, the cryptocurrency exchange titan has implemented various risk control measures, such as reducing the leverage levels with regard to the OM token to protect its users from various market risks. Besides, since January of this year, the CEX has also issued a pop-up warning for this token on the spot trading page to inform users of the change in tokenomics. Notably, the CEX underlined that Mantra’s supply has increased since the beginning of this year, which is an alarming factor when observing price movements. Overall, Binance’s recent release has offered traders and investors clarity on factors fueling the token’s current price slump. Why Is Mantra (OM) Price Falling? As mentioned above, Mantra’s price has fallen nearly 90%, even hitting an intraday bottom at $0.4222. This price crash is primarily attributable to massive OM selling, liquidations, and the project facing rug-pull allegations. Tracker Lookonchain revealed in an X post that at least 17 wallets deposited $227 million worth of tokens into exchanges right before the price crashed recently. These massive dumps totaled nearly 4.5% of the asset’s circulating supply. Subsequently, the price slump led to $66.97 million worth of liquidations in the past 12 hours, adding severe heat to the price. When coupled with Binance’s recent update on the matter, these factors triggered a highly bearish sentiment for the coin among investors. Crypto Trader Loses $3.3M Amid Price Slump Besides, a crypto trader got slammed with an alarming $3.3 million loss due to the recent price crash. Going by the name JB on X, this trader revealed that his initial investment of $3.5 million is now worth merely $200,000 due to the 90% drop. “My intention was to support the future of RWAs,” the trader added, although the current scenario remains contrary. CoinGape reported that Mantra’s team blamed “reckless liquidations” as the primary reason for the price crash. Meanwhile, another report revealed that crypto traders lost nearly $400 million amid the OM price crash. Altogether, broader market sentiments orbiting the coin remain highly bearish, with Binance’s update only fueling the fire more.

In a recent post, Ardoino announced that the stablecoin firm has seen an increase in its user base throughout the first quarter of 2025. To commemorate the growth, he posted a meme from the long-running U.S. animated series, The Simpsons. In the picture posted by Ardoino, USDT ( USDT ) is the coffee being poured from a jug into a cup held by Lisa Simpson, who represents Tether stablecoin users receiving more USDT in their on-chain wallets. “Number of USDT users grew 13% in Q1/2025,” wrote Ardoino in his recent post .

However, the firm has yet to reveal the exact number of users it approximately has as of Q1 2025. At press time, Tether remains the largest stablecoin firm by market cap with $144 billion. It ranks in third place just below Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) on the overall crypto leaderboard. Meanwhile, its competitor Circle ( USDC ) is in 7th place, with $60 billion in market cap, less than half of USDT’s market cap.

The recent surge in USDT users could be attributed to the economic uncertainty triggered by President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day blanket tariffs on products entering the U.S . Since then, Trump has declared a 90-day pause on tariffs affecting more than 180 countries and region, with the exception of China. Stablecoins provide users with a safe haven asset to store their funds, one that is evidently less volatile compared to other crypto assets. Therefore, many users have chosen to swap their crypto and fiat into stablecoins to protect it from market volatility. Most recently, Bloomberg published a report that highlighted how wealthy Indonesians have begun purchasing more USDT in recent months as a way to cope with concern regarding the economic uncertainty. According to the report, one private banker said Indonesians with a net worth ranging from $100 million and $400 million have invested 10% of their assets into crypto. On April 9, the Indonesian rupiah fell to near its record low, around Rp16,957 per dollar following tariff tensions. Since the beginning of March, trading for the USDT-rupiah pair, now contributes to more than a quarter of the Indonesian crypto exchange Tokocrypto’s daily volumes, according to the firm’s chief marketing officer, Wan Iqbal.

In a new video update, crypto strategist Jason Pizzino tells his 350,000 YouTube subscribers that returns on the top crypto asset by market cap are slimming down as its price continues to grow. Pizzino says that since hitting a bottom in November of 2022, BTC has printed two huge rallies, and if a third one were to play out, Bitcoin could print a new record high. “In this cycle, we haven’t seen the big pump moves that we’ve seen in the past. We’ve seen two $60,000 moves, almost to the dollar, which is pretty incredible when you consider that this has gone even more global, yet the markets tend to repeat things time and time again. The first move out of the low at $15,000 to the top at $74,000, [a rise of] roughly about $58,000. The next move from the next significant low like we saw in August of 2024 to the current peak, [a rise of] $60,001… Let’s have a look at where [a gain of] $60,000 takes the market from the current low, if in fact this is the low itself. Well, that’s all we got to work with [and] $60,000 takes us somewhere around $130,000.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube However, Pizzino notes that the gains are getting “quite finite” as BTC becomes bigger in market cap, and that the risk is now much higher compared to the early stages of the cycle. “If you’ve been in here for a while, maybe even from the earlier cycles and you’re looking at the price now, you’re potentially up thousands of percent. If you got in in 2023…maybe you’re up a few hundred percent. But if you’re getting in now, this is a time where you really need to have those stops in play because from this price up… the game is really becoming quite finite. It doesn’t mean that you can’t make money from it, but the returns are obviously getting slimmer on the way up even with those $60,000 moves… It’s not necessarily the game has changed now, there are just a lot more eyeballs on it, and you need a lot more money going into it to get to those prices.” Bitcoin is trading for $84,679 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

Recently, Ripple and the US SEC filed a joint motion after their mutual settlement, with both parties urging the Appeals Court to hold the Appeals in “Abeyance.” However, in a recent X post, a renowned figure in the XRP community, “All Things XRP” shared his thoughts on the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit. In other words, the XRP influencer has sounded an alert to the Ripple investors, urging them to have a realistic outlook on the future of the crypto. Experts Share Realistic Outlook On Ripple Vs SEC Lawsuit All Things XRP cautioned that those expecting XRP to “moon” right after the lawsuit ends may already be behind the curve. According to him, the price impact of a lawsuit victory has likely been already “priced in” by the market. He emphasized that XRP price’s future growth hinges on Ripple’s next steps, such as partnerships, product expansion, and utility-based developments. “That’s where the action will be,” he wrote, suggesting that post-case developments, not the legal outcome, would drive long-term price growth. Other Factors At Play A fellow community member questioned this logic, asking how XRP once hit $3.40 but now struggles to cross $2.20. The influencer responded by stating there are “other factors at play,” hinting at broader market conditions and macroeconomic dynamics. Meanwhile, some believe a short-term pump could occur after a legal win. However, others agree with the view that lasting gains depend on adoption and utility. One user, XRP Moon Shot, commented that ETFs and real-world use cases will be the true catalysts. All Things XRP endorsed this sentiment, calling it a “fair call.” XRP Price Dips: What Lies Ahead? XRP price today fell more than 1.5% and exchanged hands at $2.13 while its one-day volume rose 23% to $4.48 billion. Despite the recent positive developments, it appears that Ripple’s coin has failed to witness a massive breakout, suggesting that investors are still trading cautiously amid the macroeconomic woes. However, a recent Ripple price analysis cited the top three reasons why Standard Chartered has set a target of $5.5 for the asset by 2025 end. This article has also cited XRP case resolution as one of the key reasons that could help drive the prices higher. Simultaneously, the recent successful launch of the US XRP ETF has further fueled market optimism. Notably, the Teucrium XRP ETF recorded a 5-day inflow streak through Friday last week, reflecting a steady demand from the traders. The post XRP Case Resolution Near?

The DOJ announced that it will no longer pursue criminal enforcement actions that effectively impose regulatory frameworks on digital asset companies. According to a new memorandum entitled “Ending Regulation by Prosecution,” the policy prioritized crypto fraud and the use of digital assets to commit terrorism, drug trafficking, computer crime and human smuggling. Prosecutors will not charge “regulatory violations” involving digital assets. Trump Directs Federal Agencies to Promote Open Access to Blockchain Networks and Banking Services In a memorandum , the DOJ announced a significant policy shift, saying it would no longer pursue criminal enforcement actions that effectively impose regulatory frameworks on digital asset companies. The DOJ’s memorandum criticizes the previous administration's “reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution” and formalizes its support for President Trump’s Executive Order 14178 (“Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology.”) The policy shifts the DOJ’s focus to “end the regulatory weaponization against digital assets, "" reorienting its investigations and prosecution on defendants who cause financial harm to digital asset investors, consumers, and individuals who use digital assets to aid in criminal conduct. The memorandum essentially enforces Trump’s Executive Order 14178 and articulates the DOJ’s task under the EO. Emphasizing the Value of Digital Assets In the introduction of the memorandum, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche highlights the importance of the digital asset industry, explaining: “The digital assets industry is critical to the Nation's economic development and innovation. Thus, as noted in Executive Order 14178, clarity and certainty regarding enforcement policy ""are essential to supporting a vibrant and inclusive digital economy and innovation in digital assets."" President Trump has also made clear that ""[w]e are going to end the regulatory weaponization against digital assets."" The memorandum underscores that the DOJ is not a digital assets regulator, noting “the prior Administration used the Justice Department to pursue a reckless strategy of regulation by prosecution, which was ill conceived and poorly executed.” Blanche notes the DOJ “will no longer pursue litigation or enforcement actions that have the effect of superimposing regulatory frameworks on digital assets while President Trump's actual regulators do this work outside the punitive criminal justice framework.” In pivoting away from the DOJ under the previous administration, this DOJ’s investigations and prosecutions involving digital assets will: “…focus on prosecuting individuals who victimize digital asset investors, or those who use digital assets in furtherance of criminal offenses such as terrorism, narcotics and human trafficking, organized crime, hacking, and cartel and gang financing.” Digital Assets Enforcement Priorities Under EO 14178 According to the memorandum, Executive Order 14178 tasks the DOJ and others with: “…protecting and promoting"" (1) ""the ability of individual citizens and private-sector entities alike to access and use for lawful purposes open public blockchain networks without persecution""; and (2) ""fair and open access to banking services for all law-abiding individual citizens and private-sector entities alike.” In accordance with its task, the DOJ will no longer engage in regulation by prosecution. Specifically, the DOJ should cease targeting “virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and offline wallets for the acts of their end users or unwitting violations of regulations” unless the prosecution satisfies criteria noted later in the memorandum. Put simply, the DOJ will prioritize investigation and prosecutions involving defendants who cause (a) financial harms to digital asset investors and consumers and (b) use digital assets to further other crimes. However, DOJ prosecutors can no longer charge “regulatory violation” involving digital assets unless there is evidence that defendants “knew of the licensing or registration requirement at issue and violated such a requirement wilfully.” Prosecutors are also directed not to charge violations of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Commodity Exchange Act, or the implementation of regulations, at least if alternative charges are available. Narrowing of the DOJ’s Enforcement Policy The Deputy AG describes a “narrowing” of the DOJ’s enforcement policy relating to digital assets. Consistent with its reduced role, the memorandum directs the Market Integrity and Major Frauds (MIMF) Unit in the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section to cease crypto enforcement. The memorandum also requires disbanding the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) . While the memorandum narrows the DOJ’s enforcement policy, it does, however, provide that the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) continue providing guidance and training to DOJ personnel and act as liaisons to the digital assets industry.

Nine individuals have been sentenced to prison in China for their roles in a telecom fraud scheme that defrauded over 66,000 victims in India, according to a report by The Global Times. The group stole 517 million Indian rupees (about $6.2 million) by operating fake investment platforms and using false identities and was led by a man surnamed He, who started the operation in May 2023 by renting office space in Shandong Province. He recruited team members and set up overseas servers as well as handled contact with Indian companies and coordinated the flow of stolen funds. He stated that the group lured Indians through messaging, promising monthly returns of 8-15% on 1,000-rupee (around $12) investments via the so-called SENEE platform.

The report doesn’t say which platforms the scammers used to cash out. One of the scammers, surnamed Li, portrayed herself as a “wealthy Indian woman” who achieved success through fund investments, the report reads. The group also created fake documents and websites to appear legitimate, what the Chinese court described as a “sophisticated criminal syndicate marked by professional organization,” the report reads. The sentences range from five years to nearly 15 years in prison, along with fines.

Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet continued its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy by adding 319 BTC to its treasury and aiming for 10,000 BTC by year-end. Mechanism Capital’s Andrew Kang also recently doubled his Bitcoin long position to $200 million after Trump’s pro-crypto comments and a surprise tariff pause. WLFI Expands Altcoin Holdings The Trump family-backed cryptocurrency project, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), added 4.89 million SEI tokens to its digital asset portfolio. The purchase was valued at close to $775,000. On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence reveals that the SEI acquisition was executed on April 12 using USDC transferred from WLFI’s main wallet to one of its trading wallets. This address is linked to other altcoin investments by the project as well. World Liberty Financial crypto holdings (Source: Arkham Intelligence ) WLFI is making it a top priority to build a diversified crypto portfolio, and already holds major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins including Tron, Ondo Finance, Avalanche, and now Sei. Despite these investments, the project has not seen returns on any of its positions. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain , WLFI spent around $346.8 million on 11 different tokens, with its Ethereum holdings alone currently showing a loss of over $114 million. In total, the portfolio is down by approximately $145.8 million. This latest update happened just two months after Eric Trump, the son of President Donald Trump, encouraged followers to buy Ethereum in a Feb. 3 social media post . Originally, the post contained the phrase “you can thank me later,” but it has since been edited. Additionally, the WLFI stablecoin USD1 seems to be gaining visibility. An icon representing USD1 surfaced on major platforms including Coinbase, Binance, and CoinMarketCap, hinting at an unofficial logo reveal. However, WLFI has not made any formal announcement regarding the branding. USD1 and WLFI’s broader ambitions attracted a lot of criticism from both sides of the political aisle. During an April 2 US House Financial Services Committee hearing on stablecoin regulation, Democratic Representative Maxine Waters warned that Trump may seek to replace the US dollar with his own stablecoin for federal payments. Republican committee chair French Hill is just as concerned, and warned that without clear measures preventing a sitting president from owning a stablecoin business, he could not support any legislation that enables such power. Metaplanet Buys More Bitcoin World Liberty Financial is not the only company stocking up on crypto. Japan-based investment firm Metaplanet Inc. continued its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, and announced the purchase of an additional 319 BTC for 3.779 billion yen, or approximately $26.3 million USD. The latest acquisition was made at an average price of around $82,549 per Bitcoin, and raised the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 4,525 BTC. This brings the total valuation of its Bitcoin portfolio to about 58.145 billion yen, or $386.3 million. The announcement was shared on April 14, 2025, and it reflects Metaplanet’s strategic commitment to Bitcoin as a core component of its treasury operations. This program formally began in April of 2024. Since then, the Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed company used a mix of equity and debt financing to build its Bitcoin reserves. Metaplanet Bitcoin acquisition announcement (Source: Metaplanet ) A key internal metric used by Metaplanet to assess its performance is BTC Yield, which measures the change in Bitcoin holdings relative to its fully diluted share count. For the first quarter of 2025, the firm reported a BTC Yield of 95.6%, with 6.5% of that growth occurring between April 1 and April 14 alone. This builds on its performance in prior quarters, including a 41.7% increase in Q3 of 2024 and a dramatic 309.8% surge in Q4 of 2024. To support its acquisitions, Metaplanet implemented a structured financing approach involving multiple tranches of stock acquisition rights and zero-coupon bonds issued via third-party allotments, primarily to EVO FUND. Since January 2025, the company issued 21 million shares across five tranches as part of its expanded “210 Million Plan,” which replaced its earlier “21m Plan.” These issuances were structured with a 0% discount and flexible pricing tied to market conditions. Metaplanet has also redeemed several of its bonds early. The firm most recently issued significant share volumes through its 14th and 17th series stock acquisition rights, delivering 8.6 million and 4.2 million shares respectively. With 41.7% of the “210 Million Plan” now exercised, Metaplanet has raised over 35 billion yen through this initiative. The company has set an ambitious target of 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and ultimately aims to hold 21,000 BTC, a goal that would place it among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. Andrew Kang Doubles Down on Bitcoin Andrew Kang, the founder of crypto investment firm Mechanism Capital, recently increased his bullish stance on Bitcoin by adding another $100 million to his existing long position, bringing the total to $200 million. This is according to on-chain data analyzed by Arkham Intelligence . The new leveraged position comes with an estimated profit or loss range of $6.8 million. Kang initially entered the first $100 million long trade on April 9, shortly after President Donald Trump took to Truth Social with a post declaring , “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.” That same day, the Trump administration announced a surprise 90-day pause on its newly implemented global tariff regime, which sent both cryptocurrency and stock markets sharply higher. Kang interpreted the combination of trade war easing and Trump’s public support for markets as the ideal catalyst for Bitcoin to break out of a months-long downtrend. In a post on April 12, Kang referred to the so-called “Trump put”—the idea that the president will act to support markets—as a key factor in his bullish thesis. He described the administration’s tariff capitulation as a trigger that could reverse Bitcoin’s negative price momentum. However, the political fallout from Trump’s April 9 post continues to grow. On April 11, Senate Democrats sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) urging an investigation into potential insider trading and market manipulation. They alleged that Trump’s social media post may have preemptively hinted at the tariff pause to come. BTC’s price action over the past 7 days (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Bitcoin’s price action remained volatile as traders tried to make sense of the shifting trade policy. Over the past 24 hours, BTC’s price rose slightly by 0.34%. As a result, the crypto king was worth about $84,541 at press time.

Recent news from South Korea sends a clear message to unregistered virtual asset service providers (VASPs). In a decisive move, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of South Korea has blocked access to 14 mobile apps on Apple’s App Store. This crackdown targets foreign crypto exchanges operating without proper registration in the country, signaling a firm stance on regulatory compliance within the digital asset space. Crackdown on Unregistered Crypto Apps: What Happened? On April 14th, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), operating under South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC), took action against 14 mobile applications listed on Apple’s App Store. These apps were found to be operated by foreign virtual asset service providers (VASPs) that had not registered with the Korean authorities. Among the affected platforms are well-known names in the crypto sphere, such as KuCoin and MEXC, as reported by Newsis. This is not an isolated incident; it follows a similar operation on March 25th, where the FIU blocked 17 unregistered crypto apps on the Google Play Store. This consistent effort underscores the FIU’s commitment to enforcing crypto regulations Korea and protecting its market. Why is South Korea Taking Such Strong Action? South Korea is known for its stringent approach to financial regulations, and the cryptocurrency sector is no exception. The primary reasons behind these blocks are: Regulatory Compliance: South Korea requires all VASPs operating within its jurisdiction to register with the FIU. This registration process is designed to ensure that these platforms adhere to local laws, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures. Investor Protection: By blocking unregistered exchanges, the FIU aims to protect Korean investors from potential risks associated with platforms that do not comply with local regulations. Unregistered platforms may lack the necessary safeguards to protect user funds and data. Market Integrity: Enforcing registration helps maintain the integrity of the South Korean crypto market. It ensures a level playing field for registered domestic exchanges and prevents unfair competition from unregistered foreign entities. National Security: Compliance with AML and KYC regulations is crucial for preventing illicit activities and safeguarding national financial security. Unregistered platforms can be exploited for money laundering and other illegal operations. Impact of the Korean Crypto Crackdown on Users and Exchanges This recent Korean crypto crackdown has several implications for both users and crypto exchanges: For Users: Access Restrictions: Korean users may find themselves unable to access the blocked apps on the Apple App Store. This can disrupt their trading activities and potentially lock them out of their accounts if they primarily use these mobile apps. Increased Awareness: These actions serve as a strong reminder for users to be cautious about the platforms they use and to prioritize registered and compliant exchanges. Potential Shift to Registered Platforms: Users may be compelled to migrate to registered Korean crypto exchanges to ensure uninterrupted access and regulatory compliance. For Unregistered Exchanges: Operational Challenges: Being blocked from app stores significantly hinders their ability to reach Korean users. Mobile apps are a primary channel for user acquisition and engagement in the crypto space. Reputational Damage: Being labeled as “unregistered” and “blocked” can damage the reputation of these exchanges in the eyes of users and the broader crypto community. Financial Losses: Reduced user base and trading activity in South Korea can lead to financial losses for these exchanges. Pressure to Comply: This action puts significant pressure on unregistered foreign exchanges to either register with the FIU or cease operations targeting Korean users. Apple App Store Crypto Ban: A Growing Trend? While this action is specific to South Korea’s regulatory landscape, it raises questions about the role of app stores in the regulation of crypto services. The Apple App Store crypto ban in Korea highlights the increasing scrutiny that crypto platforms are facing from regulatory bodies worldwide. App stores, as gatekeepers to mobile users, are becoming important points of enforcement for national regulations. This could potentially set a precedent for other jurisdictions to follow suit, leveraging app stores to enforce their own crypto regulations. South Korea FIU Crypto Regulations: What’s Next? The FIU’s actions are ongoing and proactive. Beyond blocking apps, the agency is actively: Identifying Unregistered Exchanges: The FIU continues to monitor the market to identify other unregistered foreign exchanges operating in South Korea. Advising Registered Platforms: The FIU is advising registered virtual asset service providers (VASPs) against engaging with unregistered platforms, further isolating non-compliant entities. Notifying Law Enforcement: The FIU is also notifying law enforcement agencies about the activities of unregistered exchanges, which could lead to further legal actions and investigations. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the FIU’s commitment to maintaining a regulated and secure crypto environment in South Korea. The message is clear: operating in South Korea’s crypto market requires full compliance with local regulations. Navigating the Complex Landscape of Crypto Regulations For crypto businesses and users alike, understanding and navigating the complexities of crypto regulations Korea and globally is becoming increasingly crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest regulatory developments in your jurisdiction and in key markets like South Korea. Regulatory landscapes can change rapidly. Prioritize Compliance: For crypto platforms, prioritize regulatory compliance in all jurisdictions where you operate or intend to operate. Registration and adherence to AML/KYC rules are essential. Choose Registered Platforms: For users, opt for registered and regulated crypto exchanges. This provides a greater level of security and protection. Due Diligence: Conduct thorough due diligence before using any crypto platform, especially those operating internationally. Check for their registration status and compliance history. Seek Legal Counsel: Crypto businesses should seek legal counsel to ensure they are fully compliant with all applicable regulations in their target markets. Conclusion: A Warning Shot for Unregistered Crypto Exchanges South Korea’s recent actions against unregistered crypto apps on the Apple App Store serve as a powerful warning to foreign virtual asset service providers. The FIU’s proactive and consistent enforcement of crypto regulations Korea underscores the importance of regulatory compliance in the digital asset space. As global regulatory scrutiny intensifies, exchanges must prioritize registration and adherence to local laws to operate successfully and sustainably. This move not only impacts unregistered exchanges but also shapes the behavior of users, pushing them towards compliant and secure platforms. The message is loud and clear: in South Korea, and increasingly worldwide, regulatory compliance is not optional – it’s a prerequisite for participation in the burgeoning crypto market.

His concerns aren’t just about market volatility; they point to a broader structural fragility. Interestingly, bitcoin (BTC) has been showing resilience amidst the chaos. The digital asset has broken a three-month downtrend and is approaching $85,000, signaling it may be stepping into a role as a potential alternative safe haven. Mixed signals continue from the White House on tariffs, adding to the growing uncertainty weighing on global markets. As a result, markets continue to be extremely volatile especially over the past two weeks as Trump’s tariff policies take hold. Dalio, the founder of investment giant Bridgewater, is particularly focused on the mounting U.S. debt and deficit. He argues that Congress must bring the federal deficit down to 3% of GDP, warning that the imbalance between debt supply and investor demand could cause serious dislocations, according to CNBC. That’s already playing out in the bond market, where U.S. Treasury yields are climbing. The 10-year sits just under 4.5%, while the 30-year is hovering just below 5%. These elevated yields are rattling markets and could force the Federal Reserve to step in in order to calm markets. Dalio also warns that tariff uncertainty is feeding into broader macro instability. The U.S. dollar, as measured by the DXY index , has now fallen below 100 for the first time in years — a potential sign of capital flight from the country. He is calling for a comprehensive trade deal with China and a currency adjustment to strengthen the yuan, aiming to stabilize a system that’s looking increasingly fragile, according to the report. In a sobering comparison, Dalio likens today’s risks to those seen during the U.S. exit from the gold standard in 1971 and the global financial crisis in 2008, according to the report. Both were inflection points that reshaped the financial system.

New survey data reveals a growing sense of unease among Korean crypto holders, with nearly half anticipating a US recession this year. This sentiment is casting a shadow over Bitcoin price predictions and overall crypto market sentiment, signaling potential volatility ahead. Let’s dive into the key findings of this revealing survey and explore what it means for the future of crypto investments. US Recession Looms Large in South Korean Crypto Investors’ Minds The survey, conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos from April 7th to 11th, polled 2,000 South Korean individuals deeply invested in the cryptocurrency market. A striking 48.9% of these South Korean crypto investors are bracing for a US recession to hit within this year. Adding to the concern, another 39.0% believe the recession will strike next year. This paints a picture of widespread apprehension about the global economic landscape and its potential ripple effects on the digital asset space. Here’s a breakdown of what South Korean crypto investors are predicting regarding the US economic outlook: 48.9% foresee a US recession in 2024 . 39.0% anticipate a US recession in 2025 . 7.6% believe the crypto market will be independent of a US recession. 4.6% do not expect a US recession at all. This data clearly indicates that a significant majority of South Korean crypto investors are factoring a US recession into their investment strategies and market outlook. Bitcoin Price Prediction : A Week of Uncertainty The survey also delved into short-term Bitcoin price prediction sentiment among these investors. While some remain optimistic, the overall outlook has become more cautious compared to the previous week. Here’s a comparison of Bitcoin price prediction sentiment week-over-week: Sentiment This Week (%) Last Week (%) Increase/Significant Jump 24.6% 35.1% Stable Market 19.5% 39.1% Decline/Sharp Drop 56.1% 25.9% As you can see, the percentage of South Korean crypto investors expecting a decline or sharp drop in Bitcoin’s value this week has more than doubled, jumping from 25.9% to a concerning 56.1%. Conversely, optimism has waned significantly, with those predicting an increase or jump decreasing from 35.1% to 24.6%. The stable market prediction also saw a sharp decline, suggesting increased anticipation of market movement, albeit largely negative. Crypto Market Sentiment : Fear Grips Investors Reflecting the economic anxieties and Bitcoin price uncertainty, the overall crypto market sentiment among South Korean crypto investors is leaning heavily towards fear. A substantial 62.2% of respondents expressed feelings of fear or extreme fear regarding the current market conditions. Optimism, on the other hand, is in short supply. Let’s break down the current crypto market sentiment : Fear/Extreme Fear: 62.2% Optimism/Extreme Optimism: 21.1% Neutral: 16.7% This overwhelming sense of fear underscores the prevailing uncertainty in the crypto market and the impact of broader economic uncertainty , particularly the looming threat of a US recession . This cautious crypto market sentiment could influence trading behaviors and investment decisions in the short term. Economic Uncertainty and Tariff Tensions Fuel Recession Fears The survey highlights that economic uncertainty , exacerbated by ongoing tariff tensions, is a key driver behind the recession predictions. These global factors are undoubtedly weighing heavily on investor confidence, not just in traditional markets, but also in the relatively nascent and volatile cryptocurrency space. The interconnectedness of the global economy means that a US recession , should it materialize, would likely have far-reaching consequences, impacting markets worldwide, including South Korea and its crypto investor base. Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors: Prepare for Volatility: The survey data suggests increased market volatility in the short term. Investors should be prepared for potential price swings and adjust their strategies accordingly. Risk Management is Crucial: With fear dominating market sentiment, prudent risk management becomes paramount. Diversification and careful position sizing are more important than ever. Stay Informed: Keeping abreast of macroeconomic developments, particularly news related to the US economy and potential recession indicators, is vital for informed decision-making in the crypto market. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term sentiment is cautious, remember the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies. Market downturns can present opportunities for strategic accumulation for investors with a long-term outlook. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto Waters Amidst Recession Concerns The survey of South Korean crypto investors paints a clear picture of heightened anxiety and anticipation of a US recession . This sentiment is directly influencing Bitcoin price prediction expectations and driving a fearful crypto market sentiment . As economic uncertainty persists, crypto investors should exercise caution, prioritize risk management, and stay informed to navigate these potentially turbulent market conditions effectively. While fear currently dominates, understanding market sentiment and economic indicators is crucial for making informed investment decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

This formation suggests that a breakout is not only imminent but could lead to a significant upward price move, provided key resistance levels are breached. The ascending triangle pattern, characterized by a series of higher lows against a relatively flat resistance line, is typically seen as a sign of mounting buying pressure. For XRP, that horizontal ceiling currently sits around $2.22—a level that has been tested multiple times in recent sessions. Ali noted that a successful breakout above this resistance could trigger a rally toward $2.40, aligning with historical trends that often follow similar formations. $XRP is trading within an ascending triangle, with key resistance at $2.22. A breakout could spark a move toward $2.40. pic.twitter.com/bzrTYg9ps1 — Ali (@ali_charts) April 14, 2025 What the Pattern Tells Us Ascending triangles often indicate that buyers are becoming more aggressive with each dip, stepping in at increasingly higher prices. This compression against a fixed resistance can eventually lead to a breakout, driven by momentum and rising demand. In XRP’s case, the series of higher lows suggests bullish conviction is steadily growing, even amid broader market volatility. Ali’s analysis places XRP in a strong technical position, especially considering the asset’s recent performance. The $2.22 barrier has proven resilient, but a decisive move beyond it would likely attract renewed interest from short-term traders and longer-term investors looking to ride the next leg up. Volume, often a key confirming indicator for breakouts, will also be worth monitoring closely as XRP approaches this critical threshold. Market Conditions Are Lining Up Beyond chart patterns , macro, and fundamental factors may provide further fuel for a breakout. XRP continues to ride a wave of optimism stemming from legal clarity following developments in the SEC vs. Ripple case, and speculation about its increasing role in global payments infrastructure continues to drive institutional interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As more traders and analysts begin to recognize the pattern playing out on XRP’s chart, it may become a self-reinforcing signal. That’s because technical breakouts often draw algorithmic and speculative trading flows, accelerating price moves in the breakout direction. A Moment to Watch Closely Whether or not XRP decisively breaks above the $2.22 resistance will likely define the next phase of its price journey. For now, Ali’s technical analysis gives both retail investors and institutional traders a clear level to watch—and a target to consider. If the breakout is confirmed, $2.40 may only be the beginning of a broader bullish phase . But as always in crypto markets, timing and confirmation are everything.

The spotlight now shines on a lesser-known player, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Investors participating in the altcoin presale are buying MUTM tokens at $0.025 while the platform has successfully obtained $6.65 million during this phase. The ongoing presale phase now counts more than 8,200 investors whereas many buyers expect the token price to reach $0.03 when the next phase begins. Buyers during this timeframe will obtain up to 140% in profit gains once the predicted launch price of $0.06 is achieved. MUTM has the highest upside potential among these altcoins, potentially making it the breakout crypto of 2025. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors due its advanced Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending solutions is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform collected more than $6.65 million and accumulated 8,200 members in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.025 before their value will grow to $0.03 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 140% when Mutuum Finance hits its initial launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position.

Senator Tim Scott, chair of the Senate Banking Committee, has confirmed that a crypto market structure bill could be signed into law by August 2025, a timeline echoed by both industry leaders and fellow lawmakers. Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s clarification that recent tariff exemptions on electronics are only temporary further signals a broader government focus on national security and domestic industry protection. Lutnick Clarifies Trump Tariff Strategy as Volatility Grips Global Markets The United States’ approach to global trade policy remains in flux as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick walked back the recently announced reciprocal tariff exemptions on key electronics, signaling a more permanent, sector-focused strategy in the Trump administration’s ongoing trade war. The exemptions, announced in an April 12 bulletin from US Customs and Border Protection, were initially seen as a potential olive branch to ease tensions and bring stability to volatile global markets. However, during an April 13 appearance on ABC News, Lutnick clarified that the exemptions were only temporary and would remain in place for “a month or two” until the administration finalized a broader “sector tariff regime” targeting semiconductors, phones, graphics processors, and other critical computing components. “President Trump has called out pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos,” Lutnick said. “He called them sector tariffs, and those are not available for negotiation. They are just going to be part of making sure we ensure core national security items are made in this country.” Lutnick further emphasized the administration’s national security priorities, underscoring the importance of domestic manufacturing for essential items such as medicine and microchips. “We can't be relying on China for fundamental things we need. Our medicines and our semiconductors need to be built in America,” he stated. Strategic Shift or Negotiation Tactic? Lutnick’s comments have fueled speculation that the Trump administration’s tariff agenda is less a temporary tactic to influence trade talks and more a long-term strategy to realign the US industrial base. Analysts suggest this signals a geoeconomic pivot from free-market globalization to targeted onshoring of supply chains deemed essential to national security. While Lutnick did express optimism about reaching a trade agreement with China, the tone of his remarks suggested that any deal would not touch core sectors designated as off-limits by the Trump administration. The sectors in question—pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and automobiles—are not only vital to the US economy but also strategic arenas in the ongoing technological competition with China. This evolving trade stance is expected to have a profound impact on multinational corporations, supply chain logistics, and inflationary pressures. It also sets the stage for potential retaliatory measures by China and other US trading partners. The announcement and subsequent walk-back of tariff policy have contributed to growing unease in financial markets. The Volatility S&P Index (VIX), a widely tracked measure of expected stock market turbulence, remains elevated as investors brace for more policy whiplash. The situation escalated earlier this month when President Trump’s tariffs triggered a dramatic sell-off in both equity and crypto markets, erasing approximately $3.5 trillion in market value as investors fled riskier assets. The S&P 500, a bellwether for global economic sentiment, hit a volatility rating of 74 in April—surpassing even Bitcoin’s, which registered at 71, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. Markets briefly rallied on rumors of a 90-day reciprocal tariff pause, with stocks surging and roughly $2 trillion in value reentering the system. However, that optimism was quickly squashed when Trump dismissed the rumors, prompting another mass exodus of capital. When the pause was finally confirmed days later, the market rebounded once more—only to now face renewed doubt following Lutnick’s assertion that the exemptions are merely a temporary measure. Traders and institutional investors are left grappling with a landscape in which US trade policy can pivot on a dime, making it difficult to assess long-term risk. Some market participants have described this environment as “policy-induced volatility,” a term reminiscent of the 2018 trade war era, which saw similar fluctuations. Decoupling or Recalibration? Interestingly, Bitcoin has shown signs of decoupling from traditional risk assets in recent days, with price action becoming slightly more stable even as the S&P 500 lurches in both directions. This phenomenon, while still nascent, has sparked debate about whether digital assets could emerge as alternative safe-havens in the face of political and economic instability. Still, with macroeconomic pressures mounting—from inflationary shocks to supply chain disruptions—the crypto market remains vulnerable to broader sentiment shifts, especially if US policy becomes increasingly protectionist. If Lutnick’s statements are any indication, the United States is preparing for a fundamental economic shift—one that puts domestic manufacturing, national security, and technological sovereignty at the center of its trade agenda. Unlike previous trade skirmishes aimed at leveling the playing field, this iteration appears designed to rebuild the field entirely. Whether this doctrine can coexist with global supply chains and capital flows remains to be seen, but for now, it is clear that the Trump administration is doubling down on an America-first industrial policy—one that is already reshaping global markets. Senator Tim Scott Says Crypto Market Bill Likely by August as Bipartisan Momentum Builds US lawmakers are also setting their sights on a pivotal summer for cryptocurrency legislation, with Senator Tim Scott, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, expressing confidence that a comprehensive crypto market structure bill will be passed into law by August 2025. Scott's remarks, made in a recent interview with Fox News, mark a significant milestone in the years-long effort to craft a federal regulatory framework for digital assets. The senator also pointed to the committee’s advancement of the GENIUS Act in March—an ambitious regulatory bill aimed at establishing clear rules for stablecoins—as evidence of a growing focus on responsible innovation in the crypto sector. “We must innovate before we regulate — allowing innovation in the digital asset space to happen here at home is critical to American economic dominance across the globe,” Scott told Fox News. Momentum for crypto legislation continues to build on both sides of the aisle. Speaking at the Digital Assets Summit in New York City last month, Representative Ro Khanna (D-CA) echoed Senator Scott’s outlook, stating that both market structure and stablecoin bills are expected to pass in 2025. Khanna noted that approximately 70 to 80 Democrats in Congress now recognize the importance of establishing digital asset policy that encourages responsible growth, promotes technological innovation, and safeguards the role of the US dollar in a rapidly digitizing global economy. Among Democrats, support for dollar-backed stablecoins is particularly strong. According to Khanna, many lawmakers believe these digital tokens could play a vital role in boosting global demand for the US dollar by facilitating fast, low-cost, internet-based payments without relying on foreign banks or traditional infrastructure. Executive Branch Aligns with Legislative Agenda The legislative momentum is matched by strong signals from the executive branch. Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, stated at the same conference that stablecoin legislation could be signed into law within the next 60 days, further aligning with Senator Scott's August timeline for broader market structure reforms. The Trump administration has made digital asset regulation a key policy focus, emphasizing its importance for national economic security and technological leadership. President Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and crypto policy lead David Sacks have repeatedly stressed that developing clear and competitive rules for crypto is crucial for attracting capital and innovation to US-based blockchain firms. The GENIUS Act, which advanced out of committee in March, lays the groundwork for federal oversight of stablecoins, requiring issuers to maintain full reserves, provide regular audits, and register with regulatory bodies. Industry stakeholders have largely welcomed the bill as a step toward mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity. Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a leading crypto industry advocacy group, also expressed optimism that both the GENIUS Act and a broader crypto market structure bill will be passed by August. Smith praised the bipartisan approach taken by Congress, noting that it reflects growing recognition of crypto’s role in the US economy. Toward Regulatory Certainty As 2025 progresses, lawmakers appear increasingly aligned on the need to move beyond regulatory ambiguity. In past years, the absence of federal rules left US crypto firms navigating a patchwork of state regulations while competing with jurisdictions overseas that offered clearer frameworks. Now, with bipartisan support, executive alignment, and industry cooperation, there is real hope that the US could soon establish a comprehensive regulatory structure for digital assets—covering both the operation of crypto platforms and the issuance of stablecoins tied to the US dollar. If successful, this effort could help cement the United States' role as a global hub for crypto innovation while reinforcing the dollar’s dominance in a digitally connected financial world.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-14 09:30:00

These assets have long histories of performance, ecosystem strength, and institutional interest—especially during periods of consolidation. One project that’s emerging fast is MAGACOINFINANCE —a low-entry altcoin that’s generating momentum far beyond what most early-stage projects see at this phase. While traditional players like Chainlink (LINK) and Hedera (HBAR) continue providing steady infrastructure value, MAGACOINFINANCE is rising on raw trader interest and real-time volume increases. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! MAGACOINFINANCE – Building Momentum Before the Crowd Arrives MAGACOINFINANCE is proving that smart money moves early. The project already sold out Stage 6 and is deep into Stage 7 , now priced at $0.0002908 , with a public listing set for $0.007 —delivering an estimated 25x ROI for those who secure tokens before the exchange debut. But this isn’t just another presale. With wallet activity climbing, community traction building, and trading discussions heating up, it’s becoming clear MAGACOINFINANCE is one of the few presales actually accelerating during a stable market. Analysts say this kind of presale energy is rare. And with macro attention still focused on BTC and ETH, altcoin hunters are quietly locking in their positions while most of the market is distracted. ANALYSTS SAY 100x — MAGACOIN FINANCE STILL EARLY! The MAGA50X bonus is still available to Stage 7 buyers, offering a 50% token bonus while allocations last.

The proceeds were earmarked exclusively for purchasing additional cryptos.

The bullish outlook emerged as the protocol’s total value locked (TVL) bounced back in April, ending the downtrends that dominated since early January. The shifting sentiments have sparked debates about AVAX’s potential price recovery. The alt seems ready for a 50% jump from current prices to the $30 psychological level. Avalanche TVL recovers from prolonged declines DeFillama data shows Avalanche TVL recovered in April after slumping since early 2025, currently at $1.27 billion. Source – DeFillama Broad market sentiment sent the total value locked below $900M in February. The same hovered at the $1.1 billion vicinity at March end. Meanwhile, that represented a notable slump from above $1.5 billion in January 2025. TVL recoveries mark the initial signal of sustained rallies, suggesting a potential turning point for AVAX prices. Further, Avalanche outperformed its L1 and L2 rivals as its DeFi TVL increased by approximately 15% within the previous month. That represented the fastest growth among the top ten protocols. Ethereum, Bitcoin, Berachain, Arbitrum, and Aptos saw significant dips as Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Tron, and Base recorded modest gains. Meanwhile, Avalanche’s stood out among the top ten platforms. The significant growth confirms revived investor interest and increased developer activity within the AVAX ecosystem. Token Terminal data shows AVAX’s active addresses (monthly) increased by over 15%. Also, various DeFi projects within the Avalanche ecosystem, including Benqi and Trader Joe, have recorded surged capital inflows and amplified user engagements. Such upticks highlight revitalizations of the blockchain’s use cases and appeal to users and developers. AVAX price outlook Avalanche trades at $20.11 after gaining 2% and 35% in the past day and week, respectively. Chart by Coinmarketcap The recovering 24-hour trading volume confirms the shifting sentiments as bulls target a takeover. Technical analysis reveals the $30 mark as a psychological level and crucial resistance. AVAX witnessed multiple rejections at this zone in mid-2024. It last tested the level in February 2025, confirming its robustness. However, continued buyer interest remains vital for such a surge. The alt should overcome $24 and ensure a candle closing above $26 for a smooth ride to $30. That would mean a 50% surge from Avalanche’s current price. A decisive move past $30 would shift Avalanche’s trajectory to bullishness and catalyze extended rallies. X user and crypto enthusiast Farid trusts that AVAX price will hit $60 by July 2025.

According to Martinez, Bitcoin (BTC) price could currently be forming a rising wedge formation and seems to be signaling a retest of the $79,000 level. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $84,430. On the other hand, the analyst stated that the critical resistance zone for Bitcoin is $86,000 and said that in case of a rejection from this level, the route is back to $79,000, and in case this level is exceeded, the path is towards $97,000. However, Joao Wedson, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal, said in his statement that the difference between the futures price and the spot price in Bitcoin has decreased, which could be an optimistic sign. Related News: Confusing Statements from the Trump Administration on Tariffs Again: US Secretary of Commerce Speaks Today According to Wedson, this difference is currently still negative, reflecting the selling pressure in the futures market. However, this difference has started to close. According to the analyst, this could be the first sign that bearish sentiment is starting to fade. The analyst explained the historical significance of this metric as follows: Historically, when the Futures-Spot Range turns positive, it usually precedes a strong BTC rally. We saw this in 2020-2021 (BTC rose from around $10k to $65k) and again in 2024 ($90k). A positive range indicates that traders are willing to pay a premium for futures and reflects continued confidence in the upside. *This is not investment advice.

The price broke out on Friday, retested the downtrend line over the weekend, preventing the CME gap. This suggests the bulls are in line to push the BTC price towards $90,000 as the technicals are close to displaying a bullish divergence. However, the price is required to rise above and secure a crucial resistance in the next few days, which could clear the path towards $100K; otherwise, a drop close to yearly lows is imminent. The markets began to recover after President Trump halted the tariffs. Recently, he clarified that no country would be getting ‘’off the hook’’ on tariffs, as no exemptions will be implemented. In the coming days, the Gold price, which is breaking down after printing huge bullish candles, is expected to come down substantially. This drop is expected to push the Bitcoin price close to $90,000 with a drop in panic and uncertainty. Now that the BTC price has regained important levels and is gaining strength despite the Mantra collapse. This suggests greener days are yet to come, reviving the possibility of rising above $100K shortly. The weekly chart of Bitcoin flashes a major bullish signal as the price has risen above the trend like it held since September 2023. The selling pressure has dropped from the past week, which may further assist the levels to undergo a bullish crossover. On the other hand, the weekly RSI has reached the average zone, and a continued upswing could eventually push the BTC price towards the crucial resistance at $88,500.

Co-founder JP Mullin reassured the community that the project remains active, pointing to the official Telegram group being “still online.” “We are here and not going anywhere,” Mullin wrote, also sharing a verification address to prove the team's OM token holdings. He attributed the OM’s crash to “reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges.” Source: JP Mullin The assurance calmed the OM token sell-off that had obliterated over $5 billion in market capitalization and liquidated $75.88 million worth of futures positions in a day. Numerous online commentators claimed the Mantra team, reportedly controlling 90% of the token supply, orchestrated the sell-off due to suspicious OM transfers to centralized exchanges right before the crash. Source: AltcoinGordon Analyst Ed further alleged that the Mantra team used their OM holdings as collateral to secure high-risk loans on a centralized exchange. He noted that a sudden change in the platform’s loan risk parameters triggered a margin call, contributing to the token’s sharp decline. Source: Ed Exchanges adjust loan risk parameters to manage market volatility and protect themselves from potential insolvency due to falling collateral values. Centralized exchanges like OKX have changed their parameters after Mantra’s tokenomics update in October 2024. Notably, Mantra doubled the total supply of OM tokens from 888,888,888 to 1,777,777,777 in the said month. It further transitioned from a capped to an uncapped, inflationary model with an initial 8% annual inflation rate.

OM bounce might resemble LUNA’s bull trap OM’s 200% rebound from its $0.37 low may look impressive, but its structure closely resembles the classic bull trap pattern seen in Terra’s LUNA debacle in May 2022. OM’s price has crashed below the 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) support near $3.25 and is now testing resistance at the 200-week EMA (the blue wave) at around $1.08.

For context, SBF was sentenced to 25 years in prison on March 28, 2024, for orchestrating one of the largest financial frauds in history. In the aftermath, the cryptocurrency market has seen notable shifts in price movement and adoption trends. The portfolio associated with SBF’s companies, including crypto exchange FTX and Alameda Research, mainly comprised assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and FTX’s native token, FTT. While SBF may not have personally owned these assets, they were central to his firm’s operations and investment strategies. Here’s how these digital assets have performed since his sentencing and what a $1,000 investment in each would be worth today. Bitcoin (BTC) On March 28, 2024, Bitcoin traded at $70,744, rising by 19.43% as of press time to $84,490. A $1,000 investment in Bitcoin on the day of SBF’s sentencing would now be worth $1,194. Over this period, Bitcoin has undergone notable developments, including being added to the strategic crypto reserve of the U.S. government and hitting a record high above $100,000. BTC one-year price chart. Source: Finbold Solana (SOL) Once a cornerstone of FTX and Alameda Research’s investment strategy, Solana traded at $189 when Bankman-Fried was sentenced. Notably, the collapse of FTX had a massive impact on the decentralized finance asset, which once dropped below $10. The significance of SOL to the FTX empire was highlighted in 2021 when the exchange and Alameda raised over $300 million for Solana’s ecosystem. As of press time, SOL has decreased to $132, a 30.16% decline. A $1,000 investment in Solana at sentencing would now be worth $698.40. SOL one-year price chart. Source: Finbold Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum, trading at $3,562 on March 28, 2024, has fallen to $1,633 by press time, a 54.15% drop. Therefore, investors who put $1,000 in the second-ranked digital currency by market cap would now see their investment valued at $458.50. Ethereum has failed to mirror Bitcoin’s performance and has remained mostly suppressed. ETH one-year price chart. Source: Finbold FTX Token (FTT) FTX’s native token, FTT, is central to the exchange’s operations. It traded at $1.92 on March 28, 2024. As of press time, it has plummeted to $0.86, a 55.21% decrease. To this end, a $1,000 investment in FTT would now be worth $447.90. The token’s collapse largely points to investor reaction to the eroding trust in the exchange after fraud allegations emerged.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price oscillates within a tight range between $83,000 and $86,000, as shown in the chart below. BTC/USD four-hour chart. Cointelegraph/ TradingView Key factors behind Bitcoin’s flat price action include: Trump’s mixed signals on technology tariffs. Buy and sell pressure equilibrium with BTC price trapped between two key levels. Trump tariffs breed market uncertainty One significant factor contributing to Bitcoin price flatlining is the White House’s semiconductor and technology tariff inconsistency. Key points: Bitcoin price rallied on April 11 after US President Trump announced tariff exemptions for an array of tech products, including smartphones, chips, computers, and semiconductors. On April 13, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick walked back on this announcement , saying that the tariff relief on electronics was temporary. This was later confirmed by President Trump, who stated that the tariff rate would be announced next week, adding that there would be flexibility for some companies in the sector. This flip-flopping breeds uncertainty, as tariffs could disrupt supply chains for tech firms, many of which are intertwined with crypto infrastructure like mining and blockchain companies. According to capital markets commentator The Kobeissi Letter, the ""Clarification of Exceptions Under Executive Order 14257"" note published by the White House on April 11 did not present a “new list of exemptions.” Rather, it was a clarification that the “goods were never actually intended to be subject to 145% tariffs,” The Kobeissi Letter explained in an April 14 post on X. “It appears that the news and most investors, along with customs enforcement themselves, never truly understood what was being tariffed to begin with. This was a complete misunderstanding by almost everyone involved.” As a result, market participants have taken a wait-and-see approach, as clarity on policy could either ignite a rally or trigger a sell-off. Related: Trade war vs. record M2 money supply: 5 things to know in Bitcoin this week BTC price trapped between two key trendlines Another reason why Bitcoin price remains stuck in limbo is that it trades within two significant levels, as shown in the chart below: BTC price trades between the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $84,400 and the 200-day SMA at $87,500. This confirms the 200 SMA as resistance and the 50 SMA as support on the daily candle chart. The value of the RSI close to the midline at 52 suggests that there is a tug-of-war between the bears and the bulls. Bitcoin needs to break the 200 SMA trendline and confront resistance at the $90,000 psychological level. Falling below the 50-day SMA will likely lead to a deeper correction. BTC/USD daily chart.

In this article, we’ll explore short trading with DCA bots and discuss its potential for traders to diversify their portfolios and create a new income stream. What is Short Trading? Generally, when you decide to trade a specific crypto (or any other financial asset), you can either go long or short. Long positions are more suitable for rising markets as they profit when prices increase. On the other hand, short positions generate profit for traders when prices go down. While short trading is traditionally considered more dangerous, thanks to the efficiency of the crypto markets and the advanced capabilities of advanced automated trading tools, that is not necessarily the case anymore. Most risk barriers have been removed, allowing retail crypto traders to experiment with this trading method. What are DCA Bots? Dollar-Cost-Averaging bots, known as DCA bots , are one of the most popular automated trading solutions in the crypto world. Famous as a helpful way to exploit subtle price changes through fast-paced trades, they present crypto traders with one of the best risk-reward ratios in the automated trading niche. Although known for being great performers in bullish market conditions, DCA bots can work the same way when the bears are out. Technically, DCA bots don’t care where the market is heading if it moves in a clear direction. Through their methodical technique of swiftly exploiting subtle price changes in trending markets, DCA bots present a crypto-trading experience that doesn’t involve many risks associated with trading high-volatility assets. How does it work? The workflow for shorting cryptos with a DCA bot is straightforward to understand. The only thing to remember is that it profits when market prices are lower than our entry point. Once the setup is complete, the bot immediately opens a short position. During that time, the DCA bot will use any upward short-term price corrections to enlarge its original stake. When prices return to their original downward trend, the DCA bot closes its positions according to its profit goals. It immediately opens a new position to restart this trading routine for as long as the downtrend lasts. The Advantages of DCA Short Trading With most crypto bots and other automated trading tools focusing on bullish markets, short trading with DCA bots offers a unique way to take advantage of less-favorable times. From a design perspective, all parameters for entering and exiting trades and many advanced settings, such as stop-losses, take-profits, leverage preferences, and more, are fully customized. This gives crypto traders complete control over their trading experience and risk tolerance. When it comes to execution, thanks to their ability to relentlessly monitor the crypto markets 24/7 according to a strict yet effective set of rules, they ensure that the potential of a short trading strategy is maximized to its fullest without jeopardizing more than necessary.

Kiyosaki asks “Are you listening?” Robert Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, took to X on Sunday to post his views on how Bitcoin, gold, and silver were sending the market a very important message. He said that gold was at an “all time high”, silver demand was “exploding”, and Bitcoin was “roaring”, and he asked the question: “Are you listening?” Kiyosaki reiterated what he had prophesied in his previous books, such as Rich Dad Poor Dad, and Who Stole My Pension, that the biggest stocks and bonds crash in history was coming. He added that this crash had now arrived. He remarked in his X post: “The corrupt and crooked US dollar is being wiped out. Savers of stocks, bonds, ETFs, and MUTUAL FUNDS are being wiped out…their wealth stolen, by a sinister global banking cartel, known as Central Banks….led by The Bank of International Settlements Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank…. and in the US known as “The Fed.”” He went on to say that “it’s not too late”, affirming that those who bought Bitcoin, gold, and silver, could still come out of this “premeditated disaster” as the “new rich and the new leaders of the world.” US still has much to do to avoid crash If Kiyosaki is right about the timing of the crash, it suggests that perhaps the US and China may not do a trade deal, other countries might also take a stand, and the current problem the US has with refinancing its debt could worsen. When all is said and done, no matter the amount of gloss that might be put on it, the US is in an extremely critical position. U.S. stock markets have rallied over the last week, and the S&P 500 might even get back above $5,800, but the 10-year bond yield remains high, and refinancing around $7 trillion in debt that matures this year will be a tough task. $BTC breaks through 3-month downtrend and confirms above Source: TradingView For the short-term time frame it can be seen that the $BTC price has broken through the descending trendline and has confirmed the break. This confirmation has so far taken place up to the daily time frame. The next step for the bulls, besides consolidating above the trendline, is to take out the last local swing high at $88,600. If this happens, the path back to the $109,000 all-time high could be open. Weekly indicators turn bullish for $BTC Source: TradingView The weekly view of the Bitcoin chart shows how close the price got to the top of the previous bull flag, which is likely to be incredibly strong support, if one takes into account the years that it took for the bulls to finally break above. The Relative Strength Index near the bottom of the chart shows that the indicator bounced again from the very strong support structure at the 44.00 level. Also, the Stochastic RSI, just below this, displays the tilt back up with the blue indicator line on top. If both indicator lines can pass the 20.00 level this would signal strong upward price momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As Dogecoin (DOGE) struggles to reclaim momentum, dipping to around $0.16, many investors are beginning to question whether the beloved memecoin can truly reach the elusive $1 mark this cycle. Meanwhile, a new performer, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is rapidly gaining traction thanks to its real-world DeFi utility. The project is in phase 4 of its presale priced at $0.025. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $6.7 million with over 8300 investors already onboard. In phase 5 the price will jump 20% to $0.03. MUTM could hit $5 and be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. A newly released dashboard now features a dynamic leaderboard, spotlighting the top 50 token holders. Those who maintain their ranking will be eligible for exclusive bonus token rewards. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Approach Mutuum Finance is transforming decentralized lending by bringing the best of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With the P2C model, users can lock stablecoins like USDT into liquidity pools supported by smart contracts and gain passive income while making borrowing simpler. The P2P model, on the other hand, cuts out middlemen and enables direct negotiation between lenders and borrowers. This combination of techniques attains ultimate security, enhances efficiency, and preserves decentralization, putting Mutuum Finance in the lead among DeFi. By giving full control to users over their lending decisions, the platform benefits both risk-averse investors seeking stability and high-return investors seeking greater flexibility, resulting in an open and dynamic financial system. Mutuum Finance is security-first, starting with the introduction of a fully collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The over-collateralization framework removes volatility risk typically present in algorithmic stablecoins, creating stability. In addition to building confidence among investors, the platform is audited by smart contracts on a regular basis and maintains a financial transparency focus, filling potential vulnerabilities in the DeFi lending market. By placing a focus on security and sustainability, Mutuum Finance is a solid option for long-term investors. Special Rewards and Community Incentives Early adopters of Mutuum Finance will receive various rewards together with a special benefit. Ten lucky participants in the current $100,000 MUTM token award will each receive $10,000 as their prize. Users at Mutuum Finance receive benefits through their referral program and receive funds from successful referrals which helps develop their community. Users who adopt Mutuum Finance at its origin get exclusive access to upcoming staking options alongside governance capabilities and stakeholder selection during platform improvements. The incentives exist to draw initial users and additionally keep token holders present while actively participating in the platform. A Strategic Vision for Sustainable Growth Mutuum Finance has built a well-thought-out tokenomics strategy to achieve long-term value creation. Through efficient liquidity management, strategic partnerships, and security features with anti-inflationary elements, the platform positions itself for long-term growth. Disciplined distribution during presale and periodic rewards through token staking encourage investors to retain their stakes while ensuring the token is sustainable. Over the long term, the deflationary models progressively reduce the supply of the network, hence creating scarcity that drives the potential for long-term price appreciation. As Dogecoin struggles to regain momentum at $0.16, the likelihood of it hitting $1 in 2025 remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing serious investor attention, having already raised over $6.7 million from 8,300+ participants in its presale. Secure your MUTM tokens now at $0.025 before the next phase begins and join the future of DeFi.

The weekly chart reveals an extended descending channel drawn with multiple yellow trend lines that originated in 2021 and constricted price action throughout 2022. Within that formation, the most critical horizontal threshold appears to be $0.139, labeled on the chart as the “Last line in the sand” and described by Kevin as essential for preserving bullish market structure. He notes that maintaining durable weekly closes above this zone is paramount for further upside, while a decisive break beneath $0.139 would nullify the bullish thesis. Dogecoin Follows The Blueprint Dogecoin’s retracement from highs near $0.45 earlier this year has so far been contained by a confluence of support channels and Fibonacci retracement levels. According to Kevin’s chart, the primary Fib levels span from roughly $0.049 at the lower bound (0% Fib) to around $2.268 at the 1.414 extension. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy Over 80 Million DOGE In 24 Hours – Sign Of Recovery​? Closer inspection shows intermediate Fibonacci markers at $0.090 (0.236), $0.138 (0.382), $0.190 (0.50), $0.262 (0.618), $0.413 (0.786), $0.542 (0.88), $0.738 (1.0), $0.934 (1.0866), and $1.543 (1.272). Since the price is hovering near $0.16–$0.17 at press time, Dogecoin has remained above the 0.382 retracement near $0.138, reinforcing Kevin’s argument that the risk-reward ratio at this level appears “absolutely phenomenal.” Kevin’s March 22 update describes the confluence of several higher time frame indicators, including the Weekly Stochastic RSI, the 3-Day MACD, and the 2-Week Stochastic RSI, all of which he sees nearing full resets. He cites the previous weekly demand candle, which formed just above $0.139, as a key sign that buyers are stepping in to defend what he calls “the Last line of bull market support.” The Weekly Stoch RSI on his chart is already situated at low levels, while the 3-Day MACD and 2-Week Stoch RSI appear roughly a month away from bottoming out. According to Kevin, these technical resets should serve as a springboard for Dogecoin’s next significant upward move, provided that Bitcoin, which he believes must hold above $70K in his scenario, remains stable enough to support broader market strength. Related Reading: Dogecoin At Major Breakout Point As Liquidity Bottoms, Says Analyst On Sunday, Kevin reminded his audience that this strategy, first made public on March 22, is going “exactly according to plan,” given Dogecoin’s confirmed bounce around the $0.139 region and the ongoing drift toward oversold conditions in multiple momentum gauges. He disclosed that his Patreon trading portfolio holds an average entry at $0.15 for this swing and noted that a swift rejection of sub-$0.139 weekly closes, coupled with the bullish stance of the higher time frame indicators, corroborates his confidence in Dogecoin’s recovery potential. While he acknowledges that “lots of work” still needs to be done for Dogecoin to reclaim loftier levels near the 0.618 Fib around $0.262 or even the 0.786 Fib at $0.413, Kevin maintains that his initial thesis stands as long as the meme-inspired asset preserves its foothold above $0.139. For him, the risk of a breakdown is well-defined if the pivotal support gives way, but should the level persist, he sees the upside potential extending far beyond the current range. As of now, Dogecoin’s price continues to cling to that all-important line in the sand, keeping Kevin’s bullish blueprint very much alive. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.16493.

This integration has fuelled optimism that Pi Coin will soon gain adoption from top centralized exchanges. Can this integration support a Pi Network price rally to $3? Let’s find out. Pi Network Price Eyes $3 Amid Chainlink Integration Pi Network price may be on the verge of a parabolic rally after Chainlink announced the token’s addition to the LINK Data Streams alongside 21 other crypto assets. Chainlink PI Integration The Chainlink Data Streams provide crypto traders with timely updates on prices, making it easier for investors to trade products like options and derivatives. Hence, the Chainlink integration may pave the way for a Pi Network price recovery to a record high past $3. The Pi Network community has hailed the integration. Analyst MrSpockApe opined that this move will open up utility for Pi Coin in the Web3 industry. “With this move, Pi Network and its cryptocurrency PI are part of Chainlink’s data feeds that will allow decentralized applications (dApps) to access reliable on-chain pricing data for Pi token.” At the same time, others opined that the move will strengthen the prospects for the Pi Network token to be listed on top centralized exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. Considering the current market sentiment and rising utility for Pi Network , the token may attain its $3 price target in the coming weeks. Moreover, looking at the 40% rally in the last seven days, a 4x rally for Pi Coin is not impossible. Is Pi Coin Ready for the Next Bull Run? At press time, Pi Coin trades at $0.75 after outperforming the broader crypto market in the last seven days. The altcoin has formed a rounding bottom pattern on the four-hour chart, which may precede a 44% rally to $1.13. If Pi Network price can flip the resistance level at $1.12, it may kickstart a strong bull run for the token towards the breakout level of $3. The technical indicators are flashing mixed signals on the Pi Network price prediction . The RSI line is rising and has reached 65, indicating that the momentum is still bullish. However, the MACD line is on the verge of forming a sell signal after merging with the signal line from above. If it confirms a crossover, it will create a sell signal that could wipe out the recent gains. PI/USDT: 4-Hour Chart Nevertheless, the Pi Network token is gaining adoption, with the Chainlink integration inching the altcoin closer to listing on leading crypto exchanges. If this happens, a breakout is likely to happen soon, with one analyst forecasting a Pi Coin rally to $10 . However, $3 is a more attainable target in the near term.

Sixteen various projects will have “cliff unlocks” in this timeframe, according to Tokenomist data. The unlocks’ values vary from $5.61 million to $334 million. The Trump meme coin (TRUMP) is at the forefront with $334 million of tokens set to be released. TRUMP meme coin unlocks 20% supply According to Tokenomist , the TRUMP meme coin is set to release 40 million tokens worth around $334 million on April 18. This is 20% of the total supply of tokens. The unlock is the largest dollar-value token release and also one of the largest unlocks in terms of total supply percentage. Other politically-themed tokens are also undergoing unlocks at the same time, with the MELANIA token scheduled to release 26.25 million tokens worth $12.25 million, or 7.78% of its total supply. Among other large cliff unlocks scheduled for the April 14-21 period, FTN will release 20 million tokens worth $80.8 million (2.33% of supply), CONX will unlock 4.33 million tokens valued at $77.07 million (7.45% of supply), and QAI will release 565,690 tokens worth $49.53 million (12.7% of supply). The Trump meme coin leads large cliff and linear token unlocks this week. Source: Wu Blockchain ZKJ follows with 15.53 million tokens valued at $35.25 million (5.6% of supply) and ARB with 92.65 million tokens worth $28.22 million (2.3% of supply). Other notable cliff unlocks include DRB’s massive 1.14 billion token release worth $25.99 million (63.24% of supply), UXLINK’s 37.5 million tokens valued at $18.48 million (5.54% of supply), and STRK’s 127 million tokens worth $16.11 million (8.54% of supply). OMNI will experience 8.21 million tokens valued at $15.18 million becoming available, accounting for the biggest percent increase of 78.91% of its total supply. Joining IMX at 24.52 million tokens valued at $10.15 million (1.36% of supply), SEI at 55.56 million tokens at $9.63 million value (1.44% of supply), APE at 15.6 million tokens at $6.67 million value (1.88% of supply), and XCN at 296.38 million tokens at $5.61 million value (0.86% of supply) in unlocking from the cliff are completed. Token unlocks of this size tend to generate selling pressure as newly released tokens come into circulation. This may be sold by early investors, team members, or partners who were given token allocations in initial distributions. Solana leads large linear unlocks Whereas cliff unlocks are the immediate token release, linear unlocks release tokens in increments over time. During the period between April 14 and April 21, Solana (SOL) is at the top of the linear unlock with 465,770 SOL tokens worth $60.95 million up for release. After Solana, Worldcoin (WLD) boasts the second-largest linear unlock of 37.23 million tokens valued at $27.91 million, which is equivalent to 3.02% of its circulating supply. Celestia (TIA) comes in next with 6.96 million tokens valued at $17.12 million (1.20% of supply), followed by Dogecoin (DOGE) which will have 96.52 million tokens valued at $15.92 million unlocked, although this is just 0.06% of its enormous supply. Other significant linear unlocks are TAO ($12.17 million), Avalanche ($13.92 million), and Polkadot ($8.52 million). These linear releases tend to induce less market volatility compared to cliff unlocks because they are gradual and have a smaller relative effect on circulating supply. The total value of all linear unlocks for this period is around $181 million, which is much lower than the cliff unlocks. Other lesser known token unlocks Beyond the headline-grabbing TRUMP token and major blockchain platforms like Solana, several lesser-known projects are scheduled for substantial token unlocks during the April 14-21 period. According to CoinMarketCap statistics , DRB has one of the largest supply increases. The project is releasing 1.14 billion worth $25.99 million. That is 63.24% of its total supply – the second highest among all tokens having unlocks scheduled. Equally, OMNI will release 8.21 million tokens worth $15.18 million, a huge 78.91% of its supply, the largest percentage rise of any token in this timeframe. Token unlocks expected during the week. Source: CoinMarketCap Starknet (STRK) boasts a substantial unlock with 127 million tokens worth $16.11 million (8.54% of supply). The next unlock for the token will unleash a further 163.04 million STRK worth around $20.6 million. Other unlocks of prominence include ZKJ ($35.25 million, 5.6% supply), UXLINK ($18.48 million, 5.54% supply), and ARB ($28.22 million, 2.3% supply). The APE token, focused on gaming, will have $6.67 million unlocked, while the XCN, data-focused, will unlock $5.61 million worth of tokens. The unlock tracker also indicates some projects at initial stages of their token distribution cycles. KonnektVPN (KPN) indicates 39% unlock progress with 27 million KPN tokens pending as its next release. Turbos Finance is also 35.10% through its unlock schedule with 106.46 million TURBOS tokens in the pipeline, and Sei has reached 48.82% of its unlock progression with 224.86 million SEI tokens ready for future release.

Amid this, Ripple’s coin recorded an inflow, defying the broader market trend, which also resulted in an outflux in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This shift comes amid growing anxiety over the US tariffs and legal uncertainty in the crypto sector, with Ripple’s native asset showing surprising resilience. XRP Reigns Supreme Amid $795M Crypto Market Outflux A recent CoinShares report showed that the Digital asset investment products recorded a staggering $795 million in outflows last week. This marks the third straight week of declines, wiping out nearly all year-to-date gains. Since early February, outflows have reached $7.2 billion, drastically reducing market sentiment. Meanwhile, Bitcoin suffered the heaviest blow, with $751 million exiting the asset. Despite this, it still maintains $545 million in YTD inflows. On a weekly basis, Ethereum followed with $37.6 million in losses, while Solana also slipped by $5.1 million. Even short-bitcoin products weren’t spared, seeing $4.6 million in outflows. However, not all digital assets face the same fate. XRP saw inflows of $3.5 million, leading the top altcoins . Ondo, Algorand, and Avalanche also posted modest gains. These inflows hint at growing investor interest in assets that could outperform during turbulent periods. Notably, CoinShares analysts believe the negative trend was largely driven by uncertainty around President Trump’s tariff strategy. Still, a late-week price recovery lifted total crypto assets under management by 8%, reaching $130 billion after dipping to their lowest point since November 2024. Will XRP Maintain Momentum? Ripple’s strength isn’t entirely random. Analysts link its resilience to the ongoing Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, which may be nearing a conclusion. The crypto community remains hopeful that the anticipated favorable outcome could boost the crypto’s legal standing and long-term value. Yet, not everyone is convinced. Experts have cautioned investors against betting on a massive rally solely based on legal resolution in the Ripple Vs SEC lawsuit . The broader market environment and macroeconomic pressures could still limit Ripple’s coin upside move, despite regulatory clarity. The big question now is whether the crypto can hold its ground while others falter. Besides, the recent Ripple coin influx, defying the broader crypto market trend, has further fueled market confidence. Despite that, XRP price has lost more than 3% today but held its $2 support. During writing, Ripple price exchanged hands at $2.15, while its one-day volume fell 4% to $3.99 billion. Besides, the Ripple coin’s Futures Open Interest fell nearly 11% to $3.2 billion, reflecting the waning risk-bet appetite of the investors. Having said that, investors should exercise due diligence before putting their bets into the asset.

According to crypto tokenomics data aggregator Tokenomist , 40 million TRUMP tokens will be unlocked on the open market on April 18th. With 199 million TRUMP tokens currently in circulation, the unlock represents about 20% of the memecoin’s circulating supply. TRUMP currently has a market cap of $1.69 billion and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $8.48 billion. Token unlocks are often considered bearish for crypto assets, given that new supply will soon be available and sell pressure may be higher. Like most digital assets, TRUMP suffered recently following the escalation of the president’s trade war, starting when he signed an executive order that slapped tariffs on all imported goods entering the US with the stated goal of protecting domestic manufacturing. Despite the unlock, cryptocurrency trader and analyst Ali Martinez is leaning bullish on TRUMP. Martinez tells his 134,800 followers on the social media platform X that TRUMP could be preparing for a bullish reversal based on the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential indicator on the weekly time frame. The TD Sequential indicator is used to identify potential trend reversal points in technical analysis. Says Martinez, “The TD Sequential just flashed a buy signal on the TRUMP weekly chart! Key support: $7.13 Breakout confirmation: $11.96 Target: $17.94.” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, TRUMP is worth $8.37.

Attestation ≠ audit: Attestations are point-in-time checks, not deep financial audits, so users should still perform broader due diligence. Not all tokens are redeemable. Time-locked, test or frozen tokens are excluded from reserve calculations to reflect only actively circulating coins. USDC sets an industry benchmark with regular third-party attestations, transparent reserve reporting and compliance with MiCA regulations. Stablecoins play a crucial role in the digital asset ecosystem, bridging traditional fiat currencies and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies . How can you be confident that each stablecoin is backed by real-world assets ? This is where stablecoin attestation reports come in. Understanding how to read attestation reports is essential for anyone interacting with stablecoins like USDC ( USDC ) or Tether USDt ( USDT ). This guide explains everything you need to know about stablecoin attestation reports, how they work and why they matter. What is a stablecoin attestation report? A stablecoin attestation report is a formal document issued by an independent third party — a certified public accountant (CPA) firm — that verifies whether the stablecoin issuer holds sufficient reserves to back the coins in circulation. Unlike full audits, which evaluate broader financial systems and controls, attestations are narrower in scope. They confirm specific facts, like whether reserve balances match circulating supply at a single point in time. Think of an attestation as a snapshot taken by accountants saying, “Yes, we’ve checked, and the money is there right now.” It’s not as deep or wide as an audit, but it still builds trust. For example, if a stablecoin issuer claims that each token is backed 1:1 by US dollars, an attestation report would provide evidence supporting that claim. Stablecoins like USDC regularly publish such reports to prove that their coins are fully backed, helping to build trust in their ecosystem. Attestation reports are especially critical for investors and institutions that depend on stablecoins for cross-border settlements, collateral in lending protocols and participation in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Without confidence in the reserves’ authenticity, the stablecoin system risks collapse, which can impact the broader crypto market. Purpose of stablecoin attestations: Why transparency matters? Transparency is essential in the crypto space, especially for stablecoins, which serve as a medium of exchange, a store of value and collateral on DeFi platforms. Attestation reports offer a window into a stablecoin issuer’s reserves and disclosure practices, allowing users, regulators and investors to evaluate whether the issuer is operating responsibly. Issuers like Circle , the company behind USDC, publish attestation reports to demonstrate compliance with regulatory expectations and assure users that the coins they hold are not only stable in name but also in substance. In doing so, they promote stablecoin investor safety and support market integrity. This transparency builds the foundation for regulatory trust and helps attract traditional financial institutions into the space. It also aligns with broader industry goals for increasing stablecoin compliance, particularly as governments worldwide explore stablecoin-specific regulations. Who conducts the attestation? Stablecoin attestation reports are prepared by independent accounting firms. For instance, Circle’s USDC attestation reports are conducted by Deloitte (as of April 13, 2025), a leading global audit and advisory firm. These firms follow professional standards set by bodies like the AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants). Independent attestors are essential because they remove conflicts of interest. Having a third-party review reserves ensures that the information is unbiased, credible and aligned with global assurance standards. AICPA’s 2025 criteria: Standardizing stablecoin attestations In response to growing concerns over inconsistent stablecoin disclosures, the AICPA introduced the 2025 Criteria for Stablecoin Reporting, a standardized framework for fiat-pegged, asset-backed tokens. These criteria define how stablecoin issuers should present and disclose three key areas: Redeemable tokens outstanding. The availability and composition of redemption assets. The comparison between the two. What makes the 2025 Criteria important is its emphasis on transparency and comparability. For example, token issuers must clearly define redeemable versus nonredeemable tokens (such as time-locked or test tokens), identify where and how reserves are held and disclose any material legal or operational risks affecting redemption. By aligning attestation reports with this framework, accounting firms ensure that evaluations are conducted using suitable, objective and measurable criteria, a key requirement under US attestation standards. This gives investors, regulators and DeFi users a more consistent and reliable basis for evaluating stablecoin solvency and trustworthiness. As adoption grows, the 2025 Criteria may become the industry benchmark, especially as regulatory bodies increasingly rely on standardized reporting to assess stablecoin risks and enforce compliance. Did you know? Not all stablecoins in circulation are redeemable. Some, like time-locked tokens, are temporarily restricted and can’t be accessed until a specific date. Others, known as test tokens, are used only for internal system testing and are never meant to be redeemed. These tokens are excluded from reserve calculations in attestation reports to ensure an accurate picture of what’s backing user-accessible stablecoins. Behind the peg: How to read a stablecoin report and spot real backing Reading a stablecoin attestation report isn’t just about scanning numbers. It’s about knowing whether the stablecoin you’re holding is backed. Here’s how to break it down step by step and spot what really matters: Check the report date: Attestations are point-in-time reviews. Look for the exact date the report covers (e.g., Feb. 28, 2025). It confirms reserves on that day only, not before or after. Compare circulating supply vs reserves: Find the number of tokens in circulation and the total value of reserves. The reserves should be equal to or greater than the supply. If not, that’s a red flag. Look at what backs the reserves: Reserves should be held in safe, liquid assets like US Treasurys or cash in regulated financial institutions. Watch out for risky or vague asset descriptions. Review custodian and asset details: Check who’s holding the funds (e.g., major banks or money market funds) and where they’re stored. Remember, reputable custodians add credibility. Understand the methodology: The report should explain how the review was conducted, what data was verified, what systems were used and which standards (like AICPA) were followed. Identify excluded tokens: Some tokens, like test tokens or time-locked tokens, are excluded from circulation counts. Look for notes explaining these exceptions. Check who performed the attestation: An independent and recognized accounting firm (like Deloitte or Grant Thornton) adds legitimacy. If the attestor isn’t disclosed or independent, treat with caution. A signed statement from the accounting firm verifies the accuracy of the issuer’s claims. Investors may also look for supplementary notes within the report, such as jurisdiction of reserve accounts, legal encumbrances on assets or clarification of valuation techniques. All these elements help paint a fuller picture of risk and reliability. What the February 2025 USDC attestation report reveals In March 2025, Circle released its latest reserve attestation report, offering a transparent look at what backs one of the most widely used digital dollars in crypto. The report was independently examined by Deloitte, one of the “Big Four” global accounting firms. Deloitte confirmed that, as of both Feb. 4 and Feb. 28, 2025, the fair value of Circle’s reserves was equal to or greater than the amount of USDC in circulation. The below snapshot from Circle's February 2025 attestation report shows that the amount of USDC in circulation stood at $54.95 billion on Feb. 4 and $56.28 billion on Feb. 28. The fair value of reserves held to back USDC exceeded these figures, totaling $55.01 billion and $56.35 billion on the respective dates. What’s in the reserves? Circle holds its USDC reserves mainly in: US Treasury securities Treasury repurchase agreements Cash at regulated financial institutions These assets are kept separate from Circle’s corporate funds and are managed through the Circle Reserve Fund, a regulated money market fund. The attestation also accounts for technical factors like “access-denied” tokens (e.g., frozen due to legal or compliance reasons ) and tokens not yet issued, ensuring an accurate measure of circulating USDC. For users, this means greater confidence that every USDC token is backed by high-quality, liquid assets, just like the company claims. Did you know? As of Feb. 4 and Feb. 28, 2025, 993,225 USDC remained permanently frozen on deprecated blockchains, including the FLOW blockchain. These tokens are excluded from the official USDC in circulation totals reported by Circle. How are stablecoin reserves verified? Stablecoin attestation reports serve as a form of proof of reserves, providing independent confirmation that a stablecoin issuer holds enough assets to back the tokens in circulation. The verification process typically involves several key steps: Reviewing bank statements and financial records. Confirming cash balances held by custodians. Cross-checking reported reserves with third-party documentation. Comparing the supply of stablecoins onchain with the reported reserve amount. As mentioned, these procedures are carried out by independent accounting firms and are designed to ensure that the reserves are not only sufficient but also liquid and accessible. Some attestation reports also include details on the tools and technologies used to maintain transparency, such as real-time API integrations with custodians and onchain monitoring systems . These advancements are helping bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain, reinforcing trust through verifiable, tamper-resistant data. What happens if reserves don't match supply? If an attestation report reveals that a stablecoin issuer does not hold sufficient reserves, the consequences can be severe. The issuer may face: Regulatory scrutiny : Noncompliance with financial regulations. Market sell-offs : A drop in user confidence may lead to mass redemptions. Price instability : The stablecoin may lose its 1:1 peg . These concerns highlight the need for regular, transparent crypto reserve reports. For instance, Tether has faced ongoing criticism for the lack of clarity surrounding its reserves, fueling demands for greater disclosure. This opacity has also led to Tether’s delisting in Europe under Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations as exchanges brace for stricter compliance requirements. Lack of transparency can also invite speculation and misinformation, which can cause unnecessary panic in the markets. As a result, proactive disclosure is not just a best practice; it’s a business imperative for stablecoin issuers. Limitations of stablecoin attestation reports While attestation reports are crucial, they are not a cure-all. Here are some limitations: Point-in-time snapshots : Reports only verify reserves on a specific date. No forward-looking guarantees : Attestations don’t predict future solvency. Limited operational insight : They typically don’t cover risks like hacking , mismanagement or liquidity issues. For example, the latest USDC attestation (as discussed in this article) confirms full reserves as of Feb. 4 and Feb. 28, 2025, but it says nothing about what happens on March 1 or any day after. Users must understand these limitations and avoid assuming that attestation equals absolute safety. This is why combining attestation reports with other forms of due diligence like reading legal disclaimers, following regulatory updates and tracking company behavior is key for responsible crypto participation. Not just a report — A roadmap to trust in crypto Reading a stablecoin attestation report is more than scanning numbers; it's a key step in assessing the trustworthiness of a digital asset. By understanding how to read attestation reports, crypto users can make informed decisions, avoid unnecessary risks and support projects that prioritize stablecoin compliance and transparency. With clearer frameworks from institutions like the AICPA and growing public pressure for stablecoin disclosure practices, the ecosystem is moving toward greater accountability. As regulators sharpen their focus and investors demand more visibility, learning to navigate crypto attestation reports will become an essential skill for all participants in the crypto economy. Whether you're a retail investor, developer or institutional player, mastering these reports helps protect your assets and support a more transparent and trustworthy crypto future.

On April 14, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich announced the acquisition of 319 BTC for approximately ¥3.78 billion (roughly $26.3 million), at an average price of approximately $82,549 per coin. It also reported a year-to-date BTC Yield of 108.3%. Companies holding Bitcoin use the BTC Yield metric to track how their holdings grow relative to their share base. Metaplanet’s BTC Yield rose 95.6% in Q1 2025, following a surge of 309.8% in the final quarter of 2024. Earlier this month, the company added 160 BTC for approximately $13.4 million, continuing its steady accumulation despite market volatility. Metplanet currently holds 4525 BTC, according to data from Bitcoin treasuries, and it is the ninth largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Metplanet plans to acquire 21,000 BTC The latest purchase came as Bitcoin wobbled under geopolitical pressure. The flagship crypto asset dropped more than 2% during Asia trading hours on Sunday, briefly touching $83,482 as investors reacted to mixed signals from Washington over US trade policy toward China. While broader markets remained relatively steady, with Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures posting gains, uncertainty around tech-related tariffs weighed on digital assets. President Trump clarified that smartphones and chips, initially spared from a proposed 10% tariff, would still face a 20% national security levy. When writing, Bitcoin was down 0.4% at $84,410 according to CoinGecko. However, Metaplanet views Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset and has continued to raise capital to grow its treasury irrespective of short-term fluctuations. During a podcast appearance earlier this year, CEO Gerovic said he often feels “nervous” about not having enough time to buy more Bitcoin. Since the start of 2025, Metaplanet has ramped up its fundraising activity to fuel its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. The company has been issuing stock acquisition rights and bonds as part of a broader capital markets strategy backed by institutional investor EVO FUND. Under its ongoing “21 Million Plan,” Metaplanet plans to issue 21 million shares and raise funds to buy bitcoin, and has so far raised over ¥35 billion, representing around 42% of the plan’s full capacity. Earlier this month, the Tokyo-headquartered firm exercised 8.6 million and 4.2 million shares through its 14th and 17th series of stock rights, respectively. As previously reported by Invezz, Metaplanet also raised ¥2 billion (around $13.3 million) last month through its 10th Series of Ordinary Bonds, a debt instrument separate from its equity issuances. Unlike stock rights, which bring in funds when exercised by investors, the bond sale provided immediate capital. Metaplanet aims to become Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with a target of surpassing 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and reaching 21,000 BTC by 2026. Following strategy Metaplanet is following the playbook of Michael Saylor-led business intelligence firm Strategy, which currently holds the title of the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. On March 31, the company scooped up 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion as part of its “21/21 plan,” a capital strategy under which the firm would raise $21 billion through equity and another $21 billion through debt to fuel its Bitcoin purchases. As of last check, Strategy’s total holdings stood at 528,185 BTC, valued at roughly $44.5 billion based on current prices.

Following World Liberty Financial’s announcement of the launch of a non-interest-bearing stablecoin USD1 on April 4, 2025, during a tariff-fueled stock market selloff that erased a record $6.4 trillion in value entering what Wall Street calls a bear market , the US Securities and Exchange Commission issued a notice. This notice paved the way for a more regulated and stable digital asset landscape and said that “Covered Stablecoins,” or tokens backed by physical fiat or high-liquidity assets and redeemable 1:1 with the US dollar, are “non-securities.” And persons involved in the process of “minting” (or creating) and redeeming Covered Stablecoins are exempted from reporting requirements. You might also like: US leadership in crypto: The focus is on stablecoins | Opinion The SEC notice gives examples of readily liquid assets that should back a Covered Stablecoin which include USD cash equivalents, demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions, US Treasury securities, and/or money market funds registered under Section 8(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and do not include precious metals or other crypto assets. Covered Stablecoin issuers cannot co-mingle asset reserves with operational capital or offer token holders interest, profit, or yield opportunities. Additionally, the Covered Stablecoin issuers must never use their reserves for investing or market speculation. Covered Stablecoins don’t include algorithmic stablecoins that maintain their US dollar peg using software or an automated trading strategy, leaving the regulatory status of algorithmic stablecoins, synthetic dollars, and yield-bearing fiat tokens uncertain. In the US, industry leaders are pushing for regulatory changes that would allow stablecoin issuers to share yield opportunities with stablecoin holders and offer interest. The first such interest-bearing stablecoin was approved by the SEC and registered as a security in the United States a month ago. As Tim Bailey, VP of Global Business and Operations, Red Date Technology, said: “ We believe that there is market demand for government-regulated fiat-backed stablecoins and that this will help unleash the next wave of financial services innovation. Our UDPN Stablecoin Management System is ideal to help regulated stablecoin issuers build and operate these new services. ” Another company, M^0, is building a programmable stablecoin platform with Solana, enabling builders to launch feature-rich, branded digital dollars on one of the most scalable blockchains in the industry by offering digital-dollar building blocks, the best risk-free yield proxy on-chain without the need for cumbersome agreements with programmable yield distribution. As Joao Reginatto, Chief Strategy Officer at M^0, explained: “ Solana’s unmatched speed, scalability, and developer ecosystem make it a prime environment for stablecoin innovation. By bringing M^0’s platform to Solana, we’re empowering builders to create stablecoins that are not only interoperable, liquid, and tailored to their use cases, but that can also perform at any scale. This expansion is a key milestone in M^0’s vision to build the most comprehensive digital money technology stack for developers .” You might also like: The United States is focused on tokenized certificates of deposit Stablecoins as safe haven investments During the stock market blood bath, surprisingly, the US dollar weakened against the safe-haven Swiss franc as concerns about a global recession heightened following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs on trading partners. This announcement put in question the US dollar’s unofficial status as the world’s reserve currency , which stems from its relative stability compared to other currencies. Furthermore, the price of gold fell instead of rising as investors did not seek gold, a safe-haven asset to preserve their wealth. Instead, investors turned to stablecoins with Tether ( USDT ) leading the way with $144 billion. The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market fell by 18%, but the stablecoin sector remained relatively resilient, according to Finance Magnates. The total market cap for stablecoins surged past $230 billion, a 56% increase compared to the previous year, outpacing Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price trajectory, suggesting increased demand for stablecoins as a safe haven asset during the stock market downturn, making the SEC’s stablecoin advice very timely. William Quigley, a co-founder of Wax and Tether, in an interview with me, clarified that during market downturns, people might rush to buy Tether as a safe harbor, pushing its price slightly above a dollar. This behavior mirrors the ins and outs of conventional currency trading, where economic forces dictate value rather than a fixed peg. USDT is not pegged to the US dollar. “Tether has no peg. We do not maintain a peg.” The term “pegged” implies a strict one-to-one price ratio enforced at all times, a concept that Tether does not adhere to. Instead, Tether is redeemable for a dollar, meaning that it can be exchanged for a dollar, but the price can fluctuate in the market based on supply and demand dynamics.

While this provided some relief and eased immediate concerns, ongoing tensions with China kept investors cautious. In recent weeks, the crypto market has been rocked by volatility, largely driven by escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The White House’s decision to exempt electronic imports from China from reciprocal tariffs helped calm immediate fears. As the broader market stabilises, investors seeking asymmetric opportunities—early-stage assets with the potential for outsized returns—are increasingly turning to CartelFi , the new cartel-themed yield farming protocol. The project has already raised over $850K within just days of launching its presale, highlighting significant early interest. Why CartelFi is generating buzz CartelFi is positioning itself as a disruptive force at the convergence of meme culture and decentralized finance (DeFi), addressing a longstanding contradiction in crypto: the choice between the high-risk, high-reward potential of meme coins and the stability of yield-generating DeFi protocols. By offering specialized liquidity pools designed specifically for meme coins, CartelFi transforms typically idle speculative assets into productive capital. This model allows investors to retain exposure to the significant upside of meme coins while simultaneously earning yields traditionally associated with more stable DeFi assets. One of the key features of CartelFi’s protocol is its automatic buyback and burn mechanism, funded by up to 100% of collected fees. This creates a deflationary pressure, designed to support token value and add long-term growth potential. With billions of dollars’ worth of meme tokens sitting idle in wallets, CartelFi seeks to unlock this dormant capital. Its innovative approach aims to prove that meme coins can be more than speculative bets. What CartelFi is offering Yield farming for meme coins has remained an elusive concept—sought after, but never fully realized—until CartelFi emerged as a potential solution. In the current DeFi landscape, earning yield typically involves selling off volatile assets like PEPE or DOGE and reallocating to more stable, “responsible” assets such as stablecoins, ETH, or blue-chip tokens. These assets are placed in liquidity pools offering modest returns, often no higher than 5–10% APY. However, this approach presents a significant problem for meme coin holders. They are often forced to sell their tokens at inopportune moments, either locking in losses or exiting before a potential rally. This creates an inefficiency in the market, with tens of billions of dollars in meme coins sitting idle in wallets while holders await the next big pump. CartelFi aims to unlock this dormant capital by offering bespoke liquidity pools designed specifically for meme assets. These pools offer high-octane APYs—up to 300% on popular tokens like PEPE—allowing meme holders to earn yield without giving up exposure to potential moonshot gains. The presale everyone is watching The CartelFi presale has already secured over $850K from early backers. Structured as a 30-stage offering, the presale applies a 5% price increase at each stage — rewarding early entrants and creating built-in urgency for participation. Currently priced at $0.0305, the token is set to climb to $0.032 in the next phase, with investors from initial rounds positioned for substantial gains by the time CARTFI reaches public markets. CartelFi’s proposition — transforming dormant meme coin capital into yield-generating assets — offers a differentiated play. The presale is a rare opportunity to enter what the CartelFi team is calling the “first DeFi project turning memes into money printers.” Interested investors can head directly to the CartelFi website to learn more details.

The bounce was driven by macro relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs, easing trade tensions and reigniting risk appetite. Importantly, the rebound was powered by spot market demand rather than leveraged derivatives positioning, indicating genuine conviction among buyers. Bitcoin closed the week 6.67 percent higher, extending a 15 percent move from the lows and suggesting that the correction—now 83 days long and 31 percent deep—remains consistent with typical mid-cycle retracements seen in past bull markets. Bitcoin Price Drawdown Every Year Showing Max Price and Correction Phases (Source: CryptoQuant) Spot cumulative volume delta across major exchanges shows sustained aggressive buying, yet the price remains trapped within a $75,000 to $85,000 range. This divergence signals potential for an upside breakout if supply thins further. However, a short-term pullback early this week is expected , driven by profit-taking. The response to this dip—whether buyers continue absorbing supply—will determine if Bitcoin pushes toward $90,000. On-chain data adds confluence , with long-term holder accumulation turning positive for the first time since December. While early signals are constructive, confirmation of trend strength still depends on how demand holds up during any short-term weakness. In March, headline inflation offered what seemed like a brief reprieve, as the Consumer Price Index dipped slightly due to falling energy and transportation costs. However, beneath this temporary calm lies a looming storm: new trade tariffs, especially those recently enacted and threatened by the US administration, are poised to push prices higher in the coming months. Core inflation, particularly in services and housing, remains stubbornly elevated , reinforcing concerns that inflationary pressures are far from over. This precarious inflation outlook coincides with mounting instability in financial markets. A dramatic pivot in trade policy—first escalating tariffs, then hastily walking them back—has undermined global confidence in the US economic direction, triggering capital flight from US assets . US Dollar Index, DXY (Source: Tradingview) The dollar has weakened sharply, Treasury yields have surged , and volatility has spiked , revealing a market environment that is increasingly on edge. Even a short-lived rally in the S&P 500 failed to calm fears, as investors continue to grapple with the consequences of erratic policy moves. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment is plunging. The University of Michigan’s latest survey shows a steep drop in confidence and a shocking surge in inflation expectations to levels not seen since the early 1980s. Households now anticipate persistent inflation and rising unemployment, pulling back spending and bracing for economic hardship. This erosion in both financial and consumer confidence suggests that the US economy stands at a critical crossroads. With inflation fears clashing against slowing growth, the Federal Reserve faces a no-win scenario —likely postponing any rate cuts while walking a tightrope between controlling inflation and avoiding a full-blown recession. The convergence of tariff-driven inflation, policy-induced market volatility, and collapsing consumer confidence paints a stark warning: unless clarity and stability return soon, the US economy may be heading into its most challenging period since the pandemic. In crypto news last week, Galaxy Digital secured SEC approval to redomicile in Delaware and list on Nasdaq under the ticker GLXY—a strategic move that signals increasing acceptance of digital asset investments with traditional US capital markets. While this development underscores the legitimacy and scaling of crypto infrastructure, elsewhere, the risks of unregulated hype came into stark focus. In Argentina, a congressional inquiry has been launched into the failed Libra token, a Solana-based memecoin that President Javier Milei publicly endorsed before its value crashed by over 90 percent, wiping out billions in speculative market cap. What began as a political show of support for innovation quickly turned into a scandal, with lawmakers demanding accountability and some even calling for Milei’s impeachment. Meanwhile, in the US, North Carolina is charting a more cautious but optimistic course by introducing the Digital Asset Freedom Act , a bill that proposes allowing select cryptocurrencies for tax payments and transactions—provided they meet strict standards for liquidity, decentralisation, and long-term market integrity. With such divergent developments unfolding simultaneously—from institutional adoption to political fallout—the crypto landscape continues to evolve as both a vehicle of transformation and a mirror of the challenges that come with disruption.

43326969,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149207,1744631680,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Mantra Price Crash: Unveiling On-Chain Data Behind the Market Sell-Off,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/mantra-price-crash-market-selloff/,"The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and recent events surrounding Mantra (OM) have once again underscored this point. On April 14th, the price of OM experienced a sharp plunge, dipping below the critical $1 mark. Naturally, such a dramatic price movement triggers a wave of questions and speculation within the crypto community. Was it the early investors cashing out? Was there a fundamental flaw exposed? Or was it something else entirely? On-chain analytics firm Glassnode stepped in to provide clarity, offering a data-driven perspective on what truly fueled this Mantra price crash . Let’s dive deep into their findings and understand the real story behind OM’s recent market turbulence. Decoding the Mantra Price Crash: Beyond Early Holder Sell-Offs When a cryptocurrency’s price plummets, a common first assumption is that early investors, often sitting on substantial profits, have decided to sell off their holdings, triggering a cascade. However, Glassnode’s on-chain data analysis for the Mantra (OM) crash paints a different picture. According to their insights shared on X (formerly Twitter), there was no significant surge in exchange inflows from early holders before the price crash. This crucial piece of information immediately shifts the narrative away from the typical ‘early bird dump’ scenario. So, if it wasn’t the early holders, then what caused the market sell-off ? Glassnode’s analysis points towards a more widespread market phenomenon – retail panic and potential forced liquidations. Let’s break down the key on-chain indicators that support this conclusion: Top 1% Holder Concentration: This metric tracks the percentage of the total OM supply held by the top 1% of addresses. A sharp decrease in this concentration suggests that larger holders were selling, but not necessarily early investors from the project’s inception. These could be more recent, significant investors reacting to broader market pressures. Realized Cap Drop: Realized cap is calculated by valuing each unit of cryptocurrency at the price it was last moved on-chain. A sharp drop here indicates that a significant amount of OM tokens were sold at lower prices, reflecting a decrease in the aggregate value held by investors at their acquisition cost. This reinforces the idea of a widespread sell-off. Surge in Transfer Counts: An increase in the number of OM token transfers indicates heightened activity on the network. This can be a sign of panic selling as many holders rush to exit their positions. Active Address Count Spike: A rise in active addresses – unique addresses participating in transactions – further corroborates the surge in market participation, primarily driven by selling pressure. These on-chain signals collectively suggest that the Mantra price crash wasn’t an isolated event triggered by a select group of early holders. Instead, it appears to be a broader market reaction, possibly amplified by: Retail Panic: Fear and uncertainty in the broader crypto market can lead to retail investors selling off their holdings, often at a loss, to avoid further potential downsides. This ‘panic selling’ can exacerbate price declines. Forced Liquidations: In leveraged trading, a price drop can trigger automatic liquidation of positions if the collateral falls below a certain threshold. Widespread liquidations can create a cascading effect, further pushing prices down. Why On-Chain Analysis Matters for OM Price Analysis The Mantra (OM) price crash episode highlights the immense value of on-chain analysis in understanding cryptocurrency market dynamics. Unlike traditional financial markets where data can be opaque and fragmented, blockchain transactions are transparent and recorded on a public ledger. This allows firms like Glassnode to analyze real-time data and provide insights that go beyond surface-level price charts. Benefits of On-Chain Analysis: Transparency: Blockchain data is publicly accessible, allowing for independent verification and analysis. Real-time Insights: On-chain metrics provide up-to-the-minute information on network activity, holder behavior, and fund flows. Deeper Understanding: On-chain data helps uncover the underlying reasons behind price movements, going beyond simple price action. Identifying Trends: By tracking on-chain metrics over time, analysts can identify emerging trends and potential market shifts. Risk Assessment: On-chain analysis can help assess the health and risk profile of a cryptocurrency network and its ecosystem. Challenges of Relying Solely on On-Chain Data: Data Interpretation: Interpreting on-chain data requires expertise and understanding of various metrics and their nuances. Incomplete Picture: While on-chain data is valuable, it doesn’t capture all market factors. Off-chain events, macroeconomic conditions, and news sentiment also play significant roles. Privacy Concerns: While transactions are transparent, linking addresses to real-world identities can be challenging and raise privacy concerns. Data Overload: The sheer volume of on-chain data can be overwhelming, requiring sophisticated tools and techniques for effective analysis. Actionable Insights from the OM Market Sell-Off So, what can we learn from the Mantra (OM) price crash and Glassnode’s OM price analysis ? Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Don’t Panic Sell: Market volatility is inherent in crypto. Reacting emotionally to price drops can lead to losses. Consider a long-term investment strategy and avoid impulsive selling based on short-term fluctuations. Look Beyond Price Charts: Price charts are just one piece of the puzzle. Delve into on-chain data and fundamental analysis to gain a more comprehensive understanding of a cryptocurrency’s health and potential. Understand Market Sentiment: Pay attention to broader market trends and sentiment. A general market downturn can impact even fundamentally strong projects. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification can help mitigate risk. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a volatile market like crypto. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with market news, on-chain analysis, and project developments to make informed investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto Volatility with Data-Driven Insights The Mantra (OM) price crash serves as a potent reminder of the crypto market’s inherent volatility and the importance of data-driven decision-making. Glassnode’s on-chain analysis effectively debunked the initial assumption of an early holder sell-off, revealing a more nuanced picture of retail panic and broader market pressures driving the price decline. By understanding and utilizing on-chain data, investors can move beyond speculation and gain a deeper, more informed perspective on market dynamics, ultimately navigating the turbulent waters of cryptocurrency investing with greater confidence and resilience.

Gold is at an all time high, demand for silver is exploding, and Bitcoin is roaring.Gold is at an all time high, demand for silver is exploding, and Bitcoin is roaring.” In a separate post earlier last week, the author said he plans to continue building his own ‘standard’ around these assets to weather what he calls the ‘DOGE CHAINSAW MASSACRE ’—his term for the Trump administration’s economic policy. Kiyosaki’s strategy holds strong amid Trump-driven market volatility Kiyosaki’s warnings come amid heightened market volatility, triggered by the U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent tariff announcements. Wall Street has just experienced its most turbulent trading week since the pandemic-era crash of 2020, with the S&P 500 now down more than 10% since Trump returned to office in January.

According to a recent report by Finbold, while Bitcoin’s short-term losses have slightly weighed on overall returns, the strength of gold and silver continues to support his long-held view that hard assets serve as a reliable hedge against inflation and financial instability.

The most important Bitcoin ( BTC ) resistance level currently sits at $99,500, and it held firm in the weeks preceding the tariff selloff. Despite having crashed below $80,000 in the aftermath of the tariff exchange, BTC prices recovered rather quickly. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency was changing hands at a price of $84,750, having rallied by 10.37% in the past seven days. BTC price 1-week chart. Source: Finbold As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is still down 9.38% since the year began. However, a surge to $99,500 would see it back in the green on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Here’s why that is a distinct possibility. Bullish divergence suggests Bitcoin resistance will soon be retested Noted cryptocurrency technical analyst TradingShot outlined several arguments as to why a surge in BTC price could ensue in the immediate term in an April 14 TradingView post . For one, Saturday’s close on the daily chart is above the asset’s 50-day moving average ( MA ). This is the first time this has occurred since February 3. Up to this point, price had tested the MA 6 times, only to get rejected in each case. Moreover, recent price action has breached a trendline of lower highs charted since the January 20 all-time high (ATH) — if just barely. BTC price chart with technical analysis. Source: TradingShot on TradingView Lastly, all of this has happened in conjunction with Bitcoin marking lower lows in terms of prices, as well as lower highs in terms of its Relative Strength Index ( RSI ), indicating a bullish divergence that suggests the asset will not trend toward oversold levels going forward. In such instances, traders use a 2.0 Fibonacci extension level as a price target. This time around, it sits at the $99,500 mark — which happens to be the Bitcoin resistance level that was in effect before the tariff selloff. However, readers should note that this is far from a foregone conclusion. Despite promising institutional adoption , roughly 25% of Bitcoin’s total supply is currently held at a loss . As positive as a retesting of Bitcoin resistance levels could be, it would also provide ample opportunity for risk-averse investors to liquidate their positions at a profit.

Back in the roaring days of crypto enthusiasm, numerous blockchain platforms emerged, boldly proclaiming their superiority to Ethereum. They promised faster speeds, lower fees, and revolutionary features, all aimed at dethroning the king. But fast forward to today, and the landscape looks dramatically different. A recent analysis by crypto trader @IGNIS_ratio sheds light on the current state of these once-vaunted ETH Competitors , revealing a rather sobering reality: many have not only failed to surpass Ethereum but have significantly fallen behind. Let’s dive into this eye-opening assessment and see what went wrong for these aspiring rivals. The Rise and Fall of “Ethereum Killers”: A Crypto Market Analysis The term “Ethereum Killer” itself was a powerful marketing tool. It tapped into the inherent human desire for disruption and the crypto community’s constant search for the next big thing. These platforms, often referred to as Layer-1 blockchains, presented themselves as superior alternatives, addressing perceived shortcomings of Ethereum, such as scalability and gas fees. But as we delve deeper into the analysis, a clear picture emerges: hype and promises aren’t enough in the fiercely competitive crypto market analysis . Let’s examine some of the key contenders and their current standing: EOS (now Vaulta): Once a darling of the crypto world, EOS launched with grand ambitions of being a faster, feeless Ethereum alternative. However, the promise quickly faded. Developer interest waned, users migrated elsewhere, and EOS, now rebranded as Vaulta, struggles to maintain relevance. It serves as a stark example of how initial hype can dissipate without sustained innovation and community support. TRON (TRX): TRON carved a niche for itself by hosting USDT transactions, leveraging Ethereum-based code initially. While it achieved some level of adoption for stablecoin transfers, its broader ecosystem remains underdeveloped. Developer activity is minimal, and overall platform activity is low, indicating a lack of organic growth and innovation beyond its initial use case. NEO: Dubbed the “Ethereum of China” back in the 2017 crypto boom, NEO generated significant buzz. However, the platform has largely become inactive. Occasional mentions and questions about its continued operation highlight its struggle for survival in the rapidly evolving blockchain space. The “Ethereum of China” narrative clearly hasn’t translated into sustained global impact. Cardano (ADA): Cardano, with its emphasis on academic rigor and peer-reviewed research, adopted a different approach. While it boasts a dedicated community and ongoing developer activity, particularly around staking, its user base is largely composed of passive stakers rather than active participants in a vibrant ecosystem. The focus on theoretical foundations hasn’t yet translated into widespread real-world adoption to rival Ethereum. Polkadot (DOT): Polkadot introduced the concept of a parachain ecosystem, aiming for interoperability and scalability. Despite its innovative architecture and active development, Polkadot struggles with a critical challenge: a lack of active users on its parachains. Building the infrastructure is only half the battle; attracting and retaining users is crucial for long-term success, and this remains a hurdle for Polkadot. MultiversX (EGLD): Initially conceived as a subnet platform, MultiversX (formerly Elrond) aimed for high throughput and scalability. However, current activity appears to be largely confined to promotional activities on Discord and limited real-world usage. The vision of a thriving subnet ecosystem hasn’t fully materialized into widespread adoption. Algorand (ALGO): Created by an MIT professor and boasting impressive technological foundations, Algorand has struggled to gain traction. Despite its technical merits and focus on security and scalability, adoption among both developers and users remains low. Technical superiority alone doesn’t guarantee success in the competitive blockchain platforms landscape; community and ecosystem growth are equally vital. Tezos (XTZ): Tezos focused heavily on formal governance and on-chain upgrades. It found some niche success in the NFT space, thanks to its lower fees compared to Ethereum. However, much of its user base has moved on, and its overall ecosystem activity remains limited. Governance alone hasn’t been enough to maintain a leading position in the rapidly changing crypto world. Avalanche (AVAX): Avalanche initially positioned itself as a direct Ethereum rival, emphasizing speed and scalability. However, it has arguably become more of a competitor within its own subnet ecosystem rather than a true Ethereum challenger. Investor interest has also waned, reflecting a shift in market perception and priorities. Sonic (formerly Fantom): Fantom, now Sonic, experienced periods of growth, particularly during the DeFi boom. However, it has also been marked by instability, attributed to inconsistent leadership and fluctuating development priorities. This instability has hindered its ability to establish itself as a reliable and long-term competitor. Solana (SOL): Perhaps the most resilient of the contenders, Solana has weathered numerous challenges, including seven major outages. Despite these technical difficulties, Solana has managed to survive, largely due to strong meme coin culture and retail investor support. This demonstrates the power of community and sentiment in the crypto space, even in the face of technical shortcomings. Why Did These Blockchain Platforms Fall Behind Ethereum? Several factors contributed to the struggles of these Ethereum Killers . Firstly, network effects are incredibly powerful in the blockchain space. Ethereum benefited from being first-mover in many key areas like DeFi and NFTs, building a massive ecosystem of developers, users, and applications. It’s incredibly difficult to displace a platform with such a strong network effect. Secondly, developer adoption is paramount. Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the crypto world. Developers build the applications and infrastructure that drive user adoption. Many of the “ETH Killers” struggled to attract and retain developers, leading to less robust ecosystems. Thirdly, innovation and adaptation are crucial. Ethereum, despite its age, has continued to innovate and adapt, notably with the ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 and Layer-2 scaling solutions. Platforms that failed to evolve and address emerging challenges quickly lost ground. Finally, marketing and community building play a significant role. While technology is important, effectively communicating the value proposition and building a strong, engaged community are essential for long-term success. Some platforms excelled in marketing hype initially but failed to deliver on substance or maintain community engagement over time. Analyzing Altcoin Performance: Beyond the “ETH Killer” Narrative Looking beyond the simplistic “ETH Killer” narrative, it’s crucial to analyze the broader altcoin performance landscape. While many platforms have struggled to directly compete with Ethereum, some have found niches and achieved varying degrees of success. Solana’s resilience, for example, demonstrates that alternative blockchains can still thrive by focusing on specific strengths and community building, even without directly dethroning Ethereum. It’s also important to recognize that the crypto space is constantly evolving. New platforms and technologies emerge, and market dynamics shift rapidly. The platforms discussed above are not necessarily “dead,” but they are facing significant headwinds in their quest to challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Some may pivot, adapt, and find renewed relevance, while others may continue to fade into obscurity. The Future of Blockchain Platforms: Coexistence and Specialization? Perhaps the future of blockchain platforms isn’t about a single dominant chain, but rather a more diverse and specialized ecosystem. Ethereum may continue to be the dominant platform for many applications, particularly DeFi and high-value NFTs, but other blockchains may find success in specific niches, such as gaming, supply chain management, or identity solutions. Interoperability and cross-chain communication will likely become increasingly important, allowing different blockchains to work together and leverage each other’s strengths. The story of the “Ethereum Killers” serves as a valuable lesson in the crypto space. Technological promises and initial hype are not enough for long-term success. Building strong network effects, fostering vibrant developer communities, continuous innovation, and effective community engagement are all crucial ingredients for any blockchain platform aiming to thrive in this dynamic and competitive market. In conclusion, while many platforms once positioned as ETH Competitors have indeed fallen behind, the crypto landscape remains dynamic and full of potential. Ethereum’s dominance is undeniable, but the space for innovation and niche specialization remains open. The future may not be about “killing” Ethereum, but rather about building a more diverse and interconnected blockchain ecosystem where different platforms coexist and cater to specific needs and use cases.

Early investors who caught the wave from fractions of a cent to all-time highs reaped life-changing profits — at one point, XRP delivered an estimated 70x return from cycle bottom to top. But fast forward to 2025 , and XRP now behaves more like a legacy asset than a moonshot.

43327451,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=709863,1744632024,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43327451.jpeg,Nvidia and Apple shorts are a trick bull and bear trade – Jim Cramer,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-apple-shorts-bull-bear-trade-cramer/,"CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer has warned traders that short positions in tech giants Nvidia and Apple may be a bull-bear trap for the market. Hedge funds are still grappling with a sudden market upturn from last Wednesday, where several short traders were liquidated when US President Trump paused tariffs on several nations for 90 days. “ Nvidia and Apple are so heavily shorted that I don’t think the shorts are going to play their hands first ,” Cramer posted on X Monday. “ They are going to let them rally and hit them again. That’s the only way they can get out of this mess because they can cover after they drive them down a bit. ” Short squeeze sees the market going into chaos According to Goldman Sachs’ prime brokerage data, hedge funds had amassed a record number of short bets on US equities before last Wednesday’s trading session. Many traders believed there could be a massive economic fallout from Trump’s tariffs. But stocks rocketed higher as the administration unexpectedly walked back some of its threats. Hedge funds were forced to cover en masse, which sent the S&P 500 soaring 9.5% in a single day, its third-largest gain since World War II. Per Goldman, the most-shorted stocks surged by an even more staggering 12.5% when traders rushed to unwind bearish positions in a classic short squeeze. “ You can’t catch a move. When you see someone short covering, the exit doors become so small because of these crowded trades ,” said Jeff Kilburg, CEO and CIO at KKM Financial. Looking at Monday’s pre-market open session, both Nvidia and Apple equities have not moved below their 5-day lows. According to Google Finance data, the former has seen an uptick of about 26% since April 8, while the latter has gone up by 12.3% simultaneously. Cramer says the stocks will go low again to incentivize short sellers to try their luck again. Oppenheimer’s trading desk called the whipsaw in tech stocks “extreme,” saying that the rise wasn’t just driven by short covering and “real buyers adding on to higher quality semis.” Wednesday’s rally was also fueled by unusually thin market liquidity. Goldman Sachs reported that the depth of E-Mini S&P 500 futures, a gauge of market liquidity, hit an all-time low of $2 million on Monday. Long-only institutional funds also bought heavily into tech stocks during the final three hours of Wednesday’s session, per the Bank of America. Still, many traders credit the scale of the rally to the mass unwinding of short positions. “ The pain on the short side is palpable ,” one trader noted. “ This was more than just technical, it was panic buying. ” Markets did pull back the next day when traders sobered up to the ongoing economic threat of high tariffs and trade uncertainty. Yet, like the Mad Money host, analysts say the short squeeze may not be over. “ Short covering is far from over ,” Bank of America’s trading desk wrote. “ There’s no shot the market de-risked in under three hours after seven weeks of leverage reduction and 20%+ downside in the SPX Index .” March short interest clocked multi-year highs Supporting Cramer’s thesis, Nasdaq data shows that at the March 31, 2025 settlement date, short interest across 4,765 Nasdaq-listed securities totaled 15.75 billion shares, up from 15.66 billion two weeks earlier. The number represents 2.14 days of average daily volume, up from 1.88 days in mid-March. The Nasdaq Global Market saw 13.07 billion shares shorted across 3,140 securities, with average daily volume rising to 2.64 days. The Nasdaq Capital Market logged 2.68 billion shares shorted in 1,625 issues, a noticeable uptick. Even with recent rallies, bearish bets are still substantial, and traders will be counting on the tug-of-war between the US and China trade policy to continue with more market volatility. Goldman Sachs says that nine out of 11 S&P 500 sectors were net sold last week, with financials, technology, and consumer discretionary seeing the heaviest outflows. Selling in financials was the fastest since January 2021 and the second-highest ever recorded. “ Lower prices drew out huge selling from many corners of our franchise ,” Pasquariello noted. “ People are just getting into self-protection mode .” Meanwhile, the S&P 500 climbed to 5,419.04 on Monday, a 1.81% gain or 95.31 points from the previous trading session. Over the past four weeks, the index has advanced 4.51%, while its year-over-year performance reflects a 7.06% increase. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

On April 14, CoinShares reported that crypto ETPs saw $795 million in outflows last week, with Bitcoin ( BTC )-based products accounting for $751 million, while Ether ( ETH ) products followed with $37.6 million. While the major tokens saw increased outflows, some altcoins went against the flow, seeing small gains. These included XRP, Ondo Finance, Algorand and Avalanche. According to CoinShares, the total outflows of crypto ETPs since February have reached $7.2 billion, nearly wiping out the year-to-date (YTD) inflows from the investment products. Tariff activity weighs in on crypto ETPs CoinShares head of research James Butterfill attributed the outflows to the recent tariff-related activities initiated by United States President Donald Trump. On April 2, Trump signed an executive order imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports from all countries. The president also set reciprocal tariffs for countries that charge tariffs on US imports. The Trump administration then continued flip-flopping over tariff policy , bringing market uncertainty. Butterfill wrote that the “wave of negative sentiment” that started in February has resulted in record outflows of $7.2 billion. The outflows have nearly wiped out all the YTD inflows, now amounting to $165 million. In addition to Bitcoin and Ether-based products, altcoins like Solana, Aave and Sui also collectively saw outflows of over $6 million last week. While Bitcoin-related products have also seen huge outflows, its YTD gains still stand at $545 million. Furthermore, short-Bitcoin products also saw outflows totaling $4.6 million.

It all started when a wallet possibly linked to the OM team deposited 3.9 million OM tokens on OKX, which alerted the community since the team controls nearly 90% of the total OM supply. Although Mantra claims limited involvement, internal moves and the market reactions have triggered the dramatic sell-off. Over the past year, the OM team has faced criticisms for price manipulation. The latest deposit triggered a chain reaction that sent the token’s value in a downward spiral. Cascading Liquidation Sent The Token Crashing Down After this deposit, massive sell-off began sparking rumours of earlier OTC deals at steeper discounts possibly as high as 50%. The token’s value continued to decline which led to panic selling and a cascading liquidation effect that sent the price to its breaking point. Mantra co-founder JP Mullin said that the price drop was caused by ‘reckless liquidations’. Meanwhile Binance stepped in to clarify that the cross-exchange liquidations led to OM’s crash. A Major Scandal OKX CEO Star Xu called the OM token crash a major scandal for the crypto industry. He noted that all onchain data like token unlocks, deposits and liquidations is public and can be reviewed. He also promised that OKX will release detailed reports. This comes after a report revealed that 17 wallets including two linked to investor Laser Digital had sent $227 million worth of OM to exchange just before the crash. Mantra assured its community that the team did not move any tokens during the crash and the project remains strong. However, crypto expert ZachXBT questioned the sudden drop and felt that the team’s explanation did little to imrove the situation. OKX Increases Risk Controls After OM Token Changes and Suspicious Activity OKX also reported that significant changes were made to the OM token’s tokenomics starting in October 2024. The exchange also noted unusual large-scale activity involving similar addresses on the blockchain since March 2025. In response, OKX adjusted its risk controls and advised users to exercise caution due to heightened market risks OM Rebounds 200% The token rebounded 200% after 90% crash reaching $1.10. The project’s co-founder JP Mullin confirmed that the project was still active, with its official Telegram group remaining online. $OM #OMUSDT Almost 100% wiped.

On April 14, Quinn Thompson took to X to issue his renewed warning regarding Ondo Finance (ONDO) in the light of the recent Mantra debacle , stating “In light of the recent Mantra $OM token scam, probably prudent to recirculate this thread on $ONDO in case it saves at least one person from the eventual financial ruin.” In the post, Thompson resurfaced his earlier thread from March 18, where he asked on-chain investigators to confirm whether Ondo Finance’s Total Value Locked is artificially inflated by the team selling tokens and redirecting the proceeds back into the protocol to create the illusion of organic user adoption. “Can one of the on-chain investigators confirm for me if it is true that the majority of Ondo’s TVL… is from the team’s selling of $ONDO tokens with the proceeds funneled back into the protocol to give off the appearance of organic growth?” he wrote. You might also like: Mantra CEO blames 90% OM token crash on forced exchange liquidations To support his claims, Thompson resurfaced his post from October 2024, where he criticized the project’s $7B fully diluted valuation despite generating no revenue and offering products (USDY and OUSG) that are “just wrappers on Blackrock’s BUIDL .” He also pointed to the company’s 0.15% take rate—which had been waived until 2025, meaning the protocol was earning no revenue despite its sizable TVL. He argued that once the fee kicks in, users will likely move their funds to BUIDL because it’s safer, cheaper, and has better yields. Even if Ondo does start charging the fee, it would only earn about $975K annually. “That is over a 7,000x FDV / revenue multiple on a near-zero margin business with no moat and increasing competition,” he added. In response, one user @TimiBot commented , “Thought this was on open secret,” attaching a screenshot of what appears to be a circulated message from a Telegram group. The message outlines the alleged mechanics behind Ondo’s inflated TVL. Source: @Trim_Bot This suggests that, while the TVL funds are real, Ondo Finance’s TVL metric is misleading as much of the capital in Ondo’s protocol isn’t fueling DeFi, but is instead parked in tokenized U.S. Treasury Bills, which are low-risk, traditional financial instruments. To tie it all together, Ondo Finance may be leveraging artificial inflation of TVL by selling their own ONDO and then taking that cash and putting it back into their own protocol. The funds invested in T-Bills are also part of the reported TVL, but they’re not actually being used for DeFi activities like lending, borrowing, or trading. Both of these tactics create a misleading picture of the protocol’s actual adoption.

Google is changing its advertising policy for crypto services in the European Union, requiring businesses to follow the Markets in Crypto-Assets rules. Starting April 23, companies that want to advertise crypto exchanges and software wallets on Google in the European bloc must be licensed as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider under the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation by a “relevant national competent authority,” Google said in its official notice. The updated policy covers 30 countries, including Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. In addition to MiCA licensing, Google said advertisers must also comply “with all other local legal requirements, including any national-level restrictions or requirements beyond MiCA” and be “certified by Google.” You might also like: Google to let users access their Bitcoin wallets via Google accounts Some countries will have a transition period where existing licenses remain valid.

The deadlines for the transition period vary by country. For Finland it lasts until June 30, while for Germany it’s until December 30. After the deadline, only MiCA licenses will be accepted, the announcement reads. Google added that it will give advertisers a warning before taking action on any violations.

Meanwhile, due to Bitcoin’s poor performance, the Strategy reported a net loss of $5.91 billion on its Bitcoin holdings.

The MSTR stock has also rebounded amid this announcement, surging alongside the Bitcoin price. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy Acquires 3,459 Bitcoin In a press release , Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, announced that it acquired 3,459 bitcoin for $285.8 million at an average price of $82,618 per BTC. The company also achieved a BTC yield of 11.4% year-to-date (YTD) in the process. This announcement comes just a day after Michael Saylor hinted at the company buying Bitcoin last week. Following this latest purchase, Strategy now holds 531,644 BTC, which it acquired for $35.92 billion at an average price of $67,556 per Bitcoin. The software company remains the public company with the largest Bitcoin holdings, well ahead of MARA holdings. The recent purchase is a positive for BTC, especially considering that Strategy halted its Bitcoin purchase two weeks ago, which raised concerns about whether Saylor’s firm was choosing to wait on the sidelines amid the market downtrend. However, MicroStrategy still has the capital to acquire more Bitcoin in the foreseeable future, which is bullish for the Bitcoin price. This year, the company has announced plans to raise almost $22 billion through stock sales to acquire more Bitcoin.

While the price has held support for now, momentum is weak, and on-chain sentiment still leans bearish, suggesting any upside might be limited unless the buyers reclaim key resistance levels. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi The Daily Chart ETH’s daily structure remains heavily bearish. The asset continues to trade below the 200-day moving average, located around the $2,800 mark, and has printed multiple lower highs and lower lows over the past two months. After breaking below the $1,800–$2,000 range last week, ETH is struggling to hold onto the $1,550 support zone. The RSI also remains suppressed, hovering just above oversold levels, and momentum indicators show no strong bullish divergence. A break below $1,550 would open the door toward the next major demand zone around $1,300–$1,400, while reclaiming $1,900 is needed to slow the current bearish trend. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH has recently bounced from the $1,550 support but now faces a major descending trendline that has acted as dynamic resistance for over a month. The price is currently testing the $1,650–$1,700 intraday resistance range. A breakout above the trendline and a successful flip of this zone could trigger a short-term rally toward $1,800. However, sellers remain active at every bounce, and the market structure still favors lower highs unless ETH can close above $1,700 and hold. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Taker Buy-Sell Ratio The Taker Buy Sell Ratio for ETH trends below 1, signaling that market orders are predominantly sell-driven. While there’s been an uptick in recent days, the overall trend remains bearish, suggesting the bounce is not backed by strong demand. This aligns with the lack of bullish conviction on the charts. Until the ratio shifts decisively above 1 and sustains, buyer aggression will likely remain weak. In short, the sentiment shows lingering fear, and the broader trend points toward further downside unless the buyers can force a shift in structure and volume.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. In a post-FTX world where trust is scarce, Hola Prime is shaking up crypto prop trading with 1-hour payouts, transparent terms, and trader-first features. Table of Contents Overview Hola Prime Features of Hola Prime Competitions and other activities Awards Pros and cons Public review Conclusion It’s been over two years since the disastrous FTX fiasco. Yet, the lingering anxiety of the incident is still deeply prevalent that every time there’s a slight delay in withdrawal, crypto investors feel their heart rates gallop. In the high-stakes world of prop trading, the fear is even more palpable. Even today, despite the constant criticisms of the functioning of prop trading firms, traders still have to jump through hoops to withdraw their hard-earned money, facing unexpected payout delays, unclear terms, and sudden account closures. But, are all prop trading firms riddled with these issues? Before we venture into the world of prop trading, let’s recall what prop trading is. When traders use a company’s funds to trade financial products, such as cryptocurrencies, to earn gains, it is known as proprietary trading (shortened to prop trading). The company that provides the capital is the prop trading firm. Prop trading companies do not conduct any trades by themselves. However, with their capital, they engage in the financial markets through traders. If the trader makes a profit, this amount is shared between the trader and the prop trading company. The percentage split of the profit is based on a pre-determined contract. But, if the trader makes a loss, the prop trading company bears the loss entirely. This means that the prop trading company takes the full risk of the trade. Modern Prop trading firms have taken this one step further by letting traders monetize their demo trading. So, instead of giving traders actual capital accounts, they get virtual funds to trade in a simulated trading environment. Today, we’ll take a look at an up-and-coming prop trading firm that aims to solve many of the challenges in the sector. Overview Website: https://holaprimex.com/ Sector: Crypto Prop trading Payout processing time: 1 hour Minimum payout period: 7 days Leverage: Up to 5x Customer support: 24/7 live chat Global reach: Presence in 175+ countries Hola Prime Hola Prime is a leading prop trading firm. Established in 2024, it is now introducing on-exchange cryptocurrency trading, giving traders direct access to centralized exchange-sourced pricing and a deep liquidity pool via its new website dedicated exclusively to crypto prop trading. The platform has a presence in over 175 countries and has five offices around the world. The company employs over 100 finance professionals and provides 24/7 customer service to its clients. By integrating on-exchange feed access with Prop trading, Hola Prime ensures that traders get access to funds for trading from Hola Prime, and are able to trade cryptos directly from the exchange price feed, without hidden markups or artificial spreads. The company’s Managing Director and CEO, Somesh Kapuria, was a former senior executive at Citibank in New York and BlackRock. He brings a wealth of experience to the project. On its website, the company states that transparency is at the core of all its operations. They ensure no hidden fees or unexpected surprises so that traders can focus on trading. The platform aims for a win-win opportunity where traders can access substantial Hola Prime Accounts and 100+ cryptocurrencies available to trade, giving traders access to multiple altcoins. The firm’s model eliminates unnecessary intermediaries, allowing for tight spreads, faster execution, and deeper market access. Does Hola Prime fulfill these promises? Let’s take a deeper look at the features of this up-and-coming platform and what the public thinks about this new project. Features of Hola Prime 1-hour payout processing and 10-point payout system : Hola Prime offers several interesting features that set it apart from its competitors. One of its most striking characteristics is its fast payout processing. Hola Prime completes its payments within just one hour. Most other trading platforms require a minimum of 24 hours to process payments, with some even delaying payments for up to 4 working days. According to Hola Prime’s CFO Sumedha, the platform follows a 10-point payout system and completes their calculations at the end of each day to ensure payouts are ready in advance for the next day. Reasonable 7-day minimum payout period: At Hola Prime, the minimum payout period — which is the minimum amount of time a trader has to wait after earning profits before they can withdraw it — is 7 days. While there are platforms like Funding Pips that offer a 1-day minimum payout period, most trading platforms take at least 14 days. Extensive crypto access via MT5 and DX trade: Hola Prime provides over 110+ cryptocurrencies for trading, compared with just 5 to 10 typically available in Forex CFDs. Furthermore, these 110+ cryptos are going to be available to trade on DX Trade and also MT5, which is the most popular trading platform. This feature of being able to trade using on exchange crypto price feed, on MT5 is currently not available on any other firm in the industry. Lower spreads and better execution from exchange price feeds: Moreover, Hola Prime offers lower spreads because the underlying source of the price feed is directly the crypto exchanges. In addition to lower spreads, it also results in better execution because of a deeper liquidity pool. This is not the case in Forex CFDs, where the nature of the product is a CFD (i.e. a derivative), and these CFD prices are sourced from the Forex LPs. Challenge fee refund and high profit split: Likewise, Hola Prime refunds 100% of the challenge fee that they charge for the Prime Challenge. For readers who are not aware of challenge fees: Prop trading firms usually require traders to pass a challenge to prove their skills before giving them access to the firm’s money. This challenge comes with a fee. Hola Prime refunds the entire amount once traders pass their challenge. Hola Prime’s rewards split is admirable as it provides traders 95% of the earnings with 0 fees. Compared with other crypto leading firms, Hola Prime presents the best split. Flexible evaluation models and balance-based drawdown rules: There are Evaluation models with both 1-Step and 2-Step Prime options and a unique No Evaluation-Direct Model for traders to directly join the crypto prop space. When it comes to balance-based drawdown, Hola Prime emerges as one of the most flexible platforms. A balance-based drawdown is a rule that limits how much a trader can lose based on their account balance. Firms such as Funding Pips and Alpha Capital have stricter terms when compared with Hola Prime, which can be limiting to traders. 5x leverage on BTC and ETH with no restrictions: Hola Prime also provides leverage of up to 5x on Bitcoin and Ethereum with no restrictions. This is a higher leverage than what traders get when trading cryptos in the Forex CFD market. It’s another feature that gives traders more flexibility in their trades. Transparency reports and risk alerts: Perhaps one of the most distinguishing features of Hola Prime is its transparency reports and risk alerts. As per Ashutosh Sharma, Head of Risk and Compliance at Hola Prime, the transparency report is just as crucial for the firm as it is for its traders, as it guarantees that its liquidity providers offer prices that are in line with the market, fostering accountability at every level. It’s important to note that none of the other major platforms offer transparency reports or risk alerts, making these stand-out features for the platform. For the first time in the Prop trading industry, Hola Prime has established a Risk and Compliance Department. This department takes care of due diligence, risk monitoring, AML, internal audits, and daily account reconciliations, among other matters. Free competitions and affiliate program: In addition to all of the above features, another intriguing element of Hola Prime is that it has free competitions. This perk gives traders a chance to participate without extra costs. What’s more, Hola Prime has an affiliate commission program and provides up to 20% commission. Prime academy and 24/7 human support: They also have live chat support where users can connect to human customer service round the clock. Lastly, the platform is also preparing to start an exclusive program called “Prime Academy,” where traders can book one-on-one coaching sessions with highly experienced market professionals.

Earlier this year, the platform launched its Prime Bowl 5-Day Trading Challenge, a competition created to challenge traders in an intense, high-stakes environment. Hola Prime also runs an epic Market Rumble Competition on its website, where traders can win $5k in cash rewards and other exciting prizes. What’s more, Hola Prime sets a good example by helping the communities it operates in. The platform’s CSR initiatives have benefited several rural communities and organizations in India. The firm’s volunteer workers have built playfields for children, prepared meals for patients with leprosy, provided children battling cancer with art supplies, and have even planted 300 trees as part of its sustainability mission. Awards Hola Prime won the “Best Newcomer Prop Firm” award from the Funded Trading Awards. The Funded Trading Awards honors top-performing prop firms globally. Hola Prime has also been recognized as the “Most Trusted Prop Firm of February 2025” and “Global Prop Firm of The Month of March 2025” by Forex Prop Reviews. Adding to these achievements, the firm has also been featured in leading publications such as Forbes, FXMAG, FXStreet, among others. Pros and cons Hola Prime has various features that work in its favor: 1-hour payouts, transparency reports, risk alerts, 95% profits, refunded challenge fees, leverage up to 5x, fair drawdown limits, etc. The firm offers funding options of up to $100k, with the potential to scale accounts to $4 million, so that traders have access to the capital they need to trade well. Nevertheless, Hola Prime is a relatively new platform, and it lacks a track record, which might be concerning to some traders. And even though the minimum payout period of seven days is reasonable, some competitors offer quicker access to funds. Public review Hola Prime has received a rating of 4.9 out of 5 from 1,308 reviews on Forex Prop Reviews. The platform also maintains a 4.8-star rating on TrustIndex.io. On Reviews.io, 100% of the firm’s reviewers recommend the platform to other traders, with one verified buyer stating, “I recently requested a payout, and I was amazed at how fast it was! In just one hour, the payout was in my account. It’s really quick.” Conclusion The crypto prop trading space has always been plagued with issues such as hidden markups or artificial spreads, a lack of transparency, slow payout processing, and rigid trading practices. But firms today are addressing these concerns with smart solutions. With its 1-hour payouts, transparency reports, tight spreads, and flexible trading programs, Hola Prime aims to revive the space with a more trader-friendly approach. It remains to be seen whether Hola Prime can achieve this goal, but so far, its efforts are commendable.

This prevailing positive sentiment has evoked speculations of a potential bullish trend. Driven by this current uptrend, experts believe that XRP could possibly hit a massive high of $20. XRP Surges Past $2.2; What’s the Next Target? Amid significant developments within the Ripple ecosystem, the XRP price is experiencing notable upticks. After a week of trading below $2, XRP has finally recovered, exhibiting a notable resurgence. According to market expert, Crypto Crusaders, the XRP price is awaiting a significant uptrend , targeting an ambitious $20 mark. XRP’s Current Performance As of now, XRP is trading at $2.14, marking a massive 20% increase over the past seven days. Despite this weekly uptick, XRP has seen declines of 2.2% and 10% over the last day and month, respectively. Though traders and investors are confident about XRP’s potential rally, the overall market sentiment remains negative. The 24-hour trading volume of XRP has plummeted by 4%, currently at $3.98 billion. XRP Dipped Below $1.8 Despite Crucial Ripple Lawsuit Updates Over the past few weeks, the Ripple vs XRP case has seen major developments, invoking optimism within the community. Of this, Ripple’s withdrawal of its cross-appeal , after the US SEC dropped its appeal, has marked a significant turning point in the Ripple vs SEC case. Despite these significant developments, the XRP price continued to trade below $2, sometimes dipping to a low of $1.7. However, the altcoin’s recent rebound has lifted traders’ spirits, easing some of the anxiety and skepticism fueled by its earlier dips. While the community remains optimistic about XRP’s future amid the Ripple lawsuit settlement, All Things XRP advises taking a realistic outlook for the coin’s price . Is XRP Price Poised for Further Upticks? Expert Insights According to analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO, the XRP price is poised for a 500% rally. If his prediction comes true, XRP could hit a gigantic high of $30. Source: X, Cryptoes Similarly, another expert, Cryptoes, suggested that the altcoin would take a positive turn as it has broken past its critical resistance level. While these predictions are optimistic, it’s essential to approach them with caution. Considering the unpredictable nature of the crypto market, XRP’s future trend is uncertain. Whether XRP reaches $30 or experiences a downturn remains to be seen.

Here’s a breakdown of what’s going on with BTC from the daily and 4H chart perspectives, along with what exchange reserves are signaling. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi The Daily Chart On the daily chart, BTC is trying to reclaim the 200-day moving average, located around the $88,000 level, to flip it into support. The price bounced strongly from the $75,000 demand zone and is currently grinding just below the $88,000 mark. While the recent move looks constructive, the structure remains range-bound, and RSI is mid-range around 50, showing neutral momentum. A clean breakout above $88,000 and the 200-day moving average with strong volume could open the door to $92K and beyond, but failure to push higher here may send the asset back toward the $80,000–$82,000 region for a retest. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in, the 4H chart reveals a clean breakout above a long-standing descending trendline that capped the price for most of March and early April. After rebounding from the $75,000 support zone, BTC is now pushing higher and forming higher lows. Moreover, the RSI is holding above 50, suggesting buyers are in control in the short term. However, $86,000–$88,000 remains a major supply zone, and the buyers need to hold above the broken trendline to confirm strength. If that level is lost, this could easily turn into another fakeout and trap longs. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi Exchange Reserve Bitcoin’s exchange reserves continue their relentless downtrend, now sitting at the lowest levels over the past few years. This steady outflow of BTC from centralized exchanges suggests a long-term accumulation trend, likely from large holders and institutions shifting bitcoins into cold storage. While declining reserves are generally bullish and reduce sell-side pressure, it also means that short-term volatility can be sharper due to thinner exchange liquidity. The latest drop aligns with the price recovering from the lows, hinting that some smart money may be loading up under $80K, but that thesis only holds if the asset continues to push higher and attract follow-through demand.

This recent surge in outflows has nearly wiped out all remaining gains for 2025. Last week, digital asset investment products experienced the third consecutive week of outflows , amounting to $795 million. In fact, the recent onslaught of outflows has erased most of the remaining year-to-date inflows, which currently stand at just $165 million. CoinShares head of research James Butterfill surmised that the continued pattern of decline was triggered by the recent global tariff activity which has continued to plague the asset class. Not only that, the firm concluded that negative sentiments have impacted the flow of capital into the digital asset investment products since as early as February 2025.

Pi Network Just Unlocked a New Way to Grow,https://cryptonews.com/news/more-than-just-mining-pi-network-just-unlocked-a-new-way-to-grow/,"Pi Network has risen by 1% in the past 24 hours, with its climb to $0.7521 coming as the crypto market as a whole falls by 2% today. PI is now up by 32% in the past week, with this big recovery stemming from the rolling out of the Pi Ad Network, which will provide developers with a new revenue stream. By enabling devs to integrate ads into their Pi Network-based applications, the Pi Ad Platform will introduce a strong use case for PI itself, potentially boosting its price over time. This may also increase the likelihood that PI gains listings from Binance and other big exchanges, something which could send it surging in the coming weeks . More Than Just Mining? Pi Network Just Unlocked a New Way to Grow Announced in an April 10 blog post , the Pi Ad Network is now available to all Pi Network developers, who can apply to join the small group of app developers who joined a pilot a year ago. The idea behind the Ad Network is to harness PI’s large worldwide community, translating their collective attention into ad revenue for app developers. Pi Ad Network: Platform-Level Utility Unlock new revenue streams by monetizing user attention. Your apps can now attract and engage Pioneers directly through the Pi Browser. Why It Matters: – Grow Your Business: Earn revenue from in-app ads powered by Pi’s ecosystem. -… pic.twitter.com/jcW0JGN4cC — Pi News (@PiNewsMedia) April 12, 2025 What’s particularly bullish about the general release of the Pi Ad Network is that, by making app development more monetizable, it will incentivize more app development, expanding PI’s ecosystem over time. And in turn, this should boost demand for PI itself, particularly since advertisers will need to pay in PI to have their ads viewable on apps. Of course, it’s worth remembering that developers will need to develop high-utility apps that will actually attract users and attention in the first place, but at least the rollout of the Pi Ad Network shows that the project is planning for the future. And this is reflected in PI’s price chart today, in that its indicators show strong momentum and optimism. For example, its RSI (purple) touched 70 again a few days and remains in a good position, likely to stay high for a while yet. Source: TradingView And that’s because PI’s 30-period average (orange) has only just begun rising towards the 200-period (orange), meaning there’s still plenty of time before the coin becomes overbought. Having said that, Pi Network’s trajectory in the near term will depend on how the ongoing tariff war plays out, with the latest being that the US has exempted tech-related goods from its high tariffs on China . This suggests a softening, and if things do improve this week then the Pi Network price could easily reach $0.80 again quite quickly. Alternative Altcoins with Strong Rally Potential Given that PI still hasn’t gained listings from Binance, Kraken or Coinbase, some traders may still be wary of the new coin. However, there are plenty of alternatives for them to investigate, including several popular presale coins that may rally strongly when they list for the first time. One of the most interesting presales right now belongs to MIND of Pepe (MIND), an ERC-20 token that has raised $7.9 million in its ICO. Omnipotent. $MIND pic.twitter.com/sXGIdy4X6O — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) April 9, 2025 With 20,000 followers on X , MIND of Pepe has become enviably popular for such a new project, with investors bullish about its plans to launch an autonomous AI agent. Its platform will process masses of social and market data to identify emerging trends, and it will harness such trends in generating its own meme tokens. Given the recent success of AI-generated coins such Fartcoin and Goateus Maximus (GOAT), its creations have the potential to rally strongly in their own right. And given that you will need to hold MIND in order to gain early access to these tokens, as well as access its advice, the new coin could experience very strong demand. You can join MIND’s presale by visiting the MIND of Pepe website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet. MIND is currently selling at $0.0037115, with this price set to rise several more times before the sale ends. The post More Than Just Mining?

Here is the Latest Purchase Amount!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/japanese-investment-company-metaplanet-continues-to-accumulate-bitcoin-here-is-the-latest-purchase-amount/,"Tokyo-based investment firm Metaplanet, often referred to as the “MicroStrategy of Asia,” has expanded its Bitcoin holdings with a new purchase of 3.78 billion yen ($26.3 million), bringing the total to over 4,500 BTC. Japan's Metaplanet Buys Another $26 Million in Bitcoin Amid Rising US Tariff Uncertainty As geopolitical tensions ripple across global markets, the Tokyo-listed firm is targeting 10,000 BTC by the end of the year. The move comes as global markets grapple with uncertainty stemming from escalating US-China trade tensions. In a statement today, Metaplanet confirmed the purchase of 319 BTC at an average price of 12,849,780 yen ($82,549) per coin. The company’s total Bitcoin holdings currently stand at 4,525 BTC and it aims to increase that figure by 470% to 10,000 BTC by the end of the year. The purchase comes amid rising geopolitical unrest as investors try to interpret the latest signals from the Trump administration on U.S. trade policy. Bitcoin fell more than 2% to $83,482 during Asian trading hours over the weekend as fears of new tariffs rocked crypto markets. Despite the crypto sector’s wobble, traditional financial markets held firm. Nasdaq 100 futures gained more than 1% in early trading, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.7%. Confusion over US tariff plans continued, with smartphones and semiconductors temporarily excluded from the proposed 10% reciprocal tariff, but President Trump later clarified on Truth Social that the products would still face a separate 20% national security tariff. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added to the uncertainty by announcing that more industry-specific tariffs are expected in the next two months. Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy mirrors that of Strategy, a US-based firm that has become the poster child for institutional BTC accumulation. Last month, Metaplanet made headlines by appointing Eric Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump, to its newly formed Strategic Advisory Board, citing his “business expertise and passion for Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

Crypto lending enables borrowers to use their crypto holdings as collateral to obtain a crypto or fiat loan, while lenders can loan their holdings to generate interest. The crypto lending market is down over 43%, from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021 to $36.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a Galaxy Digital research report published on April 14. “The decline can be attributed to the decimation of lenders on the supply side and funds, individuals, and corporate entities on the demand side,” according to Zack Pokorny, research associate at Galaxy Digital. Crypto lending key events. Source: Galaxy Research The decline in the crypto lending market started in 2022 when centralized finance (CeFi) lenders Genesis, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager filed for bankruptcy within two years as crypto valuations fell. Their collective downfall led to an estimated 78% collapse in the size of the lending market, with CeFi lending losing 82% of its open borrows, according to the report. While the overall value of the crypto lending market has yet to reach its previous highs, DeFi lending has made a significant recovery according to some metrics. Related: Trump kills DeFi broker rule in major crypto win: Finance Redefined DeFi borrows grow nearly 10-fold The crypto lending market found its bottom at $1.8 billion in open borrows during the bear market in the fourth quarter of 2022. However, DeFi open borrows rose to $19.1 billion across 20 lending applications and 12 blockchains by the end of 2024, representing a 959% increase over the eight quarters from the 2022 market bottom. “DeFi borrowing has experienced a stronger recovery than that of CeFi lending,” wrote Galaxy Digital’s research associate, Pokorny, adding: “This can be attributed to the permissionless nature of blockchain-based applications and the survival of lending applications through the bear market chaos that felled major CeFi lenders.” “Unlike the largest CeFi lenders that went bankrupt and no longer operate, the largest lending applications and markets were not all forced to close and continued to function,” he added.

The gold spot price has surged around 24% since the beginning of this year. In comparison, $PAXG has increased around 23% during the same period, while $XAUT also surged by 24%. Read on to know what this gold-driven bull run means for your crypto portfolio and how investing in the best crypto presales right now could be one of the smartest financial moves you can make. Gold: The Safe Haven Bitcoin has fallen around 12% year-to-date, whereas the wider crypto market capitalization plunged by almost 30%. The first quarter of the year also saw the highest inflows in gold ETFs since 2022, totaling around 226.5 tonnes. The global economy is still recovering from the US-China tariff war, which brings along a lot of uncertainty. Precious metals such as gold emerge as safe investments in turbulent times like this. Goldman Sachs has, for the third time, updated its year-end price target for gold, setting it at $3.7K an ounce. This translates to a 12% increase from the current trading levels of $3.2K. Initially, the investment giant had set a target of $3.1K per ounce, which was revised in March to $3.3K. Swiss Bank UBS has also upgraded its 2025 projections from $3.2K to $3.5K. After the announcements of tariffs on April 4, gold fell by more than 5%, making a low of less than $3K. However, since then, it has made a remarkable recovery, soaring around 8.5% and hitting a new all-time high. Government Spending May Not Reduce Dr. Jan Wüstenfeld, an economist and Bitcoin researcher, took to LinkedIn to explain that the US government spending may not reduce and, in fact, may keep increasing. The federal debt may balloon to 169% of GDP by 2055 from the current level of 123% of GDP. This translates to higher interest payments, which is why it will become essential for the government to keep interest rates low. That will then lead to monetary expansion and ultimately inflation. While this might not be good news for traditional markets, hard assets like $BTC and gold will become more attractive. Gold is a proven safe investment, and increasing interest payment pressure will only make it more alluring. As uncertainty increases, investing in cryptos that are currently in presale can help you diversify your portfolio without taking on much risk. That’s because these assets aren’t yet listed on exchanges, which is why they’re immune to the market’s volatility. To help you get started on the right foot, we’ve handpicked three top altcoins you should consider buying. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Crypto Presale with over $30M in Funding When it comes to cryptos that offer relatively safe investments, Solaxy ($SOLX) stands out as the top choice. This new meme coin on presale is one of the very few to offer real-world application and utility, which is why our Solaxy price prediction suggests it could reach $0.2 by 2030. That would be a nearly 11,800% gain in less than five years. But to realize such gains, you’d need to buy Solaxy while it’s still in presale. One token is currently available for just $0.001694, but hurry because the price increases in just a few hours. It’s also worth noting that the project has in total raised a staggering $30M. Check out our step-by-step guide on how to buy Solaxy . As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, Solaxy aims to restore the popular blockchain’s glory, which has been blunted due to an overload of investors on the network. Solaxy will help Solana’s mainnet by processing some of its transactions on a sidechain. Because it’s a multi-chain token, $SOLX will make use of both Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s speed to crank up Solana’s efficiency and reduce congestion and scalability issues. Moreover, Solaxy’s whitepaper has laid out that it will process multiple transactions at once, i.e., in batches. This will improve Solana’s affordability. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Top New Altcoin Powering the Fastest-Growing Wallet Ecosystem Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is another utility-based altcoin that could be the perfect solution if you’re looking for a safe but potentially extremely profitable crypto investment opportunity. As the native token of the Best Wallet app , $BEST powers the entire Best Wallet ecosystem. $BEST token holders will get exclusive perks as a reward for their loyalty. These include lower transaction fees, 133% staking rewards, and access to the best cryptos before they become available to the general public.It’s worth noting, though, that the biggest reason we predict $BEST climb to $0.07 by 2030 is the explode-worthy prospect of the Best Wallet App. It’s an easy-to-use crypto wallet that takes security seriously, which is a huge deal, especially in an industry rife with cybercrime. Remember Bybit’s $1.5B hack ? In addition to offering top-notch security settings, such as 2FA/MFA and class-leading encryption, Best Wallet is also self-custodial. This means only and only you will have access to your crypto assets. What’s more, Best Wallet’s team also verifies each token before listing it on their app. This will protect you from scams and rug pulls. $BEST is currently in presale ($11.6M+ raised), and each token is selling for only $0.024725. Here’s how to buy it . 3. PepeX ($PEPX) – AI-Powered No-Code Launchpad for Meme Coins Although potentially not as safe as the two presales mentioned above, PepeX’s revolutionary proposal is nothing to sniff at, as it could very well attract the market’s favor. $PEPX claims to build the first-ever AI-powered no-code launchpad for meme coins . By allowing crypto enthusiasts with no tech knowledge to enter a prompt and create a meme coin, PepeX wants to liberalize the meme coin industry like never before. At the heart of PepeX are its cutting-edge AI agents. They will help users create, manage, and even promote (on platforms like X and Telegram) their tokens. We’re also impressed by how PepeX has addressed security concerns. It will leverage on-chain monitoring and anti-sniping tech to eliminate the possibility of any malicious activity during the distribution and trading of your meme coins. Currently in presale, $PEPX has already raised over $1.3M. Each token is available for just $0.0268, which makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now . Bottom Line While the above-mentioned cryptos are certainly safe investments now, once they’re listed, they’ll have to put up with the market conditions to climb higher.

Dogecoin price may reach a maximum of $1.07 in 2025. With a potential surge, the DOGE price may achieve its $3 mark in 2030. Dogecoin, the memecoin category leader, has picked up the pace amidst the uptrend in the market. Betwixt the turn of events, marketers are still hoping for it to match its June 2021 high. The hopes could soon be fulfilled, as the House of Doge within the Dogecoin Foundation has opened the doors to the “Official Dogecoin Reserve” by acquiring 10 million DOGE to boost payment utility and transaction efficiency. Talking about DOGE’s price, it is currently holding onto its support/resistance at $0.1657, a bullish push from here could lead DOGE to its resistance at $0.17. On the flipside, if bears hunt DOGE down, its price could tumble to $0.15 in the very short term. As the underlying dynamics shift amid broader market volatility, investors have started wondering, “Will Dogecoin reach $1?” to “Will Dogecoin go up?” Are you wondering the same? Worry not, Coinpedia’s Dogecoin price prediction 2025 to 2030 will clear all such doubts. Look at this well-researched and detailed DOGE price prediction for the upcoming moves.

Given DOGE’s success, largely driven by hype with some technical progress, crossing $1 by 2025 remains a realistic possibility. A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025.

While it is intended to enhance investor protection, experts warn that the policy could stifle smaller firms. Crypto gaming and gambling campaigns have become the most expensive in Web3 marketing, with high churn and competition driving up user acquisition costs. Meanwhile, the US Social Security Administration is shifting all public communications to Elon Musk’s X platform, as part of cost-cutting efforts led by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Google Rolls Out New Crypto Ad Rules Google is set to enforce stricter advertising rules for cryptocurrency services in Europe starting April 23, to align its policies with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The move requires that crypto exchanges and wallet providers advertising on Google be licensed under MiCA or under national-level Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) regimes. These advertisers must also adhere to local legal requirements and get certification from Google. While violations won’t lead to immediate suspensions, Google clarified that accounts found in breach will receive at least a seven-day warning before any action is taken. The policy change comes after the rollout of MiCA in December of 2024, which was the EU’s first comprehensive regulatory structure for digital assets. Google’s advertising restrictions will cover a wide array of European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Sweden, among others. The company’s move is seen as part of a broader shift toward increasing regulatory compliance in the crypto space. Google announcement Legal experts see the change as a “double-edged sword.” Hon Ng, the chief legal officer at Bitget, acknowledged that while the policy enhances investor protection by filtering out unregulated actors, it also risks becoming overly restrictive. He believed that smaller exchanges might struggle with MiCA’s capital requirements and the dual certification demands of Google and local regulators, which could potentially stifle innovation and create enforcement gaps due to varying national transition periods. Others are more skeptical of the policy’s real-world impact. Mattan Erder, general counsel at blockchain project Orbs, suggested that the change may be more about shielding Google from liability than protecting investors. He pointed out that the policy’s effects will largely depend on how burdensome and costly MiCA and CASP registration prove to be. If these frameworks favor larger entities, smaller players may find themselves at a disadvantage in reaching users across European jurisdictions. Crypto Gaming Ads Are Burning Budgets Not only are crypto ads facing strict regulations, but crypto gaming and gambling campaigns recently emerged as the most expensive user acquisition strategies in the Web3 space, with recent data showing that these sectors lead in cost per wallet (CPW) metrics. According to Addressable co-founder Asaf Nadler , the median CPW for these campaigns stands at $8.74, with a lower quartile of $3.40. This makes them the priciest channels for attracting users who already have crypto wallets installed. (Source: X ) CPW is seen as a high-quality metric in crypto marketing, as it directly measures the cost of acquiring users who are more likely to convert to crypto products. The steep CPW associated with gaming and gambling may be attributed to high churn rates, speculative user behavior, and fierce competition in these sectors. Nadler believes there is a big need for a more robust user acquisition engine if Web3 gaming is to achieve the same level of sustainability that is currently seen in traditional gaming ecosystems. Axie Infinity co-founder Jeff “JiHo” Zirlin has a different perspective, and suggested that high CPW phases offer opportunities for experimentation, new product development, and market consolidation in anticipation of the next market boom. In contrast, campaigns in decentralized finance (DeFi) and centralized finance (CeFi) are proving to be far more cost-effective. Nadler pointed out that these sectors have a median CPW of just $2.79, with a lower quartile as low as $0.10. The findings are based on 200 programmatic campaigns that were conducted by over 70 advertisers, collectively targeting an estimated 9.5 million crypto wallet holders globally. The study also revealed how market conditions and regions influence CPW. During bull runs, premium markets like the United States and Western Europe offer scalable and quality engagement at lower costs. However, these same markets become much more expensive during bearish periods. In 2024, CPW in the US and Western Europe increased by four times and 27 times, respectively, from Q1 to Q3 as investor interest dwindled. On the other hand, emerging regions like Latin America and Eastern Europe offer more affordable acquisition costs in favorable market conditions but can also be subject to extreme cost volatility. Social Security Goes Social Meanwhile, the US Social Security Administration (SSA) is set to move all public communications exclusively to the X social media platform. This is a controversial shift that is spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is led by X owner Elon Musk. According to sources cited by WIRED , the agency will stop issuing traditional letters and press releases, and will rely only on X to inform the public of updates and changes. The move accompanies a big downsizing of the SSA's workforce, which will be reduced from 57,000 to approximately 50,000 employees as part of a broader effort to cut costs and increase operational efficiency. The SSA acknowledged that its longstanding 10-region structure is outdated and will be streamlined into just four regional offices. Elon Musk has been very outspoken in his criticism of the Social Security system, and claimed that it is responsible for billions of dollars in erroneous payments. This sentiment also reportedly gained a lot of traction in the White House . On the other hand, the transition to X raised some concerns about access to vital information, especially for those without internet access or social media accounts. Trump and Musk in the White House (Source: YouTube ) DOGE is aggressively pursuing cuts across various government agencies. In March, it began investigating the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and gained access to its internal data systems. The SEC confirmed its cooperation with the department. DOGE has also proposed cutting the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) workforce by 20%, which could potentially affect around 6,800 employees. These reductions will possibly take effect by May 15, which is just one month after the 2024 tax filing deadline. Beyond staff cuts, DOGE is also exploring technological solutions to reduce waste, including a proposal to place the entire federal budget on a blockchain. The initiative is intended to boost transparency and public trust by allowing citizens to track government spending in real time. For now, Musk’s involvement and the centralization of government communications on his own social media platform is a topic of fierce debate over the future of public service accessibility and the role of private influence in federal operations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-14 13:30:00

What’s changing now is the scale. Volume is increasing, Telegram activity is climbing, and the token is popping up on more altcoin tracking platforms. As market rotation intensifies, more investors are diversifying into promising presales—and MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly becoming a priority watchlist item.

In its Q1 roadmap for this year, Ai16z ( AI16Z ) announced plans to launch an AI-focused platform inspired by Solana’s ( SOL ) Pump.fun memecoin launchpad. The launchpad will be open-source, and allow the creation and deployment of AI-based projects using the Eliza framework. Additionally, it will allow creators to earn fees from trading of their tokens, rather than having those fees absorbed by the platform. According to Shaw , the founder of Ai16z, the launchpad is expected to be released as soon as this week. The upcoming launch of Auto.fun by Ai16z follows the debut of Raydium’s launchpad LaunchLab earlier this year, which was created as a competitor to Pump.fun . However, while LaunchLab and Pump.fun cater to memecoins, Auto.fun positions itself as their polar opposite as it’s supposed to be an “anti-pump” platform, according to Shaw.

After reaching its all-time high of $2.48 on Jan. 2, the token has plunged to just $0.1371 as of press time, marking an almost 95% decline. The price has also been consistently trending below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average since mid-January. The Relative Strength Index sits at 42.50, slightly recovering from oversold territory but still indicating weak bullish strength. The RSI has been subdued for most of Q1, showing little sign of upward breakout potential thus far. According to the recent price action, AI16Z price appears to be consolidating in the range between $0.13 and $0.15 over the past two weeks. This range sits just above the key support level at $0.10, where buyers stepped in about a week ago with a noticeable pump in volume. While this consolidation hints at potential accumulation, the lack of strong upward momentum suggests that the market is in a wait-and-see mode, waiting for a clear breakout or breakdown before deciding the next direction.

While they did not want to jump to conclusions, speculation followed and the market reacted predictably. According to reports on X and a tweet from Odin.fun’s founder Bob Bodily, the Odin platform was compromised, and it led to the unauthorized clearance of assets. As soon as the news got out, the platform’s flagship token, $ODINDOG, saw a sharp decline in value, reportedly dropping by almost 40% within hours. Odin platform’s $ODINDOG token plummeted after users noticed the founder’s account was unloading assets, potentially due to a breach. Source: @CG_BRC20 (X/Twitter). Odin rocked by hack reports According to data from CoinGecko, Odin’s market cap is currently hovering just above $4 million, with a circulating supply of 21 million. Each token is currently worth 0.1911, down almost 90% from its all-time high of $1.78. Bodily first reported the attack on his Odin account hours after it seemingly happened, stating that the team was investigating the issue and reassuring users he would share more info soon. About an hour after his first post about the attack, he clarified that only his Odin.fun account had been compromised so far, not his BTC account. “Still digging,” he concluded the tweet. It seemed like things were being handled but then shortly after his second tweet, Bodily revealed that Odin had paused trading and withdrawals platform-wide as it looked into whether the breach was an isolated event targeting Bodily’s account or signs of a broader vulnerability. Community members on X are skeptical of Odin and its leadership Some users on X are skeptical that Bodily was not the perpetrator of the attack himself. Few have even suggested the possibility of it being an internal theft, even though no substantial evidence supports their suspicion. Others expressed sympathy for the Odin team, tagging the situation a “nightmare” and accepting wholeheartedly that the asset liquidation happened due to the mass sell-off from the compromised account. While nobody can prove yet that the incident exploited an internal flaw, was an external hack, or involved internal misconduct, one thing many seem to be agreed on is that the platform did not need to restrict withdrawals. We've stopped trading/withdraws to ensure this isn't a broader issue on the platform. Still investigating. — Bob Bodily, PhD 👋 | #BTC #ETH #ICP 🧙🏽‍♂️ (@BobBodily) April 14, 2025 “Unless the team can resolve the issue in a short period of time, do not close the deposit, withdrawal, and trading functions, as this may cause greater panic,” one user wrote. Another wanted to know why withdrawals were put on hold when only the founder’s account was compromised. “Please listen to the voice of the market, do not create greater panic, believe that your goal is not to make a little money, but to have a greater sense of achievement and wealth!” Another user urged. The exploit comes more than a month after Bodily reassured users that Odin’s BTC deposits are secure with a 1:1 reserve. The statement was supposed to address unrelated hacking concerns at the time, which suggests the platform has faced security scrutiny before. Still, it’s unclear how it relates to the current incident. As things stand, why those assets were cleared from Bodily’s account and why it was his only account that was targeted remain unknown, but investigations are ongoing.

After selling that company, I joined Shopify and I worked there for almost six years, helping build their business, their operational and finance functions. At Coinbase, I help lead a team who are building a platform for Canadians to diversify their assets into the digital economy. CoinDesk: How long has Coinbase been operating in Canada, and what regulatory milestones have you achieved? Lucas: Coinbase has been in Canada for almost four years now. We've been officially pursuing our registration here in Canada for a number of years as well. Canada is registered as a restricted dealer under CSA. We're the first international exchange to be registered in Canada. We're lucky to have a regulatory regime here where we operate under a compliant regime in Canada to grow our business. We are now pursuing our IIROC registration with IIROC as a full dealer registration, that'll expand the types of products and services that we can offer Canadians. CoinDesk: Ethereum was born in Canada, yet most of its ecosystem developed elsewhere. Is there a certain irony in having to convince Canadian institutions to embrace a technology with Canadian roots? Lucas: Coinbase seeks regulatory clarity all over the world, and we look for markets that provide stability and clear rules for us to operate under a regime. Canada is one of those markets that is identified as being open to providing clear rules and regulating cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase. When we look across the world, Canada's also a very crypto-literate country. It's the third most crypto-aware country of all the international locations that we operate in, so we have quite a strong awareness about the technology here. The opportunity for it to help our financial system — as you probably know, Ethereum was founded here in Canada. We have very strong roots here in Canada around cryptocurrency and around technology. We have a lot of really great universities in computing science that are focused on blockchain technology and helping our students in Canada understand the opportunity. CoinDesk: That's fascinating about Canada being the third most crypto-aware country. How does that translate to adoption rates? Lucas: When we survey countries around the world, we survey how aware citizens are to specific types of cryptocurrencies, uses of cryptocurrencies and technology. Canadians are the third most crypto-aware country of all the international markets that we survey. We see some surveys in Canada suggesting that upwards of 30% of Canadians by the end of this year will own digital assets. So we see very strong adoption in Canada and healthy diversification into the asset class. Of course, Canada was the first to introduce crypto-related ETFs, so we have quite a broad awareness about the opportunity for Canadians to diversify into crypto through traditional ETFs as well. CoinDesk: Who are the Canadians using Coinbase? Is there a particular demographic profile? Lucas: We have a very broad distribution of demographics in Canada. We have a very diverse user group in Canada—people who are diversifying from young students, immigrants who are looking to remit money. We see a significant number of people building and diversifying portfolios, accumulating digital assets for long-term diversification and wealth preservation. Then we have a significant amount of institutional investors in Canada starting to diversify assets into the crypto economy as well. So we see very strong adoption across retail, and in Canada specifically now we're seeing a healthier adoption from institutional investors and more interest from institutional investors, pension funds, asset managers who are exploring diversifying their clients' assets into crypto as well. CoinDesk: With Canada's election approaching on April 28th, what policy changes would you like to see from the next government? Lucas: We proposed a number of changes for our new government to really think deeply about over the next term. We've recommended that they: Launch a government task force and create a national crypto strategy Consider a Bitcoin strategic reserve Regulate stablecoins federally from a prudential regulator as a payment instrument Introduce a market structure bill like we're seeing in the US where we can clearly define crypto assets so that it's clear for the public, institutions, and builders exactly how crypto assets are defined Make it easier for banks to bank crypto trading platforms in Canada Currently, our large banks—we have big banks with 80-90% of the money in Canada—do not bank crypto trading platforms, so we are very keen to help our government encourage our financial institutions to participate in the digital economy. (You can read Lucas’s writing on what Canada should do to be a global crypto leader here .) CoinDesk: You've mentioned 'Stand with Crypto' as an advocacy initiative. How are you organizing the industry to influence policy in Canada? Lucas: 'Stand with Crypto' is an organization that has advocated for clear rules all around the world for crypto, and we've recently launched Stand with Crypto here in Canada with a number of partners. We have a number of crypto trading partners joining Stand with Crypto to help us advocate for change. Stand with Crypto is really an opportunity for our elected officials to understand this opportunity so that we can prioritize it clearly. Canada has a lot of priorities and challenges within our economy, and crypto technology can help us rebuild our economy and our economic freedom. That's one of the ways that we organize. Canada also has two strong industry associations, the Canadian Blockchain Consortium and the Canadian Web3 Council , and these organizations help unify views and help us align on opportunities that we can engage with our regulators to drive more regulatory clarity in the market. CoinDesk: Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are challenging centralized platforms like Coinbase in the US. How do you view this trend affecting your business in Canada? Lucas: I think decentralized finance will form a very healthy and significant part of our financial economy. I think that's the foundation of the technology and the ecosystem—to decentralize financial interactions in a trusted, safe, compliant manner. I think the decentralization of finance will be a healthy part of how some investors will choose to participate. But centralized exchanges provide a very valuable tool to on-ramp and off-ramp from the digital economy in a compliant way that helps governments and institutions around the world get comfort that platforms like Coinbase are managing risks appropriately, managing anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, ensuring that people on their platform are acting in good faith. CoinDesk: If you could say a few things to the upcoming administration, what would they be? Lucas: I would say the rest of the world is moving quickly to adopt crypto and integrate it into their economy. It's time for Canada to do the same—to integrate crypto into our economy, build a national strategy, and educate Canadians about why the world is going digital. CoinDesk: There seems to be a patriotic element to your advocacy. Do you see Canada becoming a global leader in crypto? Lucas: I think Canada can be a leader in crypto. Canada has the opportunity to embrace this technology in a meaningful way to help this country rebuild ourselves and grow our economy. I think we're entering a time where we need to rethink how we organize our government, how we tax our government, how we generate revenues, and how we spend money. I think we're entering a cycle where governments are expected to do more with less. That's what entrepreneurs do with technology every day, and that's what governments around the world are starting to embrace is the opportunity to do more with less, to be more efficient, to provide better government services through technology, to be more entrepreneurial.",Consensus Toronto 2025 Coverage,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-14 13:40:47

In this article, we’ll unpack the data that suggests Bitcoin miners are not just staying the course, they’re accelerating, doubling down at a time when many are pulling back. What exactly do they know that the broader market might be missing? For a more in-depth look into this topic, check out a recent YouTube video here: Why Bitcoin Miners Are Doubling Down Right Now Bitcoin Hash Rate Going Parabolic Despite Bitcoin’s recent price underperformance, the Bitcoin Hashrate has been going absolutely vertical, breaking all-time highs with seemingly no regard for macro headwinds or sluggish price action. Typically, hash rate is tightly correlated with BTC price; when price drops sharply or remains stagnant, hash rate tends to plateau or decline due to economic pressure on miners. Yet now, in the face of heightened global tariffs, economic slowdown, and a consolidating BTC price, hash rate is accelerating. Historically, this level of divergence between hash rate and price has been rare and often significant. Figure 1: The current significant divergence between hash rate and price. View Live Chart Bitcoin Miner Difficulty , a close cousin to hash rate, just saw one of its largest single adjustments upward in history. This metric, which auto-adjusts to keep Bitcoin’s block timing consistent, only increases when more computational power floods the network. A difficulty spike of this magnitude, especially when paired with poor price performance, is nearly unprecedented. Again, this suggests that miners are investing heavily in infrastructure and resources, even when BTC price does not appear to support the decision in the short term. Figure 2: The recent spike in mining difficulty. View Live Chart Adding further intrigue, the Hash Ribbons Indicator , a blend of short and long-term hash rate moving averages, recently flashed a classic Bitcoin buy signal. When the 30-day moving average (blue line) crosses back above the 60-day (purple line), it signals the end of miner capitulation and the beginning of renewed miner strength. Visually, the background of the chart shifts from red to white when this crossover occurs. This has often marked powerful inflection points for BTC price. Figure 3: Renewed miner strength recently triggered a buy signal. View Live Chart What’s striking this time around is how aggressively the 30-day moving average is surging away from the 60-day. This is not just a modest recovery, it’s a statement from miners that they are betting heavily on the future. The Tariff Factor So, what’s fueling this miner frenzy? One plausible explanation is that miners, especially U.S.-based ones, are trying to front-run the impact of looming tariffs. Bitmain, the dominant producer of mining equipment, is now in the crosshairs of trade policies that could see equipment prices surge by 30–50%, potentially to even over 100%! Figure 4: Bitcoin’s hash rate distribution across mining pools. Given that over 40% of Bitcoin’s hash rate is controlled by U.S.-based pools like Foundry USA, Mara Pool, and Luxor, any cost increase would drastically reduce profit margins. Miners may be aggressively scaling now while hardware is still (relatively) cheap and available. Bitcoin Miners Keep Mining Hashprice , the BTC-denominated revenue per terahash of computational power, is at historical lows. In other words, it’s never been less profitable in BTC terms to operate a Bitcoin miner on a per-terahash basis. Typically, we see hash price increase toward the tail-end of bear markets, as competition fades and weaker players exit the space. Figure 5: The ongoing decline in per-terahash miner profitability. View Live Chart But that’s not happening here. Despite terrible profitability , miners are not only staying online, they’re deploying more hash power. This could imply one of two things; either miners are racing against deteriorating margins to front-load BTC accumulation, or, more optimistically, they have strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future profitability and are buying the dip aggressively. Bitcoin Miners Conclusion So, what’s really happening? Either miners are desperately front-running hardware costs, or, more likely, they’re signaling one of the strongest collective votes of confidence in the future of Bitcoin we’ve seen in recent memory. We’ll continue tracking these metrics in future updates to see whether this miner conviction is proven right.

Participants will earn points by holding or staking XRD, providing liquidity, executing DEX swaps, and engaging in lending and borrowing. NFT interaction and dApp usage will also qualify for rewards. “Users will earn points based on meaningful activity,” said Dan Hughes, CTO and founder of Radix. “We want to ensure deep and sustained ecosystem participation instead of just passive token hoarding to bump up our market cap.” Radix is distancing itself from traditional airdrop tactics, which it sees as unsustainable and prone to attracting short-term “mercenary” users. The campaign’s structure aims to build robust liquidity while creating a stronger foundation for dApps and developers within the ecosystem.

Or burn it, and hope for a short-term flash mob? The choice is clear: repurpose this reserve and make Radix the home of the next generation of DeFi.” The announcement comes ahead of Radix’s Hyperscale testnet rollout, which targets a sustained throughput of 1 million complex transactions per second, a scalability benchmark far beyond what current Layer 1s have demonstrated in production. According to the press release, this upcoming milestone represents the “only real path to Hyperscale in the industry.” To support this push, Radix’s newly launched incentives campaign is designed to rapidly onboard more users, capital, and liquidity, positioning the network as a serious contender in the next wave of DeFi adoption.

In an April 14 blog post, Buterin argued that privacy is essential to maintain individual freedom and protect against the growing power of governments and corporations. He criticized the idea that increased transparency is inherently beneficial, saying it relies on assumptions about human nature that are no longer valid. “These assumptions include believing that global political leadership is generally well-intentioned and sane, and that social culture continues to progress in a positive direction,” Buterin wrote. “Both are proving to be increasingly untrue.” Buterin claimed there was “no single major country for which the first assumption is broadly agreed to be true.” Furthermore, he wrote that cultural tolerance is “rapidly regressing,” which is reportedly demonstrable by an X post search for “bullying is good.” Buterin’s personal privacy issues Buterin said that he found his lack of privacy unsettling at times. He added: “Every single action I take outside has some nonzero chance of unexpectedly becoming a public media story.” Covertly taken photos of Vitalik Buterin. Source: Vitalik.eth While this may appear as a suggestion that privacy is an advantage only for those who venture outside the social norms, he highlighted that “you never know when you will become one of them.” Buterin only expects the need for privacy to increase as technology develops further, with brain-computer interfaces potentially allowing automated systems to peer directly into our brains. Another issue is automated price gouging, with companies charging individuals as much as they expect them to be able to pay. Related: Messaging apps are spying on you — Here’s how to stay safe in 2025 There is no privacy with government backdoors Buterin also argued strongly against the idea of adding government backdoors to systems designed to protect privacy. He said such positions are common but inherently unstable. He highlighted how, in the case of Know Your Customer data, “it’s not just the government, it’s also all kinds of corporate entities, of varying levels of quality” that can access private data. Instead, the information is handled and held by payment processors, banks, and other intermediaries. Similarly, telecommunication companies can locate their users and have been found to illegally sell this data. Buterin also raised concerns that individuals with access will always be incentivized to abuse it, and data banks can always be hacked. Lastly, a trustworthy government can change and become untrustworthy in the future, inheriting all the sensitive data. He concluded: “From the perspective of an individual, if data is taken from them, they have no way to tell if and how it will be abused in the future. By far the safest approach to handling large-scale data is to centrally collect as little of it as possible in the first place.“ Related: Privacy will unlock blockchain’s business potential Authorities have more data than ever Buterin raised the issue of governments being able to access anything with a warrant “because that‘s the way that things have always worked.” He noted that this point of view fails to consider that historically, the amount of data available for obtaining through a warrant was far lower. He said the traditionally available data would still be available even “if the strongest proposed forms of internet privacy were universally adopted.” He wrote that “in the 19ᵗʰ century, the average conversation happened once, via voice, and was never recorded by anyone.” Buterin’s proposed solutions Buterin suggested solutions based mainly on zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) because they allow for “fine-grained control of who can see what information.” ZK-proofs are cryptographic protocols that allow one party to prove a statement is true without revealing any additional information. One such system is a ZK-proof-based proof of personhood that proves you are unique without revealing who you are. These systems rely on documents like passports or biometric data paired with decentralized systems. Another solution suggested is the recently launched privacy pools , which allow for regulatory-compliant Ether (ETH) anonymization. Buterin also cited on-device anti-fraud scanning, checking incoming messages and identifying potential misinformation and scams. These systems are proof of provenance services for physical items using a combination of blockchain and ZK-proof technology. They track various properties of an item throughout its manufacturing cycle, ensuring the user of its authenticity. The post follows Buterin’s recent privacy roadmap for Ethereum . In it, he highlighted the short-term changes to the base protocol and ecosystem needed to ensure better user privacy.

To read full editions, subscribe . Last week, Meanwhile announced a whopping $40 million raise co-led by Framework Ventures and Fulgur Ventures. However, the raise is a bit more significant than was initially reported. “This is the largest equity investment that Framework Ventures has ever made,” Framework’s Michael Anderson exclusively told me. If you’re not familiar, Meanwhile is a bitcoin life insurance company valued at $190 million after their Series A announcement. Oh, and here’s an interesting factoid: They only have 10 employees. “We’ve written all our own technology,” Zachary Townsend, Meanwhile’s CEO, explained. I asked Townsend whether or not the firm would consider creating a US-based subsidiary, as its current subsidiary is fully licensed and regulated by Bermuda. Through that license, I should note, Meanwhile’s able to offer its services in a variety of countries including the US, UK and Canada. Townsend explained that it’s on the cards in the future to build an “onshore life insurance company that interacts with our offshore company to offer Bitcoin products to folks in the US,” but it’s going to take a lot more than a friendly regulatory environment to make that happen. “Insurance is regulated on a state-by-state basis, and obviously there are states that are more crypto-friendly versus states that are less crypto-friendly. I think doing the particular thing we do, which is having everything in Bitcoin, which we consider safer, would be quite difficult in the United States in the near term,” he noted. Townsend explained Meanwhile has some plans to put the $40 million raised to use. “Expanding globally is also an expansion of the products we offer and what those customers are interested in,” Townsend explained. “Sometime this year, [we’re] going to launch something that looks like an annuity in Bitcoin. So that would be … you put Bitcoin into an account, there’s a yield or rate of return in many countries that return [of] the account’s tax advantages.” Meanwhile’s whole life product is a “massive unlock in terms of anyone who [wants] to be able to put Bitcoin into the policy when it’s lower [and] … anybody who does that will be able to borrow Bitcoin out of their life insurance policy over their lifetime,” Anderson said. Townsend said Meanwhile’s product fit has found success in places like Argentina, Nigeria and Turkey, where folks may not want to take out insurance because of the limitations of the currencies. “So much of the world has inflation risk, currency risk, regime risk […] and cross-border risk, so no matter where you live, the idea of having life insurance in this global, decentralized store of value is incredibly attractive,” he said. Has Meanwhile somehow made it — dare I say fun — to look under the hood of an insurance firm? Never knew that was even possible. Get the news in your inbox.

On April 13, OM plummeted from $6.30 to below $0.50 within hours, wiping out over 90% of its $6 billion market cap.

What really happened, and which red flags did investors ignore? https://t.co/2HeL1ZiMhG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 14, 2025 As panic spread across the market, allegations of a rug pull began circulating online. Critics pointed to suspicious token transfers and the project’s controversial tokenomics. OM Token Faces Terra LUNA Comparisons Amid Skepticism The Mantra team quickly addressed the concerns. Co-founder JP Mullin responded directly in the project’s Telegram group, stating, “We are here and not going anywhere.” He attributed the price collapse to “reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges” rather than any wrongdoing by the team. Mullin also provided a verification address to show the team’s token holdings. This response helped ease some of the panic, with OM bouncing back nearly 200% from its post-crash low of $0.37 to as high as $1.10 on April 14. Despite the recovery, skepticism remains high. Source: Cryptonews Critics allege that Mantra’s core team reportedly controls around 90% of the token supply and uses their OM holdings as collateral to secure high-risk loans. According to analyst Ed , a sudden change in loan risk parameters by centralized exchanges triggered a margin call, exacerbating the token’s fall.

OKX CEO Star Xu described the event as a “big scandal,” stating that the exchange would release further reports on the situation in the coming days. OM Price Struggles with Key Resistance Levels Despite the price rebound, OM’s technical indicators paint a concerning picture. The token remains well below its 50-week exponential moving average near $3.25 and is now facing resistance at the 200-week EMA around $1.08. The weekly relative strength index has dropped to 33.31, suggesting continued weakness in market momentum.

Lookonchain also flagged that since April 7, at least 17 wallets have deposited 43.6 million OM onto exchanges, about 4.5% of the circulating supply. However, Binance attributed the crash to cross-exchange liquidations and warned users of OM’s changing token economics months ago. Mantra promises a full postmortem soon.

Metaplanet Presses On With Bitcoin Purchases Metaplanet disclosed on Monday that it purchased an additional 319 BTC for about $26.3 million at an average price of ¥12,849,780 ($82,549) per Bitcoin. This brought its total holdings to 4,525 BTC, acquired for about $386.3 million, according to Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich. Based on market prices, the firm’s 4,525 BTC is currently worth around $382.2 million. Metaplanet has been buying the apex crypto since announcing its Bitcoin strategy in April 2024. It currently ranks as the world’s ninth-largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin and the largest in Asia. Metaplanet intends to boost its BTC stash by 470%, aiming to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of this year and a total of 21,000 BTC by end-2026. Metaplanet’s latest purchase comes as crypto markets remained largely flat under geopolitical tensions. The price of Bitcoin barely budged on Monday morning, changing hands at $84,509 as of press time as investors digested mixed signals from Washington over the direction of U.S. trade policy toward China. An Increasingly Influential Company Metaplanet is following closely in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Strategy, whose aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy has influenced an increasing number of corporate entities seeking to use digital assets to enhance shareholder value. Strategy currently holds 528,185 BTC , which is equivalent to 2.5% of the leading crypto’s total supply. Metaplanet’s use of stocks to raise money for its Bitcoin buying spree has given the company the nickname “Asia’s MicroStrategy”, as the formula follows similar actions from Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy ). Meanwhile, Metaplanet is making powerful friends in the US political scene. As ZyCrypto reported in March, the company tapped US President Donald Trump’s son Eric to its newly established strategic board of advisers to advance its mission to become a “global leader in the Bitcoin economy.”",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-14 13:56:17
33767162,[object Object],1744639079,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Solana’s Price Plunges. Will Solaxy’s Layer-2 Solution Revive the Ecosystem?,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-plunges-will-solaxys-layer-2-revive-it/,"Solana’s price declined sharply to begin April, declining 60% from its all-time high of $294.33 in mid-January. The sudden drop has raised concerns about the scalability and resilience of Solana, a leading meme coin ecosystem, and its native token $SOL, one of the top altcoins – but created an opportunity for Solaxy. Is the latest plunge just another part of $SOL’s particularly volatile nature? Or are there deeper concerns resting beneath the surface? Time for a closer analysis of $SOL’s performance, and a look at how Solaxy could be just the Layer-2 solution that Solana needs to succeed. Solana’s Recent Challenges In mid-January, $SOL reached an all-time high of $295. By April 7, it briefly traded below $100 before recovering. It currently sits at roughly $133. What caused the downturn? $SOL has seen wide swings before – the recent all-time-high was just barely higher than the previous one, which came two years earlier. On the broader market front, Donald Trump’s escalating trade war continues to send shockwaves through the market. Broader economic uncertainties have impacted investor confidence, leading to sell-offs. One of the major drivers in Solana’s success as a network was new meme coins . $BONK, back in 2022, helped to kick-start $SOL’s price surge. But increased trading and speculation can lead to congestion of the Solana mainnet, causing transaction delays and failures. In addition, Solana’s relationship with meme coins has cooled decidedly. Trading volume on the popular meme coin launchpad Pump.fun fell dramatically in Q1 2025, from $3B in January to $170M in early March; it was a paltry $38M in early April. Top top it all, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin criticized Pump.fun for bringing projects with little to no value, hurting blockchain’s ‘social philosophy.’ To solve its meme coin blues – and perhaps reverse the price plunge – Solana needs some fresh innovation in the ecosystem. Solaxy: Improved Scalability on Solana’s First-Ever Layer-2 Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s first true Layer-2 (L2) scaling solution, designed to address the network’s congestion and scalability challenges and reinvigorate its meme coin ecosystem. Solaxy handles transactions off the main chain, alleviating congestion and enhancing throughput with a rollup architecture much like Ethereum’s L2s. Even better, Solaxy supports a cross-chain infrastructure connecting Solana and Ethereum, blending the latter’s reliability and scalability with Solana’s speed and lower transaction fees. The utility token for Solaxy, $SOLX, is currently in the presale stage. You can learn how to buy $SOLX with our guide , but don’t delay – the presale continues to gain steam rapidly. It just passed the $30M mark, with tokens priced at $0.001694. Solaxy’s ability to deploy a sophisticated Layer-2 solution comes at an ideal time. Our own analysis indicates that, on the back of a successful presale, $SOLX token price could reach $0.032 by the end of 2025. Visit the Solaxy presale page to learn more. Continued Interest in Solana Supports Solaxy’s Development Solaxy deployment could have great timing. Despite the recent losses, at least one company – Renover – plans to build a Solana reserve. They’ve been buying the dip, with a recent purchase of over $11M bringing their total $SOL holdings to over 83K tokens. The company’s CEO, Joseph Onorati, explained the rationale behind the move. He called Solana the ‘foundation of a high-performance financial system’ and a key strategic asset. Renover aims to raise a total of $42M to fund a Solana reserve for the company. It’s proof of the positive reputation Solana has as both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain ecosystem. It’s worth remembering that US President Donald Trump also included $SOL in the planned US Digital Assets Stockpile alongside other best altcoins like $XRP and $ETH. Short-term losses shouldn’t hinder Solana’s continued ecosystem growth, and Solaxy could be in a perfect position to accelerate that expansion. The Potential Impact of Solaxy on Solana’s Ecosystem Solaxy’s development comes at a critical time for Solana. By addressing the network’s scalability issues, Solaxy could play a pivotal role in restoring confidence and attracting new projects to the Solana ecosystem, making it one of the best crypto to buy now . All the information provided here is just that – information. Do your own research before making any investment decisions; this is not financial advice. Solaxy could position Solana as a more robust platform, capable of supporting a resurgence of meme coins and high-demand applications, including DeFi and NFT projects.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-14 13:57:59

Kraken, the world’s 13th largest centralized cryptocurrency exchange (CEX) by volume, announced the launch of 11,000 US-listed stocks and ETFs with commission-free trading in an effort to bring “equities and digital assets together” under one trading platform. As of April 14, US-based users in New Jersey, Connecticut, Wyoming, Oklahoma, Idaho, Iowa, Rhode Island, Kentucky, Alabama and the District of Columbia can access these stocks and ETFs within their Kraken account, the company announced . Kraken expands to stocks and ETFs. Source: Kraken The exchange plans to continue expanding access to clients in other US states, marking the first part of a “phased national rollout.” Related: Trump’s tariff escalation exposes ‘deeper fractures’ in global financial system Both traditional and cryptocurrency investor sentiment took a significant hit after US President Donald Trump’s reciprocal import tariff announcement on April 2.

Related: 70% chance of crypto bottoming before June amid trade fears: Nansen Crypto is becoming the “backbone” for trading across asset classes Kraken’s expansion into traditional investment products signals the growing utility of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, according to Arjun Sethi, the co-CEO of Kraken. “Crypto isn’t just evolving, it’s becoming the backbone for trading across asset classes, such as equities, commodities and currencies. As demand for 24/7 global access grows, clients want a seamless, all-in-one trading experience.” Sethi added that expanding into traditional equities is a “natural step” toward the tokenization of real-world assets and the “borderless” future of trading built on blockchain rails. Kraken also plans to expand its stock trading offering to other large international markets, including the United Kingdom, Europe and Australia.

However, a crypto advocate with historical credibility has shared insights that challenge this widely held belief. He pointed to key points that make the $1 milestone highly unlikely. Understanding the Implication of the $1 SHIB Price A pundit who famously urged investors to buy at least $1 worth of BTC over 10 years ago has explored what it would really take for Shiba Inu to reach the elusive $1 mark. In a recent post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Davinci Jeremie revealed that one of the key reasons Shiba Inu reaching $1 is highly unlikely is the resulting colossal market capitalization. According to Jeremie, for SHIB to hit $1 per coin, its market value would need to reach an astronomical $600 trillion. To put the sheer scale of this figure into context, the total market cap of gold, the world’s most valuable asset, is around $21.8 trillion. Additionally, Bitcoin (BTC), the crypto market leader, boasts a market cap of $1.67 trillion. The crypto influencer argues that SHIB hitting a $600 trillion market cap would make it bigger than anything in the history of mankind that ever existed. Shiba Inu’s vast circulating supply is also part of the reason why a $1 price is an unrealistic scenario. While crypto assets such as Bitcoin have a limited supply, SHIB’s is significantly bigger as it was created to appeal to its community. As such, skyrocketing to $1 is virtually impossible unless drastic changes are made to the SHIB supply or token burns surge meteorically. Many commentators on X concurred with Jeremie’s belief that Shiba Inu is unlikely ever to hit $1, stressing just how unrealistic and ambitious this price target is. But while $1 is off the table, Jeremie foresees realistic growth potential for the canine-themed crypto. “Shiba Inu will still do well, but not crazy well,” he concluded. At press time, Shiba Inu is trading hands at $0.0000124, down 1.9% in the last 30 days, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko . The second-biggest dog coin by market cap has fared even worse on a year-to-date basis, experiencing a notable 25% loss.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-14 14:00:58

At this stage, even major rallies won’t deliver 100x returns. The real upside in Q2? It’s coming from a much newer player that’s building major momentum: MAGACOINFINANCE . Meanwhile, other long-standing names like XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , Avalanche (AVAX) , and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continue to deliver strong infrastructure, but none carry the early-access narrative that MAGACOINFINANCE currently holds. FINAL CALL — ACT NOW & SECURE YOUR SPOT! MAGACOINFINANCE – Doing What Bitcoin Did in 2012 If you’re looking for what Bitcoin offered over a decade ago—ultra-low entry, momentum, and the chance to be early— MAGACOINFINANCE is checking every box. Now in Stage 7 of its presale, the token is priced at just $0.0002908 , with a public listing target of $0.007 . That alone represents a clean 25x ROI , but trader sentiment suggests it could push even higher post-launch. It’s not just hype. Wallet growth, X mentions, and presale volume are rising week after week. The project has officially sold out Stage 6 and continues trending across major presale aggregators. Traders who missed early BTC runs are now seeing MAGACOINFINANCE as their redemption arc. Still Active: MAGA50X Bonus – 50% Extra Tokens The MAGA50X bonus gives Stage 7 buyers a 50% token bonus , significantly boosting their position before the token hits exchanges. Early access is narrowing fast—this could be the final presale stage with meaningful bonus rewards. SELLING OUT FAST — LIMITED SPOTS XRP, ETH, AVAX, and BCH Remain Solid Choices XRP continues to gain institutional traction Ethereum (ETH) holds its crown for smart contract dominance Avalanche (AVAX) scales multichain functionality with speed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) keeps pushing as a peer-to-peer payments solution 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X Conclusion While Bitcoin is no longer a 100x opportunity, MAGACOINFINANCE is being watched as one of the few tokens that might still deliver that kind of growth. With momentum accelerating and early access still open, traders looking for asymmetrical upside are paying attention—especially as XRP , ETH , AVAX , and BCH continue building around the core.

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/singapore-based-crypto-firm-qcp-capital-explains-short-term-caution-continues-among-bitcoin-investors-heres-why/,"Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital reported that Bitcoin (BTC) risk reversals remained skewed toward sell-offs through June, signaling continued short-term caution among investors. QCP: Bitcoin Options Market Cautious in the Near Term, Optimistic in the Long Term Amid Tariff Uncertainty Despite BTC’s recent price resilience, market sentiment appears to be in a holding pattern as investors monitor developments in global trade policy. Risk reversals, used to measure sentiment in options markets, compare buying and selling demand to show that investors are still protected against potential downside risks in the short term. However, QCP noted a shift in sentiment ahead of the curve, with a more constructive tone emerging for long-dated options. “On Saturday, we observed aggressive buying of 800 contracts for the BTC-27MAR26-100K call,” QCP said, emphasizing the increased interest in long-term bullish bets. This particular options trade implies a confident outlook for BTC to reach $100,000 by March 2026. Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to consolidate in the $80,000-$90,000 range as macroeconomic uncertainty keeps markets under pressure, especially regarding the US tariff policies. Investors appear to be taking a “wait and see” approach amid conflicting signals from Washington on the direction of tariffs targeting China and other major economies. With BTC holding steady despite the broader geopolitical and economic noise, the divergence between near-term caution and long-term optimism underscores a maturing market that is becoming increasingly sensitive to macro signals. *This is not investment advice.

43330768,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104920,1744639663,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Vitalik Buterin Says “Good Social Philosophy” is Needed for the Upper Layers of Ethereum,https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-says-good-social-philosophy-is-needed-for-the-upper-layers-of-ethereum/,"Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder, argued that “good social philosophy” is needed for the upper application layer regarding Ethereum and not so much on the lower infrastructure layer. He reasons that apps built on the upper layer reflect the developer’s motives, philosophy, ethics, and worldview. The lower layer, although influenced by these factors, is not as much because the infrastructure layer must be abstract enough to run many apps. Buterin, by analogy, compares C++ with Ethereum, pointing out that C++ would remain the same regardless of whether there was good social philosophy or otherwise. However, with Ethereum, good social ideas, such as environmental concerns, spurred many Proof of Stake technologies when most people were preoccupied with Proof of Work. Along these lines, he concluded that the lower layer is about 50% general purpose, whereas the upper app layer is about 80% special purpose. Buterin then argued that your worldview more influences apps and should be the focus of good social philosophy. When asked about the apps with bad social philosophy, Buterin said FTX, Lunar Terra labs, and pump.fun. Ethereum’s official account on X raised the question of the network’s ethos and what the apps best represented this ethos. However, community support for this idea was limited, with many people expressing annoyance that Ethereum was focusing on philosophy rather than Layer 1 bread-and-butter problems such as scalability, transaction fees, and network speed. The question then becomes, what comes first, philosophy or technology? Many in the community believe that more people will adopt cypherpunk ideas if the technology works well. Buterin gave examples of good and bad philosophies impacting crypto projects. Polymarket, a good example, started with predicting elections but then moved on to bigger and better things, using the prediction market to improve scientific research. Pump. Fun, a bad example, launched meme coins but doesn’t seem to progress any further, merely supporting rug pulls on the Solana network. Meanwhile, many critics of Ethereum suggest that Solana may soon overtake the token. Pump.fun has recently experienced much chaos, supporting Buterin’s argument. The Solana-based memecoin platform started as a good idea, allowing individuals to make community tokens. However, it soon got out of hand, with people livestreaming all sorts of degrading stunts. However, one could say the same about Ethereum, at least at one point, having the most Ponzi schemes on the crypto market. However, an Ethereum-based Ponzi token would be on the app layer, thus proving Buterin’s point that the app layer is most vulnerable to the developer’s worldview and social philosophy.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-14 14:07:43

Bullish patterns—XRP’s $2.00 breakout, ADA’s double bottom at $0.55, and SOL’s rally to above $130—suggest accumulation phases despite broader market volatility. However, a bitcoin drop below $80,000 or intensified macro pressures could limit gains. Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in a note to CoinDesk that traders must await confirmation of a bitcoin trend reversal before long-term dip buying on major tokens. ""Bitcoin has yet to confirm a growth reversal,"" Kuptsikevich said. ""The key area along the way is the $85,000 level, where the 50-day moving average passes. Its overcoming will be an important confirmation of the bullish sentiment, while fluctuations below it will remain market noise."" ""XRP found support last week on the decline to the 200-day moving averages. This small but encouraging signal suggests that market participants are still adhering to a ‘buy on dips’ strategy, believing in the continuation of the bullish trend,"" he added. Here are technical analysis highlights for XRP, ADA and SOL, based on CoinDesk data: XRP: $2.00 support signals bullish momentum XRP surged 11% from $1.87 to $2.07 in the past week, breaking a psychological $2.00 barrier earlier Monday. Recent price action shows a higher low at $2.065, recovering to $2.068, with decreasing volatility indicating accumulation. Technical Outlook: Support: $2.00-$2.065, reinforced by the 50-hour moving average at $2.03. Resistance: $2.10, with $2.15-$2.20 possible on a break. Indicators: Volume surges during breakouts, and a higher low structure confirms buying interest. RSI near 60 suggests room for upside without overbought risks. Short-Term Target: If $2.00 holds, bulls may want to watch $2.10-$2.15, with a break below risking $1.99. Solana: Ascending channel eyes $125.50 Solana rallied 3% from a low of $125 to nearly $134 in early European hours Monday, part of a 30% climb from $101.30 to $125.48 in the past week driven by ETF approval optimism (76% odds on Polymarket). Support around the $120 mark remains firm, with recent consolidation between $124.50-$125.30 testing $125.50 resistance. Technical Outlook: Support: $120-$124, with $115 as a deeper base. Resistance: $130-$135, with $145 in sight on a breakout. Indicators: Increasing volume and tightening Bollinger Bands hint at an explosive move. MACD’s bullish divergence supports gains. Short-Term Target: Clearing $135 could push SOL to $140 and above. A drop below $120 risks $105, but the channel favors bulls. Cardano: Double bottom drives rebound ADA rebounded 18.6% from $0.537 to $0.637 in the past week, forming a double bottom at $0.55 with strong volume on April 9th. Despite bitcoin’s 15% weekly decline and trade tensions (China’s 34% U.S. import tariffs), ADA’s consolidation above 60 cents (now support) signals strength. With the ascending channel with support at 63 cents, bulls can now target at least 70 cents. Technical Outlook: Support: $0.632-$0.636, backed by the 50-minute moving average at $0.636 as of Monday. Resistance: $0.641, with Fibonacci extensions at $0.645-$0.658. Indicators: Healthy volume and declining volatility suggest accumulation. Stochastic RSI shows building momentum. Short-Term Target: A break below 63 cents risks 55-59 cents, but the double bottom supports the upside.

The probe, which is being conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, is aimed at determining whether the heavy U.S. dependence on foreign chips threatens national security. Trump announced the news on Sunday. “We are considering a wide variety of options on Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN for future National Security Tariff Investigations,” he wrote. If the findings bear out, the United States could impose tariffs on imported semiconductors and related technologies, as Trump wanted. Most of America’s chips are in East Asia, specifically Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and China. Trump’s team contends that reliance is dangerous, particularly amid global tensions. The tariffs in question would be applied at a proposed rate of 25% and gradually elevated as time goes on. The aim is to compel companies to produce chips in the U.S., where Trump claims they are safe and controlled. Trump administration prepares fresh tariffs on electronics and semiconductors Last Friday, the United States government announced a temporary exemption for consumer electronics, smartphones, laptops, and tablets from the latest round of steep mutual tariffs on Chinese imports. The move provided some immediate relief for tech giants like Apple, Dell, and HP, all of which depend on manufacturing operations in China. For instance, Apple has most of its iPhones assembled in factories in China by contractors like Foxconn. However, President Donald Trump signaled over the weekend that this relief is temporary. In a post on his social media platform on Thursday, Trump said the electronics were just being moved to a new tab without indicating any new trade measures were on the way. According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the administration plans to implement separate tariffs that will apply to electronics and semiconductors in the coming one to two months. Lutnick also said in an interview on Sunday that the electronics were previously exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but are included in the new semiconductor and electronics tariff package. The new tariffs will apply to high-tech goods considered key to national security, including smartphones, computers, medical devices, advanced telecom gear, and pharmaceutical components. Lutnick stressed that the administration aims to lessen reliance on supply chains in China and encourage production at home. Critics say the move may increase prices on consumer electronics and worsen already stretched supply chains. However, Trump officials say the longer-term benefits of economic security and job creation are worth the kinks in the immediate term. Lutnick also mentioned that they had done it before in the steel industry and would do it again in the electronics industry. Critics warn the tariffs will hurt the economy Not everyone is on board with Trump’s plan. Economists and investors have warned that continuing to raise tariffs would damage the economy. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, a political backer of Trump, said the policy was too aggressive. He urged Trump to delay the China tariffs for 90 days and pursue a more limited 10% rate instead. According to Ackman, this scaled-back approach would still motivate companies to reduce their reliance on China — without creating market panic. Market analysts have also raised alarms over potential price increases for consumer electronics like iPhones and laptops. Sven Henrich of NorthmanTrader warned that the costs of new tariffs would ultimately fall on American consumers. He also aimed the administration’s erratic messaging, saying the shifting policies make it impossible for businesses to plan effectively. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren slammed Trump’s tariff strategy, calling it “not a coherent tariff policy — it is chaos.” China hits back with 125% tariffs as U.S. shuns talks, eyes deals with allies China has increased its tariffs on American goods to 125% in a retaliatory move. Its Ministry of Commerce said it studied the U.S. exclusions and warned of further action if necessary. “The bell on a tiger’s neck can only be untied by the one who tied it,” China said cryptically. White House officials say they are willing to negotiate trade deals with countries like Japan, South Korea, India, and the EU — but not China. Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade adviser, said the United States sought to partner with “trusted allies” while blaming China for stoking the fentanyl crisis and abusing trade rules. Trump is not intending to speak directly to Chinese President Xi Jinping at this time, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said. Instead, the administration is looking for deals with other countries in the coming weeks. But concerns are rising. On Sunday, billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio warned that the economy could tumble into recession — or worse — if the tariffs are botched. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This decline often suggests reduced investor confidence in the meme coin, which may trigger selling activity. As the sentiment shifts, what’s the next path for SHIB? Let’s explore. Shiba Inu Price At Risk as Active Addresses Hit 1-year Low The number of daily active Shiba Inu addresses has dropped significantly and is currently at the lowest level in one year. This drop highlights a bearish Shiba Inu price prediction as it suggests reduced market interest and fading retail demand for the SHIB meme coin. Data from Santiment shows that the number of daily active addresses stood at 13,436 in mid-February. This metric has since plunged to 2,948, which depicts a 78% in less than two months. SHIB Daily Active Addresses The active address count is directly correlated with the price. Therefore, when the address count is low, it shows a bearish market sentiment and could precede a notable decline in Shiba Inu price . As a recent Coingape article reported, SHIB could fall to as low as $0.0000055 if bears take control. Besides fading retail interest, the other reason that could be causing the decline in SHIB daily active addresses is the declining Total Value Locked (TVL). Data from DeFiLlama shows that the layer 2 network has shed nearly three times its TVL since hitting a peak of $6M in December last year. As the network activity fades, Shiba Inu price may edge lower unless buyers step in. Shiba Inu Technical Analysis Shiba Inu price trades at $0.0000123 with a slight 0.7% gain in 24 hours. The meme coin has been facing sideways price moves in the last week, and if there is no significant uptick in the buying activity, SHIB might continue stalling at the current range. Shiba Inu is touching resistance at the descending trendline on its daily price chart. This also marks the middle Bollinger band, and if SHIB can flip this level, it could push the price to the upper Bollinger band and reverse the bearish trend. The RSI has reached 48, which is close to a neutral level, indicating that neither the buying nor selling pressure is high. If Shiba Inu can surge above the upper band, it will ignite a bull run for SHIB . SHIB/USDT: 1-day Chart However, considering the fading retail interest and the reduced network activity, it is likely that Shiba Inu price will continue to plunge lower. The four-hour chart shows a slight shift and if the meme coin can break out of resistance at the upper trendline, it could defy the bearish thesis and possibly surge.

See the Essential Price Levels,https://bitzo.com/2025/04/can-solana-and-ethereum-overcome-key-resistance-and-spark-an-ath-rally-in-q2-see-the-essential-price-levels,"Solana and Ethereum are near crucial price points that could trigger significant rallies. The upcoming months hold potential for big moves if these coins can break past their current resistance levels. The detailed analysis of essential price zones may reveal insights into the next big surge. Find out which coins are poised for growth. Ethereum Price Update: Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Decline Ethereum experienced a modest rise of 2.60% in the past week, following a decline of 15.39% over the last month. This decline has compounded an overall drop of 37.93% in the past six months. The recent uptick in trading occurs within a broader context of market weakness. Historical trends indicate ongoing selling pressure, overshadowing any short-term gains. Despite occasional recoveries, the long-term outlook remains weak, suggesting caution among traders. Current prices fluctuate between $1538.93 and $2325.85. The nearest support level is at $1255.61, while key resistance is found at $2829.45, with an additional resistance at 3616.37 dollars. Bears are dominant, as momentum indicators and RSI near 41 suggest a bearish sentiment. Traders may consider buying near support and selling towards resistance levels, monitoring for potential trend shifts along the way. Solana Price Action: Key Trends and Support Levels Last month SOL showed a slight decline with a -0.94% change, while six-month performance fell by 14.5%. A one-week jump of 25.19% indicates a short-term recovery amidst a generally bearish trend. Recent price action has been volatile, with attempts to regain strength as the market absorbs longer-term negative momentum. Currently, the coin trades between $97.93 and $165.67, with support near $71.30 and resistance at $206.76. Bulls are gaining momentum this week, but the overall trend remains mixed following the six-month decline. Trading strategies focus on testing the $206.76 resistance and positioning around the $71.30 support, while observing modest momentum and a stable RSI at 54.24. Conclusion ETH and SOL are currently facing critical resistance levels. Breaking through these levels might set the stage for a strong rally in Q2. Monitoring market behavior at these key points will be crucial. inflação Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The move reflects rising demand for AI infrastructure and a broader push to localize advanced tech manufacturing — one that could also benefit crypto miners repurposing their facilities for AI and high-performance computing (HPC). Many of these operators already have access to the large-scale power and cooling systems needed for data center operations, making them potential players in the growing AI economy. Crypto miners, once singularly focused on hashing power, are increasingly looking for ways to fit into the AI and HPC supply chain. Their existing access to power-dense infrastructure and logistical experience in running industrial-scale operations gives them a foothold as demand for AI computation surges. Recent tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump, however, is causing anxiety among miners as the policy changes are expected to raise costs on ASIC miners, electrical components, networking hardware and more. Nvidia has secured over a million square feet of space across Arizona and Texas to build and test Blackwell chips and AI systems, NVIDIA said. Production has already begun at TSMC’s facility in Phoenix. In Texas, supercomputer factories are being built with Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas, with full production expected within 12 to 15 months. This marks a shift for NVIDIA, which has previously relied on overseas facilities. The company will also work with Amkor and SPIL to handle packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA expects these efforts will support up to half a trillion dollars’ worth of AI infrastructure in the next four years. CEO Jensen Huang called the shift “the first time the engines of the world’s AI infrastructure are being built in the United States.” Disclaimer: Parts of this article were generated with the assistance from AI tools and reviewed by our editorial team to ensure accuracy and adherence to our standards.

In one of his latest tweets, he bluntly stated that the dollar will be wiped out by global financial powers. As a result, he urges people to focus instead on Bitcoin and gold. PLEASE LISTEN to Gold, Silver, & Bitcoin. What are they telling you?Gold is at an all time high, demand for silver is exploding, and Bitcoin is roaring.Are you listening?REPEATING MYSELF, I warned of the biggest stock and bond market crash in history was coming in my… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 13, 2025 Robert’s warnings aren’t a one-off. The avid Bitcoin bull has consistently placed more trust in gold and Bitcoin over traditional assets. This latest post could serve as another catalyst for increased investment in cryptocurrency. Those looking to find the best crypto to buy now would be wise to act today. The Corrupt and Crooked Dollar Will Be Wiped Out – Kiyosaki In a post on X, Robert Kiyosaki claimed that the US dollar is ""corrupt and crooked"" and will eventually be removed from the market. He stated that savers in stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds are already being wiped out, and that a sinister global ""banking cartel""—the central banks—is responsible for destroying the dollar’s value. According to him, the real opportunities lie in gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Those who invest in these assets, he said, will be able to survive the ""premeditated disaster."" While Robert's comments are often dismissed as overly bullish crypto sentiment, a deeper look at the charts suggests there may be some truth to his claims. Goldprice.org , a website that tracks gold values, shows that the price of gold CFDs has surged by over 25% since December of last year. Bitcoin has also shown immense growth, even as it remains a highly volatile asset. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is currently trading around the $84K support zone. The next key resistance is $88K—above its 200-day moving average. A breakout past that level could put BTC on track to reclaim its all-time high. Robert Kiyosaki's remarks reflect the growing momentum behind crypto among investors, making it more important than ever to identify the best crypto to buy now. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Top 4 Picks BTC Bull Kiyosaki believers may now be mobilizing after his recent comments, looking to buy more Bitcoin. However, their investment approach might not center around growth, but rather on hedging against market volatility. And even if Bitcoin sees upward movement, the surge could be minimal compared to meme coins that undergo parabolic price shifts. That realization has led to the rise of BTC Bull , a meme coin inspired by Bitcoin. Created by a community of Bitcoin bulls, BTC Bull is a blockchain project whose mechanics are directly tied to Bitcoin’s price action—giving meme coin investors a chance to realize massive profits. These mechanics—token burns and Bitcoin airdrops—are triggered as Bitcoin crosses certain price thresholds. With every burn event, the goal is to create demand pressure on BTC Bull and drive up its value. Meanwhile, Bitcoin airdrops reward true believers with free BTC. The project has already raised upwards of $4.5 million in its presale round and continues to attract investors. It has also earned spots in several top crypto lists by major influencers, including 99Bitcoins. MIND of Pepe Since the meme coin space is the niche where true crypto profitability often emerges, MIND of Pepe could be one of the most obvious ""no-brainer"" buys this year. While it may not be as strong as Bitcoin, its combination of an AI agent narrative and meme-based attributes could push its value up very quickly. MIND of Pepe is a meme + AI agent project, representing the convergence of knowledge and technology to give investors something fresh. Described as an unholy union of memes and AI, the project has published a techmap outlining what it plans to bring to the table. By using real-time intelligence and hive-mind analysis, the project aims to identify early-moving opportunities for investors while delivering deep market insights. The official whitepaper also highlights tools for token deployment as part of the broader utility. Elvora Labs, the developers behind MIND of Pepe, are focusing primarily on the AI agent. The agent is reportedly self-sovereign and will offer sharp, autonomous insights into the crypto market. While development is ongoing, the latest tweet reveals that a base model is already active and currently evolving. 🔥 MIND of Pepe $MIND Update 🔥MIND of Pepe $MIND continues its unstoppable evolution, solidifying its position as the most advanced AI-powered crypto-intelligence systemLLM Persona RefinementMoP’s language model is getting sharper!◉ Enhanced intelligence & engaging… pic.twitter.com/H56ATBvKzn — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) March 20, 2025 This major presale project continues to gain traction, largely due to AI being its core utility. With over $7.7 million already raised, the community is eagerly waiting for its official launch. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is the cryptocurrency powering Best Wallet, a decentralized wallet that’s gaining traction for standing out among DEX storage and swapping solutions. Not only does it offer a wide range of features, but it’s also a multichain wallet—capable of swapping and storing even Bitcoin. This unique capability is a major reason why the next wave of Bitcoin bulls may prefer to store their BTC here. When it comes to functionality, Best Wallet offers perks like a token launchpad, staking, portfolio management, and a host of other features. As part of a growing decentralized ecosystem, there are also plans to expand its utility with more use cases over time. Best Wallet Token is currently in its presale phase and has already raised upwards of $11 million, signaling strong investor interest. Solaxy Since times are relatively bullish for Bitcoin, Solana has also experienced upward momentum, crossing the $120 mark at the time of writing. However, as Solana continues to expand, some scalability issues have started to surface. Solaxy is a project that has emerged to address these challenges. Described as the world’s first Layer 2 solution for the Solana blockchain, Solaxy has made headlines by raising over $30 million during its presale. The project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as ZK rollups, Hyperlane, and Celestia to position itself as an L2 protocol that can enhance Solana’s scalability. What sets Solaxy apart is its core belief: the growth of Solana lies in the emergence of more meme coins within its ecosystem. By solving scalability issues, Solaxy aims to pave the way for this growth. The project reinforces this vision by showcasing memes on its official website and across its social media platforms. In the long run, Solaxy may offer strong value due to its practical utility. But its short-term viral appeal—driven by its meme-friendly approach—is also something worth noting. Final Words Robert Kiyosaki’s warnings about the dollar aren’t new, but their impact could become significantly more profound in today’s shifting socio-political landscape. With Trump’s tariff decisions exposing the dollar’s vulnerabilities—and China and Russia adopting Bitcoin as part of their de-dollarization strategy—the popular author’s prediction may soon prove accurate. That’s why investors should act now and hedge against current market conditions by investing in the best crypto to buy now. Since many of these tokens are still in presale, their earning potential remains high. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The crypto market cap currently sits at $2.69 trillion. BTC held firm above $84,000 over the weekend, briefly climbing above $85,000. However, it has been unable to push above $85,00, although analysts believe it is nearing a breakout confirmation. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) witnessed considerable movement as its price bobbled around $1,600, at times sinking below it and at other times moving past it. Ripple (XRP) , buoyed after its settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), maintained its position above $2, registering a marginal increase and moving to $2.14. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) registered a substantial increase of over 3% and is currently trading at $133. SOL has been up over 30% in the past seven days, and it has mounted a strong recovery. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. However, Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Stellar (XLM) , and Chainlink (LINK) traded in the red, going against market trends. Ripple (XRP) Settles With SEC Ripple (XRP) has rallied over the past few months after settling with regulators. XRP has become the top-performing major cryptocurrency over the past 90 days, according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse. The altcoin’s rally coincides with Ripple agreeing to pay regulators $50 million as part of a settlement. The court had given Ripple a partial victory in 2023 against the SEC after the regulator alleged that XRP was sold as an unregistered security. However, the court stated that while institutional sales were legal, the sale of XRP on public exchanges violated securities laws. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated, “We’re actually taking most of that back, including the interest that had been earned along the way. I think it’s just evidence that the former [Gary] Gensler SEC was on the wrong side of the law. And thanks to the new leadership at the SEC and in the White House.” Ripple plans to expand its business and recently acquired prime broker Hidden Road in a staggering $1.25 billion deal. Garlinghouse stated that such an audacious acquisition would have made no sense a year ago under a hostile SEC led by former Chair Gary Gensler. “This allows even larger institutions like BlackRock, like the biggest Wall Street financial institutions, to come into this market in a way they understand with a safer prime broker to help clear transactions and a bigger balance sheet to do that.” Malware Silently Siphoning Crypto From Wallets Cybersecurity researchers have flagged a malware campaign targeting ETH, XRP, and SOL. The attack targets Exodus and Atomic wallet users through compromised node package manager (NPM) packages. Transactions are redirected to attacker-controlled addresses without the wallet owner’s knowledge. The attackers gain access to the wallet if a developer unknowingly installs a trojan npm package in the project. Once installed, the package scans the system for crypto wallets and installs the malicious code to intercept transactions. Researchers have identified “pdf to office” as a compromised package, appearing legitimate but containing malicious code. The researchers noted, “This latest campaign represents an escalation in the ongoing targeting of cryptocurrency users through software supply chain attacks.” The malware can redirect transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies, including ETH, XRP, SOL, and Tron-based USDT. NFT Sales Volume Slumps The NFT market has reported a substantial decline in sales volume, falling 4.7% to $94.7 million. According to data from CryptoSlam, the downward trend continues the previous week’s $102 million decline. The decline extends beyond just sales volumes, with NFT buyers dropping almost 78% to 128,244 and NFT sellers falling 75% to 85,792. NFT transactions have also reported a substantial slump, dropping 6.3% to 1,441,009. However, despite the decline, the Ethereum blockchain maintained its dominant position, with $36 million in sales, an increase of 41% from last week. Polygon was second with a sales volume of $17.4 million, registering a modest increase of 4.3%. Mythos Chain was third, with a sales volume of $14.1 million, an increase of 2%. However, Solana continued to struggle, with sales registering a sharp decline of 33% and falling to $6.5 million. Mantra Token Collapses over 90% The price of the Mantra (OM) token, the native token of the Mantra real-world tokenized asset blockchain, has collapsed over 90% in 24 hours. The token price fell from above $6.3 to $0.50, shedding over 90% of its market cap. Some market watchers and analysts called the dramatic collapse a rug pull and urged the Mantra team to address the problem. “[The] team needs to address this or OM looks like it could head to zero, biggest rug pull since LUNA/FTX?” However, the reason for the stunning collapse remains unclear. Mantra’s collapse comes after several high-profile incidents in the crypto ecosystem, including the LIBRA meme coin implosion and the $1.4 billion Bybit hack, attributed to the dreaded North Korean Lazarus Group. Mantra’s team and co-founder responded to the token collapse, adding that the project’s Telegram group was active, and the team’s tokens remained in their custody. “MANTRA community - we want to assure you that MANTRA is fundamentally strong. Today’s activity was triggered by reckless liquidations, not anything to do with the project. One thing we want to be clear on: This was not our team. We are looking into it and will share more details about what happened as soon as we can.” The team stated the OM token collapse was triggered by reckless liquidations and not related to actions taken by the team. TRUMP Meme Coin Facing Growing Market Pressure Donald Trump’s TRUMP token faces significant market pressure as an upcoming token unlock looms. According to data from the Tokenomist, the Solana-based meme coin project is set to release 40 million TRUMP tokens worth over $320 million to its team. This is the project’s first major unlock and adds roughly 20% of the current circulating supply to the markets. The project will then begin releasing 493,000 TRUMP tokens, worth around $4 million, every day until the next significant token unlock, scheduled for July. The upcoming token unlocks have raised significant concerns about the impact on prices due to the increased supply. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a marginal increase during the ongoing session after spending Sunday in the red, dropping almost 2% to $83,776. The flagship cryptocurrency is trading around $84,457, marginally down over the past 24 hours, but is up nearly 13% over the weekly timeframe. Although BTC registered a significant increase on Friday and Saturday, it has struggled to punch through $85,000, with selling pressure forcing buyers to lose momentum. However, buyers have not ceded much ground to bearish sentiment and have kept the price steady above $80,000. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital believes BTC is ready for a technical breakout from its multi-month downtrend. The analysts stated that when the flagship cryptocurrency successfully breaks out of a technical downtrend, it will establish a new uptrend phase. “Bitcoin is on the cusp of a breakout Mere hours away from performing the initial but crucial steps towards fully confirming a breakout beyond the multi-month Downtrend And when BTC breaks a technical downtrend it enters a new technical uptrend.” The prediction comes when BTC is going through a challenging phase, down over 22% from its all-time high. However, despite the significant correction, on-chain data suggests accumulation activity at crucial levels. Data from Glassnode has highlighted a considerable BTC accumulation of around $79,000, with approximately 40,000 BTC purchased in this zone. Markets have also worked through a larger cluster of around $82,000, where roughly 51,000 BTC were accumulated. These accumulations of the asset indicate strong levels of support. BTC has also broken above $83,500, where another 48,500 BTC have been accumulated. Now that the flagship cryptocurrency has broken above this level, markets could see an acceleration in upward momentum. One analyst has noted that BTC has broken out of a falling wedge pattern, with a bullish divergence forming on key indicators. A falling wedge pattern is a bullish reversal formation characterized by converging downward trend lines. BTC registered a substantial decline on Wednesday (April 2), slipping below $85,000 and the 20-day SMA to $82,525. The price recovered on Thursday and Friday, registering marginal increases and settling at $83,828. However, it was back in the red over the weekend, registering a marginal decline on Saturday before plunging over 6% on Sunday, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $78,301.BTC registered significant volatility on Monday, dropping to a low of $74,393, surging past $80,000 before settling at $79,164, ultimately registering an increase of 1.10%. However, BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping almost 4% and settling at $76,283. Source: TradingView Markets rallied on Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause in tariffs. As a result, BTC surged over 8%, going past $80,000 and settling at $82,593. The rally lost momentum on Thursday as the price dropped 3.63%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $79,592. Bullish sentiment returned to the market on Friday as BTC rallied almost 5% to reclaim $80,000, move past the 20-day SMA, and settle at $83,370. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price registered an increase of 2.41% to move past the 50-day SMA and settle at $85,379. However, selling pressure returned on Sunday as the price dropped almost 2%, slipping below $85,000 and the 50-day SMA and settling at $83,776. The current session sees BTC up over 1%, trading above the 50-day SMA at $84,700 as buyers look to build momentum and push the price above $85,000. If BTC can cross and consolidate above this level, it could rally to $90,000. The MACD shows growing bullish sentiment, indicating buyers have the upper hand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) steadied itself over the weekend, maintaining its position above $1,500. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has steadied itself, bouncing off the daily support level. However, it faces resistance at around $1,700 and is trading around $1,640. Analysts believe if ETH can close above $1,700, it could extend its rally to test the next resistance level, which sits around $1,850-$1,900. A break above this level could set ETH up for a move towards reclaiming $2,000. ETH was trading in the red towards the end of the first week of April, registering a marginal decline on Friday and Saturday and settling at $1,805 as it struggled to stay above $1,800. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as markets tanked. As a result, ETH plunged over 12%, slipping below $1,800 and settling at $1,580. Selling pressure intensified on Monday as ETH plunged to a low of 1,412. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $1,500 and settle at $1,552, ultimately registering a decline of almost 2%. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price fell over 5%, slipping below $1,500 and settling at $1,472. However, markets rallied Wednesday after President Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause. As a result, ETH surged over 13% to reclaim $1,600 and settle at $1,668. Source: TradingView The rally lost momentum on Thursday, dropping almost 9% and settling at $1,521. Despite selling pressure, ETH remained above $1,500 and registered an increase of nearly 3% on Friday to settle at $1,556. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price registered an increase of almost 5% and settled at $1,644. However, ETH lost momentum on Sunday, dropping nearly 3% and slipping below $1,600 to $1,596. The current session sees ETH up almost 3% as buyers look to push above $1,700. A break above this level could drive ETH past the 20-day SMA towards $1,850. The MACD suggests a bullish bias, indicating buyers are gaining the upper hand. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has made a strong recovery after slipping below $100 and falling to a low of $95 at the beginning of the previous week. SOL had registered a significant drop of over 12% a day prior as it fell to $105 on Sunday.

Bullish sentiment intensified on Saturday as SOL surged past the 20-day SMA and $130, rising 9% and settling at $132.

The move expands Kraken's business as a growing list of U.S. crypto companies aiming to go public on U.S. exchanges — joining the likes of Coinbase (COIN), Marathon Digital (MARA), and Bitdeer (BTDR), among others. The Kraken stock trading rollout begins in 10 U.S. jurisdictions including New Jersey, Connecticut and Alabama, with plans to expand access across the country and to international markets such as the U.K., Europe and Australia. Clients in these states can now buy and sell equities directly through their Kraken account using the mobile app, Kraken Pro or web interface. “Crypto isn’t just evolving, it’s becoming the backbone for trading across asset classes, such as equities, commodities and currencies,"" said Kraken’s co-CEO Arjun Sethi in a statement. ""As demand for 24/7 global access grows, clients want a seamless, all-in-one trading experience.” “Expanding into equities is a natural step for us, and paves the way for the tokenization of assets,” he continued. This move makes Kraken one of the few crypto-native companies to offer traditional asset trading alongside digital assets under a single account. The new product is offered through Kraken Securities, a FINRA-regulated entity focused on equities. By consolidating crypto and traditional finance tools, Kraken is positioning itself to compete more directly with platforms like Robinhood and Public that already cater to multi-asset investors.

Mullin reassured users that Mantra and its partners are actively working to support the recovery of the Mantra (OM) token, though he noted that details around token buybacks and potential burns are still being developed. “We’re still in the early stages of putting together this plan for potential buyback of tokens,” the CEO said, adding that the OM token recovery is Mantra’s “preeminent and primary concern right now.” At the time of writing, OM traded at $0.73, slightly higher than its post-collapse low of $0.52 recorded on April 13 at around 7:30 pm UTC, according to data from CoinGecko. “Baseless allegations” In addition to denying reports claiming that key Mantra investors dumped the OM token pre-crash, the Mantra CEO also denied allegations that the Mantra team controls 90% of the token’s supply. “I think it’s baseless. We posted a community transparency report last week, and it shows all the different wallets,” Mullin said, highlighting the “two sides” of Mantra’s tokenomics. Source: Cointelegraph “You have the Ethereum side and you have the mainnet side,” Mullin noted, adding the Ethereum-based token is hard capped and has been around since August 2020. “The biggest holder of OM on exchange is Binance,” Mullin continued, referring the public to Etherscan records . The top eight addresses of OM holdings. Source: Etherscan However, the top OM wallet is currently held by crypto exchange OKX, which controls 14% of the circulating supply, or roughly 130 million tokens. What’s next for Mantra’s $109-million MEF fund? Mullin also addressed the Mantra Ecosystem Fund (MEF), a $109-million fund launched on April 7 in collaboration with its major strategic investors, including Laser Digital and Shorooq. Other investors in the fund also included Brevan Howard Digital, Valor Capital, Three Point Capital, Amber Group, Manifold, UoB Venture, Damac, Fuse, LVNA Capital, Forte and others.

End of the staking program on Binance In the AMA, the Mantra CEO also said that a 38-million-OM transaction to the Binance cold wallet on April 14 is related to a staking program on Binance. “It was actually Binance,” Mullin said, adding that Binance had OM tokens on its exchange that it was using as a staking program. Source: Onchain Lens “So, they just returned them because the staking program ended,” he said. Mullin also emphasized that many of the transactions that caught the community’s reactions post-crash involved collaterals by an unnamed exchange . “Effectively, those tokens were being used as collateral on an exchange. Then, the exchange decided that it was not the position they wanted to maintain anymore, for whatever reason,” Mullin said, adding: “So, what happened was basically the positions were taken over by the exchange that took the collateral and started selling, which caused a cascade of sell pressure and forced more liquidations.” Mullin said Mantra remains committed to addressing the situation as transparently as possible. “We’re not running from anything,” he said, adding that the incident was a “very unfortunate situation.” Magazine: Bitcoin eyes $100K by June, Shaq to settle NFT lawsuit, and more: Hodler’s Digest, April 6–12",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB|OM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-14 15:25:43

In an announcement on April 14, the Tether ( USDT ) issuer said that it planned to mine Bitcoin ( BTC ) through OCEAN’s mining pool, deploying both existing and future hashrate. Tether will roll out the software across its operations globally. It includes underserved locations such as Africa, the company wrote in a blog post. The move to mine via the platform, which was launched by Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, aligns with Tether’s effort to support the Bitcoin network, said the company’s chief executive officer Paolo Ardoino. “Deploying hashrate to OCEAN aligns with both our mining investments and our broader mission to fortify Bitcoin against centralizing forces,” Ardoino stated.

Their participation underscores the value of open, censorship-resistant mining protocols.” OCEAN, backed by Jack Dorsey, unveiled its mining pool in late 2023, and moved its headquarters to El Salvador in May 2024. The team at OCEAN introduced DATUM, short for decentralized alternative templates for universal mining in September 2024. Meanwhile, Tether, whose stablecoin USDT has grown to over $144 billion, announced it would establish its headquarters in the Bitcoin-friendly country in early 2025. The collaboration between the two companies is part of Tether’s market presence and investment. Apart from USDT, the company’s growing traction includes infrastructure, education and artificial intelligence . In March, Tether revealed its user base had hit 400 million, managing a 14% spike in the five months going back to October. Most of this happened in the first quarter of 2025.

Analysts believe the flagship cryptocurrency is readying for a technical breakout from its multi-month downtrend. The uptick in bullish sentiment has seen BTC register an increase of almost 11% over the past week, with on-chain data suggesting strong accumulation activity at key levels. Japan’s Metaplanet Purchases Additional $26M Worth Of Bitcoin Metaplanet, a publicly traded company in Tokyo, has announced that it has added to its Bitcoin holdings, purchasing 3.78 billion yen ($26.3) million worth of BTC . The company’s latest BTC acquisition comes when global markets are bracing for a fallout of the US’ shifting trade stance against China. According to the company’s announcement, it purchased 319 BTC at an average price of 12.85 million yen ($82,549) per coin, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 4,525 BTC . “Metaplanet has acquired 319 BTC for ~$26.3 million at ~$82,549 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 108.3% YTD 2025. As of 4/14/2025, we hold 4525 $BTC acquired for ~$386.3 million at ~$85,366 per bitcoin.” The company has also outlined an aggressive strategy to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC by the end of the year. Metaplanet’s investment in the flagship cryptocurrency comes amid growing tensions and uncertainty around US trade tariffs. Markets have reacted to the mixed messaging with increased volatility, with BTC dropping below $75,000 at the beginning of last week before recovering to reclaim $80,000. Metaplanet is quickly becoming one of Asia’s biggest Bitcoin advocates. The company recently announced the appointment of Eric Trump to its Strategic Advisory Board, citing his vast business experience and growing interest in BTC . Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy mirrors Michael Saylor’s Strategy, whose aggressive BTC accumulation has influenced several publicly listed firms. Crypto And Bitcoin Investment Products Struggle To Keep Up With Tariff War Crypto investment products are experiencing persistent outflows as markets struggle to keep up with President Trump’s unpredictable tariff strategy, sending a wave of uncertainty over global markets. As a result, investors are being cautious even though BTC and other cryptocurrencies are trading at a substantial discount. According to data from CoinShares, crypto investment products have registered a little over $795 million in net outflows, making it the third consecutive week of outflows. Bitcoin investment products registered the largest outflows with over $750 million. However, the year-to-date (YTD) inflows remain positive at $545 million. However, if BTC’s investment products continue their downward trend, they could erase all gains registered in 2025. Data from SoSoValue shows spot Bitcoin ETFs registered modest daily outflows of $1.03 million for the week ending April 11, bringing the week’s total outflows to $713 million, making it the second consecutive week of outflows. Previous weekly outflows amounted to $172.69, bringing April’s total outflows to $814 million. This came after March’s $767 million in outflows and February’s record-breaking $3.56 billion in outflows. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is up over 1% during the current session as it looks to punch through $85,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has started the week on a bullish note after spending Sunday in the red and registering a drop of almost 2%. BTC has rebounded strongly after plunging below $80,000 and falling to a low of $74,393 early last week. Analysts believe it could surge to $90,000 if it breaks above the 200-day EMA. Analysts believe BTC could be entering an accumulation phase as it trades within a range capped by resistance around $86,000 to $88,000. Data from Glassnode highlights significant BTC accumulation at around $79,000, with traders purchasing approximately 40,000 BTC in this support zone. BTC has also worked through a larger cluster at around $82,000 where around $51,000 BTC had been accumulated. The flagship cryptocurrency also broke above $83,500, a level that had 48,500 BTC in accumulation. Such levels often act as support. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital believes BTC is on the verge of a technical breakout from its multi-month downtrend. “Bitcoin is on the cusp of a breakout Mere hours away from performing the initial but crucial steps towards fully confirming a breakout beyond the multi-month Downtrend And when BTC breaks a technical downtrend $BTC enters a new technical uptrend.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Wednesday (April 2), falling over 3% to go below the 20-day SMA and $85,000 and settle at $82,525. The price recovered on Thursday and Friday, registering marginal increases and moving to $83,828. However, BTC lost momentum over the weekend, dropping to $83,423 on Saturday. Bearish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC plunged over 6%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $78,301. Bearish sentiment and volatility registered a substantial uptick on Monday as BTC fell to a low of $74,383 before rising past $80,000 and then settling at $79,164, ultimately registering an increase of 1.10%. BTC was back in the red Tuesday, falling almost 4% to $76,283. Source: TradingView Markets rallied on Wednesday after Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs. As a result, BTC surged over 8% to reclaim $80,000 and settle at $82,593. However, the rally lost momentum on Thursday as the price fell 3.63%, slipping below $80,000 and settling at $79,592. Buyers returned to the market on Friday as BTC rose almost 5% to reclaim $80,000 and move past the 20-day SMA to settle at $83,370. BTC continued to push higher on Saturday as the price rose 2.41%, crossing the 50-day SMA and $85,000 and settling at $85,378. BTC lost momentum again on Sunday, falling almost 2% to slip below $85,000 and settle at $83,776. The current session sees BTC up nearly 1% as bulls look to break above $85,000 and push towards $90,000. The MACD shows growing bullish sentiment, indicating buyers have the upper hand.

Now, as Bitcoin's $90,000 level is being discussed again, Bitfinex said that this rise was due to the macro easing that came after US President Donald Trump announced his decision to suspend new tariffs for 90 days, the decrease in trade tensions and the revival of risk appetite. Bitfinex stated in its weekly report that the strong rally in BTC was supported by spot market demand, indicating that there is genuine belief among buyers for the rally. At this point, Bitfinex argued that Bitcoin aims to reach $90,000 as spot demand increases and macro uncertainty decreases. Although BTC remains range-bound between $75,000 and $85,000, analysts said that if continued spot buying by long-term investors and renewed accumulation continue, there is a potential for a price breakout towards $90,000. However, analysts said they expect a short-term pullback, adding that the reaction to the decline will determine Bitcoin's direction: “The spot cumulative volume delta on major exchanges suggests continued aggressive buying, but the price remains stuck in the $75,000 to $85,000 range. This divergence points to the potential for a breakout to the upside if supply shrinks further. However, a short-term pullback driven by profit-taking is expected early this week. The response to this drop (whether buyers continue to absorb supply) will determine whether Bitcoin continues to head toward $90,000.” *This is not investment advice.

Speaking during a recent interview with crypto analyst Scott Melker, better known in the crypto community as “Wolf of All Streets,” Hoskinson highlighted Cardano’s upcoming Layer 2 solution, Leos, which he described as “the first solution to the blockchain trilemma.” “We’re developing Leos, which is going to give us Solana-style speed but with full decentralization and no stalls,” Hoskinson stated. He emphasized that this advancement would be complemented by Cardano’s other scaling solutions, including Hydra and Midgard, an optimistic rollup system. Notably, the blockchain trilemma refers to the challenge of simultaneously achieving scalability, security, and decentralization, a problem that has plagued many blockchain projects. While Solana has gained popularity for its high transaction speeds, it has faced criticism for occasional network outages, which Hoskinson quickly referenced. “You see Solana go down all the time… yet we’re still there pushing through, and we don’t suffer from any of that stuff,” he added, highlighting Cardano’s seven-year track record of uninterrupted operation. Hoskinson further defended Cardano against what he described as persistent misconceptions about the network’s capabilities. “ People say, ‘Oh, there’s one transaction per block; it’s just a lie’… year by year, transaction volume is increasing dramatically, and the system’s been running for seven years straight, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with no downtime.” The Cardano founder cited independent metrics to support his claims about the network’s strength, noting, “ The Edward decentralization index says that Cardano is the most decentralized cryptocurrency on the planet.” Beyond competing with Solana on speed, Hoskinson outlined a broader vision for Cardano’s ecosystem, detailing plans to become “the nexus of the entire UTXO DeFi ecosystem.” This includes initiatives like Lightning Hydra—a combination of Cardano’s Layer 2 solution with Bitcoin ‘s Lightning Network and Midnight, a private smart contract platform. Hoskinson expressed frustration at what he perceives as a lack of recognition for Cardano’s achievements. “It does get frustrating when you have the same conversation again and again… they don’t acknowledge what we’ve achieved, they don’t acknowledge where we’ve been.” With a reported $1.5 billion on-chain treasury to fund development and strategic investments, Cardano appears well-positioned to deliver on these ambitious technical promises. If successful, Leos could represent a significant advancement in blockchain technology, potentially positioning Cardano as a major competitor in the high-performance blockchain arena currently dominated by networks like Solana. The developments come as Cardano expands its utility across multiple fronts, including partnerships with Bitcoin-focused projects and real-world asset integration.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-14 15:29:41

Speaking on CNBC Monday morning , Moir addressed both the macro backdrop affecting Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the firm’s launch of a Dogecoin ( DOGE ) exchange-traded product in Europe. Moir stated the volatility striking crypto has been more subdued than some may think, given the scale of macroeconomic shocks affecting other markets. Rather, volatility in the crypto is “just moving in line with broader assets.” He pointed out that Bitcoin’s long-term volatility has been decreasing, particularly as more institutional allocators enter the space. In fact, we are at a point where “volatility for Bitcoin that is on par with equities,” he added. While critics argue that Bitcoin’s behavior during inflationary spikes undermines its hedge status, Moir disagrees. “The inflation hedge argument is still very much there,” he said. “Bitcoin has a fixed supply, and we expect it to continue to be seen as a store of value by new investors coming into the market.” Read more: Apple stock gains as tech stocks, Bitcoin bounce on tariff reprieve Dogecoin ETP timing Moir also addressed 21Shares’ recent launch of a Dogecoin ETP in Europe , a move some questioned due to the meme coin’s historic volatility and unconventional origins. Moir defended the decision as both strategic and timely. “Dogecoin has particularly interesting properties,” he said. “It started as a fun social token with perfect product-market fit, but it’s evolving toward a global payments currency. We’re seeing real use cases by large corporates now.” He added that the ETP, which enables investors to access Dogecoin through a traditional financial product, is aimed at long-term holders, not short-term speculators. “Whether it was an up market or a down market, it didn’t really matter to us,” he said. “We want to make crypto investing as easy as buying a stock.” Moir emphasized that 21Shares’ Dogecoin product is the result of a rare, officially endorsed partnership with the Dogecoin community—signaling growing institutional interest in the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. “We’re really excited about this partnership because it’s highly unique,” he said. “You do not usually see these sorts of officially endorsed and exclusive arrangements.” You might also like: Dogecoin price early bullish signal points to a surge soon",News|Bitcoin|Dogecoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-14 15:30:07

Bullish signals continue to build around XRP , Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) as they push toward key upside levels. While $50K may be a psychological milestone for some and a realistic target for others, one thing is clear: market momentum is accelerating. MAGACOINFINANCE . Once under the radar, it’s now being discussed in presale circles, influencer watchlists, and altcoin forums as one of the few plays with fresh upside still on the table. Meanwhile, projects like Solana (SOL) , TON , SUI , and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continue to round out diversified portfolios with a focus on speed, interoperability, and payments infrastructure.

The accusations, most of which were made on X (formerly Twitter), have triggered a wider conversation about the ethics of crypto marketing tactics targeting students and the growing rivalry between exchanges in China. Blockbeats raises alarm over campus trading promotions The drama started in the early hours of April 14, 2025, after BlockBeats, a Chinese-focused crypto and web3 news and observer platform, made a call to all major trading platforms to stop promoting contract experience bonuses to college students in an article and X post . Translated text of Blockbeats’ call to curb advertising trading contracts to students. Source: Blockbeats Blockbeats alleged that some crypto platforms were issuing bonuses to students, and given the mode of operation and the incentives attached, the program is inducing gambling behavior among students. According to Blockbeats, these platforms target college students with weak risk awareness and insufficient fund management capabilities. The news blog is bringing its observation to the crypto community and the public at large’s notice to raise awareness about the issue and curb such activities before they lead to eventualities reminiscent of the controversial “naked loan.” That infamous case saw students blackmailed with the explicit images they had submitted as collateral for loans. Blockbeats is recalling that episode, arguing that it foresees a similar future and urging stakeholders to resist such behavior. Allegations and a request for proof After Blockbeats’ post, X user @silverfang88 made a post written in Chinese , claiming, “I just found out that Bybit went to school and asked students to download bybit to give them a trial contract, and then invited a bunch of KOLs to Bali to shut them up and report OKX wallet to the legal department. They charged a 1.4m listing fee for each project.” In response, Zhou pushed back sharply, questioning the validity of the claims . “Which school allows students to trade contracts? Show the evidence. Which legal department reported the competitor? Where is the evidence? Which coin has charged a listing fee? Any evidence?” Zhou wrote. “The cryptocurrency world is so chaotic because of idiots like you who spread rumors without any evidence and fantasize every day.” CEO Ben Zhou responds to accusations naming Bybit’s involvement in offering trade contracts to Chinese students. Source: @benbybit (X/Twitter) The allegations and Zhou’s rebuttal have fueled a wider debate around user acquisition practices employed by major crypto platforms. Industry observers are questioning whether some exchanges are pushing the limits of responsible marketing, especially when engaging younger, financially inexperienced users. Bitget responds, distances itself from controversy Amid the controversy, another major exchange with a campus ambassador program, Bitget, issued a statement denying any involvement in offering contract experience bonuses to students. Xie Jiayin, Bitget’s China lead, said in a post on X that “The Bitget Campus Ambassador Program aims to promote blockchain technology, popularize Web3 knowledge, and provide internship and practical opportunities for college students.” He clarified that Bitget has never distributed contract experience funds to students through any channel or form. Jiayin added that Bitget halted the promotion of contract rebates to college students after they noticed that it was misunderstood as contract incentives. He mentioned that they rejected all applications made toward such promotions. According to Jiayin, their current focus and dealings with blockchain associations of various universities are to popularize Web3 industry knowledge and provide employment and internship guidance and opportunities. He also claimed these programs have helped 28 college students secure jobs at Bitget. Jiayin has also welcomed supervision of its programs and called for reporting any of the alleged inducements to students, adding that they at Bitget will provide a maximum reward of 1000 USDT while also seriously dealing with the matter. He also urged media platforms to be specific in their reporting, as phrases such as “major trading platforms” lump every platform together, which can be misleading to the public.

In 2028, the coin could be worth between $18.49 and $21.97, with an average price of $19.01. By 2031, Cosmos (ATOM) might touch $67.56. Cosmos (ATOM) is a blockchain ecosystem that facilitates interoperability among independent blockchains. Co-founded by Jae Kwon and Ethan Buchman in 2014, Cosmos aims to create a decentralized network of blockchains that can communicate and transact seamlessly. Its main components include the Cosmos Hub, which serves as the central chain, and multiple “zones” that operate under their own rules while connecting to the Hub. The platform uses the Tendermint consensus algorithm and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol to enable fast low-cost transactions. Fees average around $0.01, and confirmation times are approximately seven seconds. Cosmos employs a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism, allowing users to stake their ATOM tokens for network security and transaction validation. Since its ICO in 2017, Cosmos has raised significant funding and established a growing ecosystem, including notable projects like Terra and Binance. With over 286 million ATOM tokens in circulation and a market cap exceeding $7.7 billion, Cosmos is positioned as a key player in the evolving landscape of blockchain technology, often referred to as the “Internet of Blockchains” for its ambitious goal of connecting diverse blockchain networks.

The candlesticks are trending near the lower Bollinger Band, indicating persistent downward pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 42.27, which is below the neutral 50 level, signifying subdued buying interest and a lack of bullish momentum. The price recently broke below the middle Bollinger Band, suggesting that sellers are gaining control. Unless ATOM finds strong support around the $3.93 level, it could revisit previous lows. A recovery would require a daily close above the midline near $4.44 with volume confirmation. ATOM/USD 4-hour price chart ATOM 4-hour price chart ; Tradingview Based on the 4-hour chart for Cosmos (ATOM), the cryptocurrency exhibits a bearish-to-neutral sentiment. Price action remains below the 20-period SMA within the Bollinger Bands, indicating resistance near $4.22 and limited upward momentum. The MACD histogram is declining, with the MACD line below the signal line and deep in negative territory, suggesting growing bearish momentum. The Balance of Power (BoP) is at -0.68, reinforcing seller dominance in the short term. Unless ATOM reclaims the $4.22 mark with increasing volume, it may continue consolidating or decline further toward the lower Bollinger Band near $4.00. Traders should expect cautious sideways movement ahead.

Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts for Cosmos (ATOM), the market outlook leans bearish with underlying weakness. On the 1-day chart, ATOM continues to struggle below the 20-day moving average, with the RSI hovering near 42, suggesting waning momentum without reaching oversold territory. The Bollinger Bands are moderately wide, indicating potential for further volatility. On the 4-hour chart, MACD and Balance of Power confirm bearish control, with the price failing to establish higher highs. The asset remains confined below key resistance near $4.44. Without a decisive breakout, consolidation or a gradual drop toward $3.90 remains the likelier short-term outcome. Is Cosmos a good investment? Cosmos (ATOM) shows potential as an investment due to its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and recent upgrades like ATOM 2.0. Analysts predict long-term price growth, but the crypto market is highly volatile. Investors should conduct their research and consider risks before investing in ATOM. Is Cosmos a Safe Network? The Cosmos network is built on the Tendermint consensus protocol, offering robust security and interoperability features. However, like all blockchain systems, it faces potential risks, requiring users to remain cautious and well-informed about emerging vulnerabilities and challenges. Will Cosmos reach $50? Based on Cosmo’s current market trends and growth projections, Cosmos (ATOM) is expected to reach a value of approximately $45.96 by 2030. Will Cosmos reach $100? Current predictions suggest that Cosmos (ATOM) will unlikely reach $100 soon. Analysts estimate it would require a significant increase of over 900% to hit that price. Our forecasts place its maximum potential around $67.56 by 2031, indicating limited short-term growth potential. Does Cosmos have a good long-term future? Cosmos (ATOM) promises a strong long-term future, with forecasts indicating significant price increases over the next decade. Analysts predict that ATOM could reach values as high as $45.96 by 2030, driven by its unique position in the blockchain ecosystem and ongoing developments in interoperability and scalability. The Cosmos Hub is well-established and supported by a dedicated community, enhancing its growth and adoption prospects in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Thus, the cosmos network could expand to a wider user base. Recent news/opinion on Cosmos Cosmos announced that Shade Protocol has launched ShadeX, the first encrypted money market, allowing users to earn passive yields while maintaining privacy. Unlike traditional crypto markets that expose financial details, ShadeX secures transactions with encryption.

Cosmos historic price sentiment Cosmos price history Cosmos, created by Ethan Buchman and Jae Kwon, launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017, with the network officially going live two years later in 2019. During the bullish market cycle of 2021, Cosmos saw its price peak at over $44, driven by significant investor interest and market optimism. However, following this surge, on 3rd April 2022, the price of Cosmos (ATOM) sharply declined to $6.39. Since then, Cosmos entered a prolonged phase of consolidation, trading within a range between $6.39 and $16 as market dynamics fluctuated. In early 2024, particularly around 8th March, Cosmos encountered significant resistance at the $13 level, struggling to gain momentum above this point. This resistance reflected broader market sentiment and potential selling pressure. By July 2024, ATOM’s price was trading in a narrower range, between $5 and $6, indicating a lack of upward momentum. By August 2024, the price had further dipped to $4.02, suggesting increasing bearish pressure. This recent decline highlights ongoing challenges for Cosmos in maintaining its price stability and suggests potential further downside as market bears dominate, putting pressure on potential buyers to defend against a continued downward trend. On September 2024, the Cosmos price ranged between $4 to $5, and on October 06, the price traded at $4.5837 with a trading volume of $48.48M. On November 5, ATOM was trading at $4.10. By December 5, ATOM’s price surged significantly, trading at $10. Cosmos ATOM surged to $9 at the start of December 2024, but it declined to $9.6 and closed the year at $6.3. In January 2025, Cosmos peaked at $7.77, and in February, it’s trading between $4.54 and $4.86. ATOM value decreased further in March as it dipped to the $4.0 to $4.2 range. Cosmos ATOM continues to trade between $4.0 to $4.2.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ATOM|BLOCKCHAIN|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-14 15:32:30

It has surged by over 170% in the last 30 days, outperforming the stock market and top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Fartcoin is still showing bullish signs, a trend that may be boosted if Solana price surges to $200. Fartcoin Price Would Benefit if Solana Surges to $200 The ongoing Fartcoin surge has triggered more upside for some popular Solana meme coins. Dogwifhat has jumped by 37% in the last seven days, while Popcat, Cat in a dogs world, and Gigachad have soared by 20% and 50%, respectively. The rally has also sparked a substantial Solana price comeback. After bottoming at $94.5 earlier this month, SOL has soared by 40% to $135, outperforming comparable tokens like Cronos and Avalanche. This Solana rally has excited some crypto investors, some whom expect it to rebound to $200 eventually. Such a move would signal a 50% surge from the current level. Such a rebound is possible since the coin has a history of dropping and rising over time. For example, Solana price crashed to $168 on January 13 and then recovered by 75% to $295 a few days later. Also, as shown below, Solana plunged to $109 in August last year and then soared by 140% to $265 a few months later. A renewed Solana surge would be highly bullish for meme coins in its ecosystem like Fartcoin, Bonk, and Dogwifhat. Solana Price Chart Fartcoin Technical Analysis and Key Targets Fartcoin price has soared after bottoming at $0.19 in March. It has soared by over 300%, making it the best-performing major coins in the market, and pushing its market cap close to the $1 billion mark. The token moved above the key resistance point at $0.6345 on April 9. This was a notable level since it was the upper side of the cup and handle pattern , a highly accurate continuation sign. This C&H pattern had a depth of 71%. The coin has now moved above the 25-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a bullish sign. Therefore, measuring 71% from the upper side of the cup brings the target price at $1.0730, which also coincides with the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. That target would be a 20% above the current level. A move above that target would point to an increase to the 50% retracement point at $1.3732. A recent CoinGape article quoted an analyst who predicted that Fartcoin would soar to $1.29. Fartcoin Price The bullish Fartcoin price forecast will be canceled if the price drops below the crucial support at $0.6345, the upper side of the cup. It would signal a potential drop to the lower side of the cup at $0.2125.

In a report released Monday, the IMF cautioned that escalations in geopolitical risk, especially related to trade conflicts, could lead to major and lasting corrections in global asset prices. The global lender noted recent developments, particularly the White House’s tariff agenda, have introduced a “heightened uncertainty” that could disrupt macro-financial stability across economies. The IMF’s assessment follows several weeks of volatility in global financial markets. Since President Trump’s January 20 inauguration for a second term, the S&P 500 index has fallen more than 10%, bond markets have experienced several swings on both sides, and gold prices have surged to record highs. The world lender’s spring meeting is scheduled for April 21, where Trump’s tariff policies are expected to dominate the agenda. Financial institutions caught in market whiplash Per the IMF, price movements were more profound on April 2, the US president dubbed “liberation day,” when a fresh round of tariffs was announced against imports from several countries. The Fund said institutions such as banks, hedge funds, private equity firms, and pension funds face elevated risks from large, unpredictable market moves . According to the report, margin calls, an event that occurs when banks require borrowers to post additional collateral, have seen an uptick that has given hedge funds a run for their money. Earlier this month, following Trump’s tariff announcement, hedge funds experienced several instances of margin calls since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. “ Major geopolitical risk events can trigger large and persistent corrections in asset prices, generating market volatility that could threaten macro-financial stability ,” the IMF stated. The report also examined geopolitical threats over the past decade and discussed the US-China trade war under Trump’s first term, which it reckoned would add to the recession fears, albeit slightly. Other geopolitical elements, like Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, were listed as examples of global market impact events. Still, the Fund reiterated that Trump’s focus on trade in his second term is more aggressive than the POTUS’s first tenure at the White House. Data shows that the United States has raised tariffs to the highest level in a century, while China has responded in kind. The world’s two largest economies are now imposing import levies exceeding 100% on each other’s goods, effectively doubling the price of cross-border products. Such protectionist policies, the IMF warned, are increasing the difficulty for investors in accurately pricing geopolitical risks. This uncertainty could lead to what it described as “sharp market reactions,” compounding the threat of volatility. IMF Chief: Liberation Day is disastrous for the global economy In the statement, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has spoken against “Liberation Day,” stating that the president’s tariff program “clearly represented significant risk” to the global economy. Georgieva, like most analysts worried about Trump tariffs, propounded that the longer-term consequences of the taxes will increase the so-called “market tail risks.” These refer to the likelihood of rare but severe portfolio losses, such as during a financial crash. And if the risks grow, she asserted, so does the possibility of a market collapse. “ Geopolitical tensions and abrupt policy shifts heighten investor anxiety. This can contribute to feedback loops where falling asset prices further erode investor confidence, amplifying downward pressure on markets ,” the director added. She also cautioned nations about the effects of tariffs on sovereign debt markets. Sovereign risk premiums, which is the cost of credit default swaps that protect against government default, are rising. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note stood at 4.43% on Monday, after rising steeply last week, based on over-the-counter interbank quotes for the government bond’s maturity. This, the Fund said, could spill into other countries through international trade and finance channels, particularly in emerging markets with higher debt burdens. Meanwhile, a recent survey by Reuters shows that consumer confidence in America has dropped because of fears over inflation, which has climbed to its highest point since 1981. That sentiment is evident in several major global investment banks, many of which have recently flagged recession possibilities stemming from Trump’s economic policies. The IMF also released an accompanying blog examining the impact of US-China tariff actions between 2018 and 2024. It found that announcements during that period consistently pushed stock markets lower in both America and the East Asian country.

But, the substantial amount of tokens to be unlocked in the next few days could spell trouble for the asset, or at least enhanced volatility. Following the mindblowing volatility and price decline experienced since the end of February when it traded at $3 to the beginning of April when it plunged to an ATL of $0.4, PI’s price actions began to recover in the past 10 days. The asset now trades close to $0.75, which means that it’s up by close to 90% since then. The reasons vary, from market revival to internal updates and developments , but one analyst warned that there could be more substantial price moves in the near future, possibly leading to another correction. This is due to the large number of tokens set to be unlocked this week, starting from today. MOON JEFF, an analyst focused on PI’s price movements, warned that 2.3 million tokens will be unlocked on April 14. However, the number will grow in the following days and is scheduled to near 10 million on April 18. PI Token Unlock Schedule. Source: Piscan Such events typically lead to an increased selling pressure because investors receive access to liquid assets that they can now decide to dispose of. While this doesn’t guarantee that they will indeed sell their newly acquired tokens, it certainly raises a few alarms, as many of them have waited for a long time, given the continuous delays ahead of PI’s launch. Nevertheless, MOON JEFF remains an optimist (despite a previous controversial claim ) and noted that PI’s chart looks ‘nice.’ The on-chain analyst believes “$5 is inevitable,” but it might take weeks or months to get there. $PI chart looks nice. $5 is inevitable It might take weeks or even months but eventually we will be there.

He’s often admired in the ecosystem for being highly technical while also deeply philosophical about technology's role in society. For those that do not follow crypto closely, Buterin starkly contrasts the stereotypical image of a flashy cryptocurrency billionaire with his minimalism in his personal style as well as his geeky and awkward mannerisms. The documentary “Vitalik: An Ethereum Story,” which is set for global release April 15, tries to give us a peek into those aspects of Buterin, following his early life and childhood in Russia followed by immigrating with his family to Toronto, Canada, where his love for computers and technology began in his high school years. At the core of Buterin’s life was the creation of Ethereum, which came after his early involvement in Toronto’s Bitcoin community, where he saw the potential of the asset in giving people some financial freedom. While thinking how he could apply those concepts to other aspects of life, Buterin set out to write a whitepaper on creating the blockchain version of the internet. Toronto has strong ties to Ethereum’s early days. It was home to some of the first Ethereum developer hackathons and meetups organized by Ethereum’s Canadian co-founders in the city. This year, CoinDesk’s Consensus 2025 takes place in Toronto May 14-16, highlighting Canada’s vibrant crypto community. The film walks through the various stages of Ethereum’s lifetime, including the start of the network and the struggles Buterin faced in his new leadership role, the boom of the blockchain during the NFT era, the importance of the Merge in reducing Ethereum’s energy consumption, and Buterin’s urge to help Ukraine in its war with Russia by deploying crypto for resources. CoinDesk sat down with the producers of the documentary, Chris Temple and Zach Ingrasci, to hear about their perspectives on creating the film, ahead of its global release. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. CoinDesk: Why did you want to make a documentary about Ethereum? Zach Ingrasci [ZI]: So Chris and I have been making documentaries together for 15 years now. We make character driven documentaries. So I really love those human stories that give us insight into the emotions and motivations of people in really interesting places. We aren't crypto experts. We both studied economics, so we have a bit of understanding of finance. But when we met Vitalik in 2021 I think he immediately clicked something in our brains like: “oh, here's a story that kind of breaks the stereotypes that mainstream audiences have of this space.” Quickly after meeting Vitalik, we did an NFT crowdfund for the film on mirror.xyz, peoplepleaser did the NFT. We raised basically the full budget of the film, and it allowed us to create this independent story and approach to follow Vitalik around the world, as, he lives out of a 40 liter backpack How did you guys decide what parts of Ethereum’s history to include in Vitalik’s story? One noticeable moment I thought was interesting that you left out was not to include the 2016 DAO hack? Why exclude that key moment in Ethereum’s history but leave in other moments? ZI: This is the challenge of making these films. We had a very broad mandate, following the community, not just focused on Vitalik. And then after two years of filming, we realized that the kind of narrative structure would only make sense if you were able to follow one person and then get to meet the community through his eyes. The DAO hack is very confusing to explain, and so there's an element of just what at its essence is important. And I think, you know, the moment for Vitalik to decide whether the Ethereum Foundation would be nonprofit versus for profit is a very understandable concept for a mainstream audience. They get it. As you mentioned, there was the premiere a few months ago, and it was only accessible to people on-chain. If the movie is aimed for a mainstream audience, why first decide to release it on-chain, instead of a streaming platform where more of those folks can access it? ZI: It’s a practical answer. The documentary industry is broken, so to have an independent film premiere on a mainstream platform doesn't even mean anything, unless you have real marketing. And so actually, the on-chain release, the NFT, the trailer release on Zora, building sponsorship for this mainstream release is critical. Chris Temple [CT]: People love the film, and have rallied behind it and been interested and been sharing it with their moms, being like: “Hey, this is what I do for a living.” This isn't just our film, this film belongs to the community. And I think empowering people with it at that first step, and using the technology that the film was all about felt very right to us. How did you convince Vitalik to do the film? He’s not very rerceptive to the media so how did you get him to agree to do it? ZI: I think we got really lucky in some ways. This was before he was on the front page of TIME magazine . I think he was motivated to speak up about what he believed the future of Ethereum should look like, and how to build it, and people should focus on building things that have real world value. So I think we just happened to meet him at the perfect moment when he and the people around him were looking to have access to broader audiences. I think ultimately, that's what makes for us Vitalik the perfect participant of a film, because his reluctance to be in that spotlight, that genuine authenticity. You can tell on the film that he's not trying to hog the spotlight. This is something that he's uncomfortable with, and something that's taken a long journey for him to even find where his voice is and how it should be. CT: It was a very challenging production, more than any film we've ever made, because Vitalik is nomadic, he’s all over the world, and he says, “I'm going to be tomorrow in Montenegro…If you want to come.” We have to immediately try to scramble and get everybody there just to get those moments, even if it's just a couple of hours with Vitalik. Recently, there’s been a bunch of leadership changes at the EF, and Vitalik has been at the core of making the decision on those changes. The movie shows how uncomfortable Vitalik can be in stepping into that leadership role and having to make core decisions like whether the EF should be a non-profit vs for-profit organization and going against some co-founders. Given all the key decisions he’s had to make over the past few months and a key leader in Ethereum, what do you think went through his mind, and has he become more comfortable in his leadership role? ZI: I really can't speak for Vitalik, but I do think that's why this film has never been more relevant. Because if we are looking for insight into how Vitalik thinks and what he cares about, I think the thing he cares most about is that Ethereum will be useful in the world. There's an important quote in the film about “if Ethereum is only used for speculation, that's a huge missed opportunity.” So it's not surprising that Vitalik didn’t go to the White House [to meet with President Trump]. Vitalik cares about how this tool will be used in the long term for real, positive change in the world. He is uncomfortable with conflict, we know that, we see that in the film. So I can't imagine this has been an easy process for him. But you can definitely tell that he's begun to understand how to use his voice in this ecosystem and use his kind of soft power. Read more: Ethereum Foundation Picks New Co-Executive Directors, Following Leadership Reshuffle What was filming in Ukraine during the start of the Russian invasion like? And why does Vitalik feel so connected to that cause? ZI: We have some experience filming on the borders of war zones. Luckily, at that time Kiev was relatively safe. It really was Vitalik's idea, he always wanted to support the hackers there. Vitalik just felt like he could be there to support them, and it's something he cares so deeply about for two reasons: 1) he actually has Ukrainian ancestry, and 2) coming from Russia, I think he regrets having met with Putin. Then there’s also just really one of the first concrete examples of real positive impact in the world, of how crypto is being used when the banking system was in chaos, and so quickly got money to the front lines. There's a deleted scene where he's playing chess with Fedorov, the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine. But you know, Fedorov was talking about how 1000s of their military were saved because of that $100 million Vitalik raised in crypto was quickly mobilized. What are you hoping that your audience takes away from this film? CT: Documentaries are bad at information, but they're great at provoking questions and getting emotions. If we can inspire an audience to be more savvy and think more critically about technology, not just in these extremes of it's all bad or it's all good, but to understand a bit of that spectrum along the middle there, and look at both the positive and negative consequences of technology. I think that kind of techno optimism is the core of what this film is really about. Helping anybody apply those lessons, whether it's within crypto, within AI, because technology is just going to continue to shift and impact our lives. The movie is about Vitalik as a person but also a bit about Ethereum’s history. So is Vitalik = Ethereum? ZI: I don't think he is, and I think that's what he hoped for at this point. I hope that comes across in the film, and that's why we called it an Ethereum story, because I think it’s one of many that gets told. I think that's where Vitalik has been successful because he is not Ethereum.",Consensus Toronto 2025 Coverage,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-14 15:57:56

The company announced the launch of commission-free trading for over 11,000 US-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as it enters the equities market. Kraken Steps Into Equities Market This new service is designed to provide US-based clients, starting in select states, including New Jersey, Connecticut, and Alabama, with the ability to trade both traditional assets and digital currencies within a single platform. The rollout, starting April 14th, is part of a phased plan, Kraken announced in its official blog post. The integration of stocks and ETFs into Kraken’s existing platform gives users the ability to manage a diversified portfolio, including digital assets like cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and now traditional equities. Key features include fractional trading, which will allow users to purchase portions of high-priced stocks, and the ability to reinvest proceeds into other stocks or crypto instantly. This offering is powered by Kraken Securities, the company’s FINRA-regulated division dedicated to equities trading. Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s co-CEO, weighed in on the development and explained that crypto is not only evolving but is also becoming the “backbone” for trading across asset classes, such as equities, commodities, and currencies. While highlighting the growing demand for 24/7 global access, Sethi added, “Expanding into equities is a natural step for us, and paves the way for the tokenization of assets. The future of trading is borderless, always on and built on crypto rails – and Kraken will continue to lead this shift.” Going forward, Kraken plans to expand stock trading to clients in more US states shortly, followed by several important international markets, including the UK, Europe, as well as Australia. IPO and Acquisition As reported earlier, Kraken plans to go public via an IPO in early 2026. The exchange is also negotiating a $1 billion corporate debt deal with investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. To top that, Kraken recently finalized a $1.5 billion acquisition of NinjaTrader, a US retail futures trading platform.

But while XRP eyes a powerful rebound, a rising coin has quietly begun capturing serious investor attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being touted as the next breakout DeFi token with real-world lending applications. The project has managed to secure over $6.7 million from investors. Over 8300 holders have entered the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale during phase 4 due to the system plans to double its price from $0.025 to $0.03. Those starting to invest now during this phase will earn 140% return at the launch price of $0.06. With whales accumulating both assets and analysts predicting a parabolic trajectory for MUTM, 2025 could see this under-the-radar altcoin move in lockstep with crypto giants like XRP. Mutuum Finance: The Next DeFi Giant to Watch Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector at a rapid pace with its game-changing dual-lending technology, which has experienced phenomenal growth. During its presale phase, the project was so attractive to over 8,300 investors who collectively invested $6.7 million, envisioning its future. During its ongoing Phase 4, the Mutuum Finance Token is priced at $0.025, but there is an assurance of a 20% surge in its value during the upcoming Phase 5. As part of enhancing the user experience, Mutuum launched a new dashboard that has the leader board of the top 50 holders. The users who feature in the leader board will be rewarded with bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi space with its revolutionary combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P model offers users passive earnings in the form of participation in USDT liquidity pools, courtesy of smart contracts that automate borrowing. The P2C model, however, allows for direct lending relationships devoid of intermediaries and user capital is kept secure. Combining these two models, Mutuum Finance offers a solution that equilibrates safety, efficacy, and decentralization, posing a robust possibility for investors wishing to attain high-yield earnings. Investor Rewards and Community Growth Mutuum Finance continues expanding its community with profitable rewards. As part of its token giveaway campaign of $100,000, 10 lucky members will receive $10,000 each in Mutuum Finance tokens. It also has a referral program that rewards users for bringing in new members. Early adopters also enjoy special advantages through staking pools, voting rights for governance, and VIP updates, which reward long-term dedication to the project. Sustainable Tokenomics for Future Growth Mutuum Finance has established a well-organized tokenomics system that controls the release of tokens and ensures long-term price stability. The deflationary forces of the project, especially during presale phases, create scarcity, positioning Mutuum Finance for future price appreciation. The staking functionality of the platform also provides high incentive rewards, encouraging active participation while maintaining a healthy, sustainable ecosystem in the years to come. Ripple (XRP) may be gearing up for a powerful push toward $5, but the spotlight is quickly shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next major DeFi success story. Over $6.7 million raised and more than 8,300 investors onboard signal strong market confidence in its real-world lending model. The current presale price of $0.025 offers investors a projected 140% return at launch, before it rises 20% in Phase 5. A rapidly growing community, top-tier referral and giveaway incentives, and sustainable tokenomics all reinforce the long-term potential of this emerging altcoin. Take advantage of the presale now to secure your position in one of 2025’s most promising DeFi projects.

The recent bounce off this key support area, previously acting as a barrier, reinforces the idea that the level has now become a strong foundation. This move reinforces the strength of the support and builds the case for a potential upside run. As LINK stabilizes above this key level, eyes are now on the next resistance zones that could define the near-term direction. With momentum gradually rebuilding, the stage might be set for a breakout that could catch the broader market’s attention. Chainlink Holds Strong: Breaking Down The Critical Support Retest According to Jimmy X in a recent post on X, Chainlink has broken out of a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, a formation often considered a bullish reversal signal. This technical development is catching attention as it hints at a possible shift in momentum after a period of downward consolidation. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Targets Rebound To $19 — But Only If This Key Support Holds Jimmy noted that LINK is currently testing the upper trendline resistance of the wedge, with trading volume steadily increasing, a strong sign that buyers are stepping in with conviction. Rising volume alongside a breakout typically reinforces the validity of the move, suggesting that this isn’t just a short-lived spike but possibly the beginning of a more sustained upward trend. He further emphasizes that a confirmed breakout followed by a successful retest of the previous resistance as support could trigger a parabolic move for Chainlink. This bullish setup, often seen as a launchpad for accelerated rallies, places LINK on track to target multiple upside levels. Key resistance points include $15.40 and $17.50, which have historically served as barriers during past price surges. Beyond these are the $20.00, $23.80, and $26.50 price levels. With technical indicators aligning and sentiment shifting, a sustained move above the breakout zone may set the stage for an extended rally. Downside Potentials While Chainlink’s recent retest of support shows bullish promise, it’s crucial to acknowledge the downside risks in case momentum weakens. If the price fails to maintain its current structure, the first level of support lies around $12.50. This level has previously served as a strong demand area, and a breakdown below it might signal the start of a deeper correction. Related Reading: Support Or Resistance? Chainlink (LINK) Investor Data Suggests Key Price Zones Further down, the $11.10 level becomes the next critical point. This area marks a prior consolidation zone and aligns with the lower trendline of the broader ascending channel, making it a vital structure for bulls to defend. A breach below this could open the door for a retest of the psychological $9.28 level, where the market may once again attempt to establish a firm base.

With market conditions primed for potential shifts, investors are keenly observing these digital assets. This article explores whether these cryptocurrencies are on the verge of significant increases, keeping readers on the edge of their seats. IOTA Price Dynamics: Short-Term Dips Amid Long-Term Gains IOTA saw a 10.68% drop over the past month while maintaining a solid gain of 28.02% over six months. A short-term spike of 10.34% in one week shows active market participation but also highlights volatility. The coin experienced a mix of corrections and gains, suggesting varied sentiment among traders over different timeframes. Recent fluctuations align with broader altcoin season behavior while reflecting intermittent bullish reversals amid temporary bearish pressures. IOTA sits between a current price range of $0.11 to $0.27 with immediate resistance at $0.37 and support at $0.06. Bears appear to be testing the lower boundary, while the absence of a firm trend indicates that the price could swing. Traders might consider buyer accumulation near support with cautious profit-taking around resistance. GALA Faces Long-Term Decline Amid Short-Term Rallies Past month performance shows a decline of around 10% while the half-year figures reflect a deeper drop of about 37%. The price has experienced a volatile period with a notable one-week surge of approximately 14%, indicating short-term gains that contrast with the overall downtrend. Technical indicators over these periods suggest that downward pressure has been a consistent theme despite brief upward moves, marking a challenging environment for holding positions. Current trading sees GALA operating between $0.0118 and $0.0203. The nearest support level is near $0.0087, while resistance is observed at about $0.0257 with a second resistance around $0.0342. Momentum indicators show a slight bias toward bears, and the overall trend lacks clarity. Consider trades that respect these levels, watching for moves near support and breakouts at resistance. Conclusion Recent analysis shows that IOTA and GALA may soon experience significant upward movements. Both coins are approaching key breakout points. Investors should keep a close eye on these developments. Momentum indicators support the potential for an upward trend. Monitoring volume and market sentiment can offer additional insights.

""Assertions circulating on social media that link Laser to 'investor selling' are factually incorrect and misleading,"" the firm wrote on X . Laser Digital went on to share its controlled Mantra wallet addresses, none of which show deposits to exchanges or selling activity. Speculation remains rife over why OM collapsed so violently. The Mantra team insist it was due to wider market pressures and centralized exchanges forcibly closing positions, which led to a liquidation cascade. OKX stated that the price volatility occurred due to a spike in trading volume coupled with an initial price decline across various exchanges out side of OKX, before spreading to the wider market. Before the crash, 17 wallets deposited 43.6M OM ($227M) to exchanges, this led to a panicked response from holders as the Mantra team holds 90% of the token's circulating supply, spurring the initial sell-off.

Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem has gained a new player, Babylon, that could shape its future. In a recent report , Nansen called the project potentially one of the most undervalued plays on Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem. Critically, Babylon enables users to earn staking rewards in Bitcoin terms without relying on wrapped assets or cross-chain bridges. In doing so, the protocol leverages Bitcoin’s inherent security and decentralization, offering a safer and more native alternative for staking. You might also like: Bitcoin DeFi shouldn’t just be possible—it needs to be easy | Opinion The process, dubbed Bitcoin restaking, involves locking BTC into a script on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Babylon protocol then uses a Cosmos SDK transaction to verify whether the funds are on-chain. Once verified, the Babylon chain distributes rewards to BTC stakers in proportion to their holdings. Where Bitcoin restaking rewards come from Since Bitcoin itself does not offer staking rewards, these incentives come from the Babylon chain, primarily via BABY token inflation. Its annual inflation rate of 8% is split evenly between Bitcoin and BABY stakers. This means BABY token stakers are betting that the token’s growth will exceed the 8% inflation rate. For Bitcoin holders, however, the protocol creates a new revenue stream without giving up custody of their assets—protecting them from third-party risks such as hacking or rug pulls. Over the past year, Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem has seen substantial growth. Its ecosystem reached an all-time high of nearly $8 billion in December of last year. Even after a subsequent correction to $5.27 billion, it still experienced more than 500% growth year over year. Developers and entrepreneurs are increasingly betting on Bitcoin DeFi due to its strong name recognition and vast user base. At the same time, they see decentralized finance as a way to unlock new use cases for the Bitcoin network.

The investigation, conducted by the department’s El Dorado Task Force, has reached out to former Anchorage employees in recent weeks to gather information about the company’s internal practices and compliance protocols. The nature and scope of the investigation has not been officially disclosed, but the task force is known for its efforts to combat cross-border money laundering and financial crimes through preventive investigations. Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered crypto bank, is backed by financial firms including Goldman Sachs, Andreessen Horowitz, KKR, and Wellington Management. The company provides services such as digital asset custody and trading infrastructure for institutions and governments. Just last week, BlackRock selected Anchorage as a custodian for its crypto-related exchange-traded products. The firm has faced scrutiny before. In April 2022, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a consent order requiring Anchorage to enhance its anti-money laundering controls and improve customer due diligence. At the time, the OCC said Anchorage violated the Bank Secrecy Act and must fix gaps in its compliance systems. The company responded by committing to strengthening its procedures and remains under the consent order today. Related News: Bitfinex Analysts: ""Bitcoin is Up But at a Crucial Turning Point! The Continuation of the Rise Depends on It!"" The latest federal investigation comes at a politically charged time for the crypto industry, with Anchorage positioning itself in a key position in Washington and strengthening ties with officials loyal to President Donald Trump, who has vowed to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” CEO Nathan McCauley has publicly championed Trump’s digital asset agenda and taken a leading role in discussions around “debanking,” the practice of financial institutions cutting off services to crypto customers. In February, McCauley testified before the Senate Banking Committee about debanking practices. More recently, he attended a White House summit on digital assets and shared a photo with Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors on Digital Assets, saying, “Crypto is in good hands.” The firm has sought to bolster its credibility by hiring experienced regulatory and financial leaders. Anchorage’s board currently includes former Goldman Sachs executive Connie Shoemaker and Julie Williams, who was the OCC’s general counsel during the 2008 financial crisis. The firm also recently saw a legal leadership shakeup, with TuongVy Le, a former SEC crypto investigator, stepping down as general counsel. Founded in 2017 by McCauley and Diogo Mónica, Anchorage was last valued at $3 billion in its 2021 fundraising round. That same year, under then-OCC chairman Brian Brooks, Anchorage became the first and still only crypto firm to receive a national bank charter from the federal regulator. *This is not investment advice.

The court also sentenced nine Chinese fraudsters to prison terms ranging from five to fourteen years. The country’s authorities dismantled the transactional fraud ring that targeted Indian nationals via a crypto-fueled telecommunication scam involving fake investment platforms, fabricated identities, and promises of high returns.

Chinese court dismantles crypto fraud group targeting Indians JUST IN: CHINA JAILS 9 FOR $6M USDT SCAM TARGETING INDIANS Source: WuBlockchain pic.twitter.com/iuxIAROQFh — Chase.eth (@chasegameing101) April 14, 2025 The People’s Court of Heze Economic Development Zone has taken down a fraud ring of nine Chinese individuals and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from five years to 14 years and nine months. The group was dismantled for targeting tens of thousands of Indian nationals and orchestrating a $6 million crypto scam. The court noted that the scam involved fake investment platforms, fabricated identities, and promises of high returns. The authorities also revealed that they fined the group in addition to their prison sentences. The Chinese authorities believe the scam ran for over a year, beginning in May 2023. Court documents showed that He Mountain was at the center of the operation, where he allegedly rented office space in Heze’s Luxi New District and recruited a team to operate the fraud. The findings also highlighted that the group posed as affluent Indian women on chat apps, where they forged personal relationships with Indian men to build trust. After victims got emotionally invested, they were directed to a sham investment platform dubbed “SENEE.” The platform promised the victims monthly returns of 8 to 15% on deposits as low as 1,000 rupees. “I met an Indian on a chat app and learned about the SENEE online investment platform. I communicated with customers through the chat app, using the bait of high returns of 8% to 15% for investing 1,000 rupees a month to attract Indians to invest money on the platform.” -He Mountain. Court documents also revealed that scammers would either shut down the platform or falsely convert customers’ holdings into equity shares when investors attempted to withdraw their funds. He mentioned that “when deposits surpassed the promised returns, the scam team would shut down the platform or convert debt into equity to freeze funds.” The court maintained that the group funneled the stolen money into USDT using third-party payment platforms. The scammers then converted the assets into Chinese yuan or U.S. dollars, garnering a profit of around 15% per transaction. The court’s findings revealed that between June 1, 2023, and January 13, 2024, 66,800 Indians were defrauded of 517 million Indian rupees. Scammers fabricate lies to prove credibility A scam targeting 66,800 Indians drained $6M in USDT through a fake investment platform promising 8–15% returns. Operated via social media and messaging apps, funds were funneled through shell companies. In China, 9 scammers have been sentenced to 5–14 years. Stay alert ⚠️ 💰 pic.twitter.com/NIswzW7Asq — TradeDucky (@tradeducky) April 14, 2025 The Chinese authorities acknowledged that the group went to elaborate lengths to fabricate a compelling backstory to improve their credibility. First, they posed as financially connected Indian women stuck in unhappy marriages. Court documents mentioned that they uploaded curated photos of luxury vacations, gym routines, and stylish homes to social platforms. The court argued that the images crafted an illusion of emotional vulnerability and financial acumen. He stated that his accomplices were responsible for training and managing the scammers, with experienced fraudsters specifically designing communication strategies and coaching employees. One scammer, Chen, maintained the payment channels for the fraudulent investment platform. The authorities also believe that the fake operation included a simulated corporate structure. The scammers also listed fabricated Indian licenses, trademark registrations, and no-bank financial credentials on their website to make the firm appear legitimate. The Chinese court also argued that the operation was not only financially deceptive but psychologically manipulative, which leveraged emotional intimacy and cultural cues to prey on trust. The presiding Judge, Liu Xilei, noted that the nation has been intensifying its crackdown on telecom and online fraud, urging perpetrators to immediately cease criminal activities and voluntarily surrender to authorities for potential leniency.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Discover how BlockDAG’s upcoming 10 exchange listings could drive BDAG to $1. Plus, gain insights on the latest Polkadot price outlook and Bitget Token burn update. Table of Contents Polkadot price outlook: Can it recover from $3.34 to $6? Bitget token update: New burn model tied to on-chain utility BlockDAG gears up for 10 listings: $1 BDAG no longer a long shot Bottom Line: Where things stand and what’s next The Polkadot (DOT) price outlook is once again under review as DOT’s recent dip to $3.34 has traders watching for signs of a bounce. That focus on market behavior is also seen around the latest Bitget Token update, which is changing the game for utility tokens, introducing a burn model directly tied to on-chain usage. While these developments signal meaningful change for DOT and BGB, BlockDAG (BDAG) is preparing to list on over 10 centralized exchanges in 2025. This move is set to boost BDAG’s liquidity, trading volume, and visibility across global markets. Given that BDAG has already climbed 2,380% in its presale and raised more than $214 million, analysts predict the coin will reach $1 in 2025 once it hits public markets and broader demand kicks in. Polkadot price outlook: Can it recover from $3.34 to $6? The DOT price outlook is drawing close attention as the asset trades around $3.34, following a recent drop of nearly 9%. Traders are assessing whether DOT can rebound toward the $6 mark, with several technical levels under review. Notable zones include $3.537 for a possible short-term bounce, $4.655 as a key resistance, and $6.000, an area tied to past profit-taking. While price movement remains uncertain, analysts are watching these markers to gauge momentum. As interest builds, the DOT price outlook reflects a mix of caution and curiosity, especially as discussions around its use cases continue to grow. Bitget token update: New burn model tied to on-chain utility The latest Bitget Token update introduces a utility-based burn mechanism that adjusts the quarterly token burn based on BGB’s actual use across on-chain transactions. In Q1 2025, this shift resulted in the burn of over 30 million tokens, reflecting activity through Bitget Wallet’s GetGas accounts. Designed to align with real-world applications, the formula incorporates BGB usage, average price, and fixed constants. This Bitget Token update aims to improve transparency by publishing all data on-chain, offering a more data-driven approach to managing supply. The change marks a shift in how token value and network participation are connected going forward.

That kind of rollout can reshape a project’s future overnight. In BlockDAG’s latest Keynote 3, CEO Anthony Turner shared confidence in BDAG’s listing plan, saying, “With plans well underway to list on at least 10 major exchanges, we are confident that this will be a launch for the record books.” Exchange listings typically mark a turning point for crypto projects, opening the doors to wider exposure and more stable trading conditions. For BDAG, already backed by strong presale momentum, this next phase could push it toward the ranks of the top 50 crypto assets, much like Solana’s rapid climb after listing in 2020. Centralized exchange listings don’t just offer visibility; they also drive liquidity and daily trading volume. More platforms mean more users, tighter price spreads, and a smoother experience for traders. As BDAG appears on larger exchanges, attention builds, and price discovery begins. Presale interest already tells a success story. BDAG has raised $214 million so far, selling over 19.2 billion coins and climbing through 27 batches. From an early price of $0.001, BDAG has risen 2,380% to its current value of $0.0248. Analysts have increasingly pointed to BDAG as the top crypto to buy right now, with some projecting the coin could reach $1 in 2025 based on current demand and market positioning. That rise, paired with the listing roadmap, is driving interest among traders looking to position early. Once BDAG hits major exchanges, market pricing takes over, and early entry at presale rates will no longer be available. Bottom Line: Where things stand and what’s next As markets shift and new narratives take shape, all these projects are moving along a distinct path. The DOT price outlook hinges on whether it can break past resistance and regain upward momentum. In parallel, the Bitget Token update points to a growing trend in utility-focused token models, aligning value with real on-chain activity. However, when considering the top crypto to buy right now, BlockDAG is the go-to. The project has already raised over $214 million during its presale, and upcoming listings on 10 major exchanges are fueling speculation about what happens next. Analysts believe $1 is within reach this year, but once BDAG goes live on exchanges, the current $0.0248 entry point won’t be coming back.

Check Out BDAG, LTC, AVAX, and ICP Before Prices Climb",https://thecoinrise.com/want-real-2025-gains-check-out-bdag-ltc-avax-and-icp-before-prices-climb/,"Traders aiming to lock in strong returns next year are closely watching a few standout coins. While crypto’s track record of massive profits is well-known, not every project delivers. Sorting through thousands of options can be overwhelming, but a few coins have managed to separate themselves from the rest. This breakdown focuses on four high-potential picks—BlockDAG, Litecoin, Avalanche, and Internet Protocol. These are the names drawing attention for their strong fundamentals, expanding ecosystems, and market potential. 1. BlockDAG: $214M Raised and Aiming for $1 in 2025 BlockDAG (BDAG) has seen one of the most impressive presale runs of 2025, collecting $214 million and distributing over 19.1 billion coins—all without major VC involvement. That strong early demand speaks to real interest from the wider crypto community. The project made headlines with its third keynote, where it outlined plans to launch 1,000 dApps by 2026. These apps will cover everything from finance to health services and even gaming, helping the network grow fast. BlockDAG’s tech can support up to 15,000 transactions per second, meaning it’s built to scale without delays or congestion. The network also focuses on DeFi tools like staking and lending, available from launch. To protect user data and wallet access, it incorporates multi-party computation (MPC), which distributes control across multiple parties for added security. Right now, BDAG is priced at $0.0284 in Batch 27, with analysts projecting it could reach $1 within the next few months—a 3,932% jump. Early investors have already locked in 2,380% gains. With centralized exchange listings coming soon and mining already live, BlockDAG looks like the strongest crypto bet heading into 2025. 2. Litecoin: Practical and Trusted for Payments Litecoin, currently valued at $71.13, has kept its place among the most used cryptocurrencies for digital payments. Known for fast speeds and low costs, it remains a reliable choice for users and merchants. A major update, MimbleWimble, helped improve its privacy and transparency features. With more users adopting it and growing support from payment platforms, Litecoin continues to gain ground. Thanks to its efficient network, low fees, and real-world usability, Litecoin continues to be viewed as one of the top crypto to invest in 2025. 3. Avalanche: Speed and Scale Make It a Strong Contender Avalanche is grabbing attention as it gains momentum heading into 2025. The current price sits at $16.81, and the network is already processing thousands of transactions per second. The platform recently rolled out Avalanche 9000, a system upgrade that improved both speed and decentralization. Developers and Web3 projects are starting to build here more frequently, which helps drive up both adoption and token demand. As more tools and apps go live, Avalanche looks well-positioned for steady growth. With its solid structure and real-world usage, AVAX is seen by many as a top crypto to invest in 2025. 4. Internet Protocol: Rethinking How the Web Works Internet Protocol (ICP) is working toward a version of the internet that doesn’t rely on centralized web servers. Instead, it offers an open alternative where websites and apps run directly on the blockchain. Currently trading around $4.02, ICP allows faster and more private online tools. The project removes the need for cloud services run by large corporations, giving more control back to users and developers. The platform has been expanding through new developer tools and partnerships, and its use in building Web3 apps continues to grow. If adoption keeps up, ICP could become a major part of the decentralized internet shift. It’s one of the most watched names on the list of top crypto to invest in 2025. Which Crypto Has the Most Potential in 2025? Each of these four coins offers something different, from Litecoin’s payment strength to ICP’s focus on the internet’s future. But in terms of growth potential, BlockDAG has the biggest upside by far. The project has already delivered strong returns during its presale and is still early in its rollout. With a growing ecosystem, full DeFi features, and upcoming listings, BDAG offers a rare low-entry price with high upside. At $0.0248 in Batch 27, it gives buyers a chance to join before prices rise further. BlockDAG’s performance so far makes it the one to watch for anyone looking for the top crypto to invest in 2025 .

While well-known coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Cronos (CRO) have seen substantial decreases in market value, exceeding 25% in the past three months, another contender is demonstrating steady progress. BlockDAG focuses on building sustainable growth, illustrated by a presale that generated $214 million, sold over 19.1 billion coins, and yielded a remarkable 2,380% ROI from its initial coin release. Instead of pursuing quick hype, BlockDAG (BDAG) is laying down strong foundations. The recent launch of their Ambassador Program, announced at Keynote 3, showcases a commitment to a broad-based, community-driven approach, aiming to transition from short-lived spikes to meaningful, engaged community growth. Pepe (PEPE): A Close Look at Recent Market Challenges As of April 4, 2025, Pepe (PEPE) is valued at a market capitalization of around $2.98 billion, ranked 32nd among cryptocurrencies. Its circulating supply is steady at 420,689,899,653,544 PEPE coins. Comparing this to January 1, 2025, PEPE’s market cap was significantly higher at about $4.12 billion. This marks a decrease of around $1.14 billion, a decline of approximately 27.7% in just three months. Such a decline in market cap highlights PEPE’s volatility, possibly reflecting a broader market correction or shifts in market sentiment. Despite its substantial supply and ranking, the downturn in the first quarter of 2025 emphasizes the challenges that meme coins face in maintaining stable growth in the volatile crypto market. Cronos (CRO): Analyzing the Recent Market Downturn As of April 4, 2025, Cronos (CRO) has a market capitalization of approximately $2.69 billion, with around 27.43 billion CRO tokens in circulation. On January 1, 2025, CRO’s market cap was notably higher at about $3.99 billion. This indicates a significant reduction of nearly $1.3 billion, equating to a decrease of about 32.6% in the first three months of the year. This substantial drop implies that CRO has encountered serious market challenges, possibly due to overall market conditions, changes in market dynamics, or shifts within its own ecosystem. Despite its large circulating supply and well-known status in the cryptocurrency market, this decline highlights the inherent volatility and unpredictability of digital assets. The fall emphasizes the need for both quick adaptability and enduring strength among cryptocurrencies, particularly in a competitive and ever-changing market where confidence can fluctuate rapidly. The recent downturn in CRO’s value could be a warning for those involved in similar digital assets. BlockDAG’s Ambassador Program Grabs Market Attention BlockDAG is not merely growing; it is actively engaging. At Keynote 3, the project introduced a new dimension to its strategy with the initiation of its Ambassador Program, transforming dedicated followers into dynamic partners. This initiative is a significant advancement in BlockDAG’s aim to establish a widespread international footprint, capitalizing on community-driven enthusiasm as a primary engine for growth. This initiative allows individuals globally to represent BlockDAG in their localities, boosting visibility, attracting new users, and extending the project’s reach beyond the virtual domain. The announcement also highlights BlockDAG’s solid groundwork. With an impressive $214 million accumulated in its presale and more than 19.1 billion coins distributed, the momentum is palpable. Currently, in its 27th batch priced at $0.0248, the project has achieved an impressive 2,380% return since its initial offering. BlockDAG is leveraging its community more than conventional marketing tactics, transforming each ambassador into a key player for fostering adoption and spreading knowledge locally. This move is not merely for show but a deliberate plan to enhance grassroots growth. By harnessing cultural knowledge and local insights, the Ambassador Program creates personal, effective connections between the project and potential users, combining global outreach with local influence. As the Ambassador Program is implemented, it is clear that the ecosystem is becoming more robust and interconnected, propelled by its most ardent supporters. Keynote 3 not only presented future directions but also extended an invitation for global participation. Sustained Growth: Understanding True Momentum While short-term market trends may be fluctuating, enduring strategies present a more telling narrative. Pepe (PEPE) and Cronos (CRO) have experienced significant value declines, each losing over a quarter of their market cap within three months. Contrastingly, BlockDAG is focusing on structured growth and community involvement. The Ambassador Program is not just an additional feature; it is a pivotal element of the strategy. Supported by robust presale figures and solid ROI, BlockDAG is cultivating more than just buzz—it is establishing a tangible presence. In a sector where attention is short-lived, BlockDAG’s investment in genuine connections is proving to be a wise decision, as reflected by its encouraging financial outcomes.

According to Tom Harper, who leads the team, the firm aims to increase its workforce to roughly 10 more bankers to its tech team this year after adding roughly 20 in 2024. This move marks a significant milestone for Wells Fargo, reflecting its deepening focus on technology clients and expanding its role in the sector. “This is the largest investment in our technology banking team since we launched it more than two decades ago,” said Harper. “We’ve been quietly growing as we attract relationships, and we’ll continue to invest in this space.” The tech-banking expansion comes as Wells Fargo overhauls its commercial banking business, accounting for about 15% of its net revenue. Furthermore, besides lending to tech companies in various ways, such as financing secured by software receivables, Wells Fargo also seeks to participate in M&A, debt and equity capital markets transactions, and equity investments in tech companies. Wells Fargo develops a new plan to bounce back from the regional banking crisis that rocked it in 2023 The 2023 regional banking crisis sparked a significant disruption in U.S. tech banking as companies rushed to relocate their funds following the collapse of key players like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank. In the meantime, Wells Fargo concentrated on supporting its current customers while taking a cautious approach to forming new partnerships, doing so “strategically as possible,” said Division Executive Tom Harper. In addition, Harper said they had been gradually growing as they made those connections. He said this would also mean maintaining investment in this sector and converting prospective clients to relationship clients. Five years ago, the company established a specialized industry group within commercial banking, designating industry specialists to provide loans to middle-market companies in eleven different segments. In January 2024, Mary Katherine DuBose was appointed the specialized industry group leader, and Harper reported to her. Afterward, the position was promoted to the point where DuBose now answered directly to commercial banking CEO Kyle Hranicky. Harper highlighted that the strategy aimed to better align Wells Fargo’s commercial bankers with personnel and assets across other functions, including wealth management, investment banking, and treasury management. For example, he collaborated closely with Gerry Walters, head of technology at investment banking, specializing in mergers and acquisitions advisory and capital markets. Wells Fargo pushes forward, but asset cap still restricts growth In the technology sector, apart from Wells Fargo lending from its balance sheet in several ways and seeking to participate in M&A, debt, and equity capital markets transactions, Harper mentioned that the bank was also a limited partner in the venture and growth equity investment firm Norwest Venture Partners and made equity investments in tech companies that offer products that would benefit Wells Fargo. Despite this, Wells Fargo remains under an asset cap, banning it from growing assets beyond its 2017 size of about $1.95 trillion. Meanwhile, following his appointment as CEO in October 2019, Charlie Scharf withdrew from some sectors, like mortgages, and pushed for expansion in others, like credit cards and investment banking, to address growth. As a result, Wells Fargo’s total commercial loans increased from $503.4 billion at the end of 2017 to $540.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025. However, Over the same period, its consumer loans, which faced the greatest regulatory challenges in sectors like home and auto lending, decreased from $453.4 billion to $373.1 billion.

Based on TRUMP’s price as of April 14, the unlock is valued at approximately $321 million. The release will occur as a cliff unlock, according to crypto analytics platform Tokenomist, meaning all tokens become available at once—a move that could flood the market and amplify sell pressure. Following this event, around $4 million worth of TRUMP tokens will continue to unlock daily until the next scheduled vesting event, potentially creating sustained supply-side pressure unless offset by demand. From peak hype to price collapse TRUMP token’s journey since its January 2025 launch has been anything but stable. The token soared to an all-time high of $73.43 within just two days of trading, only to crash over 70% in the following weeks. This sharp decline has left over 813,000 wallets with estimated losses totaling $2 billion within just 19 days of its launch, according to Chainalysis . Meanwhile, the project’s creators reportedly pocketed more than $350 million during the rally. As of April 14, the token was trading at $8.02. TRUMP token year-to-date price chart. Source: Finbold On-chain data also signals a decline in investor interest. The number of wallet holders has dropped to 637,235—a 0.3% decrease over the past week and a significant drop from the 800,000+ holders recorded in January, according to data retrieved by Finbold from a Dune Analytics dashboard. Derivatives market turns bearish Adding to mounting concerns ahead of the unlock, TRUMP’s open interest (OI)-weighted funding rate turned sharply negative on April 14, suggesting that bearish sentiment is growing in the derivatives market. The funding rate dropped to -0.0282%, coinciding with a dip in spot prices. TRUMP’s open interest (OI)-weighted funding rate. Source: Coinglass A negative funding rate typically means short positions are paying long positions , indicating that traders are increasingly expecting further downside. This trend may reflect growing skepticism about TRUMP’s ability to maintain its value in the face of surging token supply and waning momentum. This downturn in TRUMP token’s value mirrors a broader wave of disappointment across the crypto landscape that followed Donald Trump’s inauguration. Despite initial optimism that his re-entry into the White House would usher in a new era of digital asset growth, the market has instead faced turbulence. According to Finbold’s Q1 2025 Cryptocurrency Market Report, the number of Bitcoin millionaire addresses fell by nearly 20% between January 20—the day of Trump’s inauguration—and March 31, the end of Q1. Specifically, 34,737 BTC millionaire wallets disappeared during that time, highlighting the extent of market erosion even among Bitcoin’s wealthiest holders. These parallel declines highlight a growing disconnect between political hype and market fundamentals, raising questions about the true influence even the most high-profile endorsements can exert on digital assets.

Kraken plans to gradually expand the offering to eligible clients across the United States. “Crypto isn’t just evolving, it’s becoming the backbone for trading across asset classes, such as equities, commodities and currencies. As demand for 24/7 global access grows, clients want a seamless, all-in-one trading experience,” said Arjun Sethi, Kraken’s co-chief executive officer. “Expanding into equities is a natural step for us, and paves the way for the tokenization of assets.

The 10-year Treasury was down over 0.04% (over 4 bps) at 4.452%, and the 2-year Treasury note yield slipped 0.036% (over 3 bps) to 3.918%. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (US10Y) plummeted over 0.04% at 4.45% while the 2-year Treasury yields plunged 0.036% at 3.918% after posting their biggest weekly increase in more than two decades as Trump’s unpredictable tariff exemptions prompted global market dislocation and forced selling. The White House revealed late April 11th that the exemptions were made because Trump wanted to ensure that companies had time to move production to the U.S. However, the president later suggested on April 13th that the exemptions were not permanent. U.S. Treasury yield has fluctuated over the past week due to tariff uncertainties Treasurys have sold off sharply this week amid broad uncertainty about the fallout from President Trump’s tariffs. One concern is that the tariffs could lead to weaker foreign demand for U.S. debt. — Ajay Bagga (@Ajay_Bagga) April 11, 2025 The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury jumped from 3.99% at the start of last week to 4.49% by Friday, April 11th, with its spread over the German 10-year bund widening by the most in a week since 1990. The 10-year Treasury yield, which fell sharply during the first week of April as fears of a possible recession intensified, was at 4.29% as of April 8th, up from 4.16% at the previous day’s close. The yield, which affects borrowing costs on all sorts of loans, notably mortgages, had fallen as low as 3.87% on April 7th, near its lowest levels since October. On April 11th, the 10-year Treasury yield climbed 9 basis points (0.09%) higher to 4.486%, while the 2-year Treasury yield rose 12 bps (0.12%) to 3.97%, adding to the steep weekly rise and fall, as confusing trade moves by Trump caused investors to dump U.S. assets in favor of other global safe-havens. However, the head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, Gennadiy Goldberg, said there was no direct evidence that foreign investors were dumping Treasury notes. Still, the fear alone was enough to move the market. Seema Shah, the chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said that low financing costs appeared to be a key pillar of the Trump administration’s overall agenda, so the reversals in market trends and volatile Treasury yields were definitely causing notable concerns in the White House. “Markets are very confidence-driven. Even the perception that foreign investors are trying to step away from Treasury markets can trigger pretty significant panic.” – Gennadiy Goldberg As of April 11th, the 10-year yield had also risen more than 50 basis points (0.5%) within the week after ending the previous week around 4%, marking one of the biggest surges on record. Eurozone bond yields also fluctuate sharply following tariff exemptions Eurozone government bond yields rose today, April 14th, after falling last week on Friday, as a possible exclusion for Chinese electronics from high U.S. import tariffs eased fear about the negative impact of U.S. trade policies on the global economy. The U.S. exempted smartphones and computers from ‘reciprocal’ tariffs, providing a potential reprieve for major technology firms. Germany’s 10-year yield–the euro area’s benchmark–rose 4.5 bps (0.045%) to 2.57% after dropping 5.5 bps (0.055%) on April 11th, while its 2-year yield, which is more sensitive to market expectations for ECB policy rates, rose 4.5 bps (0.045%) to 1.80%. It hit 1.623% last week, its lowest since October 2023. Italian bonds outperformed their German peers, with the 10-year yield flat at 3.81% after S&P upgraded its rating of Italy’s long-term credit to ‘BBB+’ from ‘BBB’. The yield spread between Italian and German 10-year bond yields fell to 120 bps (1.2%). Last week, Germany’s 10-year yield fell 5.5 bps to 2.56%. It reached 2.487% on Friday, its lowest since March 4th. At the beginning of last week, the German 2-year yield also dropped 6 bps (0.06%) to 1.80%, hitting 1.751% by Friday, April 11th, its lowest level since October 6, 2024. The yield gap between French and German bonds stood at 76 bps (0.76%). Barclays head of rates strategy Rohan Khanna said Germany’s market had been ‘plagued by scarcity’ with negative net bond issuance for seven of the past ten years–when taking central bank purchases into account. He added that this fiscal awakening was a push further into collateral abundance with far-reaching consequences for Bunds and their place in the European government bond market. Germany’s shifting price dynamics have rippled across Europe and beyond because global bond investors expected to earn higher yields elsewhere if they could earn nearly 3% on German debt.

Trump’s crypto empire and recent regulatory changes are attracting attention from several watchdog agencies. On April 14, the Government Accountability Office announced plans to investigate the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In a letter addressed to Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren and Mark Warner, the GAO—a nonpartisan agency responsible for government oversight, confirmed it would look into changes implemented by the SEC’s politically appointed leadership. Among these changes are reported plans to cut staff and restrict the agency’s ability to initiate investigations independently. In February, lawyers at the SEC told Reuters that the new, politically appointed leadership, asked them to ask for permission before launching investigations. At the time, U.S. government watchdog Accountable.US has also raised concerns over these changes, together with US crypto policy in general. Since Trump’s appointed leadership took power, the SEC has seen hundreds of resignations from staffers. At the same time, the agency was offering lucrative severance packages to staffers who would resign voluntarily. Trump’s crypto ventures cause corruption concerns Chief among the concerns are Trump’s various crypto ventures, frequently a target of congressional Democrats. For one, House member Maxine Waters has accused Trump of using his power to become “crypto king.” Waters stated that Trump was using his power to promote both his Official Trump (TRUMP) and his World Liberty Financial firm to enrich himself. She claimed that Trump made $2 billion from his various crypto ventures, at the expense of ordinary investors.

Waters and Warren explained that WLFI presents an opportunity for foreign-owned crypto firms to trade their crypto for influence on US politics.

The coin posted a 0.26% profit in the last 24 hours and a 3.42% loss over the month. Its trading activity stagnated at 1.02B in the last 24 hours. Data from DefiLlama revealed that SUI’s Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized applications has broken below the $1.27 billion mark. SUI 1-day chart analysis SUI/USD 1-day chart price analysis SUI formed a head-and-shoulder pattern earlier this month, resulting in a major breakout that led it to its lowest level this year at $1.72. The MACD histograms signal that the coin’s positive momentum rose over the last 4 days, with William Alligator showing that its volatility is dropping. SUI 4-hour chart analysis SUI/USD 4-hour chart price analysis The 4-hour chart highlights SUI’s recovery over the last 3 days. The coin is registering high volatility with its relative strength index (RSI) at 50.79. The RSI indicates whether a cryptocurrency is oversold or overbought.

Participants in the 1910 Jekyll Island Conference wrote the Federal Reserve Act, passed into law in 1913, which established the Federal Reserve, the US Central Bank. The Fed was given the dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment high, and the main tools it had at its disposal were control over the money supply and control over the price of money via the federal funds rate. Before long, the Fed was put to the test when an unprecedented financial crisis in 1929 metastasized into the economic crisis we call the Great Depression. The Fed neither prevented nor ameliorated either crisis, but the conclusion many economists and political leaders drew from this was that the state needed to exert more control over American economic life. The subsequent authoritarian turn in the United States mirrored the trajectories of other countries: When US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) issued Executive Order 6102 in 1933, which ordered everyone living in the United States to surrender their gold to the US Treasury and suspended the redeemability of dollars for gold, he was engaging in asset confiscations that mirrored those executed by other authoritarian leaders of the same era, including Winston Churchill, Joseph Stalin, Benito Mussolini, and Adolf Hitler. , During the First and Second World Wars, countries allied with the United States purchased American-made weapons with gold. This led the US to amass the world’s largest gold stockpile. As the Second World War drew to a close, allied nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to determine the outlines of a postwar international monetary order. They decided to establish the US dollar—once again redeemable for gold—as the global reserve currency. The same conference also resulted in the foundation of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, multinational lending institutions whose mandate was ostensibly to facilitate and balance trade between nations while promoting international development, but whose mixed legacy has included the ensnaring of dozens of poor countries in webs of inescapable debt peonage. Meanwhile, in the United States, a postwar military-industrial complex emerged that ensured both the normalization of a wartime posture in peacetime and GDP-enhancing arms dealing to allies and others. The routinization of war as a central pillar of American anticommunist foreign policy—beginning with the Korean War and continuing in Vietnam, Laos, Lebanon, Cambodia, Grenada, Libya, Panama, and other countries, not to mention the countless clandestine operations and proxy wars that occurred during this time—had to be funded somehow. This imperative led the Nixon administration to suspend the redeemability of dollars for gold in 1971 and, a few years later, to strike an informal agreement with the government of Saudi Arabia to denominate oil purchases in dollars and recycle those dollars back into the US economy. This petrodollar agreement, although it had the characteristics of a treaty, was concluded entirely in secret by the executive branch, in part to bypass the constitutional requirement that Congress approve all treaties into which the United States enters. The petrodollar system is now itself unraveling, as major oil producers around the world have begun pricing oil in other currencies. That is a predictable international response to US foreign policy since the end of the Cold War, which has insisted on unipolar American dominance in the conduct of international trade and military operations. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, in particular, became the pretext for the United States to declare an open-ended war on terror and to spend trillions of dollars on foreign wars, to remilitarize or fragment countries that would otherwise have been on trajectories toward greater stability, and, most consequentially, to formally militarize the US homeland via the establishment of a new military command (USNORTHCOM) and new executive department (the Department of Homeland Security). The militarization of the homeland—anathema to the founders of the United States—has entailed snuffing out the last vestiges of a citizen’s right to privacy in the name of counterterrorism via the AML/KYC of everything. The roots of this development extend to the 1970s, long before the war on terror. Indeed, the 1970s can be seen as the decade in which the Banker Revolution came into full maturity and the American experiment in liberty truly unraveled. The Bank Secrecy Act kicked off the decade with its passage by Congress in 1970. It required US-based financial institutions to keep records of all financial transactions that “have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations or proceedings,” as interpreted by the US Treasury, and to share those records with any law enforcement agency upon request. Likewise, financial institutions had to report the transfer of any amount over $5,000 into or out of the United States. The Treasury subsequently promulgated a rule under the legislation that all domestic transactions over $10,000 had to be reported. That reporting threshold has remained unchanged until the present day, despite the fact that even under conservative estimates, the US dollar has lost nearly 90% of its purchasing power since 1970. , The Bank Secrecy Act represented an unprecedented erosion of the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protections against warrantless search and seizure. Although it was challenged, the Supreme Court upheld the law in United States v. Miller (1976), which established the third-party doctrine: That Americans have no reasonable expectation of constitutional protections for records held by a third party. This ruling surprised and outraged some, which in turn led Congress to pass the Right to Financial Privacy Act two years later (1978). However, this act carved out twenty substantial exceptions to the right to financial privacy, which ended up weakening privacy protections even further. In the same year, Congress also passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), whose stated purpose was curtailing illegal surveillance practices by federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the wake of abuses by the Nixon administration. However, the FISA purported to achieve this by establishing a kangaroo court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), a secret court that issues classified warrants for virtually any surveillance activity requested by the state. , , , The Bank Secrecy Act (1970), United States v. Miller (1976), the Right to Financial Privacy Act (1978), and the FISA (1978) were the seeds of the full surveillance system of government we have today in the United States. These four legal maneuvers killed American liberty long before personal computers or the internet had any meaningful traction in the world, but they have been used to justify the full collection and sharing of financial-transaction data (and communication data more broadly) that occur via software platforms and digital networks—the virtually inescapable infrastructures of modern life. They have also given rise to, at minimum, eight additional federal laws that have vastly broadened the scope of legal surveillance: The Money Laundering Control Act (1986); the Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1988); the Annunzio-Wiley Anti-Money Laundering Act (1992); the Money Laundering Suppression Act (1994); the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act (1998); the USA PATRIOT Act (2001); the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (2004); and the FISA Amendments Act (2008), which includes the infamous Section 702 amendment, which authorizes the circumvention even of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court when authorized by the attorney general and the director of national intelligence. Finally, these laws and legal decisions have served as justification for the formation of at least three new intelligence agencies with the mandate to collect and share financial-transaction data worldwide: The Financial Action Task Force (1989), FinCEN (1990), and the US Treasury Office of Intelligence and Analysis (2004). In short, within a generation, the US banking system, which had been centralized at the beginning of the twentieth century, became an extension of the policing function of the state. The revolving door between Wall Street, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury—a career circuit in which elites cycle between appointments at these institutions—has only accelerated the flywheel of collusion between those who make and enforce laws and those who control money. This has ensured that the machine first built by the Banker Revolution and then bolstered by the petrodollar system keeps running well for elites via unofficial coordination and official bailouts. The actions taken by nation-states worldwide following the 2008 Great Financial Crisis did not right any of these wrongs. Bankers were bailed out in virtually all countries, save in outliers like Iceland. They were bailed out again, along with much of industry, in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the US, these bailouts get sanctioned, renewed, and funded through zero-debate omnibus bills endorsed by leaders of both political parties. But the 1970s did not just merge banks with the state and usher in the end of financial privacy; the decade also inaugurated rule by state of emergency, a practice in which US presidents declare national emergencies in order to arrogate to themselves powers that would otherwise be prohibited them by the Constitution. In 1976, Congress passed the National Emergencies Act (NEA), which formalized the process by which a president could declare a state of emergency. Although ostensibly intended to limit the president’s emergency powers, the formalization was so procedurally precise and broad in scope that it resulted in presidents declaring national emergencies with much greater frequency. President Jimmy Carter declared the first national emergency under this law in 1979—Executive Order 12170—imposing sanctions on Iran in the wake of the Iranian hostage crisis. To do this, he also relied on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law that authorizes presidents to freeze the assets of and block transactions with any entity outside of the United States if they decide that it poses an “unusual and extraordinary threat.” This combination of laws effectively gave US presidents unilateral power to prohibit and punish economic activity by anyone, anywhere in the world, simply by declaring a national emergency. Because transactions in US dollars generally pass through a US-controlled financial network, and because the dollar remains the world’s primary commercial unit of account and sovereign reserve currency, the NEA and IEEPA—domestic US laws—have been used to punish people and organizations otherwise operating outside of US jurisdiction. As a result, the executive branch of the US government—US presidents and the US Treasury Department, the cabinet agency that enforces presidential orders pertaining to financial transactions—extend a form of effective rule over most of the world. Executive Order 12170 was only the first instance of the United States imposing sanctions on a foreign nation via executive order. Since that time, the executive order has become a routine way for US presidents to bypass the lengthy legislative process to impose sanctions quickly. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, always invoked in conjunction with the National Emergencies Act, has been used to legitimate nearly seventy separate emergency declarations, amounting to a roster of over fifteen thousand sanctions, and counting. , In addition, the US has also used its influence over the United Nations Security Council to pass a host of resolutions imposing multilateral sanctions on specific entities and those associated with them; member states are then obligated to enforce these sanctions under chapter 7 of the UN Charter. UN sanctions are implemented without legal due process, and many of their target entities have never been accused or convicted of a crime. The ease with which sanctions can be imposed and their popularity as a tool of punishment and coercion, which on the surface appears to have few downsides for American politicians, have contributed to their accelerating proliferation. As of this writing, the United States has sanctioned approximately one-third of all countries in the world. The enforcement of these sanctions has become so onerous that the Treasury Department is experiencing record staff turnover and an unmanageable caseload. Another revolving door has emerged: Between the Treasury and private legal, consulting, and lobbying firms, as former Treasury officials leverage their understanding of the byzantine sanctions system and their government connections to secure better political and legal outcomes for their clients. Perhaps most importantly, however, sanctions appear to have little political effect on the regimes they target. With few exceptions, autocratic regimes remain in place, while democracies subject to sanctions tend to react by spending more on defense, further entrenching existing regime power. The sheer number of countries sanctioned by the United States has incentivized dozens of countries to forge new geopolitical alliances and to build alternative financial systems that can avoid the US-controlled banking system entirely. What sanctions have been shown to achieve, however, is routinized poverty, if not economic collapse, that affects the people of sanctioned countries. , This reliably turns the hearts and minds of sanctioned populations against the United States, breeding resentment and enmity for decades. Even so-called smart sanctions, which target specific industries or specific entities, are usually ineffective politically; their limited scope and weak incentives for those in power create insufficient pressure to force the desired change in policy or regime turnover. Moreover, their actual implementation tends to have binary effects on targeted parties: Travel bans and asset freezes can be relatively minor inconveniences for powerful actors who have planned ahead, while arms embargoes and bans on commodity exports from targeted countries create more collateral damage than they purport to. This obviously calls into question whether such sanctions can be called smart in the first place. There is a perversity to the consolidation of bank-state power since the 1970s: Most of the legislation recounted above was introduced with the ostensible public objective of limiting the power of seemingly unaccountable actors. The Bank Secrecy Act was intended to limit the power of banks. The National Emergencies Act was intended to limit the power of the presidency. And the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was intended to limit the power of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies. However, all of these attempts produced exactly the opposite of their publicly intended effects because they suffered from a fundamental and fatal error: Seeking to achieve by statute a limit that was already in the framework of the Constitution. By overriding the Constitution with federal law, lawmakers have created a legal, political, and military environment that has returned political assumptions to what they were prior to the American Revolution. The primary political actor is now understood to be the state; individual rights have been reconceptualized as privileges; the individual is now presumed guilty before the law; and the state is now seen as the holder of rights, money, and power, which it deploys imperially and unaccountably. These are symptoms of a political culture in deep crisis.

The market has countless options, but a few standout projects are drawing attention for their innovation and potential. Qubetics, Aptos, and XRP are three projects shaking up the crypto landscape in exciting ways. Whether you’re all about cross-border transactions, scalable smart contracts, or fast financial systems, these projects pave the way for a more decentralized future. Qubetics has been making waves with its presale, offering unique solutions for blockchain interoperability and cross-border payments. But how does it stack up against Aptos, known for its cutting-edge scalability, and XRP, the established leader in fast and secure transactions for financial institutions? That’s exactly what we’ll dive into. This article will examine each of these coins, breaking down their key features, the latest updates, and what sets them apart in the long-term crypto game. Keep reading to see why Qubetics is quickly becoming the Best Crypto to Join for the Long Term and how it compares to Aptos and XRP regarding adoption, technology, and growth potential. Qubetics: Solving Real-World Blockchain Problems with Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics is set to revolutionize the way businesses and individuals handle international payments. Traditional cross-border transactions are slow and costly, often taking several days to process, with high fees that can eat into profits. Qubetics, however, leverages its unique multi-chain interoperability model to enable fast, low-cost, and secure cross-border payments. Whether transferring assets, settling transactions, or engaging in trade across borders, Qubetics makes it easy to do so without the typical headaches. But Qubetics isn’t just focused on payments—it’s also building the infrastructure for the future of digital finance . The platform integrates various blockchain networks into a single ecosystem, making it simpler for businesses to operate across multiple chains without fragmentation. This is a game-changer for industries like finance, healthcare, and logistics, where secure and efficient cross-border transactions are crucial. Qubetics is also rolling out QubeQode IDE , a powerful development tool for creating decentralized applications (dApps). This tool empowers developers to develop next-gen applications without worrying about compatibility issues between different blockchain systems, which has been a significant bottleneck for adoption. Qubetics Presale Reaches New Heights, Raising Over $16 Million Qubetics has captured the crypto community’s attention with its massive presale success, reaching over $16.1 million in funds raised and attracting more than 24,700 token holders. Currently, Qubetics is in its 30th best crypto presale stage, with tokens priced at $0.1729. What’s all the hype about? Well, Qubetics is tackling one of the most pressing challenges in blockchain technology: cross-border transactions . Analysts are forecasting substantial returns: $TICS at $1 = 477% ROI $TICS at $5 = 2789% ROI $TICS at $15 = 8567% ROI XRP Holders Urged to Act Now: Expert Warns of Looming Supply Crisis Crypto enthusiast X Remi Relief X has raised alarms about an impending “XRP supply shock,” urging holders to move their tokens off centralized exchanges. He warns that the decreasing XRP reserves on these platforms, despite no significant increase in trading activity, signal a looming risk. The low supply across major exchanges could drive prices higher as demand surges, presenting a key opportunity for those who have already secured their XRP in personal wallets, particularly cold storage. Remi also highlighted risks tied to over-leveraging by exchanges, where a single XRP might be lent to multiple users, potentially leading to a liquidity crisis. If exchanges can’t fulfill withdrawal requests during a market rally, users may face account freezes or delays, with some possibly losing access to their funds. To mitigate these risks, Remi advises using self-custody solutions, recommending wallets like Ledger, Trezor, and Tangem for secure storage. This warning highlights the importance of safeguarding assets as the crypto market faces potential volatility. Aptos Unveils New Upgrades for Faster and More Scalable Blockchain Solutions Aptos has continued to make significant strides in blockchain scalability, with recent upgrades designed to increase transaction throughput and reduce latency. The project is rapidly gaining traction as one of the leading blockchain solutions for developers and businesses looking to scale their decentralized applications (dApps). Aptos is built on the Move programming language , designed specifically to optimize performance and scalability. Its unique Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism enables fast finality, making it one of the most scalable blockchains on the market today. Aptos can process thousands of transactions per second (TPS). This key feature positions it as a solution for businesses deploying large-scale dApps or handling high-frequency transactions. With its modular architecture , Aptos can support various use cases, from finance to gaming, to supply chain management. The platform’s robust scalability makes it an ideal choice for applications that need to handle massive data loads and high-speed transactions without compromising security or decentralization. Cross-Border Transactions: Why They Matter for Blockchain’s Future Cross-border transactions are a crucial component of the global economy, enabling businesses to engage in international trade, facilitate remittances, and access global markets. However, the traditional banking system has long been hindered by slow processing times, high fees, and reliance on centralized intermediaries. Blockchain technology solves these issues by providing decentralized, fast, low-cost international payment alternatives . Qubetics, with its focus on cross-border transactions, is paving the way for a future where businesses can operate across borders without worrying about the inefficiencies of traditional systems. By integrating multiple blockchains into a single platform, Qubetics ensures that transactions can be completed quickly, securely, and with minimal fees, all while retaining the benefits of decentralization. This is where blockchain technology truly shines. By removing intermediaries and streamlining the transaction process, companies can save money and reduce friction in their cross-border operations. This makes blockchain a valuable tool for companies operating in a global marketplace. Conclusion Regarding the Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term , Qubetics, Aptos, and XRP are leading the way with groundbreaking innovations in blockchain technology. Whether it’s Qubetics’ focus on cross-border payments, Aptos’ scalable blockchain solutions, or XRP’s dominance in the financial sector, these projects are all uniquely positioned to solve real-world problems and drive the future of digital finance.

The green light allows several issuers, including Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ, to list their Solana ETFs. The new financial products will be available to investors starting April 16, 2025, marking an important development in the cryptocurrency investment space. Canada Approves Multiple Spot Solana ETFs According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the OSC approved multiple SOL ETFs today. These ETFs will hold actual Solana tokens rather than relying on futures contracts, offering investors direct exposure to the cryptocurrency. Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ are among the firms that have secured approval to launch these innovative products. The launch of these ETFs coincides with an upward surge in the price of Solana. Over the past week, the price of Solana has seen a notable increase of 25%. Experts suggest that the growing institutional interest in Solana, further bolstered by these ETF products, could soon lead to even greater price appreciation. As the world’s first spot Solana ETFs hit the market, the launch is a critical step forward for altcoin-based investment products. Staking Features and Yield Benefits The newly approved SOL ETFs will engage in staking, which offers potential benefits for ETF investors, including enhanced returns compared to traditional investments. Staking can improve yields and offset holding costs, making these ETFs more attractive. However, according to Balchunas, TD Bank will assist in processing staking information but will not directly facilitate it. Staking could provide an edge for SOL ETFs over other cryptocurrency ETFs, such as Ethereum-based ETFs, especially with US SEC delaying Grayscale’s ETH Spot ETF staking proposal. The yield from staking and the token’s performance could offer additional incentives for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Solana Whale Moves and Growing ETF Expectations in the US The approval of spot SOL ETFs in Canada comes during heightened activity in the Solana market. Amid the market activity, a whale moved 762,416 SOL, worth approximately $101 million, according to Whale Alert. In another instance, 790,427 SOL, valued at over $105 million, was moved between unknown wallets. These large-scale transactions suggest that whales, or large holders of Solana, are preparing for future moves, possibly in anticipation of the market momentum the new ETFs could trigger. The approval of the first spot Solana ETFs in Canada follows the recent launch of the first-ever XRP ETF , Teucrium 2x Long Daily, in the U.S. Concurrently, several major firms have already filed for approval to offer SOL ETFs in the United States. These firms include Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton. In addition to the Canadian approval, market expectations for the approval of SOL ETFs in the United States are rising. Polymarket traders now assign an 81% probability to approving a Solana ETF by the end of 2025, up from just 65% in early 2025.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) was trading at $84,000 on Monday, just below the key resistance level at $85,000. This price is about 13.4% above its lowest level this month. The coin’s movement followed Donald Trump’s decision to exempt certain items like smartphones and other electronic goods from recently announced tariffs. While equities initially surged following the news, much of those gains were later erased. The Nasdaq 100 index, for example, was up by only 90 points after earlier rising more than 500 points. One key reason behind Bitcoin’s underperformance is that investor sentiment remains cautious. Many traders continue to stay on the sidelines. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows of over $713 million last week, following losses of $172 million the previous week. The crypto fear and greed index tracked by CoinMarketCap remains in the “fear” zone at 27, while the CNN Money index is sitting even lower in the “extreme fear” zone at 21. Historically, these levels indicate risk-averse behavior, with fewer investors willing to take on exposure during uncertain conditions.

According to CoinGlass, open interest remains stuck at $56 billion, reflecting ongoing weakness in futures demand and trader conviction. Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows Bitcoin remains under pressure. Price action has stalled around $84,400, a key level just beneath the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages. A potential crossover of these two indicators could form a death cross, a bearish technical signal suggesting further downside. Bitcoin also continues to trade below a descending trendline that connects the major swing highs since January 20. It’s currently near the lower boundary of its trading range, as defined by the Murrey Math Lines. Given these signals, there’s a risk that BTC could resume its downtrend, with sellers potentially targeting the recent double-bottom support at $76,800. However, this bearish outlook would be invalidated if Bitcoin breaks above the descending trendline and both moving averages. A sustained move above these resistance points would also negate the death cross setup and point to a possible bullish reversal.

This article explores the potential for upcoming growth in these promising digital assets. Readers will gain insights into market trends and the possibility of another breakout. FET Coin Price Overview: Shifting Trends and Key Levels Past month performance shows a modest decline of nearly 6% after a recent 26.5% weekly gain. Over the last six months, the coin experienced a hefty drop of about 67%, suggesting long-term challenges that have weighed on sentiment. Price volatility has been evident, indicating a struggle between short-term recovery and sustained downward pressure. Current trading places FET within a range of approximately $0.32 to $0.68. Key resistance is near $0.91 with a second barrier at $1.26, while support appears around $0.19. RSI values near 51 and a slight momentum uptick hint at a balance between bulls and bears. The lack of a definitive trend suggests that careful entries near support and tight stops near resistance could suit trading strategies. Render Price Rally Sets Stage for a Bullish Altcoin Season Render experienced a sharp one-week surge of over 40%, strengthening market sentiment after a steady monthly gain exceeding 22%. Despite a decline of around 29% over the past six months, recent volatility indicates potential for recovery, highlighting both challenges and new opportunities for investors. The current positive momentum suggests that traders are increasingly optimistic about Render's short-term performance. Current prices are fluctuating between approximately $2.46 and $4.42, with a notable resistance level at $5.43 and strong support around $1.52. Bulls have taken the lead in driving the recent price increase, although indicators show some caution. Trading strategies may involve buying near the support level, with profit-taking recommended as prices approach resistance levels. Conclusion FET has shown strong performance after its breakout. Render could potentially follow a similar path. Both coins have distinct features that attract interest. Their performance will rely on market trends and investor confidence. Observing FET's rise, Render’s prospects seem promising. Investors should watch for emerging patterns. The crypto market often rewards innovation and unique applications. Both assets have the potential to capture further growth momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Not More Than This Emerging Token,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-ethereum-eth-make-millionaires-again-not-more-than-this-emerging-token/,"Whispers across crypto circles are turning into roars. Ethereum (ETH), despite holding strong at $1,556, might no longer be the path to outrageous wealth. Instead, attention is sharply shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi breakout star still flying under the radar. Mutuum Finance tokens available during their Phase 4 presale which are priced at $0.025. A strong investor backing emerged through the acquisition of more than 8200 buyers who have raised $6.65 million during the presale process. Investors participating in Mutuum Finance Phase 4 token purchase earn 140% profit at $0.06 at exchange launch. As the market changes, MUTM is less like a gamble and more like a golden opportunity. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates in Phase 4 The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale is in progress while the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of hyper-inflated meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 4 of the presale has surpassed $6.65 million total shares and attracted more than 8200 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.025 during Phase 4 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Investors who bought in Phase 4 obtained 140% growth from their investment once MUTM launches. Furthermore analysts predict MUTM will reach $4 upon listing. The current cost of MUTM attracts investors to buy during Phase 5 since it will undergo another pricing increase to 0.03. The team has recently launched an updated dashboard that includes a leaderboard showcasing the top 50 holders. These holders will receive bonus tokens as a reward for keeping their spot in the top 50. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders receive dependable income while borrowers get secure financing opportunities through this system. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Security takes precedence in this ecosystem through combination with open-source smart contracts along with third-party audits to establish complete transparency. The MUTM token holders benefit from both price growth potential and earn passive income while receiving investments through a strategic buyback system that strengthens long-term token value. Mutuum Finance aims to increase accessibility and liquidity by implementing multi-chain expansion which will include EVM and non-EVM blockchain support. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives The $100,000 giveaway conducted by Mutuum Finance aims to give away $10,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 participants as part of its adoption drive. The referral system within Mutuum Finance provides users with rewards for bringing new members into the platform which helps the community to expand while accelerating its growth naturally. While Ethereum (ETH) continues to show strength, it may no longer be the golden ticket to massive wealth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining attention as a breakout DeFi star, with its Phase 4 presale raising over $6.65 million from 8,200+ investors. Don’t miss your chance to join the Mutuum Finance presale today and secure your future in DeFi.

After a rough start to the month, XRP has rebounded sharply, posting a 32% gain from last Monday’s low. The token’s resilience has caught the attention of analysts and investors as it continues to outperform many of its peers in the altcoin space. Related Reading: Solana Triggers Long Thesis After Pushing Above $125 – Start Of A Bigger Rally? Much of this strength is attributed to growing optimism that macroeconomic tensions—particularly around global trade policies and inflation—may begin to ease. If this trend continues, XRP could be well-positioned to lead the next leg of the crypto recovery. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez added to the bullish narrative, sharing a technical analysis showing that XRP is currently trading within an ascending triangle—a pattern typically associated with upward breakouts. Martinez identifies $2.22 as the critical resistance level to watch. If bulls can push above that line, it could open the door to a move to higher price levels. With momentum building and technical indicators aligning, XRP appears to be approaching a pivotal moment. The next move could determine whether this rally has more room to run—or if resistance will stall the breakout. XRP Bulls Eye Breakout As Market Looks for Direction XRP bulls are gaining confidence as the market shows signs of stabilization following weeks of volatility. With global tensions still unresolved, the broader crypto environment remains uncertain—but XRP has managed to hold its ground, consistently trading above the $1.80 level. This steady performance has analysts optimistic that the token could be preparing for a strong move higher, especially if macroeconomic pressure starts to ease in the coming weeks. The anticipation surrounding potential monetary policy shifts and cooling inflation expectations could create a more favorable environment for risk-on assets like XRP. Some market participants are betting that as clarity returns to the global economy, high-conviction assets will lead the charge—and XRP is firmly on that list. However, not all analysts agree that the rally will be smooth. A more cautious view suggests that the market might need one more correction to establish a solid foundation. This scenario would involve a dip below current levels to set a new demand zone before the next leg up begins. In the meantime, Martinez identified a key pattern unfolding: XRP is trading within an ascending triangle—a bullish continuation setup. According to Martinez, the $2.22 resistance level is the crucial threshold. A confirmed breakout above this level could trigger a surge toward $2.40, potentially marking the start of a broader upward trend. As traders watch price action closely, XRP’s ability to hold key support and test the top of its triangle could determine its next big move. The coming days may prove pivotal in shaping the short-term future of this high-profile altcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Stays Below Realized Price: Once-In-A-Cycle Opportunity? Daily Price Action Leans Bullish After Reclaiming Key Averages XRP is currently trading at $2.14 after a strong move that saw the token reclaim both the 200-day moving average (MA) at $1.89 and the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $1.95. This bullish development signals a potential shift in trend, as XRP bulls now hold a short-term momentum advantage. Holding above these key indicators is essential for sustaining upward pressure and building confidence in a broader recovery. The next major hurdle lies at the $2.60 daily supply zone. A clean break above that level could open the door for a continuation rally targeting higher resistance zones. For now, bulls will need to maintain strong buying interest and volume to test and eventually breach that level. However, downside risks remain. If XRP fails to hold the $2.00 psychological support, a deeper correction could unfold. This would invalidate the recent breakout and potentially send the token back toward the $1.80 zone or lower, depending on broader market conditions.

This development has occurred thanks to recent developments in the Ripple ecosystem, which will ultimately boost the stablecoin’s adoption. Ripple USD Stablecoin Volume Surges Over 100%, Here’s Why CoinMarketCap data shows that the Ripple USD stablecoin volume has surged by 120% in the last 24 hours, indicating increased activity around the stablecoin. This development is a positive for the stablecoin, which launched in December last year but has already achieved a market cap of almost $300 million. The recent surge in the RLUSD stablecoin’s volume is thanks to developments such as Ripple’s 1.25 billion acquisition of the prime broker Hidden Road. Following the announcement of the acquisition, the crypto firm mentioned that the move would reinforce the stablecoin’s position as an “enterprise-grade USD-backed stablecoin with real utility” as the prime broker leveraged it as collateral across its prime brokerage products. As such, the stablecoin is already enjoying wider adoption, although the Hidden Road deal is still subject to regulatory approval. Another reason the Ripple USD stablecoin’s volume has surged is due to the crypto firm’s integration of the stablecoin into its payment service. As CoinGape reported, Ripple integrated its stablecoin with its cross-border payment service, setting up the stablecoin for more enterprise adoption. With Ripple’s payment service booming, especially with the SEC lawsuit, the stablecoin will continue to enjoy wider adoption,, and its trading volume will likely continue to surge in the foreseeable future. The RLUSD stablecoin’s volume has also surged thanks to Kraken’s recent listing of the stablecoin. Earlier this month, the top crypto exchange announced that the stablecoin is now available for trading, with deposits and withdrawals enabled. Kraken’s listing further provides more utility for the stablecoin as traders move to trade several crypto assets in their RLUSD pair. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the stablecoin’s surge undoubtedly provides a bullish outlook for XRP, as this surge indicates that more capital is flowing to the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which is also home to the altcoin.

To read full editions, subscribe . Abstract, the Ethereum L2 blockchain that claims it’s “leading the next generation of consumer crypto,” is featuring and endorsing a crypto mining game that some have accused of being a Ponzi scheme. Abstract has added “The Big Badge” as a visual badge reward for users who engaged with Bigcoin, an app that gamifies the BIG token and lets players “mine” the token from their virtual “facilities.” “Bigcoin aims to become the most recognized coin on the planet by combining the proven emission mechanics of Bitcoin with viral, community-driven incentives,” the token’s white paper reads . Pseudonymous X user “Satoshi Bigmoto,” also known as “Bigtoshi,” is listed as Bigcoin’s creator and white paper author. Their account was created in February, just a few months ago. But to “mine” BIG and increase their hash rate, players have to buy “miners” for their pixelated “facilities” using BIG itself (both the size of one’s facility and the number of miners increase one’s hash rate). Players also have to spend BIG to “upgrade” those virtual mining rooms. Abstract Marketing Lead Phin Totten confirmed to me that Bigcoin isn’t actually using players’ physical computers to mine the token — and that the token isn’t actually being mined at all. Instead, what’s happening is a simulation, facilitated by the token’s smart contract. Okay I think I’m done upgrading now 😅 pic.twitter.com/UC8mW85S6M — Phin (@Phin_totten) April 11, 2025 One X user declared over the weekend that “Bigcoin has taken the timeline by storm and made a lot of money for people who got in early,” adding, “Congrats to everyone who got in early.” While others have argued that all of crypto is a Ponzi scheme, Bigcoin has less utility and less legitimacy than its inspiration, Bitcoin, which has been adopted by Wall Street in the form of bitcoin ETFs. Cornell Law School defines a Ponzi scheme as: “a type of investment fraud in which investors are promised artificially high rates of return with little or no risk. Original investors and the perpetrators of the fraud are paid off by funds from later investors, but there is little or no actual business activity that produces revenue. The scheme generates funds for previous investors so long as there is a consistent flow of funds from new investors.” It’s currently unclear what the point of Bigcoin is, however, besides enriching miners who “got in early” with a layer of gamification on top. Despite its token burn and sink mechanisms intended to help keep the token’s price higher, BIG’s price has fluctuated and can be as volatile as other low-cap tokens. It had a market cap of $6.9 million as of 11:15 am ET Monday morning, per Gecko Terminal data . A few minutes later, its market cap spiked to $7.5 million. It then lost about 15% of its market cap in less than an hour, then regained that loss just as quickly and then lost it again. The token’s price had spiked 40% in the past day as of Monday morning, but it quickly fell to just a 12% gain, showing big price swings. Get the news in your inbox.

While global markets have been ugly, unpredictable and fragile of late, digital assets held steady with moderate volatility. Bitcoin was up ~ 5% and the CoinDesk 20 Index was up ~ 6% last week. In a landscape where traditional assets seemed to lose their footing, crypto's resilience offers an intriguing counternarrative to the skeptics who've long questioned its legitimacy during market stress. A week ago (April 6), I described the market as a bus teetering on a cliff's edge. It might have been exhilarating for skillful traders, but unhedgeable for managers of traditional asset portfolios. Sure, being long equity puts might have looked (and felt) great as futures tumbled Sunday night (April 13), but monetizing those puts in an extremely choppy and high-velocity market is near impossible – and forces the hedger to ""call a bottom."" If you don't monetize the puts and the market rebounds, your puts decay to zero, locking in a loss. (Or, if your hedge of choice was a retreat to U.S. Treasuries, it was even worse.) The art of risk management in traditional markets is proving increasingly difficult in this environment. Even professional traders with decades of experience found themselves whipsawed by the market's violent moves. For those managing pension funds, endowments, or family offices, the challenge of preserving capital while maintaining return targets has rarely been more daunting. The playbook that worked for the past decade seems increasingly irrelevant. Bitcoin's Resilience amid Liquidations Amid the chaos, bitcoin kept a pretty narrow range. The two weakest periods, on April 7 and 9, lined up with perp liquidations (forced sales of leveraged positions that are much more “standard practice” in crypto than in traditional markets). This gave pundits a handy ""low"" price to challenge bitcoin's aforementioned resilience, but we should push back here. Temporary liquidation dips are just that — artificial flows that are recoverable. They create a nice lower candle wick, but don't always represent the whole market fairly; we should discount their relevance accordingly. (This may be a controversial view; fire away if you disagree.) Store of Value vs. Safe Haven As usual, pundits and skeptics blurred bitcoin's ""store of value"" claim with ""flight-to-quality"" and ""safe haven."" We will keep pounding the drum on the difference between ""flight-to-quality""/""safe haven"" and ""store of value"" assets. Bitcoin, still in its adolescence and with limited access to traditional liquidity pools (i.e., banks), shouldn't be expected to function as a mature flight-to-quality or safe haven asset during extreme volatility episodes. Similarly, there are things I don't expect or enlist my teenage children to do. Seeing gold's outperformance vs. bitcoin this year supports this argument. Gold has better access to traditional finance, is perceived to be limited in supply, and has a mature network. But does it have adoption momentum? Is it an asset of the future? While gold glitters in times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty, bitcoin offers something different – a technological evolution in the concept of money itself, with adoption curves that continue to remind us that we're still early in its lifecycle. Michigan Numbers: Uncertain Consumers -> Strong Bitcoin The week's crypto-supporting experience was capped by April 11's University of Michigan Consumer Survey , which delivered two powerful data points supporting bitcoin's price trajectory: the highest expectations for 1-year inflation since 1981(!) and elevated expectations for unemployment. Source: University of Michigan Source: University of Michigan We favor anchoring bitcoin's demand to expected real interest rates — the difference between expected nominal rates and inflation expectations. When real rates are expected to rise, bitcoin faces headwinds. Conversely, when real rates are expected to fall due to higher inflation and potential rate cuts (hello, rising unemployment expectations), bitcoin tends to benefit. The Michigan survey numbers provide a surprisingly clear north star for bitcoin accumulation: 1) higher expected inflation and 2) unemployment expectations that could prompt Fed easing. Lower nominal rates, higher inflation. This framework helps explain bitcoin's impressive performance during previous easing cycles and suggests we could be entering a similarly favorable environment. The divergence between consumer inflation expectations and the Fed's more sanguine outlook bears watching closely – historically, the consumer has often proven more prescient than the central bank. Beyond Bitcoin With Paul Atkins now cleared to lead the SEC and other supportive regulatory developments, the broader crypto ecosystem shows promising signals. Can we expect the rest of the broad-based CoinDesk 20 Index, which covers about 80% of the market, to participate in a potential bitcoin-lead rally? Two factors suggest yes. First, asset correlations rarely break down during broad market rallies in this sector. Second, the pro-blockchain uptrend dynamics we witnessed last November could reappear and reignite interest across Layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Sui, Cardano, and Avalanche, infrastructure providers like Chainlink and Filecoin, DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Aave, financial services assets like Ripple, and other sectors. The potential for a broader rally suggests that diversification within the crypto space could once again prove rewarding, particularly if regulatory tailwinds continue to strengthen.

Bybit CEO Ben Zhou objected to the accusations and requested evidence. “The crypto space has been in turmoil because of rumors posted without evidence,” Zhou tweeted on X. What Bybit Actually Requires for Listings Bybit detailed its listing process in a statement. There are three things required by the exchange: a marketing budget, a security deposit, and a thorough project review. “Projects are expected to budget promotion funds for user interaction activities,” a Bybit spokesperson explained, saying that legal restrictions prevent exchanges from holding project tokens. Bybit said it imposes a security deposit of $200,000 to $300,000 in stablecoins. This is refundable but can be penalized if promotion goals are not met. The entire listing process involves application forms, internal voting, research, and a final review meeting. Bybit’s review process involves fundamentals, onchain data, tokenomics, team credentials, and others. Allegations About Student Trial Contracts The X user also alleged that Bybit used KOLs (key opinion leaders) to silence students who took part in its Campus Ambassador program after they were given “trial contracts.” The program, the user claimed, was part of the issue.

Ruvi AI Is Redefining Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI brings something completely new to the table by combining blockchain with advanced artificial intelligence. Unlike Solana’s focus on high speeds, Ruvi AI’s platform allows users to create high quality content (text, images, audio, video) through an AI powered system. This superapp model is decentralized, users can contribute to the ecosystem and earn $RUVI tokens. The $RUVI token has multiple use cases within the platform, unlock premium features, stake and govern. What really sets it apart is the $0.01 presale price, this is an incredible entry point for investors. By focusing on real world applications and community collaboration, Ruvi AI is carving out its own space in the blockchain and AI space. Get Double Your Rewards with Ruvi AI’s VIP Bonuses Ruvi AI’s bonus system is designed to reward early and committed investors big time. For example, with its VIP 5 Tier Bonus, investors who buy at least 500,000 RUVI tokens get a 100% bonus, effectively doubling their allocation. So an investment of $5,000 during the presale would be 1,000,000 tokens, a massive increase that sets the stage for huge returns. When you consider Ruvi AI’s listing price of $0.07, this would already be $70,000, a 14x ROI. The platform takes it to the next level with its Leaderboard Rewards system, designed to incentivize top contributors. Investors with higher presale contributions are ranked, those in the top 10 get up to 500,000 extra RUVI tokens, top 50 get 200,000 and top 200 get 75,000. Why Experts See $1 Tokens in Ruvi AI’s Future While Ruvi AI’s $0.01 presale price is already a big selling point, its future value is what really gets experts excited. Many believe Ruvi AI’s AI driven platform can reach $1 token in the near future. That’s huge growth for early investors. For example if you buy 1,000,000 tokens during the presale for $5,000 you could see your tokens balloon to $1,000,000 when Ruvi hits $1. That’s a massive 200x gain. Why Ruvi AI Is Better Investment Than Solana While Solana’s network is a technical marvel, its growth has plateaued. With so much competition in the space and transaction speed as its only unique selling point, Solana is struggling to keep investor interest in a tough market. The effort to get back to its previous highs like $290 shows this uphill climb. Meanwhile Ruvi AI is blazing a new trail by combining blockchain with AI in a way that hasn’t been done before. This allows Ruvi AI to target multiple industries (content creation to enterprise solutions) and expand its use cases and relevance across markets. With presale bonuses and community driven development Ruvi AI is the standout project with more short term and long term potential. Time Is Running Out on Ruvi AI’s $0.01 Presale Timing is everything in crypto and Ruvi AI’s presale is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The $0.01 presale price combined with the VIP bonus structure and leaderboard rewards creates massive urgency for those who want to maximize their returns. Delaying means missing out on this price point. Ruvi AI is a way to pivot to a highly scalable, future proof project with massive ROI potential. Being at the forefront of blockchain and AI innovation means it appeals to both seasoned investors and newbies looking for exponential opportunities. Get Your Stake in Ruvi AI Today Ruvi AI is shaping up to be one of the most exciting stories in the blockchain and AI space. With an unbeatable presale price, groundbreaking features and extraordinary ROI potential it’s no wonder investors are flocking to this project. Whether you’re a Solana holder looking for your next big win or a new investor looking to get into next gen tech, Ruvi AI is a proposition that’s hard to ignore.

The token, created by the MANTRA blockchain project, lost more than 88% of its market value over the weekend. Rumors online claimed that a big investor sold many OM tokens , leading to panic and selloffs. Some reports said Laser Digital was involved, but the company has strongly denied this. Laser Digital Responds to Rumors In a recent X post , Laser Digital, a key investor in MANTRA’s Layer 1 blockchain project, responded to growing rumors. The company made it clear that it was not behind the crash. It was stated that the online assertions linking Laser to ‘investor selling’ are factually incorrect and misleading. These claims started when on-chain analytics showed that 17 wallets moved $227 million worth of OM tokens to different exchanges since April 7. Two of those wallets, including one marked “0xB37DBD,” were allegedly linked to Laser Digital. Laser Digital strongly denied owning any of the wallets tied to the large transactions, including the “0xB37DBD” in question. The firm explained that one of the transfers people referred to was not a selloff. However, it was used to return collateral after a loan agreement ended. This can be confirmed by checking the movement of tokens on the blockchain. Laser also confirmed that its main investment in OM is still locked and has not been sold or moved. OKX Finds Unusual Trading Activity Meanwhile, crypto exchange OKX took steps to address OM’s sudden volatility. The platform updated its risk settings and warned users about increased price swings. In a statement, OKX said it found changes in OM’s token structure since October 2024. It also saw suspicious trading patterns. Several wallets have made large deposits and withdrawals across different exchanges since March 2025. However, OKX did not mention who was behind the movements but confirmed the matter is still under investigation. OM Value Dropped Sharply The OM token’s market cap dropped from $5.9 billion to $697 million between April 13 and April 14, a loss of over $5.2 billion in less than a day. CoinGlass said $71 million worth of positions were liquidated during the crash. Many believe that a large investor sold huge amounts of OM on centralized exchanges, causing the price to fall quickly. MANTRA’s team and investors are working to stabilize the situation. Exchanges like OKX continue investigating what caused one of the biggest single-day crashes in OM’s history.

Buterin expressed this view in a recent blog post titled “Why I Support Privacy,” in which he warned about centralization and transparency. In the post , which marks the latest that Buterin will write on privacy, the Ethereum co-founder said he is increasing his focus on privacy in the Ethereum ecosystem because of centralization risks. According to him, most people focus on centralized technical infrastructure, but centralized data collection is also a major concern. He said: “When people in the real world express concern about centrally operated technical infrastructure, the concern is sometimes about operators changing the rules unexpectedly or deplatforming users, but just as often, it’s about data collection.” Buterin observed that the risks are even higher now with the development of artificial intelligence, as this technology makes it easier to centralize data collection and analysis. He noted that future technologies, such as brain-computer interfaces, could even pose a great risk. Buterin debunks assumptions about transparency Meanwhile, Buterin spent a major part of his essay debunking previous theories and assumptions about the need for transparency. According to him, the assumptions that led people to advocate for transparency decades ago have turned out to be wrong. These assumptions, which include the beliefs that government will become better-intentioned and that society will grow more tolerant and accepting, have not come to pass. Instead, no one agrees that governments have the best intentions, and culture has regressed and become less tolerant. Buterin used his own case as an example, noting that he is subject to privacy intrusions because of his popularity. According to him, this is unusual and proves the need for privacy, especially because several others are also in such unusual circumstances. He said: “Privacy gives you the freedom to live your life in a way that best suits your personal goals and needs, without having to constantly balance every action between “the private game” (your own needs) and “the public game” The Ethereum co-founder also countered the opinion that the government should have backdoors allowing them access to privacy. He noted that authorities today already have access to more information than at any time in history, even without requiring a warrant. Thus, he believes that the risk of backdoors, such as abuse, illegal transfer and use, hacking, and other factors, make them untenable. For him, privacy is important because it represents freedom, order, and progress. Buterin advocates for ZK-SNARKS and FHE With Buterin highlighting why privacy is necessary, he also discussed solutions for implementing it on blockchain networks. According to him, the blockchain industry relegated privacy discussions to the background before now because there was no technology to guarantee that. However, he believes Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof technology offers the best solution to privacy and identity challenges today as it can provide sufficient information to prove trustworthiness while protecting identity. The Ethereum co-founder also mentioned fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) as another promising technology that enables people to compute over data without seeing the data and noted that things could get even better with obfuscation. Based on these technologies, Buterin believes that several solutions can be developed to enable privacy without compromising security. He listed some solutions to include ZK proof of personhood, on-device anti-fraud scanning, privacy pools, and proof of provenance for physical items. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The launch of these ETFs comes at a good time, as Solana’s price has gone up by 25% in the past week. Canada to Launch Solana ETFs The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has officially given the green light to several major ETF issuers, Purpose Investments, Evolve ETFs, CI Global Asset Management, and 3iQ, to roll out Solana ETFs in the country. These firms will offer new ETFs that actually hold real Solana (SOL) tokens, instead of just following the price. What makes these ETFs special is that they will also include staking. According to a Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas , the ETFs will use TD Bank for staking services. Staking means holding Solana to help the network and, in return, earning extra coins as rewards. This can give investors higher returns, especially because Solana staking pays more than Ethereum, and it can also lower the total cost of holding the ETF. How This ETF Is Different From Other ETFs Even though all the ETFs will hold Solana, each one will track a different index. This gives investors different ways to invest in Solana based on their goals and strategies. All of them, however, will focus on long-term holding of physical Solana coins, showing strong belief in the future of the token. Solana Market Santiment Peaks Solana is getting a lot of attention lately, and not just from investors! According to data from Santiment over the past few days, more and more people have started talking about it online, and it’s trending on social media. Adding to the excitement, data from Nansen shows that Solana had the highest number of transactions among all blockchains in the last week, over 355 million transactions. Solana (SOL) Price May Jump to $151 Looking at the Solana 1-day price chart, it has been consolidating between the $125 to $135 range for the past few days. Experts believe that if it can break above $137, the next target could be around $151. However, if the price falls below the support level of $125, it might drop further to $117. So, the next few days are important for Solana’s price direction.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 18:12:36

He accused them of artificially sustaining token prices while centralized exchanges (CEXs) turn a blind eye. Cheong Warns Market Is Becoming ‘Uninvestable’ In an April 14 post on X, Cheong claimed that the liquid crypto market is plagued by a “complete black box” system in which the involved parties collaborate to engineer token valuations. “You don’t know whether the price is a result of organic demand and supply,” he wrote, “or simply due to projects and market makers colluding to fix the price to achieve other objectives.” Cheong also criticized the CEXs, suggesting they are deliberately ignoring these practices despite their damaging impact. He noted that the altcoin market is increasingly resembling a “lemon’s market,” where reduced trust makes quality harder to identify. He further argued that token generation events (TGEs) in 2025 have been poorly priced, with many coins dropping between 70% and 90% within months of listing, leaving buyers facing major losses. The Defiance Capital CIO concluded by emphasizing that unless major players in the crypto space take action to fix these issues, many parts of the market will remain unsafe for serious investors in the future. MANTRA Crash Sparks Manipulation Fears His comments follow the April 13 collapse of MANTRA’s native token, OM, which saw its market value nosedive by 90% in a matter of hours. John Patrick Mullin, a co-founder of the protocol, claimed the crash was caused by forced liquidations carried out by CEXs. However, blockchain data revealed unusual activity in the days leading up to the incident. Analytics platform Lookonchain reported that 17 wallets sent 43.6 million OM tokens, about 4.5% of all coins in circulation, to exchanges starting on April 7. Two of those wallets were linked to Laser Digital, a known investor in MANTRA, raising suspicions of insider selling. Meanwhile, Spot On Chain said whale OM holders moved 14.27 million tokens to OKX three days before the crash. Further, they had bought over 84 million OM for $564.7 million in March, which added to fears of a planned sell-off. Earlier in the year, the Libra token faced similar scrutiny. Following Argentinian President Javier Milei’s public endorsement, the coin’s market cap surged to $4 billion within hours before crashing by over 90%, wiping out millions in investor funds. The country’s Chamber of Deputies has since approved an investigation into LIBRA, focusing on Milei’s social media promotion of the meme coin and its subsequent collapse.

CoinShares figures indicate that funds specific to Bitcoin saw the most outflows of $751 million, representing about 94% of all outflows, even though BTC has seen YTD inflows of $545 million. The persistent negative sentiment since early February has resulted in cumulative outflows reaching $7.2 billion. This has nearly eliminated all inflows recorded since the beginning of 2025. Current YTD inflows now stand at just $165 million. Bitcoin dominated outflows The money leaving the market was shared by almost all big cryptocurrency fund providers. The statistics indicated that ProShares ETFs alone received more funds for the week, which was $3.70 million. iShares ETFs/USA lost the largest amount of funds, at $341.64 million. Grayscale Investments LLC/USA lost $186.69 million. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund lost $74.63 million, and Bitwise Funds Trust lost $43.78 million. The other big providers that witnessed withdrawals were ARK 21 Shares/USA ($27.22 million), 21Shares AG ($11.26 million), and CoinShares XBT Provider AB ($7.70 million). The smaller providers as a group witnessed $106.05 million in withdrawals. Looking at the asset breakdown, Bitcoin dominated with $751 million in outflows, accounting for 94% of the total. Ethereum followed as a distant second with $37.6 million in withdrawals. Other cryptocurrencies showing outflows included Solana ($5.11 million), Short Bitcoin ($4.58 million), Sui ($0.6 million), Cardano ($0.4 million), and Litecoin ($0.26 million). Source: CoinShares A handful of assets managed to attract positive flows during the week, with XRP leading at $3.45 million in inflows. Multi-asset funds also saw modest gains, with $1.05 million in inflows. According to the CoinShares report, other altcoins with minor inflows included “Ondo, Algorand, and Avalanche [with] inflows of US$0.46m, US$0.25m and US$0.25m respectively.” Despite maintaining positive year-to-date inflows of $545 million, Bitcoin’s massive weekly outflow has raised concerns about changing investor sentiment toward the cryptocurrency. The monthly trend shows Bitcoin losing $890 million over the past month while still having the largest assets under management at $112.96 billion. Crypto outflows heavily concentrated in the United States The outflows were heavily concentrated in the United States, which accounted for $763 million or 96% of the total weekly withdrawals. Other major markets experienced outflows included Switzerland ($11.9 million), Hong Kong ($11.2 million), Sweden ($6.8 million), and Germany ($4.4 million). A few markets managed to maintain positive flows despite the negative trend. Canada led with $2.1 million in inflows, followed by Brazil ($0.2 million) and Australia ($0.4 million). The market context for these outflows was directly tied to recent policy developments. According to CoinShares, “recent tariff activity continues to weigh on sentiment towards the asset class.” However, a late-week development helped stabilize the market somewhat: “a late-week price rebound helped lift total assets under management (AuM) from their lowest point on April 8 (the lowest since early November 2024) to US$130bn.” The U.S. market dominance is also reflected in the assets under management distribution, with U.S.-based funds holding $99.53 billion, or about 77% of the global total. The next largest markets by AUM are Canada ($4.8 billion), Switzerland ($4.58 billion), Germany ($4.5 billion), and Sweden ($2.62 billion). Bitcoin leads with $545 million YTD inflows Despite the substantial recent outflows, several digital assets maintain positive year-to-date inflows, according to the CoinShares data. Bitcoin leads with $545 million in YTD inflows, followed by Ethereum ($241 million), XRP ($176.35 million), Solana ($78.78 million), Cardano ($69.63 million), and Sui ($52.46 million). The collective outflows since early February have nearly eliminated the year’s gains, with total YTD inflows now standing at just $165 million. This is a major reduction from peak inflow levels earlier in the year. From a provider perspective, iShares ETFs/USA maintains the strongest YTD position with $2,848.51 million in inflows despite recent withdrawals. ProShares ETFs/USA follows with $401.27 million in YTD inflows. ARK 21 Shares/USA has also maintained positive territory with $118.74 million in YTD inflows. With total assets under management at approximately $130 billion, the crypto investment fund sector has maintained substantial size despite the recent volatility.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Blogging isn’t dead: it’s just evolving, and in web3, creators finally have the tools to earn without relying on outdated ad models or middlemen. Table of Contents 6 ways to monetize websites in web3 1. Token-gated content and memberships 2. Turning a website/app into a crypto exchange 3. DAO and community-driven funding 4. NFT sales and collectibles 5. Decentralized affiliate marketing 6. Sponsored posts and native web3 partnerships Conclusion There are now better ways to turn a blog into a reliable source of income, especially for creators in web3. It is well known that display ad payouts are miserable. In fact, Google AdSense payouts to publishers have steadily declined since 2015. This is mainly due to content saturation, and over time, the internet will only become more competitive. In 2024, Google switched AdSense to a CPM model , slashing income for many blog owners who once relied on CPC rates. So, should publishers say goodbye to their dreams of earning passive income from a blog already? Absolutely not. If the internet is evolving from web2 to web3 , then so should monetization. Instead of leaning on outdated models like display ads and affiliate links, it’s time to explore smarter, decentralized revenue streams that put the creator back in control. 6 ways to monetize websites in web3 1. Token-gated content and memberships Web3 allows creators to offer exclusive content through smart contracts and NFTs. This means content creators can token-gate premium articles, reports, or even video content, granting access only to those who hold a specific token or NFT. Token-gated communities or apps set preconditions that the users must meet in order to get access. The most common condition is proving ownership of a particular token or NFT. The users are asked to connect their crypto wallet to the app, which prompts them to complete a transaction without gas fees. If the transaction goes through, the user successfully proves their ownership of the required private key and access is granted. This is kind of like having a Patreon account but way better, especially since creators get to keep all of their money. Token-gating can be done directly on the blog, and it works even if creators want to hide exclusive video content without paying a cut to third-party services. Collab.Land has an API that allows creators to set up token gating on their content. Why it’s powerful Direct revenue from the audience without third parties. Builds a highly engaged and exclusive community. Creates scarcity and value around the content. Moves audience away from social media and on to the platform (with the creator’s own rules and policy). 2. Turning a website/app into a crypto exchange Creators can now run their own crypto exchange for free. A lot of people don’t know just how easy it is these days to run and manage one. With a simple code, creators can add a crypto exchange widget to their website that pays them commission each time a user completes a transaction. A lot of web3 entrepreneurs build entire websites just to run the widget. ChangeNOW has a fully customizable widget that anyone can use to add crypto exchange functionality to their website. No extensive development, capital, or liquidity required – in fact, the company’s developers even help users troubleshoot errors on their platform for free. If creators are looking for a quick solution, they can also add a simple but fully customizable “Exchange Button” to the platform using the referral program : The integration immediately gives users access to both CEX and DEX liquidity. Users can easily carry out crypto-to-crypto swaps and even process transactions in fiat (such as purchase or settlement operations). In addition, they also have an open source API that works seamlessly with Android and iOS apps (such as wallets) so that they’re not just limited to web platforms. Why it’s powerful: Turns creator sites into a useful exchange tool, not just a read Allows creators to set their own commissions Generates revenue without intrusive ads or paywalls Integrates seamlessly without third-party branding Becomes an integral part of the user experience on the site or app 3. DAO and community-driven funding Let’s say a creator has a dedicated audience who loves their content. Instead of chasing big sponsors or running donation campaigns every month, what if they could let their own readers help fund and shape the direction of the blog? That’s exactly what a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) allows creators to do. They can create a simple governance structure using smart contracts and launch their own token to allow readers to contribute, vote on topics, fund new series, or even co-own parts of the platform. Instead of writing what they think people want, the most loyal followers tell the creator what they want – and they pay to make it happen. Start small. Creators don’t need to be developers to launch a DAO anymore. Tools like Juicebox let users create DAO structures without writing code. They can also raise funds using Gitcoin Grants to back blog features or series based on community votes. If creators want a token attached, platforms like Mirror.xyz make it easy to write blog content and launch tokenized crowdfunding in the same breath. Why it’s powerful: Turns the blog into a community-owned publication Eliminates the need for advertisers or corporate funding Empowers the audience to become true stakeholders Scales with the readership and grows over time 4. NFT sales and collectibles NFTs are so much more than just overpriced pictures and collectibles – especially for bloggers/website owners. Creators can mint NFTs tied to their content, giving readers ownership of unique digital assets like limited-edition posts, essays, access passes, behind-the-scenes content, or even lifetime memberships. The scarcity and collectibility element of NFTs creates a brand-new reason for the audience to support the creator financially – not just consume the content passively. Creators can easily mint any kind of file into an NFT on platforms like OpenSea. They can also try Paragraph.xyz – a web3-native newsletter platform where they can mint NFTs for each issue or offer token-gated content tied to NFTs. Many creators are also using NFTs as “blog badges” – unique tokens that readers earn for supporting a post, reading a series, or attending an online event. It’s kind of similar to the top fan badge system on YouTube and Facebook. Why it’s powerful: Creates new revenue without relying on ads or clicks Adds scarcity and collectibility to the content Builds a deeper connection with superfans NFTs appreciate in value, becoming long-term assets 5. Decentralized affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is nothing new, but in web3 it comes with a twist – full transparency, on-chain tracking, and no middlemen taking a cut. Smart contracts allow creators to track clicks, conversions, and payouts automatically, without relying on centralized affiliate networks. That means better margins, faster payments, and way less friction. To get started, creators should look for affiliate programs run by web3-native platforms like: 1inch Paraswap GMX NFT marketplaces like LooksRare Many of these platforms offer smart contract-based referrals where creators can earn a portion of the trading fees or user activity. Some DeFi platforms also offer custom links they can embed directly into the blog – turning every mention of a product or token into a revenue opportunity. Why it’s powerful: Smart contract transparency = no shady payouts Creators earn instantly (no waiting 30 days for payroll) Potentially higher commissions than web2 equivalents Allows deeper integrations with the web3 ecosystem 6. Sponsored posts and native web3 partnerships Sponsored content is still one of the most lucrative income streams in the blogging world. Why get rid of a cash cow if it’s already bringing in money? However, web3 takes sponsored content to another level. Rather than working with SEO agencies and legacy ad networks, creators can partner with blockchain projects, DAOs, or token platforms that are actually aligned with their niche. The best part is that these partnerships often pay in crypto, and many use smart contracts to guarantee transparency and instant payouts – no need to chase invoices anymore. Where to find sponsors? Creators can start by listing their blog on platforms like Sponsy or Heaps – both of which connect web3 creators with projects looking for visibility. They can also DM projects directly on Twitter/X or reach out via Discord if they’ve built a niche community. Alternatively, creators can publish a “Partner With Us” page on their site outlining their traffic stats – just like traditional media sites do. Why it’s powerful: Web3 sponsors often pay higher rates Partnerships feel more aligned than typical ads Smart contract-based deals reduce friction Helps position the blog as a serious player in the ecosystem Conclusion Monetization is an art, and web3 makes it easier to turn traffic into money with newer tools and methods. But when there are so many options, it’s easy to get overloaded by all the choices out there. Creators should opt for methods depending on their niche. Hardcore content creators, whose audience is only there to consume content, should use methods that allow them to get paid more for the content, such as token gating or web3 sponsorships. Entrepreneurs should, however, offer an actual service or tool instead of relying entirely on revenue from content creation. For example, creators should consider turning their website into a fully functional crypto exchange with swaps, fiat transactions, and instant withdrawals using ChangeNOW’s API.

The latest Story (IP) price drop has traders concerned over a repeat of the Mantra (OM) crash. Notably, on April 14, the IP token was down from $4.24 to a daily low of $3.02. In just one hour, the token registered a 25% price drop. Even though IP somewhat recovered to $3.73, the flash crash raised concerns over market liquidity and potential insider selling. What is more, traders on social media linked the Story crash to the recent Mantra crash , which lost 90% of its value and $5 billion in market cap the same day. According to crypto journalist Colin Wu , most of IP’s trading volume was concentrated in Binance Futures and OKX spot markets, the same platforms implicated in the Mantra crash. After the sudden drop, both exchanges issued conflicting explanations. Low liquidity, or insider selling, hurt projects like Story For one, Binance concurred with the Mantra CEO, who blamed forced liquidations on several exchanges. These can happen in times of low liquidity, when sharp changes in prices result in liquidations of big positions in the futures market. You might also like: OM 90% price crash: Binance and OKX responds to OM crash OKX, on the other hand, pointed out that the Mantra made changes to its tokenomics model. The exchange also noted major token deposits to several centralized exchanges. This explanation aligned more with that of independent investigators, who blamed insider selling as the likely culprit. For smaller projects like Story and Mantra, both low liquidity and insider selling can be a source of significant volatility. According to a report by Kaiko research , the sudden crash of the Mantra token resulted in $21 million in liquidations of long positions, which exacerbated price pressures. While Story recovered, the sudden crash revealed the volatility risks of smaller tokens. In a situation of low liquidity, a few big trades can cause major price moves.

The claim gained traction after a Chinese influencer made the allegations public during an X Spaces talk that attracted thousands of listeners. Binance Founder Debunks Federal Reserve Ties As the Binance founder revealed on X , the story originated from a Chinese influencer using the X handle Liangxihgui. In a detailed post, the influencer alleged that CZ’s legal troubles in the United States were staged and that he serves as a covert operative for the US Federal Reserve. The message sparked intense interest online, drawing in an audience of 119,000 listeners on the X Spaces. In response, CZ posted on his X account to publicly dismiss the claims. He shared a screenshot of the original message and stated that, while the story was amusing, it was completely false. He clarified that he did serve a four-month prison sentence in the United States, from May to September 2024, for violations related to anti-money laundering laws. After his release, Changpeng Zhao shared some key moments from prison. WSJ Smear Job and the CZ Response It is worth noting that before this, CZ addressed another circulating rumor. This one claimed he had worked with the US Department of Justice to target fellow crypto figure Justin Sun. A report by the Wall Street Journal alleged that Binance executives were negotiating a regulatory return to the US while working with the DOJ to obtain evidence against Sun . The Binance Founder dismissed the claims as a smear campaign and accused the media outlet of being paid to spread false information about him. He reminded the public that he had served prison time. Justin Sun also came to his defense, stating that he was unaware of the rumor. Meanwhile, CZ mentioned that such rumors are not new and often come from influencers trying to grow their follower base. One of his followers joked that if the Binance founder worked for the Federal Reserve, Bitcoin’s price would be at an all-time high. Changpeng Zhao Shifts Focus to YZi Labs and Giggle Academy Since leaving prison and stepping down from his role as Binance CEO, CZ has shifted his focus to new ventures. As reported earlier by CoinGape, he is now working in a key leadership position after Binance Labs rebranded to YZi Labs . In addition, he has also been building Giggle Academy, an educational platform for students. The project was first announced before his prison sentence, and the app for younger children went live in December 2024. CZ has said he will dedicate the coming years to this educational effort.

Asset managers conceded this redemption model before approving the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF products last year. VanEck and WisdomTree’s renewed push shows the US SEC’s change in stance on the crypto ecosystem. US SEC Defines New Date for In-Kind Creates Bid According to the market regulator, as shared on X by Eleanor Terrett, the new date to consider for deciding on the In-Kind creation and redemption is June 3. With In-Kind creations, stakeholders exchange the underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum directly, eliminating the need to first convert the funds to cash. The US SEC initially opposed in-kind creation and redemption for various reasons. One major one is that it avoids taxable events and helps maintain liquidity and price stability.

Although there are claims that the development team is behind the drop, OM founder John Mullin denies this claim. Mantra, which was among the world’s top 30 cryptocurrencies before the crash, lost over $5 billion in value in a single day. OM cryptocurrency users are now questioning who is responsible for the crash. However, crypto detective ZachXBT has completed his investigation into the matter and shared the suspects behind the drop. According to ZachXBT, Reef Finance founder Denko Mancheski and Fukogoryushu are behind the Mantra incidents. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Announces It Will List a New Altcoin The detective says that the reason these names are suspicious is that the duo approached various people in the last few days before the fall to borrow large amounts of money using OM collateral. ZachXBT said that these people reached out to him and told him that Denko Mancheski and Fukogoryushu wanted to borrow large amounts of money using OM collateral. ZachXBT noted that the REEF token had also experienced similar market manipulation in the past, making an over-the-counter deal with bankrupt company Alameda Research worth $80 million and eventually being delisted by Binance in October 2024. The detective did not comment on whether Mantra's CEO and development team were aware of all this, saying that users should decide for themselves. *This is not investment advice.

The market will have to absorb the first unlocked tokens coming on April 17. Official Trump (TRUMP) expects its first unlock after April 17. The token, which mixes its meme potential with community-building, may lose value even faster after the unlocks. Ahead of the unlocks, TRUMP fell to a lower range, from $8.47 down to $7.99. The token has erased most of the holders’ value, even as only 20% of the supply is unlocked. The market will potentially see an inflow of 40M unlocked tokens, currently valued at $330M. The tokens belong to one of the biggest creator wallets, currently holding 39% of the supply. TRUMP will also be the biggest token unlock for this week, becoming a test for the market, as most traders have lost interest in altcoins. Meme tokens retain some of their activity, mostly driven by FARTCOIN. The TRUMP token may get a boost from the growth in the Made in USA narrative, as well as the general weekly recovery of meme tokens, based on Alphanomics data . Most of the tokens held now are part of the public distribution, where the earliest buyers paid premium prices for TRUMP. Despite the initial enthusiasm and high liquidity, TRUMP is on track to lose 90% of its value. The current unlocks will continue for the next two years, gradually inflating the supply from 200M up to 1B tokens in circulation. The unlocks are seen as another source of price pressure, but may also trigger unpredictable short-term moves. Some expect the unlocks to bring a pump caused by market markets, so the team can cash out faster and at a higher price range. Traders are reluctant to short TRUMP Ahead of the unlocks, TRUMP trades on a mix of decentralized liquidity pools and a Binance centralized pair. The token’s trading volumes are increasing again, going over $500M in the past few days. Ahead of the unlock, the TRUMP market saw an outflow of derivative traders, aiming to avoid the potential volatility. The open interest fell to 200.03M, down from over $240M over the weekend. Despite the expectations of a price drop, short positions make up around 34% of open interest. The long/short ratio increased slightly, showing risk-averse behavior. TRUMP has no directional guarantee, as the unlocked tokens will be granted to the team at virtually no cost. It remains uncertain if the team will try to realize profits even at this lower price range. Whales still sell TRUMP ahead of the unlock Social media accounts hold some expectations that the TRUMP unlock may be bullish. However, top traders are divesting more of their holdings. The top TRUMP trader whale has realized more than $29M in profits. The same whale continued to place sell orders for TRUMP as of April 14. TRUMP whale sold ahead of the recent price slump, anticipating the first large unlock coming this week. TRUMP is a relatively obscure token, despite the active narrative around the US President. The asset is mostly swapped actively by meme token whales , some of which switch between memes for the best chances of short-term profits. TRUMP sees high-velocity activity between wallets, including potential market-makers. One of the top 10 whales is actively transacting with Binance’s wallets, potentially preparing for more volatile price action. Bubblemaps data shows the formation of several wallet clusters with high-velocity token transfers. The token is not present in Kamino lending vaults to be used as collateral, and trades outside of the currently trending Solana meme tokens. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Macroeconomic financial analyst Tomas said that this liquidity surge boosted the net Federal Reserve liquidity to $6.3 trillion, and it may support Bitcoin’s (BTC) price in the future, even though risk assets have reflected minimal growth so far. US Treasury General Account’s expected liquidity flow. Source: X.com The TGA represents the government’s checking account at the Federal Reserve, holding capital for daily operations like paying bills or collecting taxes. A decrease in TGA capital means the balance has been deployed into the broader economy, boosting available cash in the markets. Tomas explained that The TGA drawdown commenced on Feb. 12, following the exhaustion of ""extraordinary measures"" after the debt ceiling was reached. The TGA balance has dropped from $842 to roughly $342 billion, releasing liquidity into the system, and the targeted liquidity is expected to rise up to $600 billion by the end of April. The analyst added that the current tax season will temporarily drain liquidity, but the drawdown is expected to resume in May. If debt ceiling talks extend to August, net liquidity could hit a multi-year high of $6.6 trillion, which could cause a bullish tailwind for Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s correlation with global liquidity. Source: Lynalden.com According to a study by financial analyst Lyn Alden, Bitcoin has historically moved 83% of the time in line with global liquidity in a given 12-month period. The research termed “Bitcoin a Global Liquidity Barometer” compared Bitcoin to other major asset classes such as SPX, gold and VT, and BTC topped the correlation index with respect to global liquidity. Past TGA drawdowns in 2022 and 2023 have fueled speculative assets like Bitcoin. Thus, a $600 billion boost, plus billions more added over Q2-Q3, could lift BTC’s value if market conditions remain stable.

This new feature adds to its support for euro (EUR) and U.S. dollar (USD) payments, helping the bank stay at the forefront of digital financial services. JPMorgan Kinexys Improves its Operational Efficiency According to the update reported by The Block, clients can make GBP payments anytime using blockchain technology, even on weekends. JPMorgan mentioned that this change makes financial transactions more flexible, faster, and efficient. This is especially important for global institutions that need smooth cross-border payments. High-profile clients, including the London Stock Exchange Group’s SwapAgent (LSEG) and the multinational commodity trading firm Trafigura, were the first to use Kinexys’ GBP blockchain accounts. The platform also allows for same-day foreign exchange (FX) settlements, improving cash flow and operational efficiency. With the addition of GBP, clients can move funds between pounds, euros, and dollars 24/7, no matter the hour of the day. It is also worth noting that Kinexys will help reduce risks by allowing continuous settlement in multiple currencies. Furthermore, this approach signals a move towards decentralized and automated financial systems and prepares the way for more innovations in institutional finance. Kinexys: A Scalable Blockchain-Powered Solution Kinexys, JPMorgan’s private blockchain platform, has evolved from its early days as Onyx and has experienced impressive growth since its launch. Kinexys is positioning itself as a leader in blockchain-based financial operations. The network has over $2 billion in daily transactions and a total notional value of over $1.5 trillion. The platform is also on track to handle larger volumes as its capabilities expand to more currency pairs. Likewise, Kinexys simplifies liquidity management and reduces risks by allowing clients to make international transactions. With partners like Siemens, BlackRock, and Ant International, JPMorgan will create a robust multi-chain system for instant transactions. The first phase of this initiative focuses on dollar-euro settlements. A New Era for Blockchain in Banking JPMorgan’s global co-head of payments, Umar Farooq, envisions a future where blockchain ecosystems seamlessly interact. As blockchain ecosystems evolve, JPMorgan’s vision for a frictionless, multi-currency clearing and settlement network is becoming increasingly achievable. Kinexys is paving the way for a future where blockchain supports banking systems and actively powers them, providing faster, more secure, and cost-effective solutions for businesses and clients worldwide. This new era for blockchain in banking promises to redefine liquidity management, reduce risks, and offer unprecedented speed and accessibility in global finance.

According to an April 14 Barron's report, members of the task force have contacted former employees of the company over the past weeks to examine its practices and policies. Citing unidentified sources, the report claims the probe looks at potential financial crimes within Anchorage. The reported Homeland task force probe hints at cross-national financial activities. Established in 1992, the El Dorado Task Force focuses on “transnational money laundering” activities and financial crimes carried out by organizations. Anchorage is co-founded by Portuguese-American entrepreneur Diogo Mónica and Nathan McCauley, according to its website. Along with its US businesses, Anchorage has operations in Singapore and Portugal. Its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Goldman Sachs and Visa, among others. Anchorage Digital is the only federally chartered crypto bank in the United States. It received its national trust bank charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in January 2021. Despite its advanced regulatory position, Anchorage Digital has faced regulatory challenges in the US. In April 2022, the OCC issued a consent order against the bank for deficiencies in its Bank Secrecy Act and Anti-Money Laundering compliance programs. At the time, the company was ordered to establish a committee to address the alleged issues under the oversight of the OCC. Cointelegraph reached out to Anchorage for comment but had not received a response at the time of publication. Anchorage's crypto footprint Anchorage was founded in 2017, and since then has been expanding its crypto footprint with services for institutional clients. The company is a custodian of BlackRock's Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) alongside Coinbase and BitGo. BlackRock's BTC funds have attracted over $35.5 billion in cumulative inflows since its launch in January 2024. Another of Anchorage's clients is Cantor Fitzgerald. The company has offered custody and collateral management for Cantor's Bitcoin holdings since March 2025. Anchorage reported over $50 billion in assets under management in 2024. Among Anchorage's custody competitors are players such as Ripple, Kraken, Taurus and Fireblocks, but the storage of digital assets has also attracted traditional financial institutions to the crypto field. HSBC, Citi and BNY Mellon — America's oldest bank — are also competing to safeguard crypto assets for institutional clients. According to Fireblocks’ Adam Levine, senior vice president of corporate development, the US market lacks qualified custodians for digital assets. ""[...] there are limited options for certain market participants to keep their digital assets in safe keeping via a qualified custodian,” Levine told Cointelegraph in a previous interview. A 2025 survey by EY reveals that 59% of institutional investors plan to allocate over 5% of their assets under management to cryptocurrencies, indicating a growing demand for institutional-grade custody services. Institutional investors are expected to increase crypto allocations in 2025.

EURC's supply grew 43% over the past month to 217 million tokens worth $246 million, ranking above Paxos' Global Dollar (USDG) and below Ripple's RLUSD by market capitalization, RWA.xyz data shows. Most of the EURC tokens circulate on the Ethereum network, up 35% in a month to 112 million, while Solana saw the fastest, 75% expansion to 70 million tokens. Base, Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2, also saw a 30% growth to 30 million in EURC supply. The token also experienced an uptick in on-chain activity, with active addresses rising 66% to 22,000 and the monthly transfer volume surpassing $2.5 billion, up 47% in a month, per RWA.xyz . EURC is currently the largest euro stablecoin on the market, but it lags far behind its dollar-denominated counterparts. Dollar-pegged stablecoins make up 99% of the rapidly growing stablecoin market, led by Circle's $58 billion USDC and rival Tether's $143 billion USDT token. The accelerating growth of EURC could be a sign of growing demand for diversification to euro-denominated digital assets, particularly as global investors navigate increasing economic uncertainties in the U.S. with the Trump administration wide-scale tariff rollout. The greenback weakened 9% against the euro since the start of the year. Xapo Bank, a Gibraltar-based Bitcoin-focused financial services firm, reported Monday a 50% increase in euro deposit volumes during the first quarter, outpacing the 20% rise in USDC stablecoin deposits. Meanwhile, deposits in USDT declined by over 13%. ""This rapid increase in volume came amidst mounting concern about the future of U.S. dollar primacy and the threat of a U.S. recession as markets braced for Trump’s planned 'Liberation Day' in April,"" the firm said in the report. Stablecoin swap volumes between foreign currency pairs on Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges also soared to multi-year highs last week, dominated by the EUR-U.S. dollar pair, Blockworks data showed. EURC also has likely benefited from Tether's withdrawal of its euro-backed stablecoin (EURT) with E.U.-wide MiCA regulations going into effect this year, while a number of exchanges delisted USDT for E.U. users to comply with regulations, including Binance at the end of March.",Markets|Stablecoin|Circle|Xapo|Euro,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-14 19:31:20

To read full editions, subscribe . If you logged off on Friday at the close and didn’t check futures prices or the news until this morning (unlikely, I know, but maybe you spent the weekend at the Masters), you have some catching up to do. To recap: The US Customs and Border Protection late Friday night issued guidance exempting certain consumer electronics (smartphones, computers, etc.) from both reciprocal tariffs on China and the 10% global tariff on all imports. Machines used to assemble semiconductors are also exempt, the guidance noted. On Saturday afternoon, though, White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said that these products, when imported from China, are still subject to a 20% levy. Trump doubled down (sort of) on Sunday, writing in a Truth Social post that “there was no tariff ‘exemption’ announced on Friday.” Semiconductor tariffs will be moved to a different “bucket,” he said, adding that he would clarify everything on Monday. When asked about it this morning, Trump told reporters this: “Look, I’m a very flexible person. I don’t change my mind, but I’m flexible, and you have to be.” He added that “there’ll be many things coming up” and he “[doesn’t] want to hurt anybody.” We try to cover news as close to schedules as possible, but this administration loves to keep everyone on their toes. With that in mind, as of time of writing, Trump didn’t provide any specifics on tariffs on electronics. We’ll be watching for updates, but buckle up in the meantime.

The 4-hour chart reveals a tightening structure, suggesting XRP is coiling up for its next significant move. With Bollinger Bands contracting and MACD flashing early bullish cues, the market is bracing for either a breakout or rejection—likely within the next 12 hours. Traders are now positioning around critical support and resistance levels, awaiting confirmation of direction. Bollinger Bands Signal Breakout Readiness The Bollinger Bands (20,2) have tightened following a period of contraction, a precursor to increased volatility. Price action is hugging the upper band at $2.22, showing that bulls are pressing overhead resistance. The midline at $2.1119, acting as dynamic support, has held firm through minor retracements—underscoring bullish control. This price behavior hints at an imminent breakout attempt. If bulls maintain pressure above $2.11, the probability of a move toward $2.28 or even $2.35 increases. However, if the price slips beneath $2.11, the setup risks fading into consolidation between $2.00 and $2.03—levels that previously offered stability during drawdowns. MACD Reinforces Bullish Bias but Demands Volume The MACD indicator shows bullish alignment, with the MACD line currently at 0.0435 edging above the signal line at 0.0396. Though the histogram is slightly flattening, its position above zero still favors upside momentum. This setup suggests underlying buying pressure remains intact but may require a volume surge to sustain upward momentum. Should the histogram widen again in the coming hours, it could confirm a fresh leg upward. Conversely, a bearish crossover or histogram dip into negative territory would signal weakening momentum—prompting caution among short-term traders. Price Structure Points to Continuation Pattern XRP’s recent recovery from the sub-$1.60 region has been technically healthy, forming a sequence of higher lows and re-testing resistance zones. This structure supports the theory of a bullish continuation. The immediate hurdle remains $2.22, a level XRP has approached multiple times. A clean breakout with volume could send prices soaring toward the $2.35–$2.40 resistance band. On the downside, $2.11 and $2.00 form the key short-term support axis. A breakdown below $2.00 would signal a breakdown of the current pattern and potential retest of lower consolidation zones around $1.90–$1.95. For now, however, buyers remain in control unless proven otherwise. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 12-Hour Outlook: Anticipating the Next Move In the short term, XRP’s price is poised to move within the $2.11–$2.28 range over the next 12 hours. A successful break above $2.22 will likely drive XRP toward $2.35. If bulls fail to crack that resistance, the asset could consolidate between $2.00–$2.15 before attempting another push. The volume will be the determining factor. A surge in buying volume would validate the breakout narrative. Without it, XRP may enter a low-volatility phase, moving sideways within current levels. Traders should monitor price action closely around $2.22 for the first sign of a breakout or rejection. XRP Approaches Make-or-Break Moment XRP is nearing a pivotal decision point, with indicators leaning bullish but not yet confirmed. The current squeeze in the Bollinger Bands, paired with a still-positive MACD, positions the token for a possible breakout. But with resistance at $2.22 still intact, traders must watch for a convincing move above this barrier to validate upward continuation. In the next 12 hours, expect heightened volatility as XRP tests this crucial range. If momentum builds, a rally toward $2.35 is plausible. If not, XRP may stall and retrace toward support at $2.00. Either way, XRP is setting the stage for a swift move—and the market is watching. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Right now, all eyes are on the traditional financial world as the dollar slump intensifies amidst growing concerns over international trade policies and the highly anticipated European Central Bank (ECB) meeting. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding these forex market dynamics is crucial, as they often ripple into the digital asset space, creating both challenges and opportunities. Let’s dive into the factors driving the dollar’s decline and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Why is the Dollar Facing a Slump? Unpacking Trade Policy Uncertainty The greenback, long considered a safe-haven asset, is currently under pressure. The primary culprit? Trade policy uncertainty . Recent signals from major economies suggest a potential shift in global trade dynamics, leaving investors jittery. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors contributing to this uncertainty: Geopolitical Tensions: Ongoing global events are casting shadows on international trade relations. Uncertainty about future trade agreements and potential tariffs is making investors wary of holding dollar-denominated assets. Economic Data Concerns: Mixed economic data from the United States has further fueled doubts about the dollar’s strength. Slightly weaker-than-expected indicators have prompted some to question the robustness of the US economic recovery. Shift in Investor Sentiment: There’s a palpable shift in investor sentiment. The perception of the dollar as an unshakeable safe haven is being tested, leading to portfolio adjustments and diversification into other currencies and assets. This confluence of factors is creating a perfect storm for the dollar, pushing it into a slump and injecting volatility into the broader financial markets. The Looming ECB Meeting: A Potential Game-Changer for the Forex Market Adding another layer of complexity to the current situation is the upcoming ECB meeting . Market participants are keenly awaiting signals from the European Central Bank regarding its future monetary policy. Here’s what makes this meeting so crucial: Interest Rate Decisions: The ECB’s stance on interest rates will be pivotal. Any hints of a more hawkish approach, suggesting potential rate hikes, could significantly boost the Euro and further pressure the dollar. Inflation Outlook: The ECB’s assessment of the Eurozone’s inflation outlook will be closely scrutinized. Concerns about persistent inflation could prompt the ECB to consider tightening monetary policy, strengthening the Euro. Forward Guidance: Market participants will be hanging on every word from ECB officials for clues about future policy direction. Any surprises in the forward guidance could trigger sharp movements in the forex market , impacting currency pairs globally. The ECB meeting is not just a European event; its repercussions will be felt across global currency markets, influencing the dollar’s trajectory and creating ripples in the crypto sphere. Currency Volatility: Navigating the Forex Storm and Crypto Opportunities The current environment is characterized by heightened currency volatility . For those in the cryptocurrency space, this volatility presents both challenges and exciting opportunities. Here’s how to navigate this dynamic landscape: Understanding Correlation: Keep a close watch on the correlation between the dollar and cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Historically, a weaker dollar has sometimes coincided with increased interest in Bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Hedging Strategies: Experienced traders might consider employing hedging strategies to mitigate risks associated with forex market volatility. This could involve diversifying into different currency pairs or utilizing stablecoins to reduce exposure to dollar fluctuations. Identifying Entry Points: Periods of volatility can create attractive entry points into the crypto market. A weaker dollar, coupled with increased risk appetite, could drive capital into digital assets, presenting buying opportunities. However, remember that volatility is a double-edged sword. While it can amplify gains, it can also magnify losses. Prudent risk management and thorough research are paramount during times of heightened currency fluctuations. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? So, what actionable steps can crypto investors take amidst this dollar slump and trade policy uncertainty ? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in global trade policies and monitor the outcomes of the ECB meeting. Reliable news sources and financial analysis platforms are your best tools. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is key in volatile markets. Consider diversifying your crypto holdings across different assets and potentially exploring non-dollar pegged stablecoins. Risk Management: Implement robust risk management strategies. Define your risk tolerance, use stop-loss orders if appropriate, and avoid over-leveraging in highly volatile conditions. Long-Term Perspective: Maintain a long-term perspective. Short-term currency volatility is often a feature of the market, not a bug. Focus on the fundamental value of your crypto investments and avoid making impulsive decisions based on fleeting market swings. By staying informed, being strategic, and managing risk effectively, crypto investors can navigate the current forex market turbulence and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Forex Uncertainty The current dollar slump , fueled by trade policy uncertainty and the looming ECB meeting , presents a complex but potentially rewarding landscape for crypto investors. By understanding the interplay between traditional forex market dynamics and the cryptocurrency space, and by preparing for periods of increased currency volatility , you can position yourself to not just weather the storm, but potentially thrive amidst the uncertainty. The key is to remain agile, informed, and focused on long-term value creation in the ever-evolving world of digital assets.

43340694,https://coinpaper.com/8511/bitcoin-mining-fuels-air-pollution-crisis-and-legal-challenges-in-the-u-s,1744659769,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Bitcoin Mining Fuels Air Pollution Crisis and Legal Challenges in the U.S.,https://coinpaper.com/8511/bitcoin-mining-fuels-air-pollution-crisis-and-legal-challenges-in-the-u-s,"A new study in the journal Nature Communications has found that mining Bitcoin results in large amounts of harmful air pollutants - small particles produced by power plants. Between August 2022 and July 2023, about 1.9 million Americans were exposed to pollution due to mining, as harmful substances spread quickly across the U.S. thanks to winds. The list of affected regions includes New York City, the Houston-Austin metropolitan area, northeast Texas, and areas on the Illinois-Kentucky border. How mining affects the environment The study was led by Dr. Francesca Dominici of Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Researchers found that Bitcoin mining often causes an increase in electricity generation from fossil fuel-fired power plants . Experts analyzed data from 34 of the largest mining centers in the U.S. and concluded that mining in one state has the potential to increase the load on a power plant in another state, thereby spreading pollution. For example, electricity consumption by a mining farm in North Carolina caused an increase in coal-fired power plant capacity in Kentucky, which ultimately worsened air quality in Illinois. Meanwhile, Illinois residents cannot directly affect either the mining farm or the power plant. Since the pollution is not occurring in the state where its effects are being felt, there is a regulatory gap. One of the study's authors, Dr. Scott Delaney, said there are a number of ”policy mechanisms” that can mitigate ”interstate air pollution.” However, he said, this requires action at the federal level. Specifically, the expert suggested that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should adopt a rule regarding fine particle air pollution. Such regulation would require grid-connected states to more actively control power plant emissions. Programs could also be launched to encourage cryptocurrencies and data centers to locate in new, safer locations, taking into account the impact on public health. It is important to note that the activity of Bitcoin miners is growing. This can be seen in the BTC network hashrate indicator, that is, the total computing power of all devices in this blockchain. Last night, it exceeded the level of 1,100 hashes per second for the first time in history. Going to jail for cryptocurrencies More serious legal consequences for working with crypto await Waylon Wilcox, a 45-year-old American from Pennsylvania. He previously pleaded guilty to underreporting income on his tax return, which allowed him to avoid paying millions of dollars to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). He received the money for transactions involving nearly a hundred NFTs from the popular CryptoPunks collection. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Wilcox sold 97 tokens from the CryptoPunks series in 2021 and 2022 and received more than $13 million. However, he failed to report these transactions on his tax return, avoiding about $3.3 million in taxes. The case was the first major tax evasion case in the U.S. involving the sale of unique tokens. IRS regulations require a taxpayer to declare capital gains or losses on the sale of ”virtual currency” subject to capital loss deduction limitations. The progress of the crypto-enthusiast's case was commented on by Yuri Kruti, the head of the IRS office in Philadelphia. Here is his comment. The IRS Criminal Division will continue to uncover complex financial schemes using virtual currencies and unique tokens (NFTs) to hide taxable income. In today's economic climate, it's more important than ever for Americans to make sure everyone is playing by the rules and paying their taxes. Wilcox faces a maximum sentence of up to six years in prison. However, a guilty plea is likely to result in a reduction. CryptoPunks is a series of 10,000 algorithmically generated pixel characters in NFT format. It is one of the most sought-after collections during the peak popularity of unique tokens during the previous bullrun in 2021 and 2022. While today the minimum price for a single CryptoPunk is 42.42 ETH or just under $69 thousand dollars, at the peak in August 2021 they sold for a minimum of 125 ETH. This amount translated to almost $479,000 dollars at the time. In dollar terms, the value of the collection is down 85.7 percent from its all-time high. Just last week, one owner sold his CryptoPunk for $6 million dollars, incurring a $10 million loss. That is, Wilcox made his deals with NFT literally on the wave of hype around ”cryptoPunk”, which allowed him to earn large sums relatively quickly. The bottom line Bitcoin mining is still a major environmental controversy - especially in the U.S., where it affects air quality even in other states.

Its market dominance is growing, especially now that Bitcoin has bounced back above $85,000. On top of that, several on-chain indicators are showing positive signs, suggesting growing bullish momentum as Ethereum moves near a descending resistance line. However, a drop in whale interest might change the forecast. Ethereum’s Large Transaction Volume Declines Ethereum has seen growing buying interest recently, with its price rising nearly 6% over the past week. According to data from Coinglass, about $82.8 million worth of trading positions in Ethereum were liquidated, with buyers losing around $43.5 million and sellers about $39.2 million. Last week, ETH dropped to its lowest point since March 2023. However, a pause in tariffs helped the price recover slightly. Still, this recovery hasn’t been enough to boost investor confidence. Glassnode data shows that the number of wallets holding at least $1 million worth of ETH has dropped significantly this year, hitting the lowest level since January 2023. This points to a decline in interest from wealthier investors. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the volume of large Ethereum transactions has dropped significantly. Whale activity has fallen from a peak of $9.81 billion to just $2.75 billion, showing a clear decline in interest from big investors. Recent activity supports this trend—on April 14, a whale moved 20,000 ETH (worth about $32.4 million) to the Kraken exchange, likely in preparation for selling. Also read: Cardano Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will ADA Price Hit $2? Adding to the pressure, an on-chain analyst reported that an early investor from Ethereum’s 2015 ICO has been consistently selling. On April 13, this whale sold 632 ETH, worth around $1 million. Meanwhile, market sentiment remains mixed, and Ethereum’s open interest (the total value of outstanding derivatives contracts) has dropped by 1.16%, now sitting around $17.91 billion. This dip in open interest could slow down Ethereum’s recovery and increase the chances of a short-term pullback. What’s Next for ETH Price? Ether has bounced back from the key $1,500 level, as sellers are struggling to push the price any lower. Buyers are now focused on keeping the price above a descending resistance line to strengthen the current bullish momentum. At the moment, ETH is trading around $1,640, up more than 2% in the past 24 hours. The moving averages are pointing upward, and the RSI is in positive territory—both signs that buyers currently have the advantage. If they can keep the price above the descending resistance line, ETH might make a strong move toward the important $2,000 level in the coming hours. On the other hand, if sellers want to regain control, they’ll need to push the price below the EMA20 trend line. If that happens, Ether could drop toward $1,384—a key support level. A break below that could signal a short-term shift in momentum in favor of the bears.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 19:49:03

The K-Community is known for its dynamic and trend-setting influence in the digital asset space. Last week, between April 4th and 10th, Bitcoin World, a leading platform for crypto enthusiasts, delved into the heart of the Korean crypto conversation to uncover the tokens that were not just talked about, but actively sought after. Let’s dive into the fascinating insights revealing the Korean crypto trends and see which digital assets reigned supreme in search queries and community mentions. What Fuels the Korean Crypto Trends? Top Searched Cryptocurrencies Search volume is a powerful indicator of investor interest and potential market movements. When a cryptocurrency sees a surge in searches within the K-Community crypto space, it often signals growing curiosity, investment consideration, or even anticipation of price fluctuations. Here’s a breakdown of the top 10 most searched tokens in the Korean crypto sphere last week: Rank Token Search Volume 1 XRP 78,127 2 UXLINK 34,468 3 ETH 29,064 4 BTC 26,689 5 AERGO 15,634 6 SOL 13,367 7 ONDO 12,430 8 NEO 10,106 9 DOGE 6,801 10 ARDR 5,544 Key Takeaways from Search Data: XRP Dominance: XRP leads by a significant margin, indicating sustained interest and potentially ongoing discussions around its regulatory status or upcoming developments. UXLINK’s Surprise Surge: UXLINK, while less mainstream, shows a remarkably high search volume, suggesting a potential emerging trend or community focus on this token. Blue Chips Still in the Game: Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) remain strong contenders, proving their enduring popularity and foundational role in the crypto ecosystem. Diverse Altcoin Interest: The list showcases a diverse range of altcoins, from established projects like Solana (SOL) and NEO to newer entrants like ONDO and AERGO, reflecting the varied investment appetites within the crypto market Korea . Beyond Search: What’s Being Discussed in the K-Community? Most Mentioned Tokens While search volume reveals what people are looking for, mentions highlight what they are actively discussing and engaging with. Tracking token mentions provides a glimpse into the sentiment, narratives, and trending conversations within the most mentioned crypto Korea landscape. Here are the top 10 mentioned tokens in the K-Community: Rank Token Mention Count 1 BTC 1,671 2 ETH 1,017 3 TRUMP 738 4 XRP 348 5 SOL 236 6 UXLINK 193 7 AERGO 146 8 FIL 66 9 DOGE 57 10 ONDO 57 Insights from Mention Data: Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead the Conversation: BTC and ETH dominate mentions, reflecting their status as market leaders and core subjects of discussion across the crypto space, including the top searched crypto Korea community. TRUMP Token Enters the Fray: The appearance of the TRUMP token in the top mentions is noteworthy. It suggests that meme coins or politically themed tokens can quickly capture community attention and spark conversations, even within a relatively short timeframe. XRP Still Relevant in Discussions: While search volume for XRP is exceptionally high, its mention count is lower, suggesting that while people are searching for XRP, the active discussion around it might be less intense compared to BTC or ETH. UXLINK and AERGO Maintain Presence: UXLINK and AERGO, which were prominent in search volumes, also feature in the top mentions, indicating that the initial search interest is translating into ongoing community discussions and engagement. FIL Makes an Appearance: Filecoin (FIL) enters the top 10 mentioned tokens, suggesting growing interest in decentralized storage solutions or specific developments within the Filecoin ecosystem. Decoding the K-Community Crypto Landscape: What Does It All Mean? Analyzing both search and mention data provides a more nuanced understanding of the K-Community crypto trends. Here are some actionable insights: XRP: High Interest, Moderate Discussion: The high search volume for XRP, coupled with a lower mention count compared to BTC and ETH, could indicate a ‘wait-and-see’ approach. Investors might be researching XRP due to anticipation of legal outcomes or potential price movements, but the active community conversation might be more focused on broader market trends or other tokens. UXLINK and AERGO: Emerging Contenders? The strong presence of UXLINK and AERGO in both search and mention lists suggests these tokens are gaining traction within the Korean crypto community. Investors and enthusiasts should keep a close eye on these projects for potential growth and development. BTC and ETH: The Pillars of Crypto Conversation: The consistent dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum in both metrics reinforces their position as the foundational assets of the crypto market. They remain central to discussions, investment strategies, and overall market sentiment. Meme Coin Mania (TRUMP): The inclusion of TRUMP token in the mention list highlights the unpredictable nature of the crypto market and the power of meme culture to drive interest and conversation, even for tokens with less fundamental utility. Stay Ahead of the Curve in the Korean Crypto Market Keeping a pulse on the crypto market Korea requires more than just watching global trends. Understanding the specific interests and conversations within influential communities like the K-Community can provide a significant edge. By tracking search volumes and mention counts, as Bitcoin World has done, you gain valuable insights into potential market movers and emerging trends. This data-driven approach helps you navigate the dynamic world of cryptocurrency with greater clarity and make more informed decisions. In conclusion, last week’s data from the Korean crypto community reveals a fascinating blend of established giants like BTC and ETH, resurgent interest in XRP, and the rise of intriguing altcoins like UXLINK and AERGO. Monitoring these trends is crucial for anyone looking to understand the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and capitalize on emerging opportunities within the vibrant Korean market.

Following the incident, Odin’s Dog (ODINDOG), a meme coin native to the platform, saw its price crash by over 55% in the last six hours. The Hack and Immediate Fallout The chaos began early Monday when Bodily took to X to report that his personal Odin.fun account had been compromised. “My ODIN•FUN account was hacked,” the Bitcoin educator wrote. “Working on it. More info as soon as I can,” he added. When a user asked him to clarify the extent of the breach, he responded, “Just ODIN•FUN account that I can see so far.” However, fears quickly escalated as the platform paused all trading and withdrawals, a move similar to those of other platforms that have been targeted by hacks in the past. PeckShield, a well-regarded blockchain security tracker, added fuel to the fire, reporting through its X account that Bodily’s wallet, labeled as the Odin.fun deployer, had liquidated its entire ODINDOG position worth more than $178,000. This liquidation seems to have intensified market panic even more, leading to further selloff. As of this writing, the meme coin is down 57.6% in 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.1808, per Odin.fun. On CoinGecko, the token has plummeted from a 24-hour high of $0.3309 to a new all-time low of $0.1894, an 89.3% drop from its all-time high of $1.78 recorded last month. Recurring Security Crisis The crypto community was quick to react, with some expressing sympathy and others skepticism. Additionally, a number raised questions about Odin.fun’s broader security, with one user stating, “Funds SAFETY is the key question now,” echoing concerns from users and investors waiting for a clear explanation regarding the status of their assets on the platform. The incident is not isolated, coming almost two months after the crypto industry witnessed the largest heist in its history when Bybit suffered a $1.4 billion hack attributed to the notorious North Korea-linked criminal organization Lazarus Group. Elsewhere, lending protocol zkLend was also exploited , but on a much smaller scale, losing $4.9 million to an attacker who later ironically claimed to have lost the stolen funds in a phishing scam.

Tether to Deploy Hashrate on OCEAN, Advancing Decentralized Bitcoin Mining Infrastructure Learn more: https://t.co/QVzLawzvwK — Tether (@Tether_to) April 14, 2025 In a post on April 14, Tether said it is deepening its commitment to supporting decentralization, transparency, and censorship resistance. OCEAN will give users a different approach to mining by allowing miners to generate their own block templates using the open-source DATUM protocol. This eliminates reliance on centralized intermediaries and enhances the Bitcoin network’s resilience against censorship. Tether’s hashrate deployment will use OCEAN’s DATUM Gateway software, which is engineered for mining operations. “As a company committed to financial freedom and open access, we see supporting decentralization in Bitcoin mining as essential to the network’s long-term integrity,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “Deploying hashrate to OCEAN aligns with both our mining investments and our broader mission to fortify Bitcoin against centralizing forces.” Global and Rural Expansion Tether plans to integrate OCEAN’s DATUM Gateway across its mining operations worldwide, particularly in rural and underserved regions such as parts of Africa. The software enables local generation of block templates and aggregates thousands of mining rigs with low-latency connections, ensuring global competitiveness while enhancing geographic and operational diversity. “Tether’s decision to mine on OCEAN reflects months of deep technical evaluation,” said Giv Zanganeh, VP of Mining & Energy at Tether. “We believe the DATUM protocol is the software stack most aligned with Bitcoin’s decentralization ethos. Its architecture allows us to achieve reliable connectivity even in low-bandwidth regions, expanding the reach and resilience of our infrastructure.” The move has been warmly welcomed by the OCEAN team. “Tether’s involvement is a strong signal that decentralization remains a core priority for Bitcoin’s future,” said Luke Dashjr, Chairman and CTO of OCEAN. “Their participation underscores the value of open, censorship-resistant mining protocols.” This development also complements Tether’s expanding footprint in Africa. The company is actively investing in both mining infrastructure and crypto education. A recent partnership with Quidax has seen the rollout of a major digital asset literacy initiative across Nigeria and other African nations, helping millions gain access to financial tools powered by blockchain. Tether Considers U.S.-Only Stablecoin Tether is considering launching a U.S.-only version of its token if the Trump administration introduces favorable regulations to support domestic stablecoin development. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, revealed in an interview with the Financial Times that discussions are underway with U.S. regulators regarding the framework for stablecoins, which are digital tokens typically pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. According to Ardoino, the administration views stablecoins as a major financial instrument for the U.S. economy.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. DeepSeek AI has chosen Lightchain AI, a sub-$0.50 altcoin, over XRP as 2025’s unique market opportunity. Table of Contents Why DeepSeek AI is betting on Lightchain AI Can Lightchain AI really outperform XRP? What DeepSeek AI’s choice says about Lightchain AI’s potential As the crypto landscape evolves, institutional players and AI-driven researchers are rethinking their portfolios. DeepSeek AI, known for its data-backed market insights, has reportedly shifted focus toward a lesser-known altcoin priced under $0.50 — diverting attention from traditional giants like XRP. While XRP’s long-standing presence still commands respect, newer blockchains are increasingly being recognized for their forward-thinking potential. One of these emerging contenders is Lightchain AI, a presale-stage altcoin currently attracting significant investor interest. With $18.9 million already raised and priced at $0.007 in Stage 15, Lightchain AI offers early access to a decentralized AI ecosystem built for scalable, privacy-first computation. As DeepSeek AI zeroes in on disruptive opportunities for 2025, the market is asking whether these next-gen tokens could outpace their older counterparts when the next bull run arrives. Why DeepSeek AI is betting on Lightchain AI Lightchain AI signals a new wave in blockchain technology by combining intelligent automation with decentralized AI execution. DeepSeek AI’s shift hints that Lightchain AI is set to be one of the most influential projects, catching the eyes of investors and innovators alike. By enabling AI to operate directly on-chain and introducing decentralized decision-making structures, Lightchain AI is laying the groundwork for a smarter, more autonomous blockchain future. Backing this kind of tech suggests a coming boom in AI-blockchain fusion, where decision-making becomes faster, smarter, and automated. As a result, AI-driven platforms like Lightchain AI are gaining momentum as leaders in the industry. You might also like: Emerging crypto Lightchain AI predicted to surpass SHIB with a 23,476% surge Can Lightchain AI really outperform XRP? The idea that a low-priced altcoin like Lightchain AI could outperform XRP might seem bold, but market history favours disruptors. Priced at $0.007 in its current presale stage, Lightchain AI provides a significantly lower barrier to entry for investors seeking high-upside opportunities. XRP, by contrast, has already priced in years of development, partnerships, and legal battles, limiting its room to exponentially grow. Lightchain AI, with a clear technical roadmap and decentralized governance architecture, stands at the beginning of its growth curve. If it delivers on scheduled rollouts like mainnet launch and ecosystem expansion, it could attract massive capital. For early backers, even a fraction of the projected gains could surpass what XRP offers over the same period. What DeepSeek AI’s choice says about Lightchain AI’s potential When an advanced analytics firm like DeepSeek AI puts its weight behind a new altcoin, it signals more than just a hunch — it suggests a data-backed conviction in the project’s long-term viability. Choosing Lightchain AI over XRP points to a shift in priorities from legacy blockchain functionality to future-facing use cases. DeepSeek AI likely recognises the broader appeal of Lightchain AI’s decentralized AI infrastructure, which addresses privacy, computation, and governance in one ecosystem. This choice highlights the rising market appetite for utility-driven projects capable of supporting emerging technologies. Lightchain AI’s technical capacity to integrate AI processing directly into blockchain workflows may position it as a critical tool for decentralized innovation in the coming years. DeepSeek AI’s move could prompt other institutional players to reevaluate where real growth potential lies. For more information on Lightchain AI, visit the website , whitepaper , X , or Telegram .

Waller's statements indicate that he has a more dovish stance than the general discourse within the FED. Waller considered two different scenarios in the context of current economic conditions and the potential impact of trade tariffs in particular: a high-tax scenario and a low-tax scenario, Timiraos reported. High Tariff Scenario: Inflation Temporary, Recession Risk More Significant According to Waller, if the average 25% tariffs remain in place, this could cause core PCE inflation to rise to 4% to 5% in 2025. However, Waller argues that this effect will be temporary and that the Fed can “look past” such temporary inflationary pressures, citing the continuation of the tight monetary policy stance, stable inflation expectations and the significant slowdown in the economy that is putting pressure on prices. Waller stated that in this scenario, the Fed could cut interest rates earlier and more rapidly than expected if necessary, and said, “When the economy is slowing down rapidly, even if inflation remains above 2%, the risk of a recession outweighs the risk of a short-term increase in inflation.” Referring to the policy mistakes in the 2021-2022 period, Waller said, “It would not be right to completely ignore similar analyses just because things did not go as expected in that period.” Related News: Binance Has Listed 27 Altcoins Since The Beginning Of This Year: Only Three of them experienced an Upturn - Here is the List Low Duty Scenario: Less Inflationary Pressure, More Limited Intervention Waller, who stated that in the case of a more moderate trade policy, that is, if only the basic 10% tariffs were maintained and the others were removed, the increase in inflation would be much more limited, in which case the peak inflation rate would remain around 3% on an annual basis. He stated that in this scenario, inflationary effects could emerge more slowly but could also be longer lasting. In this context, Waller said that the FED's interest rate cut pressure may decrease and the monetary policy response may remain limited, and noted that if there is more evidence that inflation is moving towards the 2% target in the second half of the year, interest rate cuts may be on the agenda again. According to Timiraos’ analysis, Waller’s statements show that he has a more flexible approach than the “low inflation determination” line that dominates the Fed. While most other members adopt a more hawkish stance in order to keep inflation expectations under control, Waller sees the risk of an economic slowdown as a more pressing threat. *This is not investment advice.

If confirmed, this setup could mark the end of the current downtrend and open the door to a bullish expansion targeting $25. The most critical level to watch is Hyperliquid’s ( HYPE ) neckline resistance at $17.17. A break above this neckline, especially when accompanied by surging volume, would validate the pattern and likely trigger a bullish expansion. The projected target sits at $25.05, calculated by measuring the depth of the head to the neckline and applying that distance above the breakout. Key points covered in this article: The structure of the inverse head and shoulders forming on HYPE Key neckline resistance at $17.17, and the role of volume confirmation A bullish technical target of $25.05, with invalidation at the current swing low Source: TradingView HYPE has already formed a well-defined left shoulder and a deep head, indicating a strong retracement and potential bottoming formation. As the price starts to climb from the most recent low, the next step is the formation of a higher low, which would mark the right shoulder. Once complete, this structure signals a potential trend reversal and accumulation phase. The neckline at $17.17 is the key breakout level. A clean move above it, especially on above-average or spiking volume, is essential to confirm the pattern’s validity. Volume is a critical filter—it helps distinguish real breakouts from fakeouts. Traders should monitor the volume profile closely as price approaches this area. A strong breakout above $17.17 opens the path toward the $25.05 target. You might also like: Bitcoin price targets new all-time high in emerging Shark Harmonic setup On the downside, the swing low—the lowest point of the head—remains the invalidation level for this setup. A break below that low invalidates the pattern, and any bullish bias should be reconsidered. However, if the right shoulder forms and holds, this zone offers a strong risk-reward entry ahead of a potential breakout. How to trade this pattern: Wait for a higher low to form (the right shoulder), signaling bullish structure. Enter early on strength in that region, or wait for confirmation. Confirmation comes with a close above $17.17 and rising volume. The target is $25.05 based on the measured move. Set invalidation below the current swing low for risk management.

However, a late-week price rebound helped lift total assets under management (AuM) from their lowest point on April 8 (the lowest since early November 2024) to US$130bn, marking an 8% increase following President Trump’s temporary reversal of the economically calamitous tariffs.” Source: CoinShares Bitcoin ( BTC ) was the biggest bleeder, letting $751 million in outflows last week alone. Ethereum ( ETH ) products lost $37.6 million over the same period. Solana ( SOL ), AAVE and SUI products lost $5.1 million, $0.78 million and $0.58 million, each. However, some altcoins did see minor inflows. “Smaller altcoin saw minor inflows led by XRP with inflows of 3.5m, while Ondo, Algorand and Avalanche saw inflows of US$0.46m, US$0.25m and US$0.25m respectively.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

A new protocol, Babylon chain, could change the BTC DeFi landscape by providing staking rewards in native Bitcoin terms without involving wrapped tokens or third-party bridges. A recent Nansen report introduces Babylon as potentially the most underappreciated Bitcoin DeFi gamble, citing its groundbreaking approach to restaking. Native BTC Staking Without Custodial Risk Babylon allows users to “lock” their BTC into a script on the Bitcoin blockchain and enjoy what it calls “Bitcoin restaking.” The platform avoids third-party custodians and bridges, securing users’ money while still giving them a chance for yield. The protocol utilizes a Cosmos SDK transaction to lock in the BTC deposit, and then staking rewards are dispensed proportionately in BABY tokens and BTC. Where the Rewards Come From Although Bitcoin does not natively provide staking, Babylon rewards participation with BABY token inflation—8% per year. Half of this rewards BTC stakers and half rewards holders of the BABY token. Bitcoin stakers receive a new yield mechanism without sacrificing custody, and BABY holders bet on the token’s appreciation being higher than inflation. This aligns incentives for both token holders and Bitcoin users. Bitcoin DeFi Is Growing—Fast The broader Bitcoin DeFi economy is growing incredibly rapidly. In December 2024, it peaked at a record high near $8 billion in total value locked (TVL) and continues to exceed $5 billion as of this writing, illustrating a 500% year-over-year increase. This momentum is a reflection of growing demand from users and developers for DeFi platforms built on the brand, user base, and unmatched security model of Bitcoin.

The regulator delayed a decision on whether it will allow in-kind redemptions for WisdomTree’s Bitcoin Fund (BTCW) and VanEck's Bitcoin Fund (BITB) and Ethereum Fund (ETHW) on Monday. It also moved its deadline for a decision in regards to a proposal by Grayscale to allow staking its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and Mini Ethereum Trust (ETH), which the asset manager’s exchange, NYSE Arca had requested in February. Cboe, the exchange that is associated with five of the other issuers of an ether ETF, including Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, VanEck and Invesco/Galaxy, submitted its amended filing in March for the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Franklin Ethereum ETF (EZET). The SEC has not previously allowed staking in spot ether ETFs. But with the appointment of new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who was confirmed by the Senate last week, things could change quickly. Several other jurisdictions, including Hong Kong, Canada and Europe, have already green-lighted staking for ETFs, but that doesn’t put much pressure on the SEC, said one expert. “The SEC will take their time and move as fast or as slow as they want,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They don’t care what other regulators are doing in my experience, they might learn from them but I don’t think a regulator approving something is going to make the SEC jump through hoops and catch up.

Experts Predict 1400% Price Increase,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/price-prediction-dogecoin-doge-or-ruvi-ai-ruvi-experts-predict-1400-price-increase/,"The crypto space is hot and one name that keeps popping up in conversations is Ruvi AI (RUVI) . This blockchain and AI powered project is gaining traction and analysts and experts are predicting a 1400% surge in its value. With a presale price of only $0.01 per token and a series of incentives to reward early investors, Ruvi AI is making a strong case as one of the top cryptocurrencies to buy right now, attracting even old school Dogecoin investors. While many projects are all hype, Ruvi AI is different. It’s bringing real world utility and AI integration to the forefront. It’s not just a token, it’s a vision for the future of decentralized AI. If you want to ride the next big wave in crypto, Ruvi AI might just be the project to do it for you. The presale got investors attention fast and reached its first milestone in just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. Why Ruvi AI is a Game Changer Ruvi AI isn’t like other altcoins that pop up and fade away. This project is built on blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to solve real problems and create meaningful applications. Ruvi AI’s platform is an AI powered superapp that allows users to generate text, images, video and even audio. Ruvi AI has reached a major milestone with the launch of its beta, a big deal since most crypto projects are still just promises. The beta allows users to try out the AI superapp for themselves, which combines blockchain with AI to generate text, images, audio and video. This is more than just progress, it’s a sign of intent to deliver real world utility. Users are already playing with the beta and it’s got features from seamless content generation to premium AI services for creatives and businesses. The beta is also the testing ground for future updates so the full version will be smooth post launch. Plus the $RUVI token has real value within the ecosystem. It fuels activities such as unlocking premium features, staking for rewards and participating in governance decisions. This utility, combined with the presale price of $0.01 makes Ruvi a steal for early adopters. Ruvi AI’s Bonuses Amplify Profits One of the best parts of Ruvi AI’s presale is the bonus system. Investors who contribute big can increase their holdings even more with the platform’s tiered rewards structure. For example, anyone who buys 500,000 tokens during the presale gets the VIP 5 Tier Bonus which is an additional 500,000 tokens. So a $5,000 investment would get you 1,000,000 tokens. With a projected listing price of $0.07 per token, the initial investment would be $70,000, that’s 14x ROI right out of the gate. If after launch Ruvi AI’s price hits $0.15 per token, that allocation would be worth $150,000. Long term investors looking for a conservative $1 projection would see their holdings jump to $1,000,000. But the bonus system doesn’t stop there. Ruvi AI also rewards contributors with its competitive Leaderboard Rewards program . Top contributors can earn additional tokens from 75,000 to 500,000 bonus tokens depending on their contribution level. This system not only rewards bigger investments but also creates a sense of urgency and competition, two key drivers for the project’s growing popularity. Experts Predict Big Returns for Ruvi AI The crypto world isn’t just speculating about Ruvi AI’s potential; it’s backing it up with data. Blockchain technology analyst says, “Ruvi AI is perfectly positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for decentralized AI tools. With its cutting edge technology, utility and early investment incentives it could see returns rival some of the biggest breakout projects in crypto.” According to industry forecasts Ruvi AI’s tokens could reach $0.15 per token after launch , that’s a 1400% increase from the presale price. This kind of growth is what we saw in the early days of other major cryptocurrencies. For long term projections, a crypto economist think Ruvi AI could hit $1 per token by the end of the year. He says, “Ruvi AI’s ability to integrate AI into blockchain applications means it serves multiple industries, which makes $1 per token not just possible but probable.”For investors this looks good. A $1,000 investment during the presale would get you 100,000 RUVI tokens . At $0.15 those tokens would be worth $15,000. But if Ruvi AI reaches its $1 long term potential that same $1,000 investment could be worth $100,000 . Why Analysts Are Betting Big on Ruvi AI One of the reasons Ruvi AI stands out is its practical use case . Unlike tokens that are just speculation, Ruvi is solving real problems by combining blockchain and AI for personal and business use. Ruvi AI’s infrastructure is designed to power multiple industries from digital marketing to entertainment, making it more than just a token but a platform for decentralized innovation. Analysts see this as a catalyst for long term growth, both in adoption and token value. At the same time Ruvi AI’s $0.01 presale price is being compared to the early days of projects like Ethereum and Binance Coin. Both started as underutilized assets before growing into major players. Experts think Ruvi AI could follow the same path as investors start to take notice of its unique value proposition. Don’t Wait The crypto market rewards those who act fast on high potential investments and Ruvi AI’s presale is the ultimate test case for this principle. The $0.01 entry point is unbeatable and the VIP bonuses and leaderboard rewards add extra value to early stage participation. If you’ve been looking for the next big crypto project Ruvi AI offers low risk entry and massive upside. At its core Ruvi is more than an investment; it’s a project that will make waves in the blockchain and AI space for years to come.

While Tron (TRX) trading at $0.24 and Ripple (XRP) at $2 continue to capture investor attention, there’s an emerging token that’s starting to steal the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a new player in the DeFi space, is quickly becoming the talk of the town, with many predicting it could soon rival the likes of TRX and XRP in both value and utility. The project has managed to secure over $6.65 million from investors. Over 8200 holders have entered the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale during phase 4 due to the system plans to double its price from $0.025 to $0.03. Those starting to invest now during this phase will earn 140% return at the launch price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance: The Next DeFi Giant to Watch Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector at a rapid pace with its game-changing dual-lending technology, which has experienced phenomenal growth. During its presale phase, the project was so attractive to over 8,200 investors who collectively invested $6.65 million, envisioning its future. During its ongoing Phase 4, the Mutuum Finance Token is priced at $0.025, but there is an assurance of a 20% surge in its value during the upcoming Phase 5. As part of enhancing the user experience, Mutuum launched a new dashboard that has the leader board of the top 50 holders. The users who feature in the leader board will be rewarded with bonus tokens. Revolutionary Dual-Model Technology Revolutionizing DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi space with its revolutionary combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P model offers users passive earnings in the form of participation in USDT liquidity pools, courtesy of smart contracts that automate borrowing. The P2C model, however, allows for direct lending relationships devoid of intermediaries and user capital is kept secure. Combining these two models, Mutuum Finance offers a solution that equilibrates safety, efficacy, and decentralization, posing a robust possibility for investors wishing to attain high-yield earnings. Investor Rewards and Community Growth Mutuum Finance continues expanding its community with profitable rewards. As part of its token giveaway campaign of $100,000, 10 lucky members will receive $10,000 each in Mutuum Finance tokens. It also has a referral program that rewards users for bringing in new members. Early adopters also enjoy special advantages through staking pools, voting rights for governance, and VIP updates, which reward long-term dedication to the project. Sustainable Tokenomics for Future Growth Mutuum Finance has established a well-organized tokenomics system that controls the release of tokens and ensures long-term price stability. The deflationary forces of the project, especially during presale phases, create scarcity, positioning Mutuum Finance for future price appreciation. The staking functionality of the platform also provides high incentive rewards, encouraging active participation while maintaining a healthy, sustainable ecosystem in the years to come. Tron (TRX) and Ripple (XRP) may remain staples in the crypto world, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly becoming a serious performer. With $6.65 million raised and over 8,200 investors already on board, its price of $0.025 in Phase 4 offers a rare opportunity before it rises 20% to $0.03 in Phase 5. A projected 140% ROI at launch makes MUTM one of the most promising altcoins heading into 2025. Get in early and join the Mutuum Finance presale now and position yourself for what could be crypto’s next big breakout.

Recently, the Swiss franc (CHF) has shown remarkable strength, catching the attention of market analysts worldwide. Bank of America (BofA) has pointed towards market deleveraging as a key factor behind this surge. But what does this mean for you, the crypto-savvy investor and Forex enthusiast? Let’s dive into the intricacies of CHF’s impressive performance and what it signals for the broader financial landscape. Why is the Swiss Franc (CHF) Showing Such Astonishing Strength? The Swiss franc has long been considered a safe-haven currency, a refuge for investors during times of global economic uncertainty. Its current strength, however, seems to be more than just typical safe-haven appeal. BofA analysts suggest that market deleveraging is playing a significant role. But what exactly is market deleveraging, and how does it boost the CHF? Market deleveraging essentially refers to the process of reducing debt or leverage within the financial system. When investors become risk-averse, they tend to unwind their leveraged positions, selling off riskier assets and seeking safer alternatives. This often leads to: Increased demand for safe-haven assets: In times of market stress, currencies like the Swiss franc and the US dollar typically see increased demand. Repatriation of funds: Investors may bring their capital back to their home countries or regions perceived as stable, further boosting demand for currencies like the CHF. Reduced risk appetite: As investors deleverage, their appetite for riskier investments, including some cryptocurrencies and emerging market assets, diminishes. BofA’s analysis highlights that the current Swiss Franc (CHF) strength is not solely due to traditional safe-haven flows but is significantly amplified by this deleveraging process. This suggests a deeper shift in market sentiment and risk perception. Decoding Market Deleveraging: What Does It Mean for Forex Traders? Understanding market deleveraging is vital for anyone involved in Forex trading. Here’s a breakdown of what it implies and how it can impact your trading strategies: Aspect Impact of Market Deleveraging Implications for Forex Traders Currency Valuations Safe-haven currencies like CHF tend to appreciate. Potential opportunities to go long on CHF pairs, especially against riskier currencies. Volatility Increased market volatility, especially in the initial phases of deleveraging. Requires careful risk management and potentially wider stop-loss orders. Carry Trades Unwinding of carry trades as investors reduce risk. Currencies funding carry trades (often lower-yielding ones like CHF in the past) may strengthen. Global Liquidity Potential tightening of global liquidity as leverage is reduced. May lead to increased sensitivity to economic data and central bank announcements. For Forex traders, recognizing the signs of market deleveraging can provide valuable insights into potential currency movements and help in adjusting trading strategies accordingly. It’s about staying informed and adapting to the evolving market dynamics. The Role of BofA’s Analysis in Understanding CHF’s Ascent Bank of America’s (BofA) note on the Swiss Franc (CHF) strength provides a crucial perspective. Their analysis isn’t just stating the obvious; it’s delving into the underlying mechanics driving the CHF’s performance. By highlighting market deleveraging , BofA offers a more nuanced understanding than simply attributing it to traditional safe-haven demand. Here’s why BofA’s insight is particularly valuable: Deeper Understanding: It goes beyond surface-level explanations, offering a structural reason for CHF appreciation. Forward-Looking Perspective: Understanding deleveraging can help anticipate future market movements and potential continued CHF strength. Strategic Trading Decisions: For traders, this analysis can inform more strategic decisions, moving beyond reactive trading to proactive positioning. BofA’s analysis serves as a reminder of the importance of fundamental analysis in Forex and crypto markets. It’s not just about technical indicators; understanding macroeconomic forces and institutional analysis is equally, if not more, important. How Does Swiss Franc Strength Impact the Cryptocurrency Market? While seemingly distinct, the Forex and cryptocurrency markets are increasingly interconnected. The Swiss Franc strength , driven by market deleveraging , can indirectly influence the crypto space in several ways: Risk Sentiment Proxy: CHF strength can be seen as a barometer of overall risk sentiment. A strong CHF often indicates risk aversion, which can negatively impact riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Capital Flows: In a deleveraging environment, investors might reduce exposure to both traditional risky assets and cryptocurrencies, favoring safer havens. Correlation Dynamics: While not always direct, there can be shifts in correlations between CHF pairs and certain cryptocurrencies during periods of deleveraging. For example, if investors are broadly risk-off, both CHF and perhaps certain ‘stable’ cryptocurrencies might see inflows, while more volatile cryptos could face selling pressure. Macroeconomic Context: CHF strength reflects broader macroeconomic concerns. These concerns – be it inflation, recession risks, or geopolitical instability – can also directly impact the cryptocurrency market’s trajectory. Therefore, cryptocurrency investors should also pay attention to signals from the Forex market, including the strength of currencies like the Swiss Franc (CHF) . It provides a broader context to navigate the often-turbulent crypto seas. Actionable Insights: Leveraging CHF Strength and Market Deleveraging for Smarter Trading So, how can traders and investors use this knowledge of Swiss Franc strength and market deleveraging to their advantage? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor CHF Pairs: Keep a close watch on CHF pairs, especially CHF/JPY, EUR/CHF, and GBP/CHF. Breakouts or breakdowns in these pairs can signal shifts in deleveraging pressures. Assess Risk Sentiment: Use CHF strength as an indicator of risk sentiment. A consistently strengthening CHF might suggest a broader risk-off environment, prompting adjustments in your portfolio. Diversify Safe Havens: Consider adding CHF exposure to your portfolio as a diversifier, especially during periods of anticipated market volatility. Stay Informed on BofA and Analyst Views: Keep track of analyses from institutions like BofA and other reputable financial analysts to get deeper insights into market dynamics and potential deleveraging trends. Refine Risk Management: In a deleveraging environment, robust risk management is paramount. Adjust position sizes and use appropriate stop-loss levels to protect your capital. By understanding the drivers behind Swiss Franc (CHF) strength , particularly market deleveraging , you can make more informed trading and investment decisions, navigating market volatility with greater confidence. Conclusion: The Enduring Power of the Swiss Franc in a Shifting Global Landscape The astonishing strength of the Swiss Franc (CHF) , as highlighted by BofA’s analysis of market deleveraging , is more than just a fleeting market anomaly. It’s a signal of deeper shifts in global financial flows and risk perception. For Forex and cryptocurrency traders, understanding these dynamics is powerful . The CHF’s performance offers a valuable lens through which to view broader market sentiment and anticipate potential future movements. By staying informed, adaptable, and strategically leveraging insights from institutions like BofA, you can navigate the complexities of the financial markets with greater acumen and potentially unlock new opportunities in this ever-evolving landscape.

In a new video update, Gromen says that if the White House truly wants to reshore American manufacturing as stated , the US will have to learn to stop or at least slow down the exporting of the dollar and Treasuries. To achieve the current administration’s goal, the macro guru says the White House could allow gold to become the primary settlement asset instead of the dollar or Treasuries. A settlement asset is a financial instrument used by central banks and governments to settle a trade or monetary obligation. Gromen also says that if gold becomes the new settlement asset, investors might start to see Bitcoin as a reliable alternative. Explains Gromen, “We can export Treasuries and financial assets, or we can make stuff, but if we want to make stuff, that’s the end of the post-1971 US dollar reserve status structure. And it’s an underappreciated point. The way you get around it is you shift the settlement asset away from Treasuries to a neutral reserve asset like gold. I think that process has been started. I thought it was extraordinarily interesting and potentially important that Trump did not put tariffs on gold. He put tariffs on everything else in the world, including an island full of penguins, apparently, but not gold, which tells me that’s where we want capital to go, and that’ll weaken the dollar which, guess what, if gold goes up a bunch, it’ll strengthen the dollar system because it’l be more gold-backed and you’re going to weaken the dollar. That’s how you split the baby around Triffin’s Dilemma and a neutral reserve asset. I think Bitcoin probably benefits over time from that, too.” The Triffin’s Dilemma is a concept established by economist Robert Triffin that notes a paradox between the need of the United States to run trade deficits to supply the world with enough USD, while keeping inflation and confidence in the currency at reasonable levels.

AVAX Slips Below Support & TON Eyes Recovery,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-hits-214m-as-keynote-3-unveiled-the-next-big-phase-avax-slips-below-support-ton-eyes-recovery/,"The current Avalanche (AVAX) price forecast has brought fresh concerns, as the coin remains below the $20.00 mark, possibly sliding down to $16.25. Meanwhile, the Toncoin (TON) price analysis presents a more stable outlook, with TON maintaining support around $3.52. Both AVAX and TON have been navigating a turbulent phase in the market, facing notable price pullbacks. This has led many traders to shift their focus to more future-ready crypto projects that can withstand rough cycles. One such project drawing attention is BlockDAG (BDAG) , quickly becoming a favorite in the altcoin space. With $214 million raised so far in its ongoing presale, without any VC backing, BlockDAG is showing strong support from the market. As its global reach continues to grow, many experts now believe the network could reach its $600 million presale goal ahead of schedule. Avalanche (AVAX) Price Forecast: Will it Recover or Further Dip? AVAX has faced difficulties in recovering the $20.00 support level after a recent correction triggered a 15% weekly decline. However, many holders continue to keep their positions, helping reduce selling pressure and hinting at a possible rebound. Analysts suggest that if AVAX fails to stay above $18.27, the next potential drop could take it to $16.25. However, reclaiming $19.86 as support would indicate a more bullish trend, possibly pushing the price back towards $22.87. Toncoin (TON) Price Analysis: Will the Support Hold? While several altcoins briefly halted their downtrends before declining again, Toncoin has shown signs of holding steady. Its ongoing V-shaped recovery offers some hope for a near-term bounce. As per Toncoin’s price analysis, the key level remains $3.52. If TON dips below this, it might slide to $3.18, then $2.74, and even as low as $2.36. However, if upward momentum builds, it may challenge resistance near $4.79 and then aim for $5.66. BlockDAG Crosses $214M in Presale— Analysts Highlight 800x Upside With over $214 million raised purely through public contribution, BlockDAG has made a strong entry in the crypto space. This milestone includes the sale of 19.2 billion BDAG coins to more than 170,000 holders globally. Its Keynote 3 revealed exciting plans, as CEO Antony Turner emphasized that the funds would power development, scale operations, and advance its blockchain structure. Enhancing mainnet capabilities, increasing reliability, and boosting performance are top priorities. In addition to technical work, BlockDAG is growing its global influence and community presence. Collaborations with sports giants like Inter Milan and the UFC aim to open doors to new regions and users. These strategic partnerships will support long-term engagement and broader adoption. Already achieving over a third of its $600 million presale goal, BlockDAG is being recognized among the best crypto for the future. Currently available at $0.0248 in batch 27, projections point toward a price of $20 by 2027. That’s a possible 800x increase for early contributors. Batch 27 is nearly sold out, as experienced traders move fast to secure their share. Final Say! AVAX shows signs of a possible rebound if it manages to turn $19.86 into support, but a drop below $18.27 could lead to deeper losses. TON holds promise if it defends the $3.52 support, with growth expected above $4.79, though declines may follow if support is breached. When considering adoption, scalability, and fund inflow, BlockDAG stands ahead as the best crypto for the future . Its $214 million presale—without any external funding—marks it as the largest of its kind. With over 800x return potential and growing demand, BDAG’s current pricing in batch 27 offers a prime chance for strong gains at minimal cost.

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $20.38 Market cap $8.47B Trading volume $445.84 Circulating supply 415.85M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $20.60 24-hour low $19.38 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.84% 50-day SMA $19.95 200-day SMA $30.50 Sentiment Neutral Green days 15/30 (50%) Avalanche price analysis As of April 14, AVAX’s price rose by 1.10% in 24 hours and 10.11% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume rose by 88.41% in 24 hours showing renewed interest in trading activity. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. The William Alligator is now sleeping as AVAX volatility drops. The relative strength index is 44.76 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing rising positive momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which has broken out upwards following a major bear run that forced it to a new annual low at $14.66. Unlike the daily chart, it registers slowing negative momentum.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering after hitting an annual low of $14.66. The general market sentiment is neutral, as evident on the 1 day chart which shows AVAX is consolidating within a narrow range. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22.

It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March.

43341481,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149205,1744661430,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Google Enforces Stricter Crypto Ad Rules in Europe Under MiCA,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/google-crypto-ad-rules-europe/,"Heads up, crypto enthusiasts and businesses in Europe! If you’re involved in crypto exchanges or wallet services and rely on Google Ads to reach your audience, brace yourselves for a significant shift. Starting April 23rd, Google is tightening its grip on crypto advertising restrictions across Europe, and it’s all thanks to the EU’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. What does this mean for you? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story and what it signals for the future of crypto promotion in the region. Decoding Google’s New Crypto Policy in Europe So, what exactly is Google changing? In essence, Google is aligning its advertising policies with the European Union’s comprehensive EU crypto rules outlined in MiCA. This means that any crypto exchange or wallet provider wanting to advertise on Google platforms in Europe will now need to jump through a few more hoops. According to a Cointelegraph report , these entities will be required to: Obtain Licensing under MiCA or CASP: Businesses must be licensed under either the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework or the Crypto Asset Service Provider (CASP) framework. These frameworks are designed to regulate crypto services within the EU. Google Certification: Beyond licensing, businesses will also need to be certified by Google itself. This implies an additional layer of scrutiny to ensure compliance and legitimacy. This move is a direct response to the EU’s push for greater regulation of the crypto space, aiming to provide enhanced investor protection and market stability. But what are the implications of these stricter crypto advertising restrictions ? The Benefits of Stricter Crypto Ad Regulations While tighter regulations might initially seem like a hurdle, especially for businesses, they actually bring several potential benefits to the crypto ecosystem in Europe: Enhanced Investor Protection: MiCA and Google’s policy are ultimately geared towards protecting investors. By ensuring that only licensed and certified entities can advertise, it reduces the risk of users falling prey to fraudulent or misleading crypto promotions. Increased Market Legitimacy: Stricter rules can foster a more legitimate and trustworthy crypto market. It signals a move away from the ‘Wild West’ image that has sometimes plagued the industry, encouraging wider adoption and participation. Level Playing Field: By enforcing consistent standards across Europe, Google’s policy, driven by EU crypto rules , helps create a more level playing field for businesses. It reduces the chances of non-compliant or less reputable entities gaining an unfair advantage through advertising. Challenges and Concerns with MiCA Regulation Crypto Enforcement Despite the potential upsides, the implementation of these new rules isn’t without its challenges and has raised some concerns within the crypto community and legal circles: Compliance Burdens for Smaller Firms: Legal experts have pointed out that the new requirements could create significant compliance burdens, especially for smaller crypto firms. Navigating the licensing process and Google’s certification might be resource-intensive, potentially disadvantaging smaller players compared to larger, more established exchanges. Potential Enforcement Gaps: There are concerns about temporary enforcement gaps across different EU jurisdictions. The rollout and interpretation of MiCA might vary across member states, potentially leading to inconsistencies in how Google’s policy is applied and enforced in practice. Impact on Innovation: While regulation is necessary, overly stringent rules could stifle innovation in the crypto space. It’s crucial to strike a balance between investor protection and fostering a dynamic and evolving industry. Navigating the New Landscape of Google Crypto Policy For crypto businesses operating in Europe, adapting to Google’s updated google crypto policy is now a priority. Here are some actionable insights: Understand MiCA and CASP: Thoroughly familiarize yourself with the requirements of the MiCA and CASP frameworks to determine which licensing is applicable to your business. Initiate Licensing Process: If you haven’t already, begin the process of obtaining the necessary licensing in your relevant EU jurisdiction. Prepare for Google Certification: Stay updated on Google’s certification process and requirements. Proactively prepare the necessary documentation and compliance measures to ensure a smooth certification process. Review Advertising Strategies: Re-evaluate your current advertising strategies in light of these changes. Consider diversifying your marketing efforts beyond Google Ads to mitigate potential disruptions. Seek Legal Counsel: Engage with legal experts specializing in crypto regulations to ensure you are fully compliant and to navigate any complexities in the implementation of MiCA and Google’s policy. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Advertising in Europe Google’s decision to enforce stricter crypto ads europe rules under MiCA marks a significant step towards a more regulated crypto advertising environment in Europe. While there are challenges to navigate, the overarching goal is to create a safer and more trustworthy space for both businesses and investors. The coming months will be crucial in observing how these policies are implemented, enforced, and how the crypto industry adapts to this evolving regulatory landscape.

In an X post on April 14, the analyst shared a private client note from TD Bank, a Canadian financial institution, claiming the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) greenlighted asset managers Purpose, Evolve, CI and 3iQ to issue ETFs holding Solana ( SOL ). The OSC did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. Canada does not have a federal securities agency, with its territories and provinces applying their own securities laws. Toronto’s securities exchange is regulated by Ontario’s OSC. The ETFs are permitted to stake a portion of the SOL holdings for added yield, Balchunas said, adding that the upcoming listings are “our first look at the alt coin race.” Source: Eric Balchunas Related: SEC approves options on spot Ether ETFs Waiting on US approval The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged dozens of applications to list ETFs holding alternative cryptocurrencies, or “altcoins,” but so far has only approved funds holding spot Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) for trading. Staking is still off limits for US crypto ETFs. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said Ether ETFs could be greenlighted to start staking as soon as May , but the process may take months longer. However, investors’ demand for altcoin ETFs may be weaker than for funds holding core cryptocurrencies, Katalin Tischhauser, crypto bank Sygnum’s research head, told Cointelegraph in August. “[T]here is all this frothy excitement in the market about these ETFs coming, and no one can point to where substantial demand is going to come from,” Tischhauser told Cointelegraph. Volatility Shares’ SOL futures ETF has roughly $5 million in net assets. Source: Volatility Shares In March, asset manager Volatility Shares launched the first ETFs to track Solana’s performance using financial derivatives. Volatility Shares Solana ETF (SOLZ) has seen a lukewarm reception, attracting only around $5 million in net assets as of April 14, according to its website. “FWIW, the 2 solana ETFs in US (which track futures so not a perfect guinea pig) haven't done much. Very little in aum. The 2x XRP already has more aum than both the solana ETFs and it came out after,” Balchunas said. Balchunas added that he “[w]ouldn't read a ton into it” as a predictor for spot SOL ETFs.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/investment-giant-jpmorgan-announces-it-will-allow-opening-blockchain-deposit-accounts-in-this-currency-here-are-the-details/,"JPMorgan has expanded its blockchain-based payments offerings with the launch of British Pound (GBP)-denominated blockchain deposit accounts through its digital payments division Kinexys (formerly Onyx). JPMorgan Expands Blockchain Payments With GBP Accounts Through Kinexys The move expands the bank’s real-time payments capabilities beyond its current euro (EUR) and US dollar (USD) offerings, positioning Kinexys as a major player in the blockchain-enabled corporate finance space. In a statement shared today, JPMorgan said the new service allows clients to conduct cross-border transactions 24/7 with on-demand access to funds, weekend processing and same-day foreign exchange (FX) settlements. These features aim to increase efficiency, flexibility and speed for global businesses. “New GBP-denominated blockchain accounts enable customers to conduct seamless cross-border transactions, including 24/7 currency exchange,” JPMorgan said. With the launch of GBP, JPMorgan clients will now be able to move money between GBP, EUR and USD instantly and around the clock, removing the constraints of traditional banking hours. London Stock Exchange Group’s SwapAgent and global commodities trading giant Trafigura were the first clients to adopt the new accounts. SwapAgent is incorporating blockchain deposit accounts into a pilot for digital post-trade reconciliation services. “Integrating Kinexys’ innovative digital payments into SwapAgent can enable us to operate beyond traditional branch closing hours,” said Nathan Ondyak, CEO of SwapAgent.

Apple (AAPL) shares gained after analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded the stock from Underweight to Sector Weight, citing optimism tied to the tariff exemption. The research firm noted that the worst-case tariff scenario is off the table – at least for now. “We’ve taken some dry powder and put it to work last week,” said Robinhood’s Stephanie Guild on CNBC. “But we also haven’t fully removed it because we think diversification is important—not only away from the dollar, but also just being cautious and balancing between low-volatility stocks and growth stocks. There’s a put now—I think that’s been confirmed—and that’s actually really helpful.” Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) fell more than six points on Monday, while U.S. Treasuries dipped lower, both signs typically seen as supportive for equities.

Cardano Is Currently Trading Inside A Descending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a pattern forming in the 3-day price of Cardano. The pattern in question is the Descending Channel from TA, which occurs when an asset observes consolidation toward a net downside between two parallel trendlines. The top line tracks successive lower highs in the price and the bottom one lower lows. When the cryptocurrency is inside the channel, it’s probable to encounter resistance at the former and support at the latter. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks & Whales Show Highest Growth Since Feb: Confidence Returning? In the scenario that either of these levels don’t hold up during a retest, the asset can witness a breakout in that direction. This means that a surge above the channel can be a bullish sign, while a fall under it a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Descending Channel that the 3-day price of Cardano has been trading inside for the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, Cardano found a rebound near the bottom of the channel earlier in the month, although it didn’t actually go low enough to make a proper retest of it. Since the recovery, the 3-day price of the cryptocurrency has returned to the midway line of the channel, situated at around $0.63. During the last few months, the coin has interacted several times with this line, with the latest instance being last month. Back then, the asset initially found support at the level, but before long, the downtrend resumed and it fell below. With ADA once again retesting this line, it will be interesting to see what trend follows this time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance: BTC’s MVRV Outpaces ETH’s For Record 812 Days If Cardano ends up losing the line and a decline takes place, then the asset’s next destination could be the $0.54 mark, according to Martinez. Such a drop would mean a decrease of almost 17% from the current spot price. Like the Descending Channel, there is also a pattern in TA known as the Ascending Channel. This one naturally occurs when the consolidation is toward the upside instead. As the analyst has pointed out in another X post, XRP has been trading inside such a channel in the short term. “XRP is trading within an ascending triangle, with key resistance at $2.22,” notes Martinez. “A breakout could spark a move toward $2.40.” ADA Price At the time of writing, Cardano is trading around $0.65, up around 20% in the last week.

To read full editions, subscribe . Solana DeFi has matured rapidly in recent years. But even as core behaviors like high-speed trading, airdrop farming and multi-leg strategies gain traction, many users still face infrastructure built for slower, passive chains. And while recent attention has turned toward liquid restaking, most new LRTs are functionally yield wrappers with limited composability. That leaves users in a situation where they must either sacrifice liquidity for returns or forgo yield entirely to participate in DeFi strategies. Blueprint Finance, the team behind the Ethereum-based Concrete protocol, saw an opportunity. After quietly acquiring Jet Protocol’s Solana-native lending platform last October, they’ve spent months rebuilding it from the ground up — not just as a lending platform, but as a full-stack liquidity engine for active Solana users. The result is Glow Finance: a rebranded and re-engineered protocol that officially launches today on Solana mainnet. It’s introducing a composable, margin-first architecture explicitly built for Solana’s high-speed trading environment. According to the team, Glow Finance enables non-custodial margin accounts with integrated adapters that allow users to borrow, lend and trade — all within a single wallet-controlled interface. These margin accounts are programmable and modular, offering sub-account functionality similar to what power users expect from centralized exchanges. Glow Finance introduces several key primitives that form the backbone of its trading-first architecture. At the core are Margin Accounts, or fully onchain, multi-strategy accounts that allow users to deposit assets, earn passive yield, and simultaneously use those assets as collateral. To enable composability across the Solana ecosystem, Glow integrates Adapters. These protocol-level connectors plug into Solana-native DEXs like Jupiter, letting users deploy leveraged strategies without jumping between platforms. According to Glow Finance, this allows users to route trades and deploy capital within a native environment, eliminating the friction of switching platforms or manually managing positions. These primitives pair with the launch of a new asset called $glowSOL: a liquid restaking token that will earn yield through Solayer’s mega validator while acting as an entry point into the broader ecosystem. “Early $glowSOL users will have influence in governance over the Glow Finance protocol as well as first access to new features. We see $glowSOL as the optimal entry into the Glow Finance ecosystem. Earn some of the highest staking yields and drive utility through borrowing, lending and trading,” co-founder and CEO of Concrete & Glow Finance, Nicholas Roberts-Huntley, explained to Lightspeed. Behind it all is Blueprint Finance, a team of quant devs, protocol engineers and institutional investors with backgrounds spanning Coinbase, Morgan Stanley, Consensys, and Avalanche. The team’s Ethereum product, Concrete, boasts over $650m in TVL and powers automated yield strategies with institutional-grade liquidation protection. Glow Finance now extends that toolkit to Solana, though Roberts-Huntley told us that Glow won’t stop there. The protocol is already preparing to expand into a new wave of chains like Fogo and Atlas, which he describes as “building around DeFi-centric design that is uniquely powered by the SVM.” Get the news in your inbox.

Here are some key questions to ask yourself: Platform Availability: Is commission-free stock trading available in your state? Currently, it’s limited to 10 U.S. states, with plans for expansion. Check if your state is on the list or when it might be included in future rollouts. Investment Goals: Does Kraken’s stock offering align with your investment strategy? Consider the types of stocks and ETFs available, research tools, and educational resources offered on the platform. Platform Features: Beyond commission-free trading, what other features are important to you? Research Kraken’s stock trading platform for charting tools, research reports, order types, and customer support. Compare these features to other brokerage platforms to ensure it meets your requirements. Security and Trust: Kraken has a strong reputation for security in the crypto space. However, it’s always wise to do your own due diligence regarding the security measures in place for their stock trading services and understand the regulatory framework. Looking Ahead: Kraken’s Global Ambitions in Stock Trading Kraken’s move into stock trading isn’t confined to the U.S. Their announcement explicitly mentions plans to extend securities trading to the U.K., Europe, and Australia in the future. This global ambition signals a long-term commitment to becoming a comprehensive financial platform, bridging the gap between crypto and traditional markets worldwide. Imagine a future where Kraken is your go-to platform for all your investment needs, regardless of asset class or geographical location. This is the vision Kraken seems to be pursuing. The Rise of Crypto Stock Trading Platforms: A New Era for Investors? Kraken isn’t the only crypto platform venturing into stock trading, but their move is certainly a significant one given their established presence and reputation in the crypto space. This trend highlights a broader shift in the financial landscape, where crypto exchanges are evolving into more comprehensive investment platforms. What does this mean for investors? Feature Traditional Brokerages Crypto Exchanges Offering Stock Trading Asset Classes Primarily Stocks, ETFs, Options, Mutual Funds Stocks, ETFs, Cryptocurrencies, Stablecoins Commissions Increasingly Commission-Free (for stocks/ETFs) Commission-Free (for stocks/ETFs on platforms like Kraken) Platform Integration Focused on traditional financial assets Integrated platform for both crypto and traditional assets User Base Broader investor base, including traditional investors Growing user base, often attracting crypto-savvy investors Regulatory Landscape Well-established regulatory frameworks Evolving regulatory landscape, especially for crypto aspects As more crypto exchanges like Kraken embrace stock trading platform functionalities, investors gain more choices and potentially greater convenience.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.4989 Market Cap $1.73B Trading Volume $153.56M Circulating Supply 3.17B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.5192 24-h Low $0.4806 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 9.66% 50-Day SMA $ 0.54828 14-Day RSI 47.94 Green Days 14/30 (47%) Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 31 (fear) 200-Day SMA – Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Sonic is hovering near the $0.50 mark with neutral momentum on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts RSI and MACD suggest consolidation with no strong bullish or bearish bias A breakout above $0.53 is needed to confirm a sustained upward move Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart Sonic/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart of Sonic (previously FTM) on April 14, the asset demonstrates a cautious bullish inclination, although with significant resistance overhead. The price has recently closed near the midline of the Bollinger Bands, which is often interpreted as a neutral to slightly bullish stance. The RSI stands at approximately 49.82, just below the midpoint, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions but hinting at recovering momentum. However, the price struggles to decisively break above the 20-day SMA, currently acting as dynamic resistance. A breakout above $0.50 could catalyze further gains toward the upper Bollinger Band near $0.59, whereas failure may result in a retest of $0.45. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart Sonic/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart for Sonic (previously FTM), the asset is currently exhibiting range-bound behavior with subtle bullish momentum. Price is trading near the 20-period moving average within the Bollinger Bands, suggesting equilibrium with slight upward bias. The MACD shows a weakening bullish crossover, with the histogram trending lower, indicating waning momentum. The Balance of Power hovers near the neutral line, reflecting a balanced tug between buyers and sellers. If Sonic sustains above $0.49, it could test resistance at $0.53. However, a dip below $0.47 may open the door for a retest of $0.45 support in the near term. Sonic technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.493895 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.505815 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.474525 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.506873 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.54828 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.578053 SELL SMA 200 – Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.448323 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.455629 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.474572 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.499824 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.535922 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.565533 SELL EMA 200 – – What can you expect from the Sonic (prev.FTM) price analysis next? Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts for Sonic (previously FTM), the asset displays a cautiously optimistic setup. On the 1-day chart, Sonic is trading just above the middle Bollinger Band and slightly below the $0.50 level, with RSI at 49.82 indicating balanced momentum and potential for a move higher if volume confirms. The 4-hour chart shows consolidation with mild bullish signals as the price hovers near the 20-SMA and MACD lines remain narrowly spread. Despite mild upward pressure, the lack of strong bullish volume and mixed oscillator readings suggest that Sonic may continue sideways with potential breakouts only above $0.53.

43342656,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149248,1744663816,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Empowering Bitcoin: Tether’s Revolutionary Shift to Decentralized Mining with OCEAN,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-decentralized-bitcoin-mining/,"In a revolutionary move that has sent ripples through the cryptocurrency world, Tether, the company behind the world’s leading stablecoin USDT, has announced its foray into decentralized Bitcoin mining. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a strategic pivot aimed at fortifying the very foundation of Bitcoin – its decentralization and censorship resistance. But what exactly does this mean for you, for the Bitcoin network, and for the future of crypto mining? Let’s dive deep into Tether’s announcement and unpack the implications of this bold decision. Why is Tether Venturing into Bitcoin Mining Decentralization? Tether’s decision to channel its Bitcoin mining hashrate to OCEAN, a decentralized mining pool spearheaded by Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr, is far from arbitrary. It’s a calculated step towards addressing critical concerns within the Bitcoin ecosystem. For years, centralization in Bitcoin mining has been a growing worry. A concentration of hashrate in the hands of a few large pools raises concerns about potential vulnerabilities and single points of failure. Tether’s initiative directly tackles this issue by promoting a more distributed and resilient mining infrastructure. Here’s a breakdown of the key motivations behind Tether’s strategic shift: Strengthening Decentralization: The core ethos of Bitcoin is decentralization. By directing hashrate to a decentralized pool like OCEAN, Tether is actively contributing to a more distributed network, reducing the influence of centralized entities. Enhancing Censorship Resistance: A decentralized mining landscape makes it significantly harder for any single entity to censor transactions or exert undue control over the Bitcoin network. OCEAN’s structure is designed to be censorship-resistant, aligning perfectly with Bitcoin’s foundational principles. Supporting Bitcoin Core Development: OCEAN is the brainchild of Luke Dashjr, a prominent Bitcoin Core developer. By supporting OCEAN, Tether is indirectly backing Bitcoin Core development, which is crucial for the long-term health and evolution of Bitcoin. Expanding Global Reach, Especially in Underserved Regions: Tether explicitly mentions expanding operations in regions like Africa. This focus on underserved areas can democratize access to Bitcoin mining and contribute to financial inclusion on a global scale. What is OCEAN and Why is it a Decentralized Pool for Bitcoin Mining? OCEAN isn’t just another mining pool; it’s built from the ground up with decentralization as its core principle. Unlike traditional mining pools that operate with centralized control and often require KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures, OCEAN aims to be permissionless and censorship-resistant. This aligns perfectly with the ethos of Bitcoin and provides miners with greater autonomy and control. Let’s explore what makes OCEAN stand out as a decentralized pool : Feature OCEAN Traditional Mining Pools Control Decentralized, miners have more control Centralized, pool operator has significant control Censorship Resistance Designed for high censorship resistance Potentially vulnerable to censorship pressures Transparency Greater transparency in operations Transparency levels can vary KYC/AML Aims to minimize or eliminate KYC/AML Often requires KYC/AML compliance Development Focus Driven by Bitcoin Core development principles Primarily profit-driven By choosing OCEAN, Tether is signaling a commitment to these decentralized values and encouraging other miners to consider the benefits of a more open and resilient mining ecosystem. The Benefits of Decentralized Bitcoin Mining: Why Should You Care? The shift towards decentralization in Bitcoin mining is not just an abstract concept; it has tangible benefits that impact everyone involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem, from miners to users and holders. Understanding these benefits is crucial to appreciating the significance of Tether’s move. Enhanced Network Security: A more decentralized hashrate distribution makes the Bitcoin network more resilient to 51% attacks. It becomes exponentially harder for any single entity to gain control over the network and manipulate transactions. Increased Censorship Resistance: As mentioned earlier, decentralization is the cornerstone of censorship resistance. With mining power spread across numerous independent pools, it becomes incredibly difficult for governments or corporations to censor transactions or block access to the Bitcoin network. Greater Miner Autonomy: Decentralized pools like OCEAN empower individual miners by giving them more control over their operations and reducing their reliance on centralized pool operators. This fosters a more democratic and equitable mining environment. Improved Network Stability: A geographically diverse and decentralized mining network is less susceptible to disruptions caused by regional events like power outages, natural disasters, or regulatory crackdowns. Long-Term Sustainability of Bitcoin: By promoting decentralization, Tether is contributing to the long-term health and sustainability of Bitcoin. A robust and decentralized mining infrastructure is essential for Bitcoin to thrive as a truly global and permissionless currency. Challenges and Considerations for Decentralized Pools like OCEAN While the move towards decentralized pools is undoubtedly positive, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and considerations that come with it. Transitioning to a fully decentralized mining ecosystem is not without its hurdles. User Experience and Adoption: Decentralized pools may have a steeper learning curve for some miners, especially those accustomed to the ease of use of centralized pools. Improving user experience and onboarding processes will be crucial for wider adoption. Potential for Lower Hashrate initially: Decentralized pools might initially have lower hashrate compared to established centralized pools, which could affect block discovery times and payouts in the short term. However, as adoption grows, this is expected to equalize. Security Considerations: While designed for censorship resistance, decentralized pools need to be robustly secured against various forms of attacks. Continuous security audits and improvements are essential. Incentive Structures: Developing effective and fair incentive structures within decentralized pools is crucial to attract and retain miners. Balancing decentralization with efficient reward distribution is an ongoing challenge. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and mining is still evolving. Decentralized pools need to navigate these complexities while maintaining their core principles of permissionlessness and censorship resistance. Tether’s Focus on Underserved Regions: A Boost for Global Bitcoin Adoption? Tether’s commitment to expanding Bitcoin mining operations in underserved regions, particularly Africa, is a noteworthy aspect of this announcement. This focus has the potential to significantly impact global Bitcoin adoption and financial inclusion. Here’s why this geographical focus is significant: Financial Inclusion: Many underserved regions lack access to traditional financial infrastructure. Bitcoin mining can provide economic opportunities and empower individuals in these areas. Energy Resources: Some underserved regions have abundant renewable energy resources that can be utilized for sustainable Bitcoin mining, contributing to a greener Bitcoin ecosystem. Decentralized Growth: Expanding mining operations geographically diversifies the network and reduces reliance on specific regions, further enhancing decentralization. Economic Empowerment: Bitcoin mining can create jobs and stimulate local economies in underserved regions, fostering economic growth and self-sufficiency. Global Adoption: By making Bitcoin mining more accessible in underserved regions, Tether is contributing to the broader goal of global Bitcoin adoption and mainstream acceptance. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Tether’s move to support OCEAN and decentralized Bitcoin mining has implications for various stakeholders in the crypto space: For Bitcoin Miners: Consider exploring decentralized pools like OCEAN. While it might require some adjustments, the long-term benefits of contributing to a more robust and censorship-resistant network are significant. Evaluate the pool’s features, fees, and community support. For Bitcoin Holders: Support initiatives that promote Bitcoin decentralization. A decentralized mining ecosystem strengthens the security and longevity of your Bitcoin holdings. Advocate for and support projects that prioritize decentralization. For the Crypto Community: Pay attention to the development of decentralized mining pools and their impact on the Bitcoin network. Engage in discussions about decentralization and its importance for the future of cryptocurrencies. For Regulators: Understand the benefits of decentralized Bitcoin mining for network security and censorship resistance. Consider regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation and decentralization in the crypto mining sector. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a More Decentralized Bitcoin Future Tether’s decision to deploy its Bitcoin mining hashrate to OCEAN is more than just a business move; it’s a statement of intent. It’s a commitment to the core principles of Bitcoin – decentralization, censorship resistance, and financial empowerment. By supporting a decentralized mining pool and focusing on underserved regions, Tether is taking a bold and commendable step towards building a more resilient, inclusive, and truly decentralized Bitcoin ecosystem. This initiative has the potential to inspire other large players in the crypto space to prioritize decentralization and contribute to the long-term health and sustainability of the Bitcoin network. The ripple effects of this decision are likely to be felt across the crypto landscape for years to come, marking a significant milestone in the ongoing journey towards a truly decentralized digital future.

As the price remains below this critical volume zone, it opens up the possibility of a move below $90, a region primed for a potential liquidity sweep and swing failure pattern that could set the stage for a significant reversal. Solana’s ( SOL ) recent price action suggests an effort to build a base, but bullish momentum is being capped by its inability to reclaim the range’s point of control—where the majority of recent trading activity has occurred. This failure has turned that zone into short-term resistance, compressing price action and leaving Solana vulnerable to further downside unless reclaimed decisively. Key points covered in this article: Rejection at the point of control puts pressure on Solana’s short-term trend $89 support remains critical for a possible SFP and reversal trigger Liquidity beneath current levels could fuel a bullish rotation back to $178–$252 Source: TradingView Solana’s rejection at the volume point of control has created a precarious technical setup. This level, once acting as support, has flipped into resistance, tightening price action and amplifying the likelihood of a liquidity-driven dip. Unless Solana reclaims this volume node with conviction, the short-term outlook remains defensive for bulls. The $89 support, just under the psychological $90 threshold, is now a key area to watch. It marks a swing low that remains untouched and sits in a high-liquidity zone. A sweep of this level followed by a clear swing failure pattern could trigger a strong reversal, with upside targets in the weekly structure zone between $178 and $252. You might also like: Solana price path of least resistance in April is $80 – Polymarket It’s essential to understand that markets hunt liquidity, and the region below $90 is likely loaded with stop orders from traders holding positions between $130 and $100. A move into this liquidity pocket would be consistent with typical market structure, especially in a consolidating asset. However, if Solana manages to reclaim the point of control before that happens, this bearish scenario becomes invalidated, and a more bullish outlook resumes, favoring continuation toward higher resistance levels. How to trade this setup: Wait for a sweep of the $89 low, and look for signs of a swing failure pattern as a trigger for long entries. If confirmed, position for a potential rally targeting $178–$252. If price reclaims the point of control, consider adjusting the bias to favor bullish continuation.

On April 11, the country’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) announced that 14 crypto exchanges were blocked on the Apple store. Among the affected exchanges are KuCoin and MEXC. The report, which was made public on April 14, says the banned exchanges were allegedly operating as unregistered overseas virtual asset operators. The report also states that the Financial Information Analysis Institution (FIU) will continue to promote the blocking of the apps and internet sites of such operators to prevent money laundering and user damage. The request to block applications on the Apple Store comes after Google Play blocked access to several unregistered exchanges on March 26 . KuCoin and MEXC were also targeted during the blocking of the Google Play apps. The FSC published a list of 22 unregistered platforms operating in the country, with 17 of them already blocked on Google's marketplace. The 17 crypto exchanges blocked on Google Play. Source: FSC According to the FSC report, users will not be able to download the apps on the Apple Store, while existing users will not be able to update the apps. The FSC notes that “unreported business activities are criminal punishment matters” with penalties of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 50 million won ($35,200). FIU considers sanctions against unregistered VASPs On March 21, South Korean publication Hankyung reported that the FIU and the FSC were considering sanctions against crypto exchanges operating in the country without registration with local regulators. The sanctions included blocking access to the companies’ apps. In South Korea, operators of crypto sales, brokerage, management, and storage must report to the FIU. Failure to comply with registration and reports is subject to penalties and sanctions.

The company said that Bitcoin, which fell to around $75,000 last week, found strong support in this area and then entered a dynamic recovery process. However, it is not yet clear whether this rise is sustainable. According to MakroVision, Bitcoin has turned bullish from the green trend lines around $75,000, while the downward structure in recent weeks has been more of a correction. Related News: “Stay Away If Bitcoin Rises to This Level,” Says CEO of Analysis Company! “It Could Be a Big Bull Trap” According to the analyst firm, for the rally to continue, Bitcoin needs to break out of the resistance cluster at $87,600-$89,900. This area, combined with the red falling trend line, forms a critical barrier. The firm notes that a sustained break above this level could signal a clear trend reversal, something not seen in months.

Hold on tight, because a significant warning has been issued that could directly impact your digital assets. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw has sounded the alarm, highlighting a critical gap in investor protection within the current crypto landscape. During a recent Crypto Task Force roundtable, Crenshaw voiced serious concerns about the lack of fundamental safeguards for retail investors plunging into crypto markets. Let’s delve into what this means for you and how you can navigate these uncharted waters. Why is the SEC Concerned About Crypto Regulation? The core of Commissioner Crenshaw’s warning centers around the absence of robust crypto regulation that mirrors the traditional financial world. Unlike established stock markets and investment platforms, many cryptocurrency platforms operate outside the well-defined boundaries of regulatory oversight. This lack of clear rules creates a breeding ground for potential risks, particularly for everyday retail investors who may not fully grasp the complexities and vulnerabilities inherent in the crypto sphere. Here’s a breakdown of why this lack of regulation is a major red flag: Unregulated Platforms: Many crypto exchanges and platforms function without the same level of scrutiny and compliance checks as traditional financial institutions. This means fewer safeguards are in place to protect your investments from fraud, manipulation, and operational failures. Bundled Services, Increased Conflicts: A significant point of concern is the bundling of key financial services within single crypto platforms. These platforms often act as brokers, custodians, and clearinghouses simultaneously. In traditional finance, these functions are typically separated to minimize conflicts of interest. Imagine a scenario where the same entity is advising you on what to buy, holding your assets, and processing the transactions – the potential for conflicts becomes glaringly apparent. Investor Misconceptions: Crenshaw pointed out a critical disconnect between investor expectations and the reality of crypto risks . Many retail investors may mistakenly believe they have the same protections in crypto as they do with traditional investments. This is far from the truth, especially concerning asset custody, bankruptcy protections, and insurance coverage. Decoding the Lack of Investor Protection: What Are the Real Risks? So, what exactly are these missing protections, and how do they put retail investors at risk? Let’s break down some key areas where the crypto world falls short compared to regulated financial markets: Protection Area Traditional Finance Cryptocurrency Markets (Often Lacking) Custody of Assets Assets are typically held by regulated custodians, separate from brokerage firms, offering a layer of security and accountability. Crypto platforms often act as custodians, and the security protocols can vary widely. If a platform is hacked or fails, recovering your assets can be incredibly challenging, if not impossible. Bankruptcy Protection Clear legal frameworks exist to protect investors’ assets in case of a brokerage or financial institution bankruptcy. The legal landscape around crypto platform bankruptcies is still evolving and often unclear. Investors may find themselves in a precarious position trying to recover funds if a crypto platform goes under. Insurance Coverage Many traditional brokerage accounts are insured by organizations like the SIPC (Securities Investor Protection Corporation) in the U.S., offering some protection against firm failure. Insurance for crypto holdings is not standard and, when available, often comes with limitations and complexities. Many crypto platforms do not offer insurance comparable to traditional financial institutions. Regulatory Oversight & Enforcement Government agencies like the SEC actively monitor and enforce regulations to protect investors from fraud and market manipulation. SEC oversight in the crypto space is still developing. Enforcement actions are increasing, but the regulatory framework is not as comprehensive, leaving room for illicit activities to thrive. What Needs to Happen Next? The Call for Regulatory Clarity Commissioner Crenshaw’s message is a clear call for action. She emphasized the urgent need for greater crypto regulation and clarity to bridge the protection gap for retail investors. She stressed the importance of: Clear Regulatory Frameworks: Developing comprehensive and well-defined rules that address the unique characteristics of crypto markets while ensuring investor safety. Stakeholder Collaboration: Encouraging dialogue and cooperation between regulators, industry participants, and investors to create effective and balanced regulations. Investor Education: Empowering retail investors with the knowledge and understanding needed to navigate the complexities and risks of the crypto market. This includes being aware of the differences in protections compared to traditional investments and understanding the specific risks associated with different crypto platforms and assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: How to Navigate the Risks While the regulatory landscape evolves, what can you, as a retail investor , do to protect yourself in the meantime? Do Your Due Diligence: Thoroughly research any crypto platform or project before investing. Understand their security measures, custody practices, and terms of service. Don’t rely solely on hype or social media buzz. Understand Custodial Risks: Be fully aware of who is holding your crypto assets and the associated risks. Consider using hardware wallets for self-custody of a portion of your holdings, especially for long-term investments. Diversify and Manage Risk: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto portfolio and only invest what you can afford to lose. The crypto market is highly volatile, and losses are a real possibility. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with regulatory developments and industry news. Understanding the evolving legal and regulatory landscape is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Question Unrealistic Promises: Be wary of platforms or projects that promise guaranteed high returns or seem too good to be true. These are often red flags for scams or unsustainable business models. The Bottom Line: Investor Awareness is Your First Line of Defense Commissioner Crenshaw’s warning serves as a crucial reminder that the crypto market, while brimming with potential, is still a largely unregulated frontier. Until comprehensive crypto regulation is in place, retail investors must be extra vigilant and proactive in protecting themselves. Understanding the inherent crypto risks , conducting thorough research, and practicing sound risk management are paramount. The path to a safer crypto investment environment requires both regulatory evolution and empowered, informed investors.

This time, the attack is multi-chain, affecting tokens on BNB Smart Chain, Base, and Taiko. The investigators pointed out that multiple tokens were affected, and the attack was still ongoing. The initial address of the hacker was funded by Tornado Cash, leading to suggestions the exploit may be the work of DPRK hackers. The hacker used MetaMask for transfers and bridging to other chains in order to target KiloEX, which operates on BNB Smart Chain and Manta Network. During the exploit, the hackers did not target the Ethereum chain, instead, they ended up with stablecoins on other networks. An hour after the hack, most of the haul sat in known large wallets, with no signs of splitting or transfers to Tornado Cash. Some of the withdrawals affected USDC and USDT, as on-chain investigators are now attempting to freeze the tokens. The trackers have already flagged a destination address on BNB Smart Chain, carrying over $3.1M USDT. Following the exploit, the KILO native token crashed, further erasing value.

KiloEX grew its activity just before the hack KiloEX has been around since the 2023 bear market, spending most of its time in building and expanding its presence. In the past quarter, KiloEX increased its influence, volumes and value locked. Just before the hack, the DEX announced a liquidity boost event to trade some of the hottest BNB Smart Chain meme tokens. The DEX now carries $47.2M in total value, remaining a potentially valuable target for hackers to drain multiple pools. KiloEX doubled its volumes in the past day, carrying over $31.8M in activity. Over $22M of that volume is in the BTC/USDT perpetual futures pair, with a small selection of tokens on several chains. One of the sources of activity for KiloEX was its airdrop farming program. The DEX offered perpetual futures trading with up to 100X leverage. Current users complained that the hack erased the value earned from airdrops.

According to a research report from investment bank Jefferies published on Friday, this metric fell by 7.4% in March. MARA Holdings Lead Bitcoin Miners In Q1 2025, the coin recorded an average price decline of 11.2% in the last month. The Jefferies report also acknowledged a 9.1% drop in transaction fees. Compared to February, when United States-listed miners, including MARA Holdings (MARA), recorded 3,002 BTC mined, March’s value reached 3,534 Bitcoin. Do you have any plans to address the reduced profits that will apply in the next Bitcoin halving? For example: 1) Lowering electricity fees. 2) Allowing mining of other cryptocurrencies 3) Other I’d like to invest more, but I don’t see the profitability in the long term… — Mpampis Menippos (@MenipposMpampis) April 14, 2025 These miners’ activities contributed about 24.8% of the total network last month, compared to 23.6% the previous month. In March, MARA produced 829 BTC of all US-listed miners, marking the most bitcoin mined by a single company at 54.3 exahashes per second. Following closely, CleanSpark (CLSK) produced 706 BTC at 42.4 EH/s. Solo Miners Process More BTC Blocks In the same mining industry, solo miners are beginning to score more often than they previously did. In the first week of April, one solo Bitcoin miner defied towering odds by successfully processing a block. This earned the miner 3.125 BTC, roughly $259,637, including transaction fees. Such trends were observed, with solo miners processing 7 blocks in 2022, 12 in 2023, and 16 in 2024. There are speculations that the growing presence of hobbyist miners may have contributed to the recent uptick in solo block wins. Bitcoin Price Hit $84,494.79, Amidst Market Recovery Amidst these events, Bitcoin price has seen some market recovery, attributed to the rebound recorded in the broader cryptocurrency market. When President Donald Trump announced his tariff policies, the news hit the tech and crypto industries. The BTC price plummeted significantly, leaving the coin below $77,000. The coin is trading at $84,494.79, following a 0.45% increase within the last 24 hours. Much of this price gain was seen after Trump rolled back a chunk of his hardline tariff policy .

According to her latest chart, XRP tapped $2.24, aligning precisely with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level. This level was anticipated as a likely top in the current corrective structure. She stated that this move appears to finalize wave C of the corrective phase from the recent low of $1.72. The posted chart highlights a well-formed ABC pattern, clearly labeling each wave. The RSI data at the bottom of the chart further supports a potential reversal, showing bearish divergence as the price reached the top of wave C. CasiTrades noted this was showing signs of reversal, consistent with weakening momentum across multiple timeframes. XRP Reaching C Top! A few days ago, I walked you through two likely outcomes for #XRP : 1⃣ A continuation from the $1.72 low into a breakout 2⃣ Or, an ABC before a deeper correction And it looks like we just got our answer. $XRP tapped $2.24, right at the .382 retracement.… pic.twitter.com/uJWpPqbNIV — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) April 13, 2025 Key Support Levels Now in Focus With the corrective wave likely complete, attention has shifted to identifying where XRP may find support before initiating its next major leg higher. CasiTrades pointed to $1.90 as the first significant level. This corresponds with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement and is described as a “critical backtest area” for a possible short-term bounce. The asset recently dipped below this level after Donald Trump’s tariffs caused a market-wide collapse. This move also affected the stock market significantly, and experts projected that XRP could drop even further in the days following the announcement. However, the digital asset quickly recovered when Trump announced a 90-day pause on his tariff plans. It is now trading at $2.14. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Outlook for the Next Major Wave With the asset now trading above $2, CasiTrades presents two scenarios. The asset could either continue this rise and experience a massive breakout from the recent price decline or fall back and test lower levels before the price rally. The $1.55 area is considered crucial. This level, which aligns with the 0.618 retracement, is an Elliott Wave Theory Wave 2 target. The chart shows a green zone stretching from approximately $1.44 to $1.55, representing a key accumulation area if XRP dips to this level. Meanwhile, CasiTrades believes that either of these levels could be XRP’s next pivot. The overall structure suggests that XRP may soon complete its corrective phase, setting a strong bullish impulse. She advised traders to monitor price action closely at $1.90 and $1.55, where the next directional pivot is expected to form. CasiTrades expects “massive new highs” from the digital asset’s next move, and many other experts share this bullish sentiment .

While the overall market has contracted significantly from its previous highs, a specific segment is not just surviving but thriving. Are you curious to know which part of the crypto lending sector is defying the market trends and showing incredible resilience? Let’s dive into the latest data and uncover the exciting developments in the world of digital asset lending. Crypto Lending Market: A Tale of Two Halves Recent data paints a picture of contraction in the broader crypto lending market. According to a report by Galaxy Digital, highlighted by Cointelegraph, the total market size dwindled to $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024. This figure represents a substantial 43% decrease from the peak of $64.4 billion observed in 2021. This downturn reflects broader market corrections and shifts in investor sentiment within the cryptocurrency space. However, this overarching decline masks a more nuanced reality. The report reveals a stark contrast between centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platforms. While CeFi lending platforms are experiencing a period of weakness and reduced activity, the DeFi sector is demonstrating remarkable growth and vitality. DeFi Loans: The Astonishing 959% Surge In stark contrast to the overall market contraction, DeFi loans , specifically open borrows, have experienced an extraordinary surge. From their lows in 2022, DeFi open borrows have skyrocketed by an impressive 959%, reaching a substantial $19.1 billion. This near tenfold increase underscores the growing appeal and utility of decentralized lending platforms within the crypto ecosystem. But what exactly is driving this phenomenal growth in DeFi lending while the broader market faces headwinds? Let’s explore some key factors: Transparency and Control: DeFi platforms operate on blockchain technology, offering unparalleled transparency. All transactions are publicly recorded and verifiable, fostering trust and accountability. Users retain full control of their assets, unlike in CeFi where assets are held by intermediaries. Accessibility and Inclusivity: DeFi lending platforms are generally permissionless, meaning anyone with a crypto wallet can participate, regardless of their location or credit score. This inclusivity opens up financial opportunities to a global audience. Innovation and Yield Opportunities: DeFi is a hotbed of financial innovation, constantly evolving with new protocols and strategies. DeFi lending often offers attractive yield opportunities through mechanisms like yield farming and staking, drawing users seeking higher returns compared to traditional finance or CeFi platforms. Resilience to Centralized Failures: The decentralized nature of DeFi makes it inherently more resilient to failures or collapses of individual entities. Unlike CeFi platforms, DeFi is not reliant on single points of failure, which can be a significant advantage in volatile markets. CeFi Lending: Why the Weakness? The weakness in CeFi lending can be attributed to several factors. Following the market exuberance of 2021, the crypto space experienced significant corrections and high-profile collapses in 2022 and 2023. These events eroded trust in centralized crypto entities and platforms. Furthermore, stricter regulatory scrutiny and increased risk aversion among investors have contributed to a more cautious approach towards centralized crypto lending services. Here’s a comparative look at CeFi and DeFi lending: Feature CeFi Lending DeFi Lending Control of Assets Custodial (assets held by platform) Non-custodial (users retain control) Transparency Limited High (on-chain transactions) Accessibility May require KYC/AML, geographical restrictions Generally permissionless, global access Yields Potentially lower, fixed rates Potentially higher, variable rates, yield farming opportunities Risk Counterparty risk, platform failure risk Smart contract risk, impermanent loss risk Navigating the Cryptocurrency Market: Opportunities and Challenges The contrasting trends in CeFi and DeFi lending highlight the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market . While the overall lending market has contracted, the robust growth of DeFi loans indicates a fundamental shift in user preference towards decentralized solutions. This shift presents both opportunities and challenges for participants in the crypto space. Opportunities: For Users: Access to transparent, inclusive, and potentially higher-yield lending and borrowing opportunities within DeFi. For Developers: Continued innovation and building of more sophisticated and user-friendly DeFi lending protocols and platforms. For the Industry: The growth of DeFi can contribute to a more resilient and decentralized financial ecosystem, reducing reliance on centralized intermediaries. Challenges: Smart Contract Risks: DeFi platforms are reliant on smart contracts, which are susceptible to bugs and vulnerabilities that could lead to financial losses. Impermanent Loss: Users participating in DeFi lending pools may face impermanent loss, particularly in volatile market conditions. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for DeFi is still evolving, and increased scrutiny could impact the growth and adoption of DeFi lending. Complexity and User Experience: Navigating the DeFi space can be complex for new users. Improving user experience and making DeFi more accessible is crucial for wider adoption. Actionable Insights for Digital Asset Lending Participants For those involved or interested in digital asset lending , here are some actionable insights based on the current market trends: Diversify your approach: Consider exploring both CeFi and DeFi lending options, but be aware of the distinct risks and rewards associated with each. Educate yourself on DeFi: Understand the mechanics of DeFi lending protocols, smart contract risks, and impermanent loss before participating. Stay informed about regulations: Keep abreast of the evolving regulatory landscape for both CeFi and DeFi in your jurisdiction. Prioritize security: When using DeFi platforms, prioritize security best practices, such as using hardware wallets and being cautious about interacting with unaudited protocols. Conclusion: The DeFi Revolution in Crypto Lending is Just Beginning The data is clear: while the overall crypto lending market is experiencing a correction, DeFi lending is not just weathering the storm but thriving. The near 10x surge in DeFi loans signals a significant shift in the crypto landscape, driven by the principles of transparency, accessibility, and innovation inherent in decentralized finance. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, the resilience and growth of DeFi lending suggest that it is poised to play an increasingly crucial role in the future of finance. The surge in DeFi is not just a temporary trend; it represents a fundamental evolution in how digital assets are lent and borrowed, potentially reshaping the financial industry for years to come.

On April 2, President Donald Trump announced plans to charge sweeping tariffs on US imports, prompting other nations to threaten retaliatory measures. Trump later paused the tariff rollout for certain countries — but the possibility of a global trade war still looms, especially after Trump reiterated his commitment to taxing Chinese goods. If high tariffs materialize, blockchain technology can play an important role in ensuring governments apply them fairly, according to the executives. Blockchain can “really help you prove provenance [...] proving the chain of custody,” Federico Kattan, Truebit’s chief technology officer, told Cointelegraph. Trump’s proposed tariffs would transform global trade. Source: Statista For example, a company might “assemble or do some packaging in a low-tariff country and then import into the US at 10% instead of 58%... [but] blockchain can help establish where the product actually came from,” Kattan said. Blockchain networks can enhance supply chain transparency by recording every transaction on an immutable public ledger, greatly limiting the scope for fraud across trillions of dollars worth of imported goods. Trump’s proposed tariffs would impact $2.4 trillion worth of imports, according to a report by the Tax Foundation. Retaliatory measures by other countries could add to that figure. Truebit is a blockchain network specializing in helping users add trustless verification to a wide variety of applications. It is already in talks with software vendors servicing the US government and has been working on a European Union-funded project exploring Web3’s potential role in global supply chains, the executives said. ""We’re not yet talking directly to governments, but to the software vendors trying to interface with them — because that’s where we want to be,” Jason Teutsch, Truebit’s CEO, said. Truebit’s native token has struggled since launching in 2021. Source: CoinGecko Related: Trade tensions to speed institutional crypto adoption — Execs Truebit was launched in 2017 and launched its TRU token in 2021. The token has a fully diluted market capitalization of $20 million, according to CoinGecko. Trade war risks However, several other crypto executives cautioned that tariffs pose serious risks to blockchain networks’ integrity and accessibility to users. Worsening trade wars threaten to disrupt networks’ physical infrastructure, fragment regulatory regimes, and censor users, they said. “Aggressive tariffs and retaliatory trade policies could create obstacles for node operators, validators, and other core participants in blockchain networks,” Nicholas Roberts-Huntley, CEO of Concrete & Glow Finance, told Cointelegraph.

Qubetics ($TICS) Might Just Be Your Last Chance to Get in the Best Crypto Presale to Join in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-quant-qubetics-tics-might-just-be-your-last-chance-to-get-in-the-best-crypto-presale-to-join-in-2025/,"2025 has been savage for those who slept through the early stages of some game-changing coins. Bitcoin’s been teasing ATHs, meme coins are back in rotation, and the market’s been pumping harder than a gym rat on pre-workout. But between the noise and the nonsense, one truth hits harder than a gas fee on Ethereum: those who got in early won big . One of the most brutal misses of all time? Quant ($QNT) . This beast didn’t just talk the talk — it built a framework that made blockchain networks play nice with one another, and it paid off big-time. Back in the day, people shrugged off Quant at $1, then watched it hit triple digits while they were still stuck researching. Sound familiar? But hey, let’s not cry over missed moonshots. Because right now, there’s another sleeper heating up — Qubetics ($TICS) — and it might just be the best crypto presale to join if you’re trying to rewrite that missed-Quant story. Quant ($QNT): The One That Got Away Let’s talk facts. Quant was never the loudest project. It didn’t need memes, hype, or constant drama on Twitter. It just delivered. It solved a massive issue: blockchain interoperability. Basically, it made different chains work together like they weren’t beefing — and that alone turned it into a sleeping giant. By the time most people realized what Quant was doing, it had already skyrocketed past $200. The early-stage FOMO? Real. That “I should’ve bought at $7” gut-punch? Also real. It’s still a solid project today, no doubt. But if you’re looking to 10x, 50x, or 100x , Quant’s glory days might be behind it. The ship’s not sinking — it’s just already sailed. If you missed the boat, you’re not alone. So, if you’re done with regret and ready to catch the next big one before it hits the stratosphere, let’s talk about the best crypto presale to join right now . One word: Qubetics. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Wallets, Real-World Use Cases, and Massive Upside Qubetics isn’t just another chain promising the moon. It’s actually solving real problems. The biggest one it’s taking on is managing multiple wallets across different blockchains. Picture this: you’ve got ETH on Metamask, some SOL on Phantom, and BNB chilling in Trust Wallet. Now you need to manage it all — transfer between them, track balances, pay gas, sign in and out. Messy, right? Enter Qubetics’ Multi-Chain Wallet . It’s a clean, secure, all-in-one wallet that actually lets you access, manage, and use assets across different blockchains without needing 5 different apps and a degree in rocket science. This isn’t some vague “future” feature. It’s already in the works — real progress, real UX. Now imagine: A freelance video editor in South Africa accepts payments in MATIC, ETH, and USDC — and handles it all from one sleek Qubetics wallet. A small business owner in the Philippines uses the same wallet to manage customer payments from European clients, convert it easily, and use it locally. A DeFi degen in Miami tracks tokens across five chains in real-time, swaps them instantly, and even uses Qubetics’ virtual card integration to spend directly. Qubetics is rolling in features: asset tokenization, cross-border settlement, decentralized VPN, and even a no-code IDE for devs to build on its chain without needing to touch Rust or Solidity. But what really puts it on the radar as the best crypto presale to join is this: it’s still in presale . That means you’re not too late—you’re early—super early. Presale Alpha: Where Dreams (and Bags) Are Made Alright, here’s where the FOMO kicks in. The Qubetics’ best crypto presale is currently at Stage 30 , and the token price sits at $0.1729 . You read that right. While some coins are already pushing triple digits, $TICS is still dirt cheap — and full of room to grow. Here’s how it’s looking: Over 508 million tokens sold More than 24,700 holders A massive $16.1 million+ already raised Now let’s talk about the potential. Analysts are putting out numbers that’ll make your eyeballs pop: $TICS hits $1 after presale? That’s 477% ROI $TICS at $5? Try 2789% ROI And $15 after the mainnet launch? You’re looking at 8567% ROI Some are even saying $10–15 is a reasonable post-mainnet price, considering the traction, tech, and partnerships forming behind the scenes. If you missed Quant, don’t sit around telling the same sad story about Qubetics. Get in while it’s still hot — and still cheap . Best Crypto Presale to Join? It’s Not Even a Contest Right Now There are hundreds of coins launching every month. Most of them promise the moon. Few of them deliver a flashlight. But Qubetics isn’t just making noise — it’s building a full-blown ecosystem with actual use cases , progress , and early-stage pricing . And that combo? That’s the dream setup for anyone hunting for the best crypto presale to join in 2025. If you’re tired of chasing pumps, getting rugged, or FOMOing into coins after they’re already cooked — this is your clean slate. The Wrap-Up: Don’t Make the Same Mistake Twice You watched Quant go from under a buck to the moon. You saw others cash out while you stayed frozen. The market doesn’t wait. And neither does opportunity. Right now, Qubetics is ticking every box: real utility, huge upside, an undervalued entry price, and a community that’s growing like wildfire. The best crypto presale to join ] isn’t about hype — it’s about timing. And yours is staring you right in the face. Load up on $TICS while it’s still in presale. Don’t be the person reading about it six months from now saying, “I should’ve bought when it was $0.17.” For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What stage is the Qubetics presale in right now?

What are the price predictions for $TICS? Analysts predict $TICS could hit $1–$15 post-mainnet, with potential ROI ranging from 477% to 8567%. What makes Qubetics the best crypto presale to join in 2025? It combines multi-chain wallet functionality, real-world solutions, dev tools, and still-affordable token pricing in a rapidly growing ecosystem. Is Qubetics live on exchanges yet? Not yet — it’s still in presale. This is the early-access window where the gains are made. The post Missed Quant?

One cryptocurrency is on the verge of a comeback, another is encountering warning signals, while a third is driving a bullish surge. Discover which assets are set for growth and could capitalize on the current market conditions. Cardano ADA Price Trends and Market Levels: A Snapshot One week gains of nearly 12% contrast with a one-month decline of over 13%, while a remarkable surge of almost 79% over the past six months highlights a strong long-term uptrend. Price movements during these periods have shown alternating bursts of quick recoveries and temporary pullbacks, illustrating the coin’s inherent volatility and cyclical nature. Current trading levels are between $0.47 and $1.02. Immediate resistance is at $1.37, with a higher barrier at $1.92, while support is around $0.27. Bearish pressure is suggested by negative readings from the Awesome Oscillator and the momentum indicator, while a near-neutral RSI indicates stability. Traders may consider buying near support and testing resistance levels while managing their risk. Uptrend Momentum Boosts TRON Price Action TRON posted a 15.01% gain in the past month and surged by 61.09% in the last six months. Price action shows steady upward movement over these periods, reflecting growing investor interest and accumulation. Data reveals a consistent climb and increasing momentum without major pullbacks, suggesting sustained confidence in the coin’s long-term potential. Current trading levels rest between $0.22 and $0.26, with key resistance at $0.27 and strong support at $0.19. Bulls are gradually taking control, though the market remains cautious near the secondary resistance at $0.31 and the second support at $0.15. Trend clarity is limited, leading to trading ideas to test the $0.27 barrier before considering further gains. Raydium Price Dance: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Adjustments Raydium rose nearly 29.73% over one week and recorded a 24.69% surge over the past month, while a six-month check shows a decline of about 5.63%. Price movements ranged widely, highlighting bursts of momentum followed by periods of retracement. Recent performance reflects active trading sessions and shifting market sentiment. Current pricing sits between $1.09 and $2.69, with immediate resistance at $3.67 and strong support near $0.47. Bulls drive short-term rallies amid balanced momentum, but no clear overarching trend stands out. Traders might explore breakouts above $3.67 while watching for rebounds at support, positioning themselves conservatively within these levels. Conclusion ADA shows potential for a rebound. TRX signals possible decline. RAY is experiencing a strong rally. Each coin presents unique opportunities and challenges in a shifting market.

This crypto whale wallet, which is unknown whether it belongs to a mysterious individual investor or an institution, purchased 15,953 ETH worth $26.16 million, according to the data. Six different cryptocurrency wallets with strong suspicions of being connected to this crypto whale transferred the ETH they purchased on OKX to the decentralized crypto lending platform Aave. Then, using these ETHs as collateral, they borrowed $15.4 million worth of USDT through Aave and transferred these USDT to OKX. Meanwhile, another crypto whale deposited $6 million worth of USDC into decentralized crypto exchange Hyperliquid and opened a long ETH position with 5x leverage at $1,624.

Fossil fuels drive most mining-related emissions. Experts urge federal action to close regulatory gaps. A newly published peer-reviewed study has raised alarms over the environmental and public health impact of Bitcoin mining in the U.S. According to the research, emissions from major mining facilities emit dangerous fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which travels far beyond its local environment and harms millions of Americans in distant states. PM2.5 Pollution from Bitcoin Mining Exposes 1.9 Million Americans Published in Nature Communications on March 26, the study titled “The environmental burden of the United States’ bitcoin mining boom” was led by Dr. Francesca Dominici of Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. JUST IN: HARVARD-LED STUDY REVEALS BITCOIN MINING SPREADS FOSSIL-FUELED AIR POLLUTION ACROSS U.S. STATES, IMPACTING OVER 1.9M PEOPLE — Coinwaft (@coinwaft) April 14, 2025 The researchers examined the top 34 Bitcoin data mining facilities in the U.S. between August 2022 and July 2023. Their findings show that these facilities consumed 32.3 terawatt-hours of electricity, 33% more than the entire city of Los Angeles, with 85% of that energy sourced from fossil fuels. As a result, this mining activity exposed an estimated 1.9 million Americans to elevated PM2.5 levels. Bitcoin mines cause air pollution/ Source: Nature Communications New York City, the Houston/Austin corridor, northeast Texas, and parts of the Illinois/Kentucky border were identified as zones with the highest exposure. Residents in these regions were exposed to ≥0.5 μg/m³ of additional PM2.5 directly attributable to Bitcoin mining, a concentration linked to increased health risks and premature deaths. A key concern is the cross-border nature of the pollution. The study cites examples like residents in Metropolis, Illinois, who are exposed to PM2.5 emissions from a power plant in Kentucky that supports a Bitcoin mine in North Carolina. Cross-border nature of the Bitcoin mines pollution/ Source: Nature Communications Such cases expose a regulatory blind spot, state governments lack jurisdiction to control pollution caused by out-of-state activities. The study suggests the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could address this with a “Good Neighbor” rule that mandates upwind states to curb power plant emissions more aggressively. Growing Scrutiny of Bitcoin Mining Environmental Toll This isn’t the first time Bitcoin mining has drawn criticism for its environmental footprint. In March 2024, a Pennsylvania-based NGO, Save Carbon County, sued Stronghold Digital Mining for allegedly burning waste coal and tires to generate electricity. The lawsuit, filed in a state court, is the first of its kind to invoke Pennsylvania’s constitutional right to a clean environment as a basis to challenge the state’s approval of crypto mining permits. At a global level, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has flagged crypto mining as a rising energy threat. In an August 2024 report, the IMF estimated that cryptocurrency mining and data centers now consume 2% of total global electricity . In response, the IMF has proposed a bold measure – an 85% increase in electricity taxes on crypto miners. Such a levy could generate $5.2 billion annually and slash carbon emissions by 100 million tons, comparable to Belgium’s yearly emissions. Mixed Industry Response and Sustainable Innovation Not everyone agrees with the gloomy outlook for Bitcoin mining. Mason Jappa, CEO of U.S.-based mining firm Blockware Solutions, criticized a recent study’s assumptions , claiming it relied on outdated mining hardware efficiency figures, which may overstate energy consumption. At the same time, sustainable innovation within the mining sector is beginning to emerge. In Finland, infrastructure firm Hashlabs Mining launched a pilot project using hydro-cooled WhatsMiner M63S ASIC rigs to produce hot water as a byproduct of Bitcoin mining. This heat is then redirected through district heating networks to warm households, a rare case where crypto mining energy is repurposed for community benefit.

This latest buy brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 4,525 BTC, valued at about $386.3 million. Relentless Bitcoin Accumulation The publicly traded company listed on the Tokyo Exchange has been steadily building its Bitcoin treasury since 2023 through a combination of strategic financial maneuvers. It employs a multi-pronged approach, using direct market purchases, cash-secured puts options, and capital market financing to maximize its BTC acquisition while minimizing costs. Metaplanet also uses a key metric to track its performance: BTC Yield. It measures the growth of the company’s Bitcoin holdings relative to outstanding shares. In the final quarter of 2024, the firm reported an astounding 309.8% yield. However, in Q1 2025, the metric dropped to 95.6%, and since the beginning of April, it has stood at 6.5%. The latest purchase pushes Metaplanet into the top 10 global corporate holders of Bitcoin, surpassing firms like Semler Scientific and Bitcoin Group. It also brings its overall ownership of BTC’s total supply to about 0.02%. This year alone, the company has made more than eight purchases. In March, it broke past the 3,000 BTC mark, buying 162 BTC for $13.5 million at an average price of $83,123. On April 1, Metaplanet reached another milestone when its Bitcoin stash hit the 4,000 BTC milestone after it added another 696 BTC bought via cash-secured put options. According to CEO Simon Gerovich, the Japanese firm is targeting 10,000 BTC by the end of the year and 21,000 BTC by 2026, equivalent to 0.1% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. Towards this end, it recently welcomed Eric Trump, the second son of the US. President Donald Trump, to its new strategic advisory board. The younger Trump, who has called Bitcoin “one of the greatest stores of value,” is a key figure in his family’s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, and is expected to help push Metaplanet’s ambitious BTC acquisition plan. Market Reaction Meanwhile, the number one cryptocurrency is demonstrating a measure of resilience. Currently trading at $84,431, it is down just 0.2% in the last 24 hours. Despite this minor blip, the asset has jumped almost 10% over the past seven days, markedly outperforming the broader crypto market, which went up 5.3% in the same period.

43344717,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=709937,1744668000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43344717.jpeg,"Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), or Ruvi AI (RUVI)? Why Investors Are Betting Big On This New AI Altcoin",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-cardano-ada-or-ruvi-ai-ruvi-why-investors-are-betting-big-on-this-new-ai-altcoin/,"Cardano and Solana have built a strong reputation in the crypto world as leaders in scalability and innovation. Both have established themselves with impressive ecosystems and loyal communities. But as investors keep looking for the next big opportunity, a rising star named Ruvi AI (RUVI) is getting all the attention. This emerging altcoin combines blockchain and artificial intelligence, a game changing opportunity for investors looking for massive ROI. With its innovative features, strategic presale pricing and unique rewards systems, Ruvi AI is becoming one of the most talked about projects in the market. The presale got investors attention fast and reached its first milestone in just a few days after launch, raising over 100,000$ with more than 10M tokens sold. What Is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI is a revolutionary platform that brings together blockchain and artificial intelligence to create a next generation ecosystem. Through its AI powered superapp , users can generate text, images, audio and even video with cutting edge AI tools. This real world utility sets Ruvi apart from many speculative altcoins. With applications for content creators, businesses and blockchain enthusiasts, Ruvi offers more than just advanced technology, it provides a practical solution for decentralized AI tools, which means sustained growth. But what’s driving the current hype around Ruvi AI? A mix of investor friendly rewards systems, promising beta developments and exponential growth potential. VIP Tier Rewards That Double Your Investment One of Ruvi AI’s most attractive features is its VIP tier rewards system , designed to multiply returns for early adopters during the presale phase. Investors who commit more will get more tokens as a bonus, so their holdings will increase. For example, those who buy 500,000 RUVI tokens or more qualify for the VIP 5 Tier Bonus , which gives a 100% token bonus . So an investor who buys $5,000 at the presale price of $0.01 per token will get 1,000,000 tokens instead of 500,000. The listing price projected by the developers of $0.07 will turn this investment into $70,000 right after the token’s listing. If analysts’ predictions of $1.00 token value after it’s launch happen, the value of those tokens will be $1,000,000 , meaning life changing returns for early investors. A Competitive Edge with Leaderboard Rewards Ruvi AI takes its rewards program to the next level with its Leaderboard Rewards system , adding more value for top contributors during the presale. This gamified approach encourages bigger investments and rewards individuals based on their ranking among other participants. The Top 10 contributors will get 500,000 bonus tokens , a big bonus to their holdings. Those in the Top 50 will get 200,000 tokens , while those in the Top 200 will get 75,000 tokens . This competitive element makes the presale more exciting and ensures committed investors walk away with maximum rewards. For those looking for high returns, Ruvi’s leaderboard program is another layer of profitability. Beta Release Unlocks Real-World Potential Many crypto projects launch without any progress, but Ruvi AI is already showing its capabilities through its Beta release . The platform’s beta phase allows users to try out its AI driven tools from generating creative content to using Ruvi’s blockchain based infrastructure. This early demo is a proof of Ruvi’s commitment to bring its vision to life. Investors can already see how Ruvi’s utility will work in real world applications, which adds a level of transparency and credibility rarely seen in initial coin offerings. A crypto analyst said about Ruvi’s beta, “Many projects launch with promises, but Ruvi AI allows investors and users to see its technology in action. This is a big credibility boost for the project and a sign that it’s ready for mass adoption.” Unmatched ROI Potential The opportunity to buy tokens at Ruvi AI’s presale price of $0.01 is an almost unheard of entry point into a high potential project. According to industry experts, the token has what it takes to reach $0.15 per token after launch , a 1400% increase from its initial price. Here’s the scenario for an average investment of $1,000: At $0.01 per token, $1,000 gets you 100,000 tokens . Once the token hits $0.15, that same $1,000 becomes $15,000 . If Ruvi AI reaches its long term target of $1 per token , your $1,000 investment becomes $100,000 . These numbers are why the buzz is building around Ruvi AI in the investment community. A blockchain expert says Ruvi’s tech-first approach could take it even higher. “Ruvi AI stands out by delivering real world value from day one. Its utility and adoption potential makes it a long term winner.” Why Ruvi AI beats the competition Cardano and Solana are two of the most respected projects in crypto but Ruvi AI is carving out its own space with its unique AI and blockchain combination. While Cardano focuses on scalability and Solana on speed, Ruvi’s niche is functional AI applications with tangible benefits for its users. This makes Ruvi AI a one of a kind asset and a crypto that solves problems not just creates hype. With its presale price, bonus rewards and strong projections Ruvi ticks all the boxes for investors looking to grow their portfolio. Don’t miss out on Ruvi AI’s $0.01 entry price Timing is everything in crypto and Ruvi AI’s presale is an opportunity you won’t want to miss. With low presale price, big bonuses and massive ROI potential the case for Ruvi is clear. Whether you want to diversify your portfolio or take a chance on an altcoin with high potential Ruvi AI is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a game changing technology project. With its rewards structure and growing momentum the clock is ticking to take advantage of what could be the altcoin of the decade.

Chainlink (LINK) is gaining traction with a rise in large investor activity, while Avalanche (AVAX) is making a modest recovery but struggling with stiff resistance. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is showing what consistent delivery looks like—securing $214 million in presale funds and launching a live Testnet that’s already being used. These projects illustrate three stages of market maturity: Chainlink is rising on renewed trust, Avalanche is navigating pressure zones, and BlockDAG is turning plans into action. Chainlink’s Rising Whale Activity Suggests a Bigger Move Is Brewing Chainlink’s steady growth has now caught the eye of analysts, and the numbers back up the excitement. A 178% spike in high-volume transactions took place within 24 hours—adding up to over $166 million. This kind of movement, mostly from whales or large investors, often hints at broader momentum shifts. The immediate effect was a 10.2% price boost, pushing LINK up to $11.80. But this rise looks like more than a short-term bounce. Chainlink continues to play a critical role in blockchain data with its oracle solutions and network integrations. It’s proving to be a long-term infrastructure player, not just another trading token. If this investor activity keeps climbing, Chainlink could aim for its 2021 highs again. Still, lasting gains will depend on whether this early movement turns into a larger wave of user adoption and trading volume. Avalanche’s Uptrend Slows as Resistance Builds Avalanche has recovered above $16, but the climb looks far from easy. Price analysts highlight a major resistance band between $17.78 and $19.62—where more than 14 million AVAX sit across 155,000 wallets currently underwater. That means a lot of holders may sell to recover losses, creating strong sell pressure at those levels. Technicals support the cautious mood. The Chaikin Money Flow indicator remains in negative territory, signaling distribution is ongoing instead of new accumulation. Even with its recent 10% gain, traders are holding off, waiting for a clearer bullish signal before entering fully. BlockDAG Raises $214M, Launches Live Testnet, & Offers $60K in Real Rewards While many projects react to market waves, BlockDAG is setting its own. It has already pulled in $214 million through its presale—without the help of venture capital or social media hype. With 19.2 billion BDAG sold so far, the demand is clear and growing. The difference lies in what BlockDAG is doing. Its Beta Testnet went live in March and offers a real experience: users can mint NFTs, deploy smart contracts, test dApps, and create tokens without writing code. It’s not just a demo—it’s running with an active user base. The upgraded explorer, improved functionality, and user-friendly design make it a standout. To reward early involvement, BlockDAG launched a $60,000 campaign that gives back to the most active users. The top 10 wallets by transaction activity, top 10 miner nodes, and top 10 by testnet holdings will each receive $2,000 in BDAG tokens—real, mainnet tokens—not test versions. All current buyers are also receiving 10,000 testnet tokens, vested over four weeks, to simulate the actual launch environment. These tokens can be viewed and managed directly through BlockDAG’s dApp and on-chain explorer. What makes BlockDAG truly unique is its technical design. It combines DAG-based block processing with the proven security of Proof-of-Work. This hybrid setup allows thousands of transactions per second and near-instant confirmations. As CTO Jeremy Harkness explained at Keynote 3: “Our hybrid consensus mechanism combines the best of two worlds: the security and proven robustness of Proof-of-Work with the flexibility and speed of a Directed Acyclic Graph.” At launch, BlockDAG aims to handle 2,000 TPS and scale to 15,000 TPS within two years. With a roadmap targeting over 1,000 dApps by 2026 and rising institutional interest, BlockDAG is quickly transforming into a serious Layer-1 project. Closing Thoughts Chainlink is gaining traction through renewed whale interest and ongoing developer integrations. Avalanche is showing signs of recovery but still faces pressure at critical levels. And then there’s BlockDAG—delivering real products, engaging users, and rewarding participation now, not later. With $214 million already raised, a working Testnet, and a strong roadmap across DeFi, AI, and governance, BlockDAG stands out as a clear contender for one of 2025’s most valuable crypto platforms. For forward-thinking buyers, this is no longer about what might happen—it’s about what’s already unfolding.

Referring to this zone as “XRP Reaching C Top,” she pointed out that this level aligns precisely with the upper boundary of the latest three-wave ABC pattern. From her perspective, that tap near $2.24 has now triggered bearish signals on the RSI, suggesting a potential short-term reversal, indicating that a deeper correction may be around the corner. Where Is XRP Heading Next? “Either one of these major supports could be XRP’s next pivot,” Casie stated when describing two possible retracement zones at $1.90 and $1.55. She labeled $1.90 as the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement and “a critical backtest area,” while identifying $1.55 as “the golden .618 Fib retrace” and a prime candidate for what Elliott Wave theorists might see as a Wave 2 corrective low. Related Reading: XRP Outflows Cross $300 Million In April, Why The Price Could Crash Further On her chart, these price levels are marked as major supports that could each prompt an eventual pivot toward higher highs. According to Casie, the overarching bullish structure remains intact, with the short-term dip now needed for confirmation before any renewed push upward. In her follow-up commentary, Casie reiterated her bullish stance by saying, “Breakout to new highs in April! Remember, ANY wave 3 extension target is valid—6.50 USD, 9.50 USD, 13 USD, 26 USD.” This statement aligns with her broader Elliott Wave Theory approach, in which she sees the current corrective leg as a precursor to a potentially powerful third wave extension. Her chart, originally shared in mid-March under the heading “XRP Holding Strong, But Still in Waiting Mode!,” showed that the project was already holding above $2.26, a level she called “the key .382 retracement support,” while pinpointing higher upside targets at $2.70 and $3.05 once the market confirms another upward wave. Casie further mentioned that “XRP needs to break above $3.40 to confirm our new trend,” explaining that until that happens, the next big move remains in question. Traders who follow her work will note that the RSI divergence visible on multiple timeframes has added to short-term bearish concerns, but the medium- to long-term picture, in Casie’s view, still indicates scope for a new rally once price revisits and confirms support. Related Reading: XRP Targets $19 Or $45 In Possible Blow-Off Top, Analyst Predicts As of now, all eyes remain on whether XRP’s pullback finds support at one of Casie’s highlighted Fibonacci levels. The price briefly breached $2.20 but has since shown signs of faltering momentum, leaving traders to watch if $1.90 —or ultimately $1.55 —will emerge as a pivotal bounce zone. If XRP does stabilize at or above those areas, sentiment could shift once more toward fresh highs, especially if the broader market cooperates. Casie’s scenario of a wave 3 extension toward targets above $6 remains on the table, but the immediate question is how the asset handles this retracement phase. The structure still appears bullish overall, yet the coming sessions will be critical in determining whether XRP’s current pullback lays the foundation for a sustained next leg higher. At press time, XRP traded at $2.16.

In a new blog post, Vitalik Buterin says that as AI bots get better and better at scraping data, so does the need for privacy. The Ethereum co-founder says that zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and obfuscation technologies are far better than what the cypherpunks of the 90s could have imagined. “Today, however, privacy can no longer be ignored. AI is greatly increasing capabilities for centralized data collection and analysis while greatly expanding the scope of data that we share voluntarily. In the future, newer technologies like brain-computer interfaces bring further challenges: we may be literally talking about AI reading our minds. At the same time, we have more powerful tools to preserve privacy, especially in the digital realm, than the 1990s cypherpunks could have imagined… Without privacy, everything becomes a constant battle of ‘what will other people (and bots) think of what I’m doing’ – powerful people, companies, and peers, people today and in the future. With privacy, we can preserve a balance. Today, that balance is being rapidly eroded, especially in the physical realm, and the default path of modern techno-capitalism, with its hunger for business models that find ways to capture value from users without asking them to explicitly pay for things, is to erode it further (even into highly sensitive domains like, eventually, our own minds)…” While he supports limiting some privacy – such as for large corporations or powerful individuals – Buterin says that the much bigger risk is an erosion of privacy, especially for regular people. “Society has always depended on a balance between privacy and transparency. In some cases, I support limits to privacy too… But from a macro perspective, the most pressing risk of near-future technology is that privacy will approach all-time lows, and in a highly imbalanced way where the most powerful individuals and the most powerful nations get lots of data on everyone, and everyone else will see close to nothing. For this reason, supporting privacy for everyone, and making the necessary tools open-source, universal, reliable and safe is one of the important challenges of our time.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Meanwhile, Mantra CEO John Mullin has denied claims of insider token sales by investors — including Laser Digital — ahead of OM’s 90% price crash, despite onchain data suggesting otherwise. Mullin also pointed to a specific exchange that may have contributed to the token’s sudden collapse. Anchorage Digital faces scrutiny from US Homeland Security — Report The US Department of Homeland Security's El Dorado Task Force has reportedly launched an investigation into Anchorage Digital Bank, a Wall Street-backed cryptocurrency firm. According to an April 14 Barron's report, members of the task force have contacted former employees of the company over the past weeks to examine its practices and policies. The report cites unidentified sources. The reported Homeland task force probe hints at cross-national financial activities. Established in 1992, the El Dorado Task Force focuses on “transnational money laundering” activities and financial crimes carried out by organizations. Anchorage is co-founded by Portuguese-American entrepreneur Diogo Mónica and Nathan McCauley, according to its website. Along with its US businesses, Anchorage has operations in Singapore and Portugal. Its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Goldman Sachs and Visa, among others. Mantra CEO denies insider OM token dump, says Arkham “mislabeled” wallets Mantra CEO John Mullin denied reports suggesting large-scale token transfers by major Mantra investors in the days leading up to the sharp collapse of the OM token, while speaking in an AMA hosted by Cointelegraph on April 14. “The Mantra association, our key investors, our advisers — no one has sold, and we are going to categorically deny and also provide verifiable proof onchain proof that this is the case,” Mullin stated in the AMA. Previous reports suggested that Laser Digital, a strategic Mantra investor, cashed out large portions of Mantra (OM) tokens before the cryptocurrency collapsed on April 13 . At least two wallets linked to Laser Digital were among 17 wallets that moved a combined 43.6 million OM tokens — worth about $227 million at the time — to exchanges before the crash, the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain reported on April 13, citing Arkham Intelligence data. Source: Lookonchain Laser Digital is a digital asset business backed by Nomura. The firm announced a strategic investment in Mantra in May 2024. According to Arkham data, one Laser Digital-linked wallet had moved about 6.5 million OM tokens ($41.6 million at the time) to OKX in seven transactions since April 11. The last recorded transaction from the wallet occurred on April 11 at around 10:00 pm UTC, days before the Mantra crash, which took place on April 13 at roughly 7:00 pm UTC, according to data from CoinGecko. Another wallet sent about 2.2 million OM (worth $13 million) to Binance in a series of transfers starting April 3. The data also indicated that Laser Digital may have started reducing its OM holdings as early as February. The wallets linked to the firm reportedly received a large portion of their OM from crypto trading firm GSR in 2023. Mantra (OM) outflows from one of the wallets linked to Laser Digital. Source: Arkham Laser Digital subsequently denied reports alleging its involvement in the OM volatility, claiming that the referenced wallets did not belong to it. Mantra says one exchange “in particular” may have caused OM collapse The team behind real-world tokenized asset blockchain Mantra says its native token’s sudden 90% plunge was caused by exchanges forcibly closing positions without notice, with one currently unnamed exchange potentially to blame. On April 13, Mantra ( OM ) price dropped from $6.30 to below $0.50 , rapidly shedding over 90% of its $6 billion market cap. Source: John Mullin “We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders,” Mantra co-founder John Mullin wrote in an April 13 statement on X. “The timing and depth of the crash suggest that a very sudden closure of account positions was initiated without sufficient warning or notice,” he added. Mullin told an X user they believe one exchange “in particular” was to blame but said they were still “figuring out the details.” He told others that the centralized exchange in question wasn’t Binance.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TRADING|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-14 22:02:20

Xi-Trump meeting could revive markets as dollar drops. NYT bestselling author Kiyosaki wants investors to choose Bitcoin over traditional currency as the asset holds steady at $84K. Recent data revealed that 12 U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows of $708.9 million. At the heart of this shift is the escalating tension between the US-China trade tension, sparked by President Trump’s aggressive tariff proposals. Nearly $1 Billion Withdrawn From Bitcoin ETFs Since April According to data from Farside, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs continue facing consistent withdrawals in April. From April 7 to 11, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw recorded daily outflows, closing every trading day in the red. Last week started with $103.9 million pulled on Monday, followed by $326.3 million on Tuesday, $127.2 million on Wednesday, $149.5 million on Thursday, and $1 million on Friday. BlackRock’s IBIT led the wave, shedding $342.6 million. Grayscale’s GBTC followed with $160.9 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw a $74.6 million exit. Smaller funds, including BITB, BTCO, ARKB, EZBC, BTCW, and HODL, collectively lost tens of millions, with individual outflows between $11 million and $38 million. Only one product managed to defy the trend. Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin Trust reported $2.4 million in inflows. Valkyrie’s BRRR ETF saw no activity at all. This steady decline isn’t new. Outflows began accelerating in late March. Between March 31 and April 4, total net outflows across all 12 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $172.89 million . That pullback ended a two-week inflow streak that had brought in $941 million. Less than halfway through April, the total net outflows from Bitcoin ETFs approach the $1 billion mark. Adding to the gloomy picture, Ethereum ETFs have also struggled. Farside’s data shows ETH ETF withdrawals rose 65% to $82.47 million last week. This marks the seventh consecutive week of Ethereum outflows, totaling over $877 million. 145% vs 125% Tariffs: How Long Will the US-China Trade Tensions Last? One major shadow looming over Bitcoin ETFs is the renewed US-China trade tension. The uncertainty began in early April when President Trump proposed a flat 10% tariff on all imports. But the situation escalated quickly. On April 9, President Trump announced an unexpected 125% tariff targeting Chinese goods while extending a 90-day delay for other nations. He cited unfair trade practices from Beijing as justification. However, China did not stay quiet. In retaliation, Chinese officials imposed up to 125% tariffs on American products and halted the export of rare-earth minerals, critical components for tech manufacturing and clean energy sectors. TRADE WAR TWIST: CHINA MATCHES U.S TARIFFS, THEN CALLS TIME-OUT After Beijing dropped a massive 125% tariff on U.S goods – effective tomorrow – it announced it won’t retaliate to any further U.S hikes. China slammed Washington’s tariffs as “abnormally high,” “unilateral… https://t.co/FMlySYbWRF pic.twitter.com/HV0vW4AExe — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) April 11, 2025 Beijing described Washington’s move as excessive and damaging to global trade rules. Chinese authorities criticized the tariffs as one-sided, disruptive, and out of step with common sense economics. Veteran investor and gold advocate Peter Schiff pointed out the dollar’s weakness , noting its sharp decline against the euro, yen, and Swiss franc, falling more than 2.3% and, in some cases, close to 4%. He further questioned whether the U.S. was truly gaining from these confrontational trade tactics. Still, all may not be lost. Behind closed doors, there are whispers that President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are set to meet. Discussions could be underway to de-escalate and bring both nations back to the negotiating table. If so, it might cool tensions and restore some confidence in the markets, including the crypto space. Bitcoin Market Outlook: Is a Price Rebound and Global Adoption Underway? Despite ETF outflows, Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, has climbed back above $84,000 after dipping near $76,000 the previous week. The rebound looks solid. Technical indicators show continued support along an upward trendline. The 50-period exponential moving average, currently at $82,530, has served as a reliable cushion. Traders seem optimistic, and momentum remains intact. Meanwhile, influential voices echo through the market noise. Robert Kiyosaki, NYT bestselling author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad, champions Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial ecosystem. PLEASE LISTEN to Gold, Silver, & Bitcoin. What are they telling you? Gold is at an all time high, demand for silver is exploding, and Bitcoin is roaring. Are you listening? REPEATING MYSELF, I warned of the biggest stock and bond market crash in history was coming in my… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 13, 2025 He sent out a warning to his millions of followers. Kiyosaki raised concerns about the dollar’s diminishing purchasing power. “PLEASE LISTEN to Gold, Silver, & Bitcoin,” he insisted, pointing to Bitcoin as a strategic hedge against inflation—a digital fortress in uncertain times. He further described Bitcoin as a people-powered currency, an asset outside the control of governments. Meanwhile, Bitcoin adoption is spreading beyond the investing class. Recently, Lomond School in Scotland announced it would accept Bitcoin for tuition starting in the Autumn 2025 semester. This marks the first time a U.K. school has embraced digital currency in such a direct way. Last year, the University of Wyoming created a dedicated Bitcoin Research Institute , and the University of Austin recently allocated $5 million of its $200 million endowment to Bitcoin in early 2025. The trend is clear. While the US-China trade tension and President Trump’s economic moves may trigger short-term volatility, Bitcoin continues to gain traction globally. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How do Bitcoin ETFs differ from traditional stock ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin, giving investors cryptocurrency exposure without direct ownership. Think of them as gateways. Traditional stock ETFs, however, spread your investment across multiple stocks or bonds, delivering wider market coverage and risk distribution. Which economy is bigger, the U.S. or China? The U.S. dominates as the world’s largest economy by nominal GDP, while China follows closely behind. The picture changes when you look deeper. Since 2020, the IMF has recognized China as the global economic leader when measured by purchasing power parity (PPP)—a metric that accounts for cost-of-living differences between countries.
