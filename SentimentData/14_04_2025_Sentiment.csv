Cardano (ADA) also appears set for a price increase. Investors might find it an opportune moment to consider these digital assets. The forthcoming analysis reveals which cryptocurrencies are primed for a bullish run and why they deserve attention now. Cardano: Recent Trends and Key Price Levels in Focus ADA price action over the past month shows a modest drop of roughly 8%, with weekly declines near 1.22%. Over the last six months, Cardano has surged close to 77%, marking a strong upward push for longer-term holders. This blend of short-term softness paired with solid long-term gains highlights a period of volatility and gradual recovery. Current levels see Cardano trading between $0.47 and $1.02, with resistance around $1.37 and support near $0.27. Technical signals point to a slight bearish leaning without a decisive trend, presenting a range-bound market. Traders might consider buying near support and testing resistance while keeping an eye on any emerging breakouts. Hedera HBAR: Six-Month Surge Meets Short-Term Correction Over the past month, HBAR price declined nearly 9.6%, while the six-month period delivered a robust 219% gain. Prices ranged between $0.117 and $0.248, indicating a volatile swing that contrasts short-term pullbacks with long-term upward momentum. This behavior shows clear recovery potential even amid recent dips. Current price action trades within the $0.117-$0.248 corridor, with immediate resistance at $0.33 and a further hurdle at $0.47. Support appears near $0.07. Despite strong long-term gains, short-term indicators lean slightly bearish with an RSI around 48. Traders may look for a steady break above $0.33 while watching for reversals near support levels. Conclusion ADA and HBAR have shown promising potential for growth. Both coins have unique features and strong communities supporting them. The bullish outlook for HBAR and the anticipated price rise for ADA highlight their attractiveness. This could be a good time to consider investing in these two assets. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With the continued rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the growing adoption of blockchain technology, it’s important to keep an eye on the projects that are standing out. These aren’t just flashy names but solid, long-term alternatives to traditional investment avenues. Among these projects, Qubetics , SEI, and Injective have firmly established themselves as key players. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what each one brings to the table, their milestones, and how they position themselves as alternatives to traditional investments.

They represent the forward-thinking alternatives that discerning crypto backers are turning to, while traditional financial markets continue to rely on outdated models.

43303102,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104907,1744579470,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Tron Founder Celebrates 300 Million Addresses as TRX Crosses $0.25,https://zycrypto.com/tron-founder-celebrates-300-million-addresses-as-trx-crosses-0-25/,"Tron (TRX) founder Justin Sun recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to celebrate a major milestone for his digital currency network. The crypto entrepreneur claimed that the programmable blockchain now boasts massive accounts, totaling 300 million worldwide. This figure dwarfs the 1 billion+ figure commanded by Bitcoin, but it is only slightly less than Ethereum’s 321 million public addresses. It is a massive achievement by the Tron Foundation, considering its standing in the charts. In the same tweet, Sun revealed that the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the crypto’s staking and DeFi ecosystem is nearing record highs and hovering just below $20 billion. At the same time, the total transfer volume, another on-chain statistic, is close to $17 trillion. These figures are being used by Sun to drum up support for his altcoin, and the price has since surpassed the resistance at around $0.25. However, the move above this figure has been less than convincing, and the crypto could face some pressure going into the first day of the new week. Does Tron Boast 300 Million Users? Despite Sun’s claim of hundreds of millions of users, on further on-chain investigation, it was found out by the ZyCrypto team that the founder is conflating the number of users with the number of blockchain addresses created on the network. This is often used by promoters looking to get their cryptocurrency into discussion circles on social media. The reality is that this metric is far from a reliable statistic when calculating the number of users of a blockchain network because a single user can create multiple accounts, as they have done for all major blockchains. According to Dune Analytics , this is the graph of active addresses on the TRX blockchain: Image Source: Dune Analytics Currently, the number of active daily addresses on the Tron network hovers around 13.6 million, which is a healthy figure but only a fraction of the figure claimed by Sun. Many users also maintain multiple active addresses, so the actual figure is likely to be even lower. There is no concrete way of knowing the exact number of unique individual users using TRX, but it is expected to be in several million. Is Tron back? Tron has had a strong last two to three quarters as it managed to capture the attention of the market after several years of relative hiatus. The cryptocurrency was launched during the first altcoin boom of 2017-2018 and experienced massive gains before capitulating much of them in a major crash in 2018 that wiped out more than 90% of its value. TRX then had a lacklustre 2020-2021 bull market, fading away in the coin market charts. However, 2024 saw the once-fancied digital cryptocurrency awaken from its deep slumber and post a new All-Time High (ATH) of $0.45 in the buildup of the calendar year. While TRX has lost around 45% of its value ever since amid even deeper short-term plunges, the altcoin could be in for a major end to 2025 if the larger bull market resumes at some point in 2025.",Cryptocurrency|News|Tron News|TRX,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|TRX,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-13 21:24:30

Despite this decline, SHIB has fared better than Dogecoin (DOGE), which has seen a steeper drop of 27% over the same period. The downturn aligns with a broader cryptocurrency market correction, led by Bitcoin’s fall below the $78,000 mark. Notably, even before the latest market decline, on-chain data signaled diminishing interest in SHIB. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently highlighted this trend tweeting , “Whale activity on the ShibaInu network has declined by 79% over the past three months.” Despite the recent weakness, some analysts remain optimistic about SHIB’s potential. On Wednesday, analyst Javon Marks pointed to a bullish chart formation that suggests a massive rally could be on the horizon. “SHIB (Shiba Inu) prices maintaining the structure of a large Inverse Head & Shoulder and with the $0.000081 target still in play, an over 402% run to reach it could come out of this.” He tweeted. Meanwhile, other indicators point to signs of accumulation and a possible reversal for SHIB. The price is currently consolidating, with the RSI at 54.72, indicating neutral momentum. While buying pressure is present, it remains insufficient for a breakout. The Stochastic RSI at 54.72/57.76 has cooled off but could signal renewed buying if it turns upward. A move above 60 RSI may spark an uptrend, while a drop below 50 could signal further downside. At the same time, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is flattening from bearish territory, hinting at a possible shift in momentum. Additionally, although trading volume has only increased by 13% in the past 24 hours to $312 million, it still signals ongoing accumulation. Beyond price action, SHIB’s ecosystem continues to expand with key developments aimed at improving liquidity and user experience. Earlier this week, the Shiba Inu team introduced upgraded liquidity pools designed to enhance liquidity management. The update allows users to seamlessly migrate, import, or create liquidity pools, streamlining the process. These advancements have generated significant interest in Shiba Inu, driving a surge in wallet addresses on its Ethereum Layer 2 network. Over the past week, the number of wallet addresses has skyrocketed by around 500%, jumping from approximately 9.4 million on February 17 to over 55.7 million as of February 24. Another bullish factor for SHIB is its increasing token burn rate. On Thursday, the Shiba Inu burn rate spiked by over 1,300%, removing over 30 million SHIB tokens from circulation in just one day. Token burning helps reduce supply, making SHIB scarcer, which could positively impact its price in the long run. At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.000012, reflecting a 3.91% drop in the past 24 hours.",Cryptocurrency|News|SHIB|SHIBA INU,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-13 21:37:03

On April 13, Lutnick told ABC News that the reciprocal tariff exemption was temporary until the administration established a sector tariff regime for semiconductor products, which includes phones, graphics processors, and computing chips in a ""month or two."" Lutnick added: ""President Trump has called out pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos. He called them sector tariffs, and those are not available for negotiation. They are just going to be part of making sure we ensure core national security items are made in this country."" ""We can't be relying on China for fundamental things we need. Our medicines and our semiconductors need to be built in America,"" Lutnick continued. The official also said he was confident that the US and China would arrive at a trade deal through negotiations. The emphasis on national security and onshoring critical industries could signal that the trade tariffs will be a long-term geostrategic policy and not simply a short-term negotiation tactic to make US exports more attractive, as some analysts have suggested. The Volatility S&P Index (VIX), a measure of the S&P stock index’s volatility, remains elevated amid macroeconomic uncertainty. Source: TradingView Related: Bitcoin ‘decouples,’ stocks lose $3.5T amid Trump tariff war and Fed warning of ‘higher inflation’ Trade war heightens volatility and sends markets tumbling Trump's trade tariffs crashed the stock and crypto markets , wiping away trillions in shareholder value as investors dumped riskier assets on fears of a lengthy trade war between the United States and its trading partners. In an April 10 X Post , Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas cited the SPY US Equity History Volume chart as evidence that the S&P 500 stock market index is now more volatile than Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to the analyst, the S&P 500 Index hit a volatility level of 74 in April, compared to Bitcoin's 71. Stocks and crypto pumped following rumors of the Trump administration initiating a 90-day reciprocal tariff pause. Approximately $2 trillion was pumped into stocks on rumors of softer trade policies. Much of this value was then wiped away when Trump claimed that rumors of a 90-day pause were false and returned once the Trump administration did, in fact, issue a reciprocal tariff pause in the following days.

Here’s The Implication,https://timestabloid.com/stellar-xlm-forms-triangle-pattern-heres-the-implication/,"Stellar (XLM), the digital asset powering cross-border payments and smart contract capabilities on the Stellar blockchain, is currently displaying a technical formation that could ignite a significant price move. According to renowned crypto analyst Ali, who shared the observation via X, XLM is forming a classic triangle pattern, a well-known setup in technical analysis that typically precedes a breakout. #Stellar $XLM is forming a triangle pattern that could lead to a 15% price move! pic.twitter.com/zDUf3weYHe — Ali (@ali_charts) April 12, 2025 Technical Analysis Points to Impending Volatility The triangle pattern indicates market consolidation, where price action narrows as buyers and sellers converge in anticipation of a breakout. In Stellar’s case, the tightening range is likely a prelude to increased volatility. Based on Ali’s assessment, this pattern could result in a price move of approximately 15% once a breakout direction is confirmed. Analysts often regard triangle patterns as continuation or reversal signals depending on the preceding trend. Stellar’s recent tight trading range sets the stage for a potential breakout, which could spark renewed buying or selling momentum. If bulls push the price above the upper trendline with robust volume, XLM could see a rally toward key resistance zones. Conversely, a breakdown could test previous support levels. Broader Market Context and Stellar’s Fundamentals While technical patterns like this triangle provide short-term trading signals, it’s essential to consider the broader market environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum—market leaders—have shown mixed momentum, and their next moves could influence altcoins like Stellar. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory updates, and on-chain developments will influence XLM’s price direction. Stellar remains fundamentally solid, with ongoing development around its smart contract capabilities and cross-border payment utility. The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) continues to pursue partnerships in emerging markets and with financial institutions, reinforcing its relevance as a blockchain platform focused on financial inclusion and interoperability. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Awaits Breakout Confirmation As the triangle pattern narrows and momentum indicators near neutral, traders are awaiting a breakout or breakdown to confirm the potential 15% move predicted by Ali. Traders and investors alike would do well to monitor volume spikes, candlestick formations, and broader market sentiment to navigate the outcome of this setup.

The findings hint at a sector still in its early phases, shaped largely by enthusiasts and trendsetters rather than the broader mainstream. Who’s Driving Crypto AI Hype According to a recent CoinGecko survey , 59.3% of respondents – nearly three in five – identified as pioneers in the crypto AI space, a group composed of 26.6% self-described ‘Innovators’ and 32.7% ‘Early adopters.’ This high concentration of early-stage adopters deviates from the traditional bell curve of technology adoption and suggests that crypto AI is still largely in the hands of tech-forward enthusiasts rather than the broader market. While this may be partially attributed to self-selection bias, given the survey’s appeal to those already interested in the sector, it may also reflect the current positioning of crypto AI as a niche yet rapidly evolving frontier within the broader crypto ecosystem. On the other hand, 34.7% of respondents viewed themselves as part of the ‘mainstream’ adoption phase, comprising 22.8% ‘Early majority’ and 11.9% ‘Late majority.’ This distribution signals that while interest in crypto AI is growing, wider adoption still hinges on demonstrating real-world utility to more cautious users. The remaining 6.1% of participants identified as ‘Laggards’ – those skeptical or resistant to change – indicating a small but notable segment of the community unconvinced by the crypto AI narrative. Novice Polarized Over Crypto AI Adoption Interestingly, adoption attitudes varied based on user experience levels within the crypto space. Participants in their first market cycle showed the most polarized views, with 31.5% identifying as ‘Innovators’ and 7.4% as ‘Laggards,’ a trend likely driven by newcomers entering the market during a wave of AI-related hype . In comparison, more seasoned participants – those in their second cycle or beyond – showed more balanced adoption patterns, with second-cycle users skewing toward the ‘Early majority’ and veterans leaning more toward ‘Innovator’ status.

43303815,https://zycrypto.com/?p=104912,1744580875,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Pundit Shares What Ripple’s XRP Value Will Be If It Replaces SWIFT,https://zycrypto.com/pundit-shares-what-ripples-xrp-value-will-be-if-it-replaces-swift/,"As the global financial system evolves towards faster and more efficient payment solutions, XRP has emerged as a potential disruptor to SWIFT, the longstanding leader in cross-border transactions. Notably, the latest speculation on XRP’s potential to overtake SWIFT has reignited debate, driven by a bold claim from DigitalIG, a former London-based fund manager and outspoken XRP advocate. “When XRP replaces SWIFT, it will be valued beyond $15,000 per token,” he tweeted Saturday. He highlighted that XRP’s design allows for such valuations, as each token can be divided into 1,000,000 smaller units known as drops. Since its establishment in 1973, SWIFT has been the backbone of global finance, connecting over 11,000 financial institutions across more than 200 countries. It processes over $5 trillion in transactions daily, translating to an annual volume of approximately $1.25 quadrillion. However, SWIFT’s reliance on a correspondent banking network often results in inefficiencies, delays, and high costs. These limitations have led financial institutions to explore alternative solutions, with Ripple and its native asset, XRP , emerging as a strong contender by providing real-time settlement using XRP as a bridge currency. Transactions on RippleNet are completed within seconds at a fraction of the cost associated with SWIFT’s traditional multi-day process. That said, the idea of XRP replacing SWIFT has also been supported by various financial analysts, with some estimating that if XRP were to handle 5-10% of SWIFT’s annual transaction volume, its price and market capitalization would need to rise significantly. In October 2024, global investment bank Houlihan Lokey identified Ripple as one of SWIFT’s strongest competitors, citing its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service as a key advantage. Additionally, in January 2025, Mark Yusko, CEO and CIO of the billion-dollar investment fund Morgan Creek Capital Management, expressed interest in supporting XRP if it replaced SWIFT. However, despite its potential, several hurdles must be overcome for XRP to achieve such a valuation. Regulatory clarity remains a significant obstacle, particularly in the U.S., where Ripple has been engaged in a lengthy legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A favorable resolution could boost institutional confidence in XRP and accelerate adoption. Scalability is another critical factor. SWIFT processes enormous transaction volumes daily, and for XRP to compete at this level, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) must be capable of handling similar loads reliably. While the XRPL already enables rapid settlements, further enhancements in liquidity management and infrastructure would be necessary to match SWIFT’s scale. Ripple’s ODL service is actively addressing these challenges, but more work is required before XRP can fully replace SWIFT.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-13 21:47:55

Despite some market fluctuations, Solana could soar to new heights, potentially reaching over $300 by the time of the next Bitcoin halving. However, the next big disruptor in the crypto market is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.6 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 8200 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% payback when the launch price reaches $0.06. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 8200 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $6.6 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. MUTM has introduced tangible features, including a new dashboard leaderboard that tracks its top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. As investors grow more utility-focused, MUTM’s rise signals what could be the next win in crypto, substance over spectacle. The Dual-Model System for Enhanced DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. While Solana (SOL) is primed for a potential rebound, reaching over $300 by the next Bitcoin halving, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could outperform expectations with a forecasted 50x growth. The fourth phase of its presale has already raised $6.6 million, with MUTM tokens priced at $0.025 and set to rise to $0.06 at launch. Don’t miss out on this high-growth opportunity.

Among them Ruvi AI has just launched its presale with a great value proposition driven by its AI powered ecosystem, attractive incentive structure and huge growth potential. Token prices start at $0.01 and you can earn up to 100% bonuses. Ruvi AI has already raised over $100,000 with more than 10M sold in just a few days since launch. AI and Blockchain for Real World Impact Ruvi AI stands out by merging AI and blockchain to create solutions for decentralized applications, content creation and analytics. This positions the project to tap into two big areas of the tech space. Unlike speculative assets Ruvi AI brings a tangible use case to the table catering to industries that are increasingly using AI for efficiency and innovation. The presale is priced at $0.01 per token to attract early adopters looking for high ROI from ground floor investment opportunities. Upon successful launch with a projected listing price of $0.07 those who buy in during the presale will get an immediate 600% return. Such numbers show the growth potential of Ruvi AI and why it’s attractive to both institutional and retail investors. Incentive Structure A key feature of the Ruvi AI presale is the tiered VIP bonus structure which rewards early investors with additional tokens based on their contribution level. Bonuses range from 25% to 100% and shows a clear incentive for big capital commitments. For example, an investor that qualifies for the VIP 5 tier with $5,000 investment gets 500,000 tokens at $0.01 each. But with the 100% bonus in this tier the token count doubles to 1,000,000. So at the projected listing price of $0.07 the total value of the tokens would be $70,000. This shows Ruvi AI not only rewards early participation but also the long term confidence Ruvi AI has in the project. These bonuses complement Ruvi AI’s bigger goal of building a collaborative and invested community. By incentivizing immediate and big commitments Ruvi AI aligns its project goals with investor goals. Leaderboard Rewards for Community Engagement To add more structure to its reward system Ruvi AI has introduced a leaderboard rewards program for its top 1,000 holders. This is designed to encourage long term participation and offers fixed token allocations to investors based on their holdings. This ranges from tens of thousands of additional tokens for mid tier positions to much bigger rewards for top ranked participants. What’s unique about this is its inclusive design. Rewards are distributed on top of the VIP bonuses so it’s an additional layer of benefit to those who are committed to Ruvi AI’s long term vision. By combining financial incentives with community building strategies the project is solidifying its commitment to building an engaged investor base. Ruvi AI’s Growth Potential Ruvi AI’s real world utility, innovative technology and well aligned incentive structure makes it a strong player in the crypto space. The project is riding the growing demand for AI driven solutions and the utility and scalability of blockchain. Analysts are getting more and more optimistic about Ruvi AI’s potential with predictions that the token could reach $1 in the near future. Such a milestone would be a 100x return for early investors and shows the project’s strong growth potential. This is because of Ruvi AI’s integrated utility, AI and blockchain technology and robust incentive structures that has caught attention. Conclusion With $0.01 presale and innovative reward mechanisms Ruvi AI is an interesting option for those looking into new projects with high growth potential. Its dual focus on technology and investor incentives is a solid foundation for building short term and long term value.

Bitcoin, widely seen as the bedrock of the digital asset space, has experienced a notable retreat in price and market cap. Ethereum, though still central to DeFi and smart contracts, has taken an even steeper fall. These movements are prompting investors to reconsider where momentum is truly building. That’s where BlockDAG enters the picture. While many projects remain in the concept stage, BlockDAG is actively rolling out products—its Beta Testnet is live, its miner app has attracted hundreds of thousands, and over 19.2 billion coins have already sold during presale. With $214 million raised so far, BlockDAG is shaping the conversation—not just joining it. For a growing number of buyers, this isn’t a Bitcoin or Ethereum replacement—it’s a new contender with something concrete to offer. Bitcoin Faces Pressure, but Remains a Long-Term Anchor As of April 4, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $83,844 with a total market cap of $1.66 trillion. Just three months earlier, BTC was priced at $98,236 and carried a $1.95 trillion market cap. This marks a 14.7% drop in value and a 14.5% market cap decline over the quarter. Despite the correction, Bitcoin still holds firm as a long-term play. Compared to the same time last year, its market cap has grown nearly 28%—a sign of continued institutional and retail belief. As the original cryptocurrency, it maintains its leadership by market size, even during temporary downtrends. Ethereum Sees a 50% Slide, but Fundamentals Remain Solid Ethereum (ETH) currently sits at $1,805 with a market capitalization of $218.4 billion. Three months ago, ETH was trading at $3,658 with a $440.7 billion market cap. That’s a steep drop—down 50.6% in price and 50.4% in market cap during the first quarter of 2025. This pullback follows a strong year in 2024 and reflects wider market corrections. Yet, Ethereum continues to lead in smart contracts, NFTs, and DeFi. Its scaling solutions and Layer-2 developments are progressing steadily. Although its market cap has declined about 45% year-over-year, Ethereum still holds a central role in Web3’s future. BlockDAG’s Presale Soars Past $214M After Keynote 3 Rollout BlockDAG’s third Keynote wasn’t just an update—it was a game-changer. The live demo of its Beta “Primordial” Testnet and visuals of 10,000 ASIC miners being shipped sent a strong message: this project is executing. With 750,000 users mining via the X1 App and 400,000 playing Tap Miner, the user base is expanding rapidly. In the days following the Keynote, presale numbers surged. BlockDAG crossed $214 million raised, with over 19.2 billion coins sold. At the current Batch 27 price of $0.0248, early adopters have already realized a 2,380% ROI since Batch 1. These aren’t projected gains—they’re realized returns backed by working tech. This kind of growth, coupled with tangible milestones, has made BlockDAG one of the most talked-about presales in crypto. Its hybrid DAG + PoW structure, active user adoption, and clear development roadmap are building serious momentum. Each batch increases in price, meaning delayed action equals higher cost. Keynote 3, for many, was the clear signal to act. With credible infrastructure, a growing ecosystem, and real-time delivery, BlockDAG is attracting buyer interest not by hype—but by proving value. Buyers Are Watching Where Progress Happens While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain dominant names, their recent pullbacks have prompted investors to explore other options. The focus is now shifting toward projects that are actively building and delivering results—something BlockDAG has made central to its strategy. With a working Testnet, a highly engaged community, and $214 million raised, BlockDAG is moving beyond potential—it’s becoming reality. This isn’t about dethroning the giants, but rather identifying where the next wave of growth may come from. As others consolidate or tread water, BlockDAG is advancing on all fronts. In 2025, that kind of momentum is exactly what forward-looking buyers are tracking.

While the Solana (SOL) price today just spiked to $118 on fresh whale activity and XRP technical analysis points to a bullish breakout after Ripple’s $1.25B Hidden Road acquisition, another opportunity is quietly stacking up returns under the radar. BlockDAG , already climbing presale charts with over $214 million raised, now has users buzzing—not just for its coin, but for its affiliate loop. The model? Earn USDT instantly by referring others, then reinvest it to scoop up more BDAG coins. It’s turning $100 into a snowball effect—“USDT in, BDAG up.” Crypto circles are calling it a launchpad with ROI baked in. It’s the kind of setup that’s catching attention from everyone tracking the next top 10 crypto—and it’s happening while most are still watching charts. The Passive Income Loop That’s Fueling BlockDAG’s Growth BlockDAG’s affiliate program is quickly becoming the easiest passive earning play in crypto. With just one referral link, users are getting paid in USDT instantly every time someone buys BDAG coins. But it’s not just about earning—those rewards can be immediately reinvested, creating a compounding loop where your holdings grow without extra effort. It’s why people are saying, “USDT in, BDAG up.” The program lets you earn 6% to 10% cashback per referral, with no cap on how many people you bring in. What makes it different is how fast it works—rewards hit your wallet right after a qualifying buy, and there’s no waiting period or payout limit. People are literally using the same $100 five times—and getting paid each time. It’s simple: share, earn, reinvest, repeat. BlockDAG’s presale is now in its 27th batch, with BDAG priced at $0.0248. Over 19.2 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $214 million—all without any venture capital. Those who joined early are already up over 2,380%. The presale is tied to key launches too, with a beta testnet live, a 150% retro bonus for all buyers, and listings planned on 10 major CEXs. With momentum this strong, it’s no surprise that BlockDAG is being discussed as a top 10 crypto contender. Its affiliate model is adding fuel to that push, creating a snowball effect of users stacking BDAG while they sleep. For anyone eyeing the next top 10 crypto, this loop might be the real alpha. Solana (SOL) Price Today Spikes After Whale Buy Solana (SOL) price today jumped 8% to $118 after a whale snapped up 32,000 SOL for $3.72 million, according to Lookonchain. This sudden move came after weeks of downward pressure and has put Solana back in focus as traders speculate whether it’s building toward another rally. The same whale had also bought at higher levels before—$157 and $216—suggesting long-term confidence despite market dips. Supporters are watching key technical levels, with $112 recently breaking down and $118 now acting as potential resistance. However, the Firedancer upgrade, expected to improve Solana’s speed and scalability, could be a game-changer. Solana (SOL) price today is still far below its all-time high, but the bullish setup around whale accumulation, ETF rumors, and inclusion in U.S. digital asset funds is creating buzz. If the trend holds, SOL could challenge higher zones soon, especially if it breaks resistance and finds support above key EMAs. XRP Technical Analysis Turns Bullish After SEC Update XRP just jumped 30% after Ripple and the SEC filed a joint motion to pause their legal appeals, hinting that a long-awaited settlement could be close. Adding fuel to the rally, Ripple announced a $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road, a London-based prime brokerage. This move is expected to boost institutional liquidity and support the rollout of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD through Hidden Road’s global network. According to XRP technical analysis, the token has broken above its 50-day moving average for the first time in months and is now trading at $2.00. Analysts are eyeing $2.50 as the next resistance zone, while support holds near $1.50. The RSI is nearing 65, showing bullish strength but hinting at a possible cooldown. Still, with over 70 financial institutions already using Ripple’s cross-border payment network and the legal case nearly resolved, XRP technical analysis now supports a potential breakout scenario in the weeks ahead. Summing Up Solana (SOL) price today is holding above $118 after a major whale buy, with the Firedancer upgrade and ETF speculation keeping bullish interest alive. Meanwhile, XRP technical analysis shows strength after Ripple’s $1.25 billion Hidden Road deal and signs of a legal settlement with the SEC. Both networks are gaining momentum, but they still face short-term resistance and volatility. That’s where BlockDAG shifts the game.

Speaking on ABC's This Week today, Lutnick explained that smartphones, laptops and other key consumer electronics were temporarily exempted from high import tariffs earlier this month, but that the exemption would never become permanent. “All of these products will fall under semiconductors and will have a special focus tariff to ensure the resupply of these products,” Lutnick said.

According to reports from users of the exchanges, the scammers are sending messages that look genuine. Text messages shared by users follow a similar pattern. They call attention to a security issue and require the user to call a number to resolve it. By doing this, they bypass anti-phishing safeguards that detect malicious links but not phone numbers. Users were getting alerts from various issues including reports of log-in from a different location, adding a new 2-factor authentication device, or connecting to a new hardware wallet. So far, there has been no report of any victim, but users on X have alerted others about the risks, noting that Binance will never ask its customers to call a number. Meanwhile, one user mentioned that he called the number. SMS Phishing scam to Binance user (Source: X/ Public_Enemy_01) He said: “New scam @binance …… it came from the same number you text me from aswell. Rang it, spoke to Abdul in Landan, who didn’t like my tone for some reason and hung up. Watch out people.” Interestingly, several users claim the text messages come from the same sender ID Binance uses for communications, leading to more uncertainty among users about the authenticity of the messages. Binance says the data leak is not from its systems Meanwhile, there are speculations about how the scammers got user data. Many believe they bought it from the dark web and are now using it for a targeted campaign. According to one user, an anonymous actor recently offered a database of Gemini and Binance users for sale. The user claimed that a 2019 leak of Binance Know Your Customer (KYC) data is the source of the database. However, Binance has denied this, noting that it examined the hacker’s data and that the records are not connected to Binance. Nevertheless, Binance.US has warned users about phishing sites that impersonate its website. A post on X warned that scammers are using lookalike websites to collect user data. It added that users should always confirm the authenticity of the QR code and website link, as it will never request a multi-factor authentication code outside its platform. Binance CSO warns users about InfoStealers malware A potential explanation also comes from Binance Chief Security Officer Jimmy Su , who said in a recent post that hackers are gaining access to user data due to malware on user devices and not a breach of Binance systems. According to him, the bad actors are using malware known as InfoStealers to collect users’ credentials from their browsers. He claimed the malware collects all information saved on browsers, including passwords and clipboard data. He added that users can unknowingly download the malware through phishing links on social media, unofficial software downloads, and malicious add-ons. Therefore, he advised them to download software only from official sources and avoid saving passwords in browsers. Su said: “This is not an isolated case. Our security team continuously monitors dark web sources and malware campaigns to identify potential threats to our users.” Meanwhile, Binance has now extended an anti-phishing code for SMS to enable users to recognize genuine text messages. The code, which is set by each user, accompanies every authentic text message from the exchange and is reportedly available in all jurisdictions where Binance has a license to operate.

This means that investors will have the chance to tackle both traditional and digital asset markets, including stocks, real-world assets (RWAs) and the successful Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs). RCOF holders may also use the platform’s AI-powered Robo Advisor , a one-of-a-kind DeFi tool providing very precise prediction insights.

Despite the statement, the community is still concerned that this might have been a rug pull by the team, which controls a huge amount of the token’s total supply. Mantra Team Responds Following Token Crash In an X post , the Mantra team assured the community that the token is “fundamentally strong” despite the crash that occurred in the last 24 hours. The team blamed the crash on “reckless liquidations” and denied it had anything to do with the project. They further assured that this had nothing to do with the team and revealed that they were looking into the Mantra price crash and would share more details about what happened as soon as possible. In an X post, the project’s co-founder, John Patrick Mullin, further revealed that there was a massive forced liquidation from a large OM investor on a Centralized Exchange (CEX). However, he didn’t reveal whether it was one of the top crypto exchanges . In another X post, Mullin tried to set the record straight. He stated that they didn’t delete the Telegram channel. He further remarked that the team’s tokens all remain in custody and provided a wallet address (mantra…..quam) for community members to verify this claim. The Mantra co-founder added that they are actively figuring out why these massive forced liquidations occurred and will provide more information as soon as possible. He assured that they are still here and not going anywhere. Mantra Price Crashes By Over 80% In 24 Hours CoinMarketCap data shows that the Mantra price has crashed by over 80% in the last 24 hours. The token sharply dropped from an intra-day high of $6.3 to as low as $0.4. However, it has reclaimed the $1 price level following the team’s statement. However, amid this statement, some community members still seem convinced that this was a rug pull, as the team controls a huge amount of the token’s supply. Crypto commentator Sjuul described the OM token as the LUNA of this cycle. He further explained why the community believes the crash was a rug pull, stating that the crash began when a wallet believed to be connected to the team suddenly deposited 3.9 million OM tokens to the OKX crypto exchange. This deposit led to significant selling pressure, which caused the Mantra price to crash. Besides the token’s crash, the broader crypto market is witnessing a downtrend following US President Donald Trump’s statement in which he debunked reports of an exemption. This comes just a day after the crypto market rebounded following reports that the US president had exempted computers, phones, and chips from his tariffs on China and other countries.

According to the data he posted , Uphold has become the largest known XRP holder, overtaking Ripple and major exchanges like Bithumb and Binance in wallet holdings. The exchange’s wallet now holds over 2 billion XRP, with a reported value of approximately $3.7 billion. The address shared by Xaif is confirmed to be associated with Uphold and displays a total XRP balance of 1,833,932,521 XRP. The wallet was last active on April 11, 2025, at 9:54 PM UTC, indicating it is actively maintained. BREAKING: Uphold Surpasses Ripple! Uphold Becomes the Largest $XRP Holder Reveals over 2 Billion XRP in balance — worth $3.7 Billion! pic.twitter.com/Kn1xbTJOyP — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) April 12, 2025 Uphold’s Pro-XRP Stance Reinforced Uphold has long maintained a clear position supporting XRP, notably continuing to list and provide access to the asset during Ripple’s now-concluded legal conflict with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout that period, Uphold did not delist or restrict access to the asset, and that loyalty has not gone unnoticed by the XRP community. Uphold’s accumulation of over 2 billion XRP further reinforces its alignment with long-term XRP holders and confidence in the asset’s future utility. Uphold has consistently supported and encouraged the XRP army and has put its money where its mouth is with its strong support and large holdings. Uphold Surpasses Ripple’s Holdings Although Ripple still controls a large volume of XRP through its escrow mechanisms and company wallets, Uphold holds the most significant number of tokens in a single wallet, with recent data putting Ripple’s holdings as the fourth and fifth largest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Uphold has achieved this feat, Ripple still holds over 36 billion XRP in its escrow system. While Ripple maintains substantial holdings through escrow and company-controlled wallets, this latest development highlights how exchanges like Uphold take the lead among the XRP army. This shift signals a growing role for private platforms in distributing large-scale XRP holdings. Uphold’s accumulation reflects a deliberate approach to long-term positioning within the XRP ecosystem. Implications for XRP’s Future The presence of an exchange at the top of the XRP wallet rankings could influence how institutional and retail participants assess the asset’s distribution. Uphold’s visible support and sustained involvement may strengthen its standing among XRP holders while reinforcing confidence in the token’s infrastructure and accessibility.

According to the analyst, these pools absorb increasing amounts of XRP, effectively removing them from the circulating supply. This observation brings attention to a critical factor in XRP’s evolving market structure. As more liquidity pools go live, the amount of XRP locked in them grows, gradually shrinking the available supply. This shift comes as the XRP Ledger (XRPL) continues to evolve with DeFi capabilities, particularly since the launch of AMM features during an upgrade in 2024. IMPORTANT: I CAN’T STRESS THIS ENOUGH: AMM liquidity pools are the most underrated part of the XRP ecosystem. Why? Because XRP used in these pools is LOCKED UP. It’s not circulating. It’s not selling. It’s gone. And as more assets get tokenized… That locked supply… — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 12, 2025 Supply Reduction via Liquidity Pools The design of AMM pools on the XRP Ledger requires participants to commit XRP in exchange for yield. Once deposited, that XRP remains in the pool and cannot be used elsewhere unless withdrawn. The longer this XRP stays in AMMs, the less of it remains in active circulation. This is particularly relevant as many participants provide liquidity for extended periods to earn passive income. While the digital asset’s total supply remains fixed at 100 billion tokens, only a portion is circulating due to Ripple’s large holdings of escrowed XRP. Liquidity pools now introduce a mechanism by which even circulating XRP becomes temporarily inaccessible. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This effectively functions as a supply reduction mechanism. As the tokenization of assets grows on the XRPL, more users are expected to provide liquidity across a range of asset pairs, which may further expand the number of tokens locked away. Impact of the Increased Demand On XRP With tokenization gaining traction across institutional and retail segments, demand for XRP’s underlying infrastructure may increase. If this growth coincides with a shrinking liquid supply due to liquidity pooling, the balance between supply and demand could shift. “When demand rises while supply falls… price has to move,” All Things XRP noted. This scenario depends on the broader adoption of the AMM system and the continued growth of tokenized asset markets using the XRP Ledger. If both trends hold, the XRP locked in pools could play a more direct role in supporting upward price movement by limiting immediate sell pressure. Before the launch, Ripple CTO David Schwartz stated that he was personally excited about the AMM upgrade, and the positive effects show that Ripple’s development team is making the best moves for the digital asset’s long-term future.

Meanwhile, BONK and PEPE are staging their own rallies — but there’s a new viral memecoin quickly stealing the spotlight: MAGACOIN FINANCE . With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves as what many are calling the next breakout meme project of 2025 . DOGE AND SHIBA INU: STILL LEGENDS, BUT ARE GAINS CAPPED? DOGE and SHIBA INU remain cultural icons in crypto. SHIBA INU’s 60,000% surge from its lows is still one of the most remarkable price movements in digital asset history. But both coins are now massive in market cap, and while they’re gaining holders again, upside expectations are far more modest. That’s why investors looking for the next 100x altcoin are scouting fresh opportunities — and that’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. MAGACOIN FINANCE: THE NEXT 100X ALTCOIN? Launched just weeks ago, MAGACOIN FINANCE has already hit major milestones. With Stage 6 SOLD OUT , and Stage 7 now LIVE , momentum is building fast — and analysts are buzzing. This early-stage opportunity offers a current presale price under $0.0003 , with a listing target of $0.007 . That’s a potential 25x ROI , or a 2,300% gain , for early backers entering before exchange listings. FROM SHIBA’S PLAYBOOK TO MAGACOIN’S TRAJECTORY MAGACOIN FINANCE follows a similar launch arc as SHIBA INU in its early days — low entry price, high community growth, and a strong focus on viral spread across Telegram and X. Just like SHIBA hit 60,000% from low to high , some are speculating MAGACOIN FINANCE could chart a similar path — especially with its stage-based pricing that creates FOMO and rewards the earliest supporters. In under a month, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn in a loyal army of holders. Its meme-driven identity backed by a structured tokenomics plan is proving to be the winning formula in 2025 ’s meme coin resurgence. From trader Telegrams to top crypto X threads, sentiment is heating up. With Stage 7 LIVE and prices still under $0.0003 , many believe now is the moment to act — before listings go live and early ROI windows close. FINAL THOUGHTS: IS MAGACOIN FINANCE THE NEW KING? 🔥 50% BONUS TOKEN OFFER — ENDS SOON! USE MAGA50X While DOGE and SHIBA INU continue to gain holders and BONK and PEPE rally in their wake, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as the next viral chapter in meme coin history . Stage 7 LIVE Listing at $0.007 25x ROI potential Now featured by major crypto publishers Explosive growth backed by analyst predictions If SHIBA’s 60,000% surge proved anything, it’s that meme coins with strong narratives and early support can flip the market overnight.

Fartcoin, a Solana-based meme coin, has outperformed expectations with a 135% year-to-date rise and promising on-chain metrics like falling exchange reserves and steady whale holdings. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has dropped 20% in just 24 hours but now sits at a critical price level that could shape its near-term future. And in the background, BlockDAG is focusing less on short-term buzz and more on execution. With 10,000+ X-Series miners nearly ready for shipment and a presale already up 2,380%, raising $214 million, BDAG appears to be building its own momentum. Real-world applications, product rollout, and exchange readiness place it in a different conversation. Among all the buzz, BlockDAG may be one of the few turning intent into action. Fartcoin Resists Downtrend—Could It Push Toward $1.22? In a market that has mostly dipped, Fartcoin has moved against the trend. The price has jumped 35% from its monthly low and is now trading at $0.4755. Compared to its YTD low, the coin is up 135%. Data shows rising confidence among investors—exchange balances are down 3.62% over the past week, and 2 million tokens have moved into self-custody wallets, hinting at reduced sell pressure. The holder count now stands at more than 113,000, and key profit-taking wallets remain untouched. Technically, a cup and handle pattern is forming—often viewed as a sign of potential upside. If it plays out, the target sits around $1.22, nearly 160% above the current price. Still, a drop below $0.355 could challenge the bullish case and pull prices toward $0.20. For now, Fartcoin is attracting attention for holding up in a weak market—but whether it can break out remains to be seen. DOGE at $0.13—Can the Original Meme Coin Find Its Footing? Dogecoin recently fell by more than 20%, hitting $0.1300 as wider crypto markets experienced heavy selling. However, many are pointing to this level as a potential support zone. If DOGE can hold here, it might set the stage for a bounce. Momentum indicators suggest this scenario is possible. RSI is back above 50, and MACD has flipped bullish. Resistance is expected between $0.1400 and $0.1450. But if the price dips below $0.1350, more losses could follow. Since Dogecoin’s moves are often tied to Bitcoin’s direction, market sentiment will likely be the deciding factor. Traders looking for a low-entry position may be watching this closely. If price holds and volume returns, the stage could be set for a rebound. But for now, confirmation is still needed. BlockDAG’s Mining Rollout Approaches—Could This Be the Moment? BlockDAG is preparing for a major phase. Nearly 10,000 X-Series miners—including the X30 and X100 models—are ready for distribution ahead of its mainnet. This rollout marks a big leap in growing its ecosystem. The X30 model is designed for individuals and can mine up to 600 BDAG daily with low energy use. The X100, aimed at high-capacity miners, produces up to 2,000 BDAG per day. At the current price of $0.0248, and with a $1 target set for 2025, projected returns could reach 3,900%. BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $214 million, selling more than 19 billion coins across 27 batches. Since launching at $0.001, the price has risen by 2,380%, with each batch pushing the price higher. With exchange listings on the horizon and hardware rolling out, this moment may prove timely for new participants. For anyone wondering what the best crypto to mine in 2025 might be, BlockDAG’s combination of speed, utility, and upward projections makes it one to seriously consider. Wrapping Up! Dogecoin still has its meme-driven appeal, and Fartcoin may surprise in the short term. But when it comes to a full-package offering—utility, delivery, and long-term planning—BlockDAG stands apart. While DOGE awaits market movement and Fartcoin depends on sentiment, BlockDAG is deploying miners, running a live testnet, and setting the stage for centralized exchange listings. The foundation it’s building goes beyond speculation. With miners earning up to 2,000 BDAG daily at a low price point of $0.0248, the upside is hard to ignore. If BDAG reaches the $1 target, early adopters could see returns nearing 4,000%. This is not just about betting on the next hype wave—it’s about backing a roadmap already in motion. For those thinking about where real value might emerge in 2025, BlockDAG may not just follow the trend—it might lead it.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 243,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on the memecoin Bonk ( BONK ). The trader shares a chart suggesting that BONK will face resistance at the $0.000012 level before printing a bullish higher low setup and rallying to his target above $0.0000145. “BONK is looking strong in the short term, and should go higher. Should be a pullback around the 200 EMA (exponential moving average) on the four-hour chart but still, I think this has pulled back enough to where any buying down here is probably reasonable.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is worth $0.00001376. Turning to the low-cap altcoin Alchemist AI ( ALCH ), the analyst says the coin appears to be in an uptrend and that he’s waiting for potential dips to accumulate the asset. ALCH is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based crypto project that allows users with no coding skills to generate codes by providing natural language descriptions. Says Altcoin Sherpa, “ALCH still seems like a really strong chart, don’t see it being mentioned much. I think it’s basically taken the place of ARC; a super volatile AI coin that moves 20% a day. Not in it but traded it a lot before; will look to buy dips.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, ALCH is the 431st-largest crypto asset by market cap, trading at $0.109. Looking at Bitcoin, Altcoin Sherpa thinks that BTC will continue to consolidate within a large trading range in the short to mid-term. “Expecting there is some sort of chop between $70,000-$90,000 over the next several weeks for BTC. Relative bottom probably in, but still some more consolidation to come.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $85,366.

With Cardano (ADA) hovering around $0.6, there’s growing anticipation surrounding its potential to rebound, driven by ongoing developments and bullish market sentiment. Yet, while Cardano maintains its place in the spotlight, there’s a new contender emerging that is quickly capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors alike, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The Phase 4 presale of MUTM tokens costs $0.025 token price per token and takes place during the current period. The price of MUTM tokens will escalate to 0.03 dollars when phase 4 transitions into phase 5. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gathered $6.6 million by attracting 8200 holders since its inception. Mutuum Finance could hit $3. The Mutuum Finance team has recently introduced a new dashboard featuring a leaderboard that highlights the top 50 holders. Investors will earn bonus tokens for maintaining their position in the top 50. Mutuum Finance: Paving the Way for the Future of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance has gained rapid investor interest from its pioneering dual-lending system. Mutuum Finance uses both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems to establish its revolutionary dual-lending system within decentralized finance. Smart contracts running on P2C guide the platform to issue loans supported by ETH tokens by receiving USDT stablecoins into its lending pools. Users can use P2P system functionality to control their loan arrangements independently and maintain both privacy protections and security features. Mutuum Finance runs adaptive operations that allow profitability through interest rates exceeding 10% for users providing liquidity to their system. Although Mutuum Finance conducts all processes through third-party audits the platform places a strong emphasis both on security and transparency. Open-source smart contracts operate on the platform to create trust between users. The operating stability of the platform will increase through the introduction of a USD-pegged stablecoin and a fee-moderated program to repurchase platform tokens and enhance price stability. Through financial incentives for liquidity stakeholders who place funds on the platform the ecosystem develops stronger confidence among its members. More than 8,200 investors currently use the platform while user numbers continue to increase rapidly. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Engagement Mutuum Finance strengthens adoption by offering a $100,000 token distribution giveaway. The giveaway includes ten prize recipients who will each get $10,000 MUTM tokens. The initiative gives financial benefits to users while it inspires them to welcome more investors into the community which strengthens the overall platform engagement. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity in Phase 4 Presale Mutuum Finance offers an exclusive opportunity for early investors during its Phase 4 presale. The price of MUTM tokens is currently set at $0.025, with the price set to rise progressively from $0.025 to $0.06 over the course of the 11-stage sale. This offers up to 140% in potential gains before the token hits the market. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens could reach $3 after launch, positioning them as a major player in the DeFi market in 2025. Currently, the total market capitalization of MUTM tokens exceeds $6.6 million, showing strong investor confidence. While Cardano (ADA) is positioning itself for a potential rebound, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a serious performer in the DeFi market. With its innovative dual-lending system, strong security measures, and a rapidly growing community of over 8,100 users, Mutuum Finance is gaining significant attention. The Phase 4 presale offers an exclusive opportunity to invest at just $0.025 per token, with the price expected to rise to $0.06, presenting potential gains of up to 140%. With a $100,000 giveaway further fueling interest, Mutuum Finance could see its value soar, possibly reaching $3 post-launch. For those looking to capitalize on the next big DeFi project, Mutuum Finance offers a better opportunity.

Despite the market struggles faced by projects like Kaspa and Aptos, BlockDAG reinvigorates the PoW concept with a fresh, hardware-focused strategy. At its third Keynote event, the team announced the shipping of 10,000 mining devices, affirming their dedication to enhancing PoW beyond traditional boundaries. With an impressive $214 million secured during its presale and an astonishing 2,380% return since the initial batch, BlockDAG (BDAG) concentrates on substantial growth over mere market buzz. This strategic infrastructure underscores its commitment to a long-term vision and durability, differentiating it from fleeting crypto trends. Kaspa (KAS): Recent Market Trends and Valuation As of April 4, 2025, Kaspa (KAS) is valued at approximately $0.0668, with a market capitalization nearing $1.73 billion and a circulating supply close to 25.97 billion coins. The past three months have seen Kaspa undergo a significant decline. Priced around $0.127978 on January 4, 2025, it has since plummeted by about 47.8%. This price reduction coincides with a substantial market cap drop from around $3.33 billion at the start of January to its present figure—a 48% decrease. This continuous downturn in both price and market valuation signifies a challenging quarter for Kaspa, creating concerns amongst market observers and stakeholders. The steep fall emphasizes the broader volatility in the crypto market and indicates a need for Kaspa to regain momentum and fortify its market stance. Currently, it persists in a recovery phase, managing through these tough times. Aptos (APT) Struggles with Sharp Decline in Q1 2025 As of April 4, 2025, Aptos (APT) trades at roughly $5.06, with a market capitalization of about $3.05 billion and a circulating supply nearing 604.53 million coins. Over the past three months, Aptos has witnessed a notable decline in value. Initially priced at around $10.62 on January 4, 2025, it has decreased by nearly 52.3%. This price drop is echoed by a significant reduction in market cap, which has decreased from approximately $6.42 billion to its current level—a roughly 52.5% fall. These parallel reductions in both price and valuation highlight a tough quarter for Aptos, marked by market unpredictability and cautious buyer sentiment. This sharp decline underscores the broader instability within the crypto sphere and accentuates the pressure on projects like Aptos to adapt and regain traction. Currently, the project is navigating a difficult market environment amidst fluctuating buyer attitudes. BlockDAG Elevates PoW: Shipping 10,000 Miners to Boost True Capability BlockDAG is not merely discussing Proof-of-Work; it is actualizing it. During Keynote 3, the team heralded the official shipment of 10,000 mining units in 2025, initiating one of the most ambitious PoW infrastructure expansions since the early days of Bitcoin. However, unlike Bitcoin, which struggles with scalability and speed, BlockDAG advances PoW with cutting-edge, high-throughput hardware and a directed acyclic graph architecture that facilitates parallel processing. This implementation reflects action, not just theory. BlockDAG’s presale has successfully raised over $214 million, marking it as one of the most notable funding achievements lately. Over 19.2 billion coins have been sold through 27 presale batches, with the latest batch priced at $0.0248. Remarkably, early participants from batch 1 have witnessed a phenomenal 2,380% gain, a significant achievement in any industry, especially in crypto. Furthermore, BlockDAG’s hardware development is more than a showcase—it’s a strategic move against the constraints of traditional PoW networks. While Bitcoin still depends on outdated consensus mechanisms and excessive energy requirements, BlockDAG’s architecture manages high transaction volumes with quicker confirmation times, maintaining decentralization and security. In essence, this is PoW redefined for speed, scalability, and practical applicability. With the ongoing shipment of miners and substantial financial support, BlockDAG isn’t just promising innovation—it’s constructing it, one ASIC at a time. Hardware Leads, Hype Fades Kaspa and Aptos have endured a challenging quarter, with market caps nearly halved and prices significantly reduced. Although they remain relevant, their recent performances mirror the uncertainties faced by projects that heavily depend on speculation without significant infrastructure advancements. In contrast, BlockDAG opts for a different path, focusing on tangible hardware, measurable returns, and strategies to scale Proof-of-Work without sacrificing speed or decentralization.

Recently, established entities like Maker and Injective have seen significant reductions in both their market value and price, signaling a shift within the sector. Amid these changes, emerging entities like BlockDAG are gaining attention with their recent Keynote 3 presentation. This update serves as more than just a status check; it’s a strategic plan for the evolution of Web3, prioritizing simplicity, efficiency, and scalability. BlockDAG’s strategy is part of a larger industry trend that focuses on creating lasting value rather than short-term gains. Looking ahead, BlockDAG (BDAG) is quickly becoming a key player in the race to develop scalable Web3 solutions that facilitate widespread use and maximize the technology’s potential. Maker (MKR): Analysis of Market Cap and Decline As of April 4, 2025, Maker’s trading price stands at $1,317.85, peaking at $1,347.92 and dropping to a low of $1,228.70 within the same day. Currently, its market capitalization is about $1.12 billion, based on 848,074 MKR tokens in circulation. This is a noticeable decrease from three months prior when MKR was priced at $1,593.11—a 17.3% fall in value. This decline in market cap reflects ongoing market instability and the challenges faced by established cryptocurrencies like Maker. The decrease also serves as a caution that without continual innovations or scalable solutions, even prominent tokens can face difficulties. As new platforms with robust frameworks come forward, older projects like MKR may have to evolve swiftly to stay relevant in the dynamic Web3 environment. Injective (INJ): In-Depth Look at Market Challenges and Price Drop As of April 4, 2025, Injective is priced at $8.35, with its daily high at $8.62 and low at $7.99. Its market cap now sits around $835 million, calculated from a circulating supply of 99,970,935 tokens. This represents a drastic fall from three months earlier, when INJ was valued at $23.60, a 64.6% drop. This severe decline has significantly affected Injective’s total market value, reflecting a broader trend of market volatility impacting well-known Web3 projects. This downturn emphasizes the need for continual innovation and adaptability among older platforms, especially as the market shifts toward new projects with solid fundamentals and scalability promises. BlockDAG Unveils Its Vision for an Advanced Web3 Ecosystem BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 transcended a typical product launch, presenting a robust declaration of purpose. From groundbreaking architecture to user-centric development tools, the presentation outlined a future where scalability, security, and simplicity converge as fundamental elements. Having secured over $214 million in crypto presale funds, BlockDAG continues to build momentum, now on its 27th batch at a price of $0.0248 per coin, showing a staggering 2,380% ROI since the first batch. With more than 19.2 billion coins distributed, the strong community support is evident. What truly shone through was the lucid vision for a Web3 ecosystem that simplifies complexities for developers and users alike. Whether it’s crafting dApps, ensuring secure transactions, or scaling solutions across networks, BlockDAG is crafting a space where technical infrastructures are seamlessly integrated, allowing users and creators to focus on innovation. The update not only highlighted technical advancements but also proposed a radical rethinking of how decentralized systems function. With inherent scalability, BlockDAG is not just addressing current challenges but preemptively solving future ones. The platform is not merely rich in features; it is strategically designed for enduring relevance in an evolving sector. In essence, Keynote 3 was not just a product revelation—it was a comprehensive blueprint for a refined, quicker, safer, and simpler Web3 domain. BlockDAG is not just adapting to the future; it is actively sculpting it, laying the groundwork for the next advancements in the field. Pioneering the Future of Web3 While Maker and Injective demonstrate the challenges and fluctuations typical of growing Web3 markets, their recent setbacks in pricing and market value highlight critical shortcomings in platforms that struggle to scale effectively amidst increasing demands. In stark contrast, BlockDAG’s proactive approach to scalability was a centerpiece of its recent Keynote 3. BlockDAG offers a tangible and actionable plan aimed at enhancing performance, simplifying user interaction, and ensuring sustainability. This project isn’t just about achieving short-term successes or capitalizing on fleeting trends; it’s about establishing a stable foundation for the future of Web3. As scalability becomes a pivotal criterion for next-gen platforms, BlockDAG isn’t just joining the conversation—it’s leading and defining it. In a domain where adaptability and pioneering are paramount, BlockDAG positions itself as an avant-garde solution, poised to tackle future challenges with strategic intent and meticulous precision.

Qubetics Could Be the Cardano-Level Comeback,https://thecoinrise.com/the-best-crypto-presale-to-join-now-qubetics-could-be-the-cardano-level-comeback/,"What happens when a digital asset once worth fractions of a penny hits over $3 per token? That’s not fiction—it’s the actual trajectory of Cardano (ADA), which launched in 2017 with an ICO price of just $0.0024. Many overlooked it, and by 2021, ADA had crossed the $3 mark, delivering an ROI of over 124,000%. Cardano’s early backers didn’t just participate in an offering—they became part of a long-term blockchain evolution focused on security, sustainability, and academic rigor. But like all rare entries, that moment is now historical. For those who missed that breakout window, Qubetics ($TICS) emerges not as a replacement but as a modern continuation of what early-stage participation can achieve. Backed by real-world use cases and bold technical foundations, Qubetics is currently in its 30th presale stage , offering access to early participants at just $0.1730 per token . The protocol doesn’t rely on promises; it delivers blockchain tools that solve interoperability problems affecting millions—starting with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet making it one of the best crypto presale to join this year. Qubetics Isn’t Just a Coin—It’s the Second Chance You Missed with Cardano Remember when Cardano’s ICO quietly came and went, and only a few believed in its potential? Fast forward, it turned early believers into millionaires. That kind of moment doesn’t come around often—but Qubetics might just be it. Unlike older blockchain systems that forced users into complex, chain-specific setups, Qubetics delivers real usability. Its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet is a breakthrough solution that lets users manage assets across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and others—all from one seamless, private interface. No third-party apps, no juggling plugins, and no waiting for bridges to sync. Just pure, direct control over your assets—instantly. In real-world terms, this means a freelancer can invoice in one token and receive payment in another, with no extra fees or technical headaches. Everything stays secure, transparent, and fast. The wallet is already live and gaining traction among users who want simplicity without sacrificing sovereignty. Presale Details You Can’t Afford to Ignore Now here’s the math that’s catching serious attention. At the current presale price of $0.17305, a $100 investment gives you approximately 578 tokens. If $TICS reaches just $1, that investment becomes $578. But if it hits $5, you’re looking at $2,890. Should it climb to $10, the return is $5,780, and at $15, that same $100 explodes into $8,670. These aren’t inflated numbers—they’re real-time projections based on current presale pricing and token output. Qubetics is currently in its 30 crypto presale stage. Over 507 million $TICS tokens have already been sold, raising more than $16 million from 24,600+ participants. The current token price is $0.1730, and it increases by 10% every Sunday without fail. This means every delay costs you more entry and fewer tokens—while the upside remains massive. Now is the time to act before the next price hike hits. Cardano: A Foundational Milestone That Redefined Blockchain Participation Cardano’s initial coin offering (ICO) launched in September 2017 through a presale campaign that lasted nearly two years, mostly targeting Japanese markets. The presale price was a mere $0.0024 , and it successfully raised over $62 million , making it one of the most high-profile blockchain fundraising events of its time. What set Cardano apart was its rigorous academic foundation and peer-reviewed protocol development. Built by IOHK (Input Output Hong Kong), Cardano emphasized scalability, interoperability, and formal methods in its coding structure. Its Ouroboros consensus mechanism became the first blockchain consensus algorithm mathematically proven to be secure. This made it highly attractive to those prioritizing security and decentralization over short-term trends. Over the years, Cardano integrated Plutus smart contracts, launched native tokens, and gradually shifted into a fully decentralized framework. The project’s rollout, often criticized for its slow pace, has remained deliberate to ensure robust layer-by-layer development. ADA, the native token, reached its all-time high of $3.10 in September 2021, marking over 124,000% growth since its ICO. That meteoric rise turned early participants into long-term ecosystem contributors, validating the importance of technical depth over marketing hype. Cardano laid down the blueprint for academically driven blockchain infrastructure. Its early ICO proved that long-term value can emerge when a project is grounded in rigorous research and practical design—even if the early market ignored it. Final Analysis Cardano’s story is a lesson in patience and design-first architecture. Those who joined early witnessed exponential growth and became part of one of blockchain’s most transformative networks. But those who missed that ICO aren’t without options. The emergence of Qubetics—equipped with real-world solutions like its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet—presents a clear next chapter in the evolution of blockchain utility. For community participants looking for projects with both functional value and presale potential, Qubetics is the best crypto presale to join . Its growth is driven not by speculation, but by tools that solve real technical challenges. And for those who value purpose-driven innovation, that’s where the next wave of long-term value may already be forming.

Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows the purchase was made on April 12 by one of WLFI’s trading wallets using USDC transferred from the project’s main wallet. It’s the same trading wallet previously used by WLFI to accumulate other altcoins. WLFI holds a diversified portfolio, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), and a larger number of altcoins, such as Tron ( TRX ), Ondo Finance ( ONDO ), Avalanche ( AVAX ) and now Sei ( SEI ). According to blockchain researcher Lookonchain, WLFI has spent a total of $346.8 million accumulating 11 different tokens, but as of April 12, it has yet to see a profit on any of them. The project’s Ethereum investments alone are currently down over $114 million. Overall, Lookonchain says WLFI’s portfolio is down $145.8 million. World Liberty Financial’s current on-paper profit/loss on its altcoins. Source: Lookonchain Only two months ago, in a Feb. 3 X post, Donald Trump’s son, Eric Trump, urged his followers to buy Ether, writing : “In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH.” Originally, the tweet also included “you can thank me later,” but it was edited to remove those five words. At the time of writing, data from CoinGecko showed ETH’s price had fallen 55% since Eric Trump’s tweet, currently trading at $1,611, down from the Feb. 3 close of $2,879.

WLFI has made no official announcement about USD1’s logo. Observers speculate this is USD1’s new logo. Source: Binance Trump’s involvement with USD1 has attracted criticism from lawmakers on both sides of US politics. At an April 2 US House Financial Services Committee hearing on stablecoin legislation , Democratic Representative Maxine Waters suggested President Trump may be ultimately planning to use USD1 to replace the US dollar. “Trump likely wants the entire government to use stablecoins, from payments made by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to Social Security payments to paying taxes. And which coin do you think Trump would replace the dollar with? His own, of course.” The committee’s Republican chair, French Hill, aired similar concerns. “If there is no effort to block the president of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers.” Magazines: 3 reasons Ethereum could turn a corner: Kain Warwick, X Hall of Flame",,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|REGULATION|ONDO|SEI,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-14 02:46:36

The app layer is where developers build decentralized applications on top of Ethereum’s base infrastructure and where they make decisions about how these programs operate. In an April 12 post on the social media platform Warpcast, Buterin responded to a user’s argument that Ethereum needs a new generation of developers rooted in Ethereum’s core values to renew itself. He argued that it’s the app layer that needs this more. “Apps are 80% special purpose. What apps you build depends heavily on what ideas you have of what Ethereum apps, and Ethereum as a whole, are there to do for the world. And so having good ideas on this topic out there becomes crucially important,” Buterin said. Source: Vitalik Buterin In comparison, Buterin says a programming language like C++ may not be as influenced by the creator’s ideology, as it is a general-purpose tool that doesn’t have much surface to be made worse or improved by social philosophy. “Imagine that C++ had been made by a totalitarian racist fascist. Would it be a worse language? Probably not,” he said. Ethereum’s layer 1 is similar to an extent, argued Buterin, though it is more exposed to philosophical influence, citing its move to proof-of-stake (PoS) and supporting light clients as examples. “Someone who doesn’t believe in decentralization would not add light clients, or good forms of account abstraction,” he said. “Someone who doesn’t mind energy waste would not spend half a decade moving to PoS, but the Ethereum Virtual Machine opcodes might have been roughly the same either way. So Ethereum is perhaps 50% general-purpose,” Buterin added. Apps with good social philosophy vs bad In a follow-up post, Buterin told a user that in his opinion, crypto privacy protocol Railgun, Web3 social protocol Farcaster, decentralized prediction market Polymarket and messenger app Signal are examples of apps with a good social philosophy. Source: Vitalik Buterin “You build apps that do the right thing behind the scenes by default. Signal is a reasonably good example of this, though it has significant flaws of its own. Farcaster is also a good example of this,” Buterin said . Related: Vitalik Buterin criticizes crypto’s moral shift toward gambling On the other hand, Buterin said the memecoin platform Pump.fun, the collapsed crypto ecosystem Terra, its native token Terra ( LUNA ), and the collapsed crypto exchange FTX are examples of bad social philosophy. “The differences in what the app does stem from differences in beliefs in developers’ heads about what they are here to accomplish,” he said.

According to data from Tokenomist, on Apr. 18, the project will release 40 million tokens, worth over $320 million at current prices, to its team. This is TRUMP’s first major unlock and will add roughly 20% of the current circulating supply to the market. Following the event, 493,000 TRUMP, around $4 million, will be unlocked daily until the next major unlock in July. The upcoming unlocks have raised concerns over potential price impact due to increased token supply. TRUMP is trading at $8.27 as of press time, down more than 5% over the past day. The token is now 88% below its all-time high of $73.43 set on January 19, as per CoinGecko data . Due to increased market activity before the unlock, trading volume has increased 23% to $476 million in the past 24 hours. On-chain data points to a decline in investor interest. Data from a Dune dashboard shows that the total number of wallet holders has decreased to 638,000, a 0.3% decrease this week and a huge decrease from over 800,000 holders recorded in January. Less than 13,000 wallets hold more than $1,000 in TRUMP, indicating that a large percentage of users have modest, speculative holdings. You might also like: McGregor’s REAL memecoin flops after missing the $1M minimum presale goal by 61% Technical indicators point to bearish pressure on the token. The majority of important moving averages are below TRUMP’s current price, with the 20- and 50-day exponential moving averages are indicating further declines. A weak bullish crossover in the moving average convergence/divergence suggests a possible but uncertain recovery, while the relative strength index is near oversold territory at 37.37. TRUMP price analysis. Credit: TradingView Support is located close to $7.50, where TRUMP has previously seen buying interest. The price might move toward $6.80 if it breaks below this level. Resistance is expected on the upside near $9.20 and $10.90, which correspond to longer-term moving averages. Even though Trump-affiliated merchandise retailers like GetTrumpSneakers.com can use the memecoin, its price movement indicates that investors are more interested in speculation than in real-world uses. As the unlock gets closer, traders will be keeping an eye on market sentiment and price movement.

We have yet to see that.” Cipolaro said crypto perpetual futures rates have “been persistently positive,” with liquidations spiking on April 6 and 7 in the days after Trump first announced the tariffs on April 2 but only to a total of $480 million, which he added “was well below other notable liquidation events.” He noted that the price of Tether ( USDT ), a US dollar-tracking stablecoin widely used token in crypto trading, was below $1 but had “not experienced a sharp decline.” Trump unveiled a sweeping tariff regime on April 2 that lumped various levies on every country before pausing them for 90 days just hours after they came into effect on April 5 and instead charging a base tariff of 10%, besides China, which currently has tariffs of up to 145%. Traditional and crypto markets tanked after Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement, and many assets haven’t recovered to the same level as before their unveiling. Stocks, bonds and foreign exchange volatility rates all rose after Trump’s tariffs announcement. Source: NYDIG Over the weekend, the Trump administration caused more confusion with its tariffs, saying on April 13 that an April 11 decision to exempt many electronics from tariffs was temporary and they would still be hit with levies. Bitcoin fares well, declining volatility to make it widely attractive Cipolaro said that Bitcoin ( BTC ) didn’t escape the market volatility, “but at current prices has fared far better than many other asset classes.” He added that Bitcoin’s volatility hasn’t risen to historic levels, unlike the traditional markets, and “has been relatively stable” despite instability instigated by the Trump administration. “Perhaps investors are increasingly searching for stores of value not tied to sovereign countries and thus not affected by the trade turmoil.” Bitcoin is down 22.5% from its mid-January peak of over $108,000 and has traded flat over the past 24 hours at $84,730, according to CoinGecko. Cipolaro said the narrowing gap between Bitcoin’s volatility and other assets makes it “increasingly more appealing” to funds with risk parity portfolios — those that use risk to choose asset allocations. He added that investors are likely reducing their risk exposure but “perhaps some reallocation of asset mix to Bitcoin is one of the reasons it has been more buoyant.” Related: S&P 500 briefly sees ‘Bitcoin-level’ volatility amid Trump tariff war “Risk parity funds allocating to Bitcoin can help dampen its volatility — making the asset more attractive and potentially reinforcing a virtuous cycle of increased adoption and stability,” Cipolaro said. However, YouHodler chief of markets Ruslan Lienkha told Cointelegraph in an April 12 note that despite a wider market rebound, “technical indicators are painting a concerning picture.” He said a “death cross,” when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, is potentially forming on Bitcoin and the S&P 500. Lienkha said the pattern is “generally considered a bearish signal for the medium term, suggesting that markets may struggle to sustain upward momentum without a clear catalyst or a stream of positive macroeconomic developments.” Magazine: Financial nihilism in crypto is over — It’s time to dream big again",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-14 03:31:26

Dubbed as “Liberation Day, “ the action was designed to bring new life to American manufacturing, but instead set off a financial chain reaction that spilled well outside of conventional markets right into the center of crypto. Global Market reaction on Tariffs The initial response was pandemonium in all financial markets worldwide. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index dropped more than 3%, and the Shanghai Composite plummeted by 4.7% an indication of serious investor nervousness in China. European markets were not immune either: Germany’s DAX and the UK’s FTSE 100 fell under the weight of dented export expectations. On the other side of the Atlantic, American indices plummeted. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 600 points, while the NASDAQ dipped close to 2.5%. The hardest hit were semiconductor and electronics firms depending heavily on Chinese production. Fear drove investors into havens, driving gold to a 12-month high and sending U.S. Treasury yields down. Crypto Market Reacted The crypto space, which many at one time praised as a hedge against macro dislocation, wasn’t immune. Bitcoin (BTC) dropped close to 9% in the first 48 hours after the news. Ethereum (ETH) followed suit, dropping more than 8%. Risk sentiment had well and truly turned, and the digital asset market, inextricably linked to global investor sentiment, was subjected to sharp liquidation. Asia-specific tokens such as NEO (baptismally referred to as the “Chinese Ethereum”) and VeChain (VET), which is associated with larger Chinese logistics and supply chain companies, experienced gruesome declines falling 12% and 15% respectively. Even US-preferred instruments were not exempt: Solana (SOL) fell by 10%, most of its drop coming courtesy of its extreme vulnerability to DeFi and institutionality trading. While it was Layer-1 blockchains that bore the bulk of the blow, stablecoins were not spared either. Tether (USDT) redemption volumes spiked, particularly on Asian exchanges such as Binance and OKX, indicative of a flight to cash. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap, on the other hand, experienced major volume declines, indicating that retail investors were taking liquidity out of the market instead of trading the dip. So why did stocks and crypto sell off in sync? For one, crypto remains a speculative asset class. During periods of uncertainty, speculative assets are the first to be dumped. Second, big institutionals now control a significant proportion of crypto volume. These institutions play macro strategies—when fear increases, their capital reverses and moves to safer bets such as cash, gold, or short-term government bonds. Worsening the situation further were early rumors of capital controls in Hong Kong and Singapore two key crypto hubs. Speculation that regulators might restrict crypto transactions to control capital flight led to further panic, especially among investors based in Asia. As Bitcoin struggled, gold shone again. The Gold Shares (GLD) ETF recorded its largest one-day inflow in half a year. U.S. manufacturing ETFs experienced fleeting optimism, but most high-growth technology stocks particularly chipmakers such as Nvidia and TSMC got hammered. In the cryptocurrency universe, those with lesser geographic and trade exposure performed better. Chainlink (LINK), which is decentralized in its oracle infrastructure, lost less than most, and some investors predicted that utility-based tokens would provide more stability in macro-driven routs. Tariffs drama continuous The tariff drama is more than politics it’s a stress test of the old and new economy. It demonstrated to us that crypto isn’t this digital island nation that is in some way proof against real world events. Whenever systemic risk beckons, any asset be it fiat, gold, or crypto adapts. It also reshaped the narrative around Bitcoin’s “digital gold” thesis. While it has outperformed in some local crises (like inflation in Argentina or sanctions on Russia), in a globally synchronized panic, Bitcoin failed to serve as a safe haven. That doesn’t diminish its long-term value proposition, but it’s a reminder: we’re not there yet. While the world grapples with this latest kick in the teeth of the U.S.–China dynamic, investors and crypto fans will have to reset expectations. Volatility is the new normal, yet in that chop is opportunity. Builders will redouble efforts on decentralization. Regulators will catch up on how essential good crypto standards are. And investors if smart will learn to hedge risk, control emotions, and diversify better. After all, Bitcoin was the product of a crisis. Perhaps this one will be the crucible out of which fresh innovation emerges once more.",Research Report|Insights,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 03:53:05

Let’s unpack the details. However, in an official statement, the firm clarified that the sell-off was not an insider job, and they are working to resolve the matter soon. MANTRA’s co-founder, John Patrick Mullin, also said that there is no need to panic and that they are investigating the matter. MANTRA community – we want to assure you that MANTRA is fundamentally strong. Today’s activity was triggered by reckless liquidations, not anything to do with the project. One thing we want to be clear on: this was not our team. We are looking into it and will share more details… — MANTRA | Tokenizing RWAs (@MANTRA_Chain) April 13, 2025 Sjuul’s Breakdown: Manipulation and OTC Deals Led to Collapse According to Sjuul, the crash was triggered when a wallet linked to the MANTRA team suddenly deposited 3.9 million OM tokens onto OKX. This raised immediate concerns, as the team is known to control nearly 90% of the token’s total supply. With such control, any sell-off could crash the market, and that’s exactly what happened. 4/ So when that large token deposit hit OKX, people started to worry that a big sell-off was coming. And they were right. Selling pressure began shortly after. — Sjuul | AltCryptoGems (@AltCryptoGems) April 13, 2025 Sjuul highlighted that trust had already been broken in the OM community over the past year. The team allegedly manipulated the market using market makers, secretly altered tokenomics, and repeatedly delayed a promised community airdrop. These actions had already put the community on edge. But the real shock came with rumors of OTC deals, mainly private sales, where tokens were reportedly offered at massive discounts, some up to 50% off. When the token’s price began to slide, even these investors rushed to exit, causing a chain reaction. Stop-losses were triggered, leveraged positions liquidated, and within an hour, the price plummeted 90%, burning countless investors. StarPlatinum’s Analysis: Airdrop Scandal and Vanishing Act Another crypto analyst StarPlatinum, echoed the alarm, calling it a disaster on the scale of LUNA. He pointed to the team’s controversial airdrop incident just a month ago, where over 50% of eligible wallets were suddenly blacklisted without explanation. This move alienated the community and created deep suspicion. It all started when a wallet linked to MANTRA sent 3.9M $OM to OKX That caught attention fast Because the team controls 90% of the supply Meaning they can crash the price anytime (2/9) pic.twitter.com/wMCZpt4Ant — StarPlatinum (@StarPlatinumSOL) April 13, 2025 He also highlighted the team’s quiet changes to tokenomics, founder inactivity, and rumors of price control through market makers. When the wallet transfer to OKX happened, it triggered widespread fear. As news of the OTC deals spread, panic selling began. In one hour, OM crashed from $7 to just $0.50. What made things worse, according to StarPlatinum, was the OM Telegram group getting deleted right after the crash. The final message before deletion likened the event to “LUNA 2.0.” Since then, the team has gone silent, adding to the chaos. Don’t Ignore Red Flags Both analysts agreed on one thing that when a token is overly centralized, lacks transparency, and constantly shifts its rules, danger is never far behind. The OM crash serves as a brutal reminder to always research before investing.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,LUNA|MARKET|TRADING|OM|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 04:00:28

The Company’s Risky Capital Model Under Scrutiny,https://coinpedia.org/research-report/can-strategy-survive-a-bitcoin-crash-the-companys-risky-capital-model-under-scrutiny/,"The post Can Strategy Survive a Bitcoin Crash? The Company’s Risky Capital Model Under Scrutiny appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy Incorporated, recently renamed as Strategy, is the largest publicly traded corporate owner of Bitcoin, with 528,185 BTC purchased at an average price of $67,458, with total acquisition cost of $35.63 billion. As of April 2025, its Bitcoin holdings are worth around $41.3 billion, with the most recent purchase of 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion on March 30 at $86,969 per BTC. Bitcoin is now Strategy’s main treasury reserve asset, and its BTC Yield—a key performance indicator measuring Bitcoin per share—rose 11% YTD during Q1, aiming for 15% annually to 2027. Microstrategy SEC filing SEC filings in recent times point to the volatility that comes with Strategy’s Bitcoin model. During Q1 2025, the firm had a $5.91 billion unrealized loss caused by a price fall to $77,351, which was offset by a $1.69 billion tax benefit. The capital structure of the company is comprised of $8.65 billion raised in the form of equity and debt since 2020, for funding continuous Bitcoin acquisitions. The highlight was raising $2 billion in February 2025 using zero-coupon convertible notes that are due in 2030. Strategy also went public with a preferred stock (STRK) offering during Q4 2024 and raised $584 million. In spite of volatility, the firm’s overall Bitcoin holding is still in profit with an unrealized gain of 14.62%. Its software segment still lags behind, reporting $120.7 million in Q4 2024 revenue, down 3% YoY, and failing to produce positive operating cash flow. The firm depends greatly on financing for its operations and Bitcoin acquisitions, having done a 10-for-1 stock split in July 2024 to increase share availability. Liquidation risk is contained at present. With $8.2 billion in unsecured loans and no collateralized loans for Bitcoin , Strategy could potentially repay all of its debt by selling 15% of its BTC at current market prices. Bitcoin through shares Executive Chairman Michael Saylor’s 46.8% voting share guarantees continuation of the Bitcoin-first strategy, and he asserts even a decline in Bitcoin’s price wouldn’t lead to a selloff. Strategy’s equity and debt offering-based fund conversion strategy—using stock and note issuance to purchase BTC has been referred to as an “infinite money glitch.” Strategy purchases additional Bitcoin by issuing stock and notes at a premium, driving both BTC and MSTR’s stock upward. This model relies on investor faith and sustained appreciation of Bitcoin. Any extended decline in Bitcoin’s price may test its capacity to raise capital or service its obligations. Critics point to centralization risks, possible tax burdens on $18 billion of unrealized gains, and regulatory attention from organizations such as the SEC. At the same time, the stock of the company experienced a 336% jump in 2024, although it dropped by 55% from a high of $543 in November to $250 by February 2025. In summary, Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin approach continues to provide returns but with high risk of exposure to market volatility, debt risk, and regulatory issues. Its success will depend on Bitcoin’s long-term trend and Saylor’s dogged adherence to the “never sell” mantra.",Research Report|Insights,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 04:05:05

Russian Economist: Crypto May Be Driving De-dollarization Vyugin, the former head of the Russian Federal Financial Markets Service and the ex-Chairman of the Moscow Exchange, was speaking at a conference on investments and trading. Russian Economist Oleg Vyugin. (Source: Viktoria PRO invest/YouTube/Screenshot) The Professor said that a “possible” rise in “foreign trade settlements” made by “Russian companies in cryptocurrency” could have helped stabilize the RUB. Vyugin explained that crypto deals make no use of “hard currencies.” That could be one reason why the demand for USD and other fiats was dropping, he remarked. The economist said: “We need to take settlement factors. into account. For example, we have information that Russia uses cryptocurrency in settlements with China. That is, this means that there is no demand for dollars. The dollar is not needed to carry out these settlements.” He remarked that while settlements remained “very difficult” to process, it was hard to see “what the point of [the] dollar” was in such trade deals. Vyugin added: “Using alternative forms of payment can reduce demand for hard currencies, and it is possible that this factor is also at play.” Russia's oil exports slipped to their lowest in a month in the four weeks to April 6, dropping 220,000 barrels a day from their recent peak, writes @JLeeEnergy https://t.co/BXGwBJfmEm — Bloomberg (@business) April 8, 2025 Yuan and USD Demand Falling? The Russian economist conceded that his claims amounted to “an assumption.” But he also suggested that crypto adoption may also be impacting the demand for other fiats. These include the Chinese yuan, Vyugin said. The newspaper noted that the yuan exchange rate on the Moscow Exchange has” been steadily declining for several months.” The exchange’s data shows that yuan prices have fallen by 22.4% from their closing levels in November last year. At that point, they stood at 14.5 rubles ($0.17). At the end of trading on Friday April 11, the Chinese currency was officially trading for around 11.25 rubles ($0.14) in Moscow. The newspaper also noted that the official dollar exchange rate, as set by the Russian Central Bank, has also fallen from RUB 109.58 (currently $1.32) to 84 rubles in the same period.

The Central Bank, meanwhile, remains vehemently opposed to crypto adoption . It wants to restrict companies to trading within the confines of its official crypto pay sandbox. But a growing chorus of domestic companies – including a major logistics player – have asked Moscow to roll out legal framework that would allow more firms to use crypto as a settlement tool for international trade. Observers think that Russian firms first began using crypto in earnest in response to the US, UK, and EU-led sanctions packages first launched after the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022.

Starting the year trading close to just $1, the token jumped to an all-time high of about $260 by November—a startling 25,000% growth in less than a year. Solana’s high-speed blockchain, low fees, and developer-friendly environment drove adoption and firmly placed it in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, transcending mere hype. By December 2024, Solana had a market value of over $103.5 billion, with a price holding robust around $217.33. Its popularity prepared the ground for a further generation of altcoins meant to follow its path. One project— Rexas Finance (RXS)—is today making comparisons to Solana’s early run. With a real-world use case, rapid presale growth, and a community-first model, RXS could be next to skyrocket into the crypto elite. How Rexas Finance (RXS) is changing real-world asset investment Rexas Finance is not only another DeFi token offering significant profits. Focusing on tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs)—transforming typically illiquid markets, including real estate, commodities, and financial securities, into fractional, transferable digital tokens—gives the blockchain area actual usefulness. For investors, this is revolutionary. With just a few hundred dollars, a picture has a share in a multimillion-dollar commercial property, rare artwork, or high-yield commodity fund. Rexas exposes these doors to ordinary people, providing access to wealth-creation opportunities outside top institutional investors. The project’s infrastructure is developed considering usability and scale. Anyone can design blockchain tokens with the Rexas Token Builder without knowing one line of code. Combining the QuickMint Bot with platforms like Telegram and Discord allows users to instantly launch tokens, substantially simplifying worldwide blockchain access points. Rexas also uses the vibrant DeFi ecosystem by providing liquidity pools, staking, and yield farming. These services offer RXS members broader interaction with the platform and passive earning possibilities. Additionally, distributed governance enables token holders to influence the direction of the protocol. The Rexas Launchpad helps startups by streamlining financing and project screening through on-chain validation, fostering investor confidence and creative output. Rexas AI Shield also provides real-time smart contract monitoring, therefore strengthening the ecosystem against fraud and exploitation. Supported by a finished Certik audit, Rexas shows its dedication to security and openness—qualities essential for long-term development. Rexas Finance (RXS) presale: the next big crypto opportunity The numbers speak for themselves. In Stage 12 of its presale, Rexas Finance boasts 91.58% of tokens sold. Initially costing $0.03 in Stage 1, RXS has jumped to $0.20—a 567% rise. The project has raised $46.8 million in presale funding, a strong indicator of growing market excitement ahead of its launch. Rexas is laying the conditions for explosive expansion with a verified listing price of $0.25 on at least three top-tier exchanges on June 19, 2025. Echoing the size of Solana’s iconic breakthrough, analysts estimate that once RXS goes live, the mix of immense publicity, community involvement, and desire for real-world asset access could drive a 40,000% surge. Rexas Finance did things differently than many hyped-up tokens supported by venture funding. Free of VC money, this is a community-first project. That implies no artificial inflation, early-stage token dumping, and a better route for natural price discovery. The forthcoming Tier-1 exchange listings—massive catalysts—are rumored to include sites like Binance and Coinbase. They could quickly boost liquidity and global visibility. Concurrently, the continuous $1 million RXS token giveaway has evolved into a viral campaign, attracting over 1.8 million participants and increasing brand recognition. Rexas Finance meets every need investors search for in the next great breakthrough initiative, thanks to its strong foundation of creativity, community involvement, and practical value. The last chance to catch the next 100,000% crypto surge? Opportunities like Solana’s 2021 run are rare—but not impossible to catch. Rexas Finance could be the next altcoin to soar into the top 10 following Solana’s path. Its momentum, technology, and goal make it among the most exciting initiatives for 2025. Rexas Finance may just be the second shot for individuals who missed out on the early waves of Solana, but the window is closing rapidly as the presale concludes.

This was the case with Mantra (OM).

Speaking on the matter was JP Mullin, co-founder and CEO of the protocol, who explained: We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders.

43316300,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63967,1744605940,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP Price Prediction For April 14, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-prediction-for-april-14-2025/,"XRP is beginning to show signs of a major technical reversal, driven by strong momentum indicators and improving structure on the charts. The recent formation of a Golden Cross on the MACD has sparked optimism among traders, indicating that a bullish phase could be underway. Currently priced at $2.1413, XRP is trading with mild gains as the market absorbs a potential breakout from its prolonged consolidation. Market sentiment is gradually shifting in favor of bulls, and all eyes are on the next move. Golden Cross on Daily Chart Strengthens Bullish Sentiment The daily chart shows a powerful signal in the form of a MACD Golden Cross, which typically signifies the beginning of a sustained upward trend. The MACD line has moved above the signal line, and the histogram is printing green bars (suggesting momentum is tilting upward). This formation, combined with XRP trading above the 20-day simple moving average (SMA), adds further weight to the bullish case. Historically, such signals have led to substantial rallies, and current price action mirrors similar pre-rally behavior seen in past cycles. Bollinger Bands Suggest Volatility Breakout Is Near The Bollinger Bands are transitioning from a squeeze phase to expansion, implying an impending spike in volatility. XRP has rebounded from the lower band and is now pushing against the midline, with the upper band in sight around $2.35. A daily close above the midline could set the stage for a surge toward resistance. The narrowing of the bands earlier this month reflected low volatility, but the current widening suggests that a strong directional move is brewing. Momentum traders should prepare for a possible breakout in the coming sessions. 4-Hour Chart Confirms Rounded Bottom Pattern Zooming into the 4-hour chart, XRP appears to be forming a rounded bottom, a textbook reversal pattern that often precedes bullish continuation. The MACD on this timeframe is also bullish, with a steady upward trajectory and positive histogram bars. The price is making higher lows and has tested the resistance zone around $2.16 multiple times (an early sign of breakout strength). If bulls can secure a close above that mark with increased volume, it could trigger a rally toward $2.25–$2.30 within hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Support and Resistance Levels to Watch Closely Immediate support lies at $2.09, which coincides with the 20-day SMA. Stronger support levels sit at $2.00 and $1.83, which have held firm during recent corrections. Resistance is now building at $2.35, followed by $2.50, and the psychological barrier of $3.00. If XRP breaks through $2.35 with strong volume, a rally toward $2.50 may unfold quickly. Volume confirmation will be key to validating any breakout and ensuring momentum is sustained rather than rejected. Prediction For Today With both the daily and 4-hour charts showing synchronized bullish signals, XRP is likely to trade within a projected range of $2.20 to $2.35 today. If buying pressure intensifies and resistance at $2.35 is broken, the rally could extend toward $2.45 by day’s end. However, if momentum stalls, a retracement to $2.09 could occur before another bullish attempt. Overall, indicators favor continued upside as market sentiment improves and technical patterns align.

43316337,https://invezz.com/?p=2669608,1744606210,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Solana’s next big move: will it break $200 or fall to $94?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/04/14/solanas-next-big-move-will-it-break-200-or-fall-to-94/,"Solana (SOL) stays under significant bearish pressure even as the crypto market recovers gradually after a notable drop over the past month. Intense market sell-offs last week caused SOL’s stock to tumble about 10%. It has struggled to keep an optimistic momentum. Solana has had a significant rejection at the $145 barrier and trades below the $130 support level. The urgent question remains: Will Solana plummet below $94 or push toward the $200 mark while traders carefully observe its next significant movement? Will Solana price break $200 or fall to $94? The price of Solana has been erratic; from its peak of $294 on January 19, 2025, the token dropped a startling 57%. Despite this sharp drop, the general crypto market is still developing, which gives SOL a chance to recover. With a 1.30% rise in the past 24 hours, today’s global crypto market capitalization is $2.69 trillion. This increase suggests possible market stability, which would help Solana’s price movement. Market activity has also exploded, reflecting a notable 35.83% increase; the total crypto trading volume in the past 24 hours exceeds $76.09 billion. The leading player in the crypto market, Bitcoin, is currently hovering at about $83,000. Given the past correlation between BTC and SOL, additional price increases for Bitcoin could spark Solana’s comeback. Moreover, conjecture about accepting an ETF based on Solana has generated market hope. SOL’s price jumped by 8% in just 24 hours upon word of a possible Solana ETF surfaced, clearly showing the significant influence of institutional interest. Polymarketcap reports that Solana’s expected growth rate is 82%, supporting the likelihood of a substantial price increase. Source: Polymarket Notwithstanding these positive signs, Solana still has a downside risk. Should the general attitude toward the market weaken, SOL might suffer more losses. Macroeconomic uncertainty plus declining investor confidence could cause Solana’s price to drop to $94. Whether SOL has a bullish breakout or suffers more losses will depend mainly on the market’s direction in the following weeks. Source: TradingView Solana must first break over the $150 resistance level to restore strength. Should it succeed, the primary goals would be $170, $180, and the crucial $200 mark. Still, a lack of sustaining buying demand can cause more falls. Should the pessimistic attitude increase, SOL could test support at $100 and show a significantly more declining trend into $94 below $120. While Solana faces uncertainty in its price movement, Rexas Finance (RXS) has emerged as the altcoin poised for an explosive rally. Rexas Finance (RXS): the altcoin set to outperform Solana Rexas Finance empowers people to own or tokenize actual assets, including real estate, artwork, goods, and intellectual property. This creative asset tokenization method transforms investment behavior and makes worldwide smooth ownership transfers possible. Currently in its 12th and final presale stage, RXS is priced at just $0.20. The presale has already raised an impressive $47.79 million, filling 91.80% of its allocation, with the launch price at $0.25. Investors have been flocking to RXS due to its rapid growth, soaring over 500% from its initial presale price to its current valuation. Adding to its appeal, Rexas Finance is conducting a $1 million giveaway, attracting over 1.82 million entries. The giveaway will reward 20 winners with $50,000 worth of RXS each. To participate, investors must contribute at least $100 in the presale, complete specific tasks, and refer others to gain bonus entries. One key factor boosting investor confidence in RXS is its successful audit by Certik, a leading blockchain security firm. This validation increases trust among investors, further solidifying Rexas Finance as a strong contender in the market. With its presale momentum and innovative real-world asset tokenization model, RXS is projected to skyrocket to $150 post-launch, marking an astounding 750x surge from its current price. This positions Rexas Finance as a more lucrative investment opportunity than Solana, offering significantly higher returns. Conclusion Solana still has development potential, but its short-term price behavior is under doubt. For those seeking exponential returns, though, Rexas Finance (RXS) offers a convincing alternative. With its creative asset tokenizing approach, explosive presale momentum, and Certik-audited security, RXS is positioned for a considerable rise, possibly exceeding $150. Rexas Finance is the altcoin with the highest growth potential in the following months, while Solana struggles with market pressure.

43315326,https://coinpaper.com/8494/sec-and-binance-extend-legal-pause-as-cz-denies-wsj-allegations,1744606800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,SEC and Binance Extend Legal Pause as CZ Denies WSJ Allegations,https://coinpaper.com/8494/sec-and-binance-extend-legal-pause-as-cz-denies-wsj-allegations,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and cryptocurrency exchange Binance have requested a second 60-day pause in their nearly two-year legal battle, citing ongoing discussions and recent internal regulatory developments. The extension comes as former Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao publicly denied a report alleging he agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun in connection with his own plea agreement with the Department of Justice. SEC and Binance Seek Additional Two-Month Pause in Prolonged Legal Battle as Crypto Task Force Reframes Case Strategy The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, have jointly requested another 60-day pause in their long-running legal battle, signaling a possible shift in the regulator’s approach to crypto enforcement under new leadership and the recently formed Crypto Task Force. According to a joint status report filed on April 11 with the US District Court for the District of Columbia, the SEC and Binance have engaged in “productive discussions” since the last court-approved stay in February. The talks reportedly include analysis of how the task force’s evolving mandate may impact the SEC’s original claims against the crypto giant. “Since the Court stayed this case, the Parties have been in productive discussions, including discussions concerning how the efforts of the crypto task force may impact the SEC’s claims,” the filing reads. The SEC initiated the extension request, and Binance agreed to it. The joint request is framed as being “in the interest of judicial economy,” reflecting a desire to avoid unnecessary litigation while both sides reassess the scope and direction of the case. This marks the second 60-day stay jointly requested by the SEC and Binance this year. The first was granted in February, just days after crypto critic Gary Gensler stepped down as SEC Chair on Jan. 20. His departure was swiftly followed by the appointment of Commissioner Mark Uyeda—a known crypto-friendly voice within the agency—as acting chair. Uyeda’s leadership appears to have catalyzed a broader rethinking of the agency’s crypto enforcement playbook, particularly as the newly formed Crypto Task Force takes shape. Crypto Task Force Reshaping Strategy A key factor behind the extension request is the SEC’s internal restructuring through its newly established Crypto Task Force. Formed on Jan. 21—just one day after Gensler’s resignation—the task force has been tasked with modernizing the SEC’s approach to regulating digital assets. Its priorities include clarifying registration pathways, designing rational disclosure regimes, and ensuring enforcement actions are proportionate and well-targeted. This evolving strategy could significantly impact the SEC’s original case against Binance. Filed in June 2023, the lawsuit accused Binance and its founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, of 13 violations including the unregistered sale of BNB and Binance USD tokens, unauthorized operation of staking services like Simple Earn and BNB Vault, and failures related to customer protections. The establishment of the task force is seen by many in the crypto community as a potential turning point in the regulatory landscape. By reevaluating legacy lawsuits under new guidelines, the SEC may be moving away from the combative tone that characterized Gensler’s tenure—marked by sweeping enforcement actions and a contentious relationship with the industry. Broader SEC Retreat from Aggressive Enforcement The Binance case isn’t the only one facing delays or withdrawals. Over the past month, the SEC has either dropped or paused lawsuits against other major players in the crypto space, including Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini, Robinhood, and Consensys. These decisions suggest a possible coordinated de-escalation across the board, reflecting both political pressures and internal reevaluation. With Binance now operating under tighter compliance frameworks and having undergone significant restructuring since its early run-ins with US regulators, the possibility of a negotiated resolution or narrowed enforcement scope appears increasingly likely. Still, legal uncertainty looms large. Binance’s former CEO, CZ, pleaded guilty to separate federal charges in late 2023 and stepped down from his role, adding further complexity to the case. The SEC’s civil action, however, is distinct from the DOJ’s criminal proceedings. As part of their filing, the SEC and Binance committed to submitting another joint status report at the end of the new 60-day period. The next update is expected by mid-June, and will likely offer deeper insight into whether a resolution is imminent or whether the litigation will continue to drag on. Crypto watchers are cautiously optimistic. With Uyeda at the helm and a task force focused on pragmatic regulation, there is hope that a new chapter of SEC -crypto relations may be unfolding—one rooted less in sweeping enforcement and more in negotiated compliance and constructive dialogue. CZ Denies Cooperating Against Justin Sun, Calls WSJ Report a “Smear Campaign” Amid Rising Crypto Lobbying Tensions In related news, CZ has forcefully denied explosive allegations that he agreed to testify against Tron founder Justin Sun as part of a plea deal with the US Department of Justice (DOJ). The claims, published by The Wall Street Journal on April 11, cite anonymous sources suggesting that Zhao’s cooperation was a previously undisclosed element of his 2023 settlement with US prosecutors. In a sharp rebuke on social media, Zhao took to X to deny the accusations, accusing The Wall Street Journal of running a “hit piece” and implying that the outlet’s journalists may have been bribed. “WSJ is really TRYING here. They seem to have forgotten who went to prison and who didn't,” Zhao posted on April 12. “People who become gov witnesses don’t go to prison. They are protected. I heard someone paid WSJ employees to smear me.” Zhao, who was sentenced to four months in prison in April 2024 for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) violations, was released on Sept. 27 of the same year. Despite the jail time, he remains one of the wealthiest individuals in the world—with an estimated net worth of $60 billion at the time of his release—making him the richest person to ever serve a US prison sentence. The allegations have sent shockwaves through the crypto community, particularly because of the close public association between Zhao and Justin Sun, the Chinese-born entrepreneur who founded the TRON blockchain and has also been the subject of several US regulatory investigations. Sun recently said he was unaware of any such deal and dismissed the rumors. “CZ is my mentor and close friend,” he said, emphasizing that he had no reason to believe Zhao would provide evidence against him. The denial by Sun adds another layer to an already controversial situation and raises questions about the credibility and motive of the WSJ report, which relies heavily on anonymous sources and has not been corroborated by any formal statements from the DOJ. Allegations of Lobbying and Political Targeting Zhao’s fiery response also included a broader critique of what he described as targeted political lobbying within the US aimed at undermining Binance and himself personally. “I also heard some rumors about some players ‘lobbying’ against us again in the US,” he wrote, alluding to potential coordinated efforts by competitors or regulatory influencers to reignite scrutiny on Binance. This isn’t the first time Zhao has raised such claims. In late 2023, he accused collapsed crypto exchange FTX of lobbying US regulators to take action against Binance, pointing to a Federal Newswire report that claimed FTX leadership had sought regulatory pressure on rivals to bolster its own market position. Such accusations are part of a growing narrative in the crypto industry that suggests policy and enforcement decisions are increasingly being shaped by corporate lobbying rather than transparent regulatory processes. CZ’s recent remarks come at a time when political influence in the crypto sector is under intense scrutiny. According to a March report by the Center for Political Accountability (CPA), crypto companies poured over $134 million into the 2024 US elections through Political Action Committees (PACs) like Fairshake, raising concerns about “unchecked political spending.” While many in the industry argue that such donations are necessary to secure fair and balanced regulation, critics warn that it risks undermining public trust. The Wall Street Journal report on Zhao’s alleged cooperation with the DOJ comes just weeks after these revelations, leading some observers to question whether the timing of the article was influenced by broader political and regulatory battles. Legal Context and Lingering Questions CZ’s legal troubles began in earnest in November 2023, when he entered a plea agreement with the DOJ related to systemic AML failures at Binance. The settlement included a $4.3 billion penalty—the largest in crypto history—and his resignation as CEO. However, the plea deal, as publicly disclosed at the time, made no mention of any cooperation agreement involving Justin Sun. The DOJ has so far declined to comment on the WSJ report or provide clarification on whether Zhao’s plea deal includes a clause requiring him to testify against other industry figures. Meanwhile, Justin Sun continues to face legal headwinds. He was charged by the SEC in March 2023 for unregistered securities offerings and fraud relating to the TRX and BitTorrent tokens. While Sun remains active in the crypto space, his legal status within the United States remains unclear, with some reports suggesting he is avoiding US jurisdiction.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB|BTT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-14 05:00:00

From trading above $6.30, OM nosedived to below $0.43 on April 13, erasing nearly $6 billion in market capitalization and sparking a wave of speculation across crypto circles. Traders were quick to voice their concerns, with some drawing grim parallels to the infamous collapses of LUNA and FTX. A market participant known as Gordon posted on X, “The team needs to address this or OM looks like it could head to zero, biggest rug pull since LUNA/FTX?” At the time of publication, the exact cause of the price implosion remains unclear. The Mantra team has yet to issue an official detailed statement, although co-founder JP Mullin attempted to calm the waters by confirming that the team’s OM holdings remain intact and verifiable. “We are here and not going anywhere,” Mullin wrote , directing users to a blockchain address tied to the team’s holdings. MANTRA Community Scrambles for Clarity In an initial response to the growing panic, the Mantra team claimed the collapse was not the result of internal malfeasance but rather “triggered by reckless liquidations.” The statement, shared on social media, emphasized that the core infrastructure of the project remains intact and that the community Telegram group is still active. However, the broader crypto community has grown wary of such assurances. 2025 has already seen multiple high-profile collapses, from the Libra memecoin’s implosion to a $1.4 billion hack at Bybit —leaving investors on edge and increasingly skeptical. Tokenization Ambitions Now in Jeopardy Just months ago, Mantra was making headlines for very different reasons. In January, the platform signed a $1 billion deal with investment conglomerate DAMAC to bring its real estate and data assets onto the blockchain. By February, Mantra had secured a coveted Virtual Asset Service Provider license from Dubai’s VARA, positioning itself as a serious player in the UAE’s booming crypto scene. The project had been riding a wave of optimism from real estate investors looking to leverage blockchain for capital formation, citing faster settlement times and reduced costs. But following the OM token’s plunge, the future of those ambitions now hangs in the balance.

Over the weekend , Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the White House’s decision to exempt items like smartphones, computers, and the semiconductors that power them from tariffs was a temporary measure. President Trump confirmed it later in a press briefing , stating that the tariff rate would be announced next week, but there would be some ""flexibility"" on the matter. ""The market saw a material rebound as popular consumer electronics categories were exempted from the 125% tariffs on China,"" BTSE COO Jeff Mei told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""Even after Trump mentioned that they would simply be moving to another bucket of tariffs rather than exempted altogether, markets held their gain amidst rumors that business leaders were able to convince the Trump administration to peel back some of their highest tariffs."" ""From our side, we believe there will be challenges to shift global supply chains away from China overnight and that low-end, low-margin manufacturing is most likely going to shift to other Asian countries after they broker trade deals. That being said, we do think that this rally looks temporary and that markets will continue to be volatile in the short term,"" Mei added. Meanwhile, China has announced its own tariffs on semiconductors, hitting U.S.-origin chips with a 34% tariff. However, China counts origin as where the chip was fabricated, not designed. As the majority of U.S. chip companies, like AMD and Nvidia, don't operate their own fabs and instead rely on Taiwan's – which China counts as its own territory – TSMC, they would be effectively exempt from these tariffs. Analysts in China acknowledge short-term disruptions from the semiconductor tariffs but broadly view them as an opportunity to accelerate domestic innovation, localization, and supply-chain restructuring, ultimately benefiting China's semiconductor industry in the long run. Local media in Taiwan report that TSMC is accelerating the construction of another fab in Arizona in order to be able to provide more U.S. fabricated chips as a cloud of uncertainty hangs above the sector. Within China, equity traders seem to be waiting on the final tariff news in order to make their next move. Shanghai's SSE composite index is up 0.8%, while Shenzhen's tech-heavy SZSE is up 0.9%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng is up 2.4%. Elsewhere in crypto, Hong Kong's Bosera HashKey Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been approved to offer staking services. This comes after the city's market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, issued guidance on offering staking services in Hong Kong. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted on X that the market hasn't taken to ether ETFs very kindly. The best-performing ETFs on the market, he wrote, have been those that are short ether ETFs. Ether has been down 47% over the last year, according to CoinDesk market data , while CoinDesk 20 is up 14%.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-14 05:01:11

Built on Solana, the PepeX platform is gaining ground at a time when Donald Trump’s expanding presence in crypto—from NFTs to memecoins and stablecoins—is intensifying market speculation. While Trump-linked tokens generate headlines and volatility, retail traders are increasingly turning to platforms like PepeX that focus on transparency, anti-manipulation measures, and long-term potential. With the current presale price set at $0.0268 and just hours left before the next stage increase to $0.0281, momentum is building behind one of the year’s most closely watched launchpad tokens. Presale gains speed with retail support PepeX has captured attention with a presale model that combines urgency and structure. The ICO, now in its 20th stage, has raised more than $1.35 million with just 6 hours left until the next price hike. The token, currently trading at $0.0268, will increase to $0.0281 in the following stage, maintaining a consistent 5% step-up model across 30 phases. This pricing structure, paired with a transparent fundraising countdown, has attracted a growing community of investors. The launchpad itself offers early access to new meme coin projects, providing regular investors a chance to get in before major listings or venture capital allocations—an approach often lacking in previous meme coin cycles. By ensuring fair allocation, PepeX is presenting itself as a secure way to explore high-risk assets with clear checks in place. Anti-sniping and locked liquidity features What sets PepeX apart is its built-in protocol to prevent common manipulation tactics. The platform uses anti-sniping technology to block automated bots that often hijack token launches. It also limits founders to no more than 5% of the token supply, a safeguard designed to reduce the risk of insider dumping once a coin begins trading. PepeX locks and absorbs liquidity if a project’s core team exits unexpectedly, a protection measure rarely seen on other meme coin launch platforms. Transparent wallet tracking and enforced 72-hour holding periods for project creators ensure accountability, tying rewards directly to a token’s performance over time. This structure appeals to traders who are seeking reliable project frameworks after a turbulent year across the broader crypto space. Trump’s crypto ventures boost industry spotlight Donald Trump’s growing footprint in the crypto world is also drawing more eyes to the sector. His ventures span NFTs, Bitcoin mining, DeFi projects, and the TRUMPo/USD memecoin. In January, one Trump-linked token briefly reached a market value of $10 billion, highlighting the power of celebrity-backed assets to drive investor attention. The broader Trump crypto ecosystem is now estimated to be worth close to $1 billion. These developments, combined with executive orders supporting blockchain innovation, have made digital assets a key feature of Trump’s economic platform. His campaign’s promotion of memecoins on Truth Social is reshaping how political capital intersects with speculative trading. Investors turn to structure amid hype Amid the Trump-fuelled frenzy, many investors are moving towards platforms like PepeX for a more structured entry into the market. With its presale progressing steadily, the platform is benefitting from a shift in sentiment: away from unpredictable meme coins and towards projects that prioritise fairness and transparency. As global interest in tokenisation grows, PepeX is positioning itself as a stable gateway for launching community-backed tokens under strict guidelines. In a volatile environment, that promise of fairness is proving to be one of the most powerful drivers of momentum.

The purchase was made at an average price of 11.8 million yen per BTC, totaling 3.78 billion yen. This brings Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin stash to 4,525 BTC, bought at an average price of 12.8 million yen per BTC, worth approximately 58.1 billion yen in total. Despite the crypto downturn, Metaplanet’s stock has shown steady performance this year, with a 0.57% gain. With each new acquisition, Metaplanet strengthens its position in the crypto space, signaling strong confidence in BTC’s future value. Metaplanet has acquired 319 BTC for ~$26.3 million at ~$82,549 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 108.3% YTD 2025. As of 4/14/2025, we hold 4525 $BTC acquired for ~$386.3 million at ~$85,366 per bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/aN0Jz9SgwQ — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) April 14, 2025 The company made it happen with a special metric called BTC Yield to measure the success of its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This yield shows how much more Bitcoin they hold compared to their shares in circulation. From January to March 2025, their BTC Yield was a solid 95.6%, and between April 1 to April 14, it was 6.5%, showing continued growth despite a shorter period. How They’re Funding the Buying Spree Metaplanet has been funding its massive Bitcoin purchases by teaming up with EVO FUND, a major investor. Instead of taking regular loans that require interest payments, the company has been issuing zero-coupon bonds, which don’t need interest to be paid. Along with that, EVO FUND gets the right to buy Metaplanet shares at the market price. Moreover, when they buy those shares, Metaplanet receives cash. That cash is then used to either repay the bonds or buy more Bitcoin. Between January and March 2025, Metaplanet rolled out several rounds of these bonds worth 2 to 4 billion yen each, all to support its ongoing Bitcoin investment strategy. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Prediction: Will BTC, ETH, and XRP See a Bullish Week Ahead? , Aggressive Expansion With Minimal Dilution Despite issuing millions of shares, Metaplanet claims it’s carefully managing dilution, which means shareholders aren’t losing too much ownership percentage in the company. The company uses a calculation of “Bitcoin per fully diluted share” to show that each share is becoming more valuable in terms of Bitcoin. The Bigger Picture Metaplanet is following the playbook of U.S.-based Strategy , aggressively turning its treasury into a Bitcoin reserve. By mixing creative finance and strategic share issuance, it’s doubling down on Bitcoin as a long-term asset. With Japan’s growing crypto interest , Metaplanet is positioning itself as a corporate BTC pioneer in Asia. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A clear move above the $2.250 resistance might send the price toward the $2.320 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.450 resistance or even $2.50 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.550. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.20 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.10 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $2.080 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.920 swing low to the $2.244 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.080 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.00 support. The next major support sits near the $1.920 zone.

On April 11, Senators Sheldon Whitehouse and John Fetterman drafted the bill , seeking to curb emissions from crypto mining and AI data centers. The legislation aims to impose fines on facilities that use non-renewable energy sources, by 2035. The bill also mandates annual reporting from mining facilities and data centers that use over 100 kilowatts of power. Further, the facilities must also provide details of electricity sources, consumption data, and the intensity of emissions. “There is a lack of transparency regarding the energy sources used to power domestic crypto mining and many data center operations,” the bill read. Data Centers Account for 4% US Electricity Use: Congress Finds According to Congress estimates, US-based data centers are projected to account for up to 12% of the nation’s electricity use by 2028. “The total network hash rate for Bitcoin mining in the US has increased 739% between September 2020 and January 2022.” The findings also said that data centers are estimated to account for approximately 1% of global electricity demand, and 4% of US electricity usage. Bill Aims to Lower Mining Emissions to Zero by 2035 The draft bill amends the initial Clean Air Act requiring facilities to adhere to different emissions caps as laid out in the Department of Energy’s National Transmission Needs Study . The emission caps would be set by the end of this year, the bill said, adding that it would lower by 11% each year until reaching zero in 2035. Those facilities that exceed the emissions caps would be imposed with inflation-adjusted fees. The penalty depends on how much their emissions exceeded the caps, the legislation noted. These fees would then be used to reduce increases in residential electricity costs through grants to states and local municipalities. “Crypto & AI data centers can support clean energy, but they’re burning more fossil fuels & driving up families’ energy prices instead,” Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, wrote on X. “We can lead on AI & climate safety with Senate White House’s Clean Cloud Act, which ensures that the industries profiting also pay their own way.” Crypto & AI data centers can support clean energy, but they're burning more fossil fuels & driving up families’ energy prices instead.

However, with the strong rise in recent days, Bitcoin has risen above the $85,000 level. Following this jump, a new assessment came from Wedson. Wedson stated in a statement on social media that many people asked him if he had changed his mind and included the following statements: “We still do not rule out the possibility of Bitcoin falling below $65,000. Many metrics show this level as a strong support area. In particular, True Market Mean Price and Alpha Price are positioned exactly around $64,700.” Wedson also noted that the CVDD Channel is showing support at $66,300, with the next important level being around $61,000. He noted that the Active Realized Price, which has been working as support throughout 2024, is currently at $70,200. Related News: Ripple (XRP) Price at Critical Crossroads: Analyst Says What It Takes to Rally to $2.5 Drawing attention to market behavior, Wedson made the following assessments: “Miners and short-term investors are selling. We have not yet seen a clear accumulation signal. This suggests that the process we are in may be a redistribution phase.” Emphasizing that his views on the altcoin season have not changed, the Alphractal CEO stated that Bitcoin will probably reach its peak in mid-October and altcoins may continue to rise until November or even December. Wedson noted that the Alpha metrics they use in their analyses are generally based on institutional-level analyses that are not publicly available, and drew attention to this with the following words: “We caught the bottom of the FTX crash and the recent peak of Bitcoin on the exact day. We shared them with our community in real time.” He gave a message of cautious optimism for altcoins: “Many altcoins may still decline due to long accumulation. However, some new projects may start to rise at any time.” *This is not investment advice.

43316301,https://timestabloid.com/?p=63970,1744608105,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction For April 14, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-btc-price-prediction-for-april-14-2025/,"Bitcoin (BTC) continues its steady recovery with growing technical strength, now trading at $84,610. The daily and 4-hour charts signal a notable shift in sentiment, with price action breaking key resistance levels and momentum indicators flashing bullish signals . As institutional interest returns and volatility tightens, BTC could be gearing up for its next major leg upward. Let’s dive into the technical across both timeframes. Daily Chart Reveals Momentum Shift The daily chart shows a renewed bullish structure, confirmed by a positive MACD crossover. For the first time in weeks, the MACD histogram has flipped green, and the MACD line has crossed above the signal line—indicating strengthening upward momentum. This is a classic early signal of a potential rally continuation . Bollinger Bands are beginning to widen after a period of contraction, suggesting volatility is returning to the market. BTC is also trading above the midline of the Bollinger Bands, reinforcing short-term bullish control. Consolidation Base Formed Near $77,000 From a price structure perspective, Bitcoin has formed a strong support base of around $77,000. This level has held firm through several re-tests, forming a horizontal accumulation zone. The current breakout attempt above $82,800, the middle band of the Bollinger setup, is notable. If Bitcoin maintains closes above this zone, the next logical move could be a test of the upper Bollinger Band near $88,000, followed by the psychological barrier at $90,000. Buyers appear to be absorbing supply, and higher lows continue to build a bullish structure. 4-Hour Chart Supports Breakout Thesis with Bull Flag Pattern Zooming into the 4-hour chart, BTC is carving out a bull flag formation—a bullish continuation pattern. After an impulsive leg up, the price entered a tight channel, consolidating in a downward-sloping structure. This pattern often precedes further rallies, especially when confirmed by volume expansion and MACD strength. The 4-hour MACD also reflects bullish control, with rising histogram bars and expanding separation between the MACD and signal lines. If Bitcoin breaks above $85,000 in the short term, it may rapidly climb toward $87,500–$88,000 before facing resistance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Support and Resistance Zones to Monitor Closely On the downside, immediate support lies at $82,800, followed by the demand-rich zone of $80,000–$77,500. These areas have provided structural integrity and will likely serve as re-entry zones if the price dips. On the upside, Bitcoin must reclaim and sustain above $88,200, which marks the top of the current Bollinger range. A decisive breakout beyond that level could open the path toward $92,000–$95,000, a region where prior selling pressure emerged. Volume confirmation and market sentiment will be essential in validating these levels. Price Prediction For Today Given the confluence of bullish indicators on both daily and 4-hour charts, Bitcoin is likely to trade between $83,500 and $88,000 today. If momentum accelerates and volume picks up during the U.S. session, BTC could tag the $89,000 mark intraday. Conversely, if the price faces rejection around $85,000, a short-term pullback to $82,800 is possible before resuming upward movement. The prevailing structure suggests any dips are likely to be bought aggressively, as bulls prepare for a broader breakout. Bitcoin is showing clear signs of a trend reversal, supported by a bullish MACD crossover, Bollinger Band expansion, and stable support formation. Both intraday and macro indicators align in favor of buyers, increasing the probability of an upward breakout in the near term. As market sentiment improves and technical strengthen, BTC could be on track for a rally toward the $90,000 region—setting the stage for a potentially explosive second quarter. Traders should monitor the $85,000 breakout zone closely for directional confirmation. Disclaimer: This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Now, well known people in the industry like Adam Back and Joe Burnett are still bullish, and predict long-term price targets as high as $2.1 million by 2035. Meanwhile, Bitcoin adoption continues to expand, with Scotland’s Lomond School becoming the UK’s first to accept BTC for tuition and introducing a curriculum on Bitcoin and Austrian economics in partnership with author Saifedean Ammous. Michael Saylor Signals Bitcoin Buying Spree Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, signaled the company's intention to resume its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy after a brief two-week pause. On March 31, Strategy made its latest purchase of 22,048 BTC, which brought up its total holdings to 528,185 BTC. According to data from SaylorTracker , the firm’s Bitcoin investment is currently up by around 26%, translating to over $8.6 billion in unrealized gains. Despite the recent downturn that saw Bitcoin's price dip below $80,000, Strategy was able to maintain its accumulation pace. This proved that there is still strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin. Strategy Bitcoin (Source: SaylorTracker ) Bitcoin demonstrated resilience despite the recent macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly as global markets reacted to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff orders triggered a historic $5 trillion sell-off in global equities, and cryptocurrencies were not immune. Data from Total3 , which is a market cap tracker excluding BTC and ETH, revealed that altcoins have lost more than 33% of their value since peaking in December of 2024. In contrast, Bitcoin dropped approximately 22% from its January 2025 high of over $109,000, but is holding relatively steady around the $84,000 level. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) This price stability fueled the narrative of Bitcoin as a store-of-value asset, distinct from traditional risk-on investments. At Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and well known cypherpunk, suggested that Bitcoin's appeal as digital gold is growing in light of persistent macroeconomic threats. Back anticipates inflation rates could surge to between 10% and 15% over the next decade, putting pressure on returns from conventional asset classes like stocks and real estate. He believes in Bitcoin’s potential to compete directly with gold, and explained that it could begin to take over gold’s traditional use cases as more investors look for protection against monetary debasement. Analysts Stick to Bold Bitcoin Predictions Bitcoin is still on a long-term bullish trajectory despite recent price corrections and weakening investor sentiment that was triggered by escalating global trade tensions. Joe Burnett , director of market research at Unchained, shared his perspective during a live show , and predicted that Bitcoin could still reach $1.8 million by 2035. He mentioned two models he considers credible: the ”parallel model,” which forecasts Bitcoin at $1.8 million, and Michael Saylor’s “Bitcoin 24” model, which projects a $2.1 million price point in the same timeframe. Burnett believes that both serve as realistic base cases, but Bitcoin’s future value could surpass them depending on broader macroeconomic shifts. The ongoing trade war climate, spurred by President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff threats since taking office in January, dented risk appetite across equities and crypto markets. While physical and tokenized gold emerged as beneficiaries of this risk-off sentiment, Bitcoin’s store-of-value appeal remains intact. Burnett compared Bitcoin’s potential to the technological shift from horse-and-buggy to automobiles, and argued that Bitcoin’s properties will allow it to eventually eclipse gold’s $21 trillion market capitalization. If Bitcoin were to match that valuation today, it would be worth $1 million per coin. Despite short-term weakness and falling ETF inflows, Bitcoin’s volatility continues to decline in both bull and bear markets, which he believes is a sign of growing maturity in the asset class. Burnett acknowledged that another steep drawdown of up to 80% could still happen during future bear cycles, but he sees these periods as strategic entry points for long-term holders with strong conviction. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes shares a similar opinion, and predicted Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2025 if the US Federal Reserve shifts back to quantitative easing. (Source: Arthur Hayes ) However, in the immediate term, uncertainty surrounding global trade negotiations continues to pressure market sentiment. Enmanuel Cardozo , a market analyst at tokenization platform Brickken, pointed out that investors are reluctant to take on big positions over the next 90 days as they await more clarity on the tariff landscape. With capital flowing out of Bitcoin ETFs, many are reallocating funds into traditional safe havens like gold and strong national currencies. UK School Adds Bitcoin and Austrian Economics Curriculum In other Bitcoin-related news, a private educational institute in Scotland announced that it will begin accepting Bitcoin for tuition payments starting in the autumn semester of 2025. This will make it the first school in the United Kingdom to adopt BTC as a payment method. Interestingly, the school also partnered with Saifedean Ammous , the well-known author of The Bitcoin Standard, to develop a new curriculum that is focused on Bitcoin and Austrian economics. Ammous is very excited for the initiative, and stated that his goal is to make the material widely accessible to students all around the world. Claire Chisholm , Principal of Lomond School, confirmed the collaboration. She looks forward to working with Ammous and appreciates the strong support from the broader Bitcoin community. The forthcoming curriculum is expected to provide students with a foundational understanding of Bitcoin’s principles and the economic theories that underpin it, particularly those rooted in Austrian economics. This is a school of thought known for advocating sound money and limited government intervention. Ammous’s book The Bitcoin Standard was first published in 2018, and played a pivotal role in popularizing Bitcoin’s monetary philosophy. More than one million copies have been sold in 38 languages. Now, the collaboration with Lomond School is a major milestone in the expanding relationship between Bitcoin and mainstream education. Across the world, academic institutions have increasingly embraced Bitcoin as both a topic of scholarly inquiry and a practical financial tool. The University of Nicosia in Cyprus was one of the first to offer a Master’s in Digital Currency back in 2013. This was followed by courses at major US universities like NYU’s Stern School of Business, which introduced a course on the law and business of cryptocurrencies in 2014, and Stanford University’s Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies course that was launched in 2015. More recently, the University of Austin unveiled a $5 million Bitcoin investment fund in February of 2025 as part of its larger $200 million endowment, making it the first of its kind. Before that, it was revealed that Emory University invested more than $15 million into Bitcoin through Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-14 05:28:51

OM plunged from over $6 to just over 40 cents late Sunday to early Monday in typically low liquidity hours for the crypto market — where outsized volumes can trigger massive price movements in either direction. “We want to assure you that MANTRA is fundamentally strong,” the team said in an X post following the price drop. “Today’s activity was triggered by reckless liquidations, not anything to do with the project. One thing we want to be clear on: this was not our team. We are looking into it and will share more details about what happened as soon as we can.” Mantra lets users tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and commodities, enabling compliant digital investments in tangible assets. Its OM token facilitates transactions and governance. In January 2025, Mantra partnered with DAMAC Group, a UAE-based conglomerate, to tokenize $1 billion in assets, including real estate, hospitality, and data centers. OM was among the biggest market gainers in 2024, rising more than 400% on relatively low public conversation on crypto-related social media - which intrigued traders and investors alike on the strength of the move. Meanwhile, co-founder John Patrick Mullin alleged the movement was likely due to exchanges closing OM positions, which impacted all market exposure. “We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders,” Mullin said in an X post . “The timing and depth of the crash suggest that a very sudden closure of account positions was initiated without sufficient warning or notice.” He further alleged “intentional market positioning taken by centralized exchanges.” OM-tracked futures recorded over $50 million in liquidations on the long side, a record figure for the tokens. Open interest slumped from $345 million to just over $130 million, indicating a quick exit for unsettled futures bets. Some prominent crypto voices aren’t buying that narrative, however, with scores of dismissive replies under Mullin’s posts . OKX founder Star Xu added in a response to a separate post that flagged over $220 million in token deposits to exchanges before the price crash. ""It’s a big scandal to the whole crypto industry. All of the onchain unlock and deposit data is public, all major exchanges’ collateral and liquidation data can be investigated.

With a price of $0.0268 in its ongoing 30-stage, 90-day presale, PepeX is drawing comparisons to established meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and PepeCoin (PEPECOIN), igniting discussions about its competitive edge. As the market remains volatile, investors are scrutinizing PepeX’s value proposition against its peers, though the establishment narrative of inevitable meme coin success warrants skepticism. PepeX’s presale began at $0.02, with a 5% price increase per stage, reaching $0.0268 by Stage 6, with 75 days remaining, as noted by the official PepeX account on X. This gradual rise has attracted significant interest, with 45% of its 2.25 billion token supply sold, per CoinJournal on April 10, 2025. Why PepeX is popular? Its AI-driven platform aims to revolutionize meme coin launches, offering fairness and reducing pump-and-dump risks seen in 99% of Pump.fun projects, aclaim that challenges the hype-driven model of many rivals. In contrast, Pepe (PEPE), an Ethereum-based meme coin, trades at $0.00000739, with a $3.1 billion market cap, per Bybit on April 12, 2025. Despite a 7.55% daily gain, it remains 75% below its $0.000028 all-time high from December 2024, per CoinMarketCap, reflecting stagnation after its 2023 surge. PepeCoin (PEPECOIN), another contender, sits at $0.5114 with a $54.7 million market cap, up 9.52% in 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap on April 13, 2025, but trails its $7.51 peak by 93%. Both coins lack the utility PepeX promises, relying on community hype and token burns, which may not sustain long-term value. PepeX’s $0.0268 price is significantly higher than PEPE’s micro-value and aligns closer to PEPECOIN’s range, reflecting its early-stage premium. PepeX set for a surge Analysts suggest PepeX could see a 332% presale surge to $0.0836 if momentum holds, outpacing PEPE’s modest recovery and PEPECOIN’s volatility. However, its unproven status and reliance on AI adoption raise risks, especially in a market where 45% bearish sentiment persists for similar coins, per Bitget on April 13, 2025. Posts found on X show 28% bullish sentiment, but the lack of exchange listings post-presale could limit liquidity compared to PEPE’s established presence on Binance and PEPECOIN’s LBank trading. The establishment narrative of meme coin dominance often overlooks utility gaps—PEPE’s no-tax appeal and PEPECOIN’s burning mechanism haven’t prevented declines, suggesting PepeX’s AI focus could be a differentiator if executed well. Investors should weigh PepeX’s growth potential against PEPE’s stability and PEPECOIN’s recovery, monitoring presale progress and market trends for informed decisions.

43316489,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149058,1744609397,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Smart Empire Play: Decoding Musk’s xAI Merger and its Crypto Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/musk-xai-merger-crypto-empire/,"Elon Musk’s recent move to merge his AI venture, xAI, with X (formerly Twitter), has sparked intense debate in tech and finance circles, particularly within the cryptocurrency community. Was this an ingenious maneuver to solidify his tech empire, or just another audacious gamble by the enigmatic billionaire? For those invested in the crypto ecosystem and the broader narrative of decentralized technologies, understanding the implications of this Musk xAI merger is crucial. Let’s unpack this complex deal and see what it truly means for investors and the future of AI. Decoding the Musk xAI Merger: A Strategic Masterstroke? When the news broke that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock deal, the immediate reaction was mixed. On the surface, it appeared unconventional. However, digging deeper reveals a potentially calculated strategy. Here’s a breakdown of why this Musk xAI merger might be more strategic than it seems: Synergy and Integration: Grok, xAI’s chatbot, was already interwoven with X. Formalizing the merger streamlines operations and deepens this Twitter integration . Financial Restructuring: X’s financial performance has been challenging. Integrating it with the potentially high-growth xAI could reframe X as an integral part of a larger, more valuable AI-driven entity. AGI Ambitions: Musk has consistently voiced his ambition for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This merger positions X as a vital data source and distribution platform for xAI’s AGI development, fueling his broader vision for his tech empire. Yoni Rechtman from Slow Ventures aptly summarizes the essence of Musk’s conglomerate: “All of Elon’s companies today are basically one company… It’s all already Elon, Inc.” This perspective suggests the merger is less about two separate entities joining forces, and more about formalizing the already deeply interconnected nature of Musk’s ventures. The Allure of the Elon Musk Empire: Beyond Quick Returns Investing in any of Musk’s companies, including those involved in the Musk xAI merger , is often perceived differently from traditional investments. It’s less about immediate ROI and more about buying into a grander narrative. Investors are drawn to Musk’s persona, his audacious goals, and the overarching story of disruptive innovation he projects. This approach to AI investment is narrative-driven, where faith in Musk’s vision often outweighs conventional financial metrics. Ron Baron of Baron Capital highlights this ecosystem effect: “every single thing [Musk] does is helping everything else he does.” This interconnectedness extends across Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, creating a powerful crypto ecosystem (in a broader sense of interconnected assets and valuations) around Musk’s leadership. Consider these interconnected elements within the Elon Musk empire : Company Contribution to the Ecosystem Tesla EV technology, autonomous driving, humanoid robots, data for AI training. SpaceX Space infrastructure, potential for global internet, resource sharing. X (Twitter) Vast real-time data, distribution platform for AI, social media reach. xAI AI research and development, Grok chatbot, AGI pursuit. Neuralink Brain-computer interfaces, long-term potential for human-AI synergy. Valuation in the Musk Era: Hope Over Hard Numbers? The financial details of the Musk xAI merger raised eyebrows. Questions arose about X’s $33 billion valuation and xAI’s $80 billion valuation, especially given xAI’s limited revenue. However, in the “Muskverse,” valuations are often future-oriented, fueled by investor expectations rather than current financials. This mirrors Tesla’s long-standing high valuation, justified by the promise of future breakthroughs in self-driving technology and robotics. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management explains Tesla’s valuation premium: “people are making a bet on the long term, and it’s not about what happens to numbers this year.” This long-term faith is “one of Elon’s superpowers,” enabling him to maintain investor engagement and support for ambitious, long-horizon projects. This investor sentiment is crucial for understanding the dynamics of AI investment in Musk’s ventures. Risks and Realities: Navigating the Musk Ecosystem While the potential of the Musk xAI merger is compelling, it’s essential to acknowledge the risks. Dan Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School, points out immediate concerns like the SEC lawsuit against X, user privacy issues related to AI data collection, and the evolving regulatory landscape for AI. Key risk factors to consider: SEC Lawsuit: The ongoing legal battle over Musk’s Twitter acquisition adds uncertainty. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increasing attention on AI regulation, particularly in Europe, could impact xAI and X’s operations. User Privacy: Data collection practices for AI training on X are already under investigation. Musk’s Focus: Rechtman raises a valid point about Musk’s potentially shifting priorities, citing his recent focus on non-business ventures. Despite these risks, Munster remains optimistic, viewing them as minor compared to the transformative potential of AI and xAI’s role in it. He sees xAI as potentially “one of the four brains that the world is going to run on,” a powerful statement underscoring the high-stakes, high-reward nature of AI investment in Musk’s vision. Betting on Elon: A Leap of Faith? Ultimately, investing in the Musk xAI merger , or any part of Musk’s empire, requires a degree of faith. Rechtman suggests Musk bulls are not blindly loyal but rather trust in his ability to “bend capital markets to his will.” This unique capability allows him to pursue projects and build businesses that defy conventional limitations. For many investors, gaining access to the Musk ecosystem is a strategic goal in itself. As Rechtman notes, “SpaceX is a real thing, and it will never go public… the only way to invest in SpaceX is to get access to the tenders. And the only way to get access to the tenders is to be in Elon’s good graces.” This exclusivity further fuels the allure of investing in Musk’s broader ventures, even seemingly speculative ones like X post-acquisition. Conclusion: The Smart Gamble on Musk’s Vision The Musk xAI merger is more than just a corporate transaction; it’s a reflection of a unique investment paradigm centered around Elon Musk’s vision and execution. Whether it’s a brilliant strategic move or a high-stakes gamble remains to be seen. However, for those already invested in the Elon Musk empire and the future of AI investment , it represents a deepened commitment to a narrative of unprecedented technological advancement and market disruption. The merger underscores the intertwined nature of Musk’s companies and the unique dynamics of investing in his ambitious endeavors. It’s a bet not just on xAI and X, but on the enduring power of the Musk mystique and his ability to shape the future of technology.

43316632,https://coinpedia.org/?p=443330,1744609729,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Why Did Mantra (OM) Crash? Binance Points to Liquidations and Token Supply Changes,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-did-mantra-om-crash-binance-points-to-liquidations-and-token-supply-changes/,"The post Why Did Mantra (OM) Crash? Binance Points to Liquidations and Token Supply Changes appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The market capitulation for the Mantra (OM), a first-level layer 1 project focused on real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, has attracted significant attention. The previously highly decorated project has now been likened to the Tera Luna (UST) crash due to the similarity of the situation. Moreover, both projects had gained significant trust from both retail and institutional investors to scale to a market cap of over $7.4 billion before dropping to around $782 million on Monday, April 14, during the early European trading session. Binance Take on Mantra Crash With more than $71 million liquidated from the leveraged OM markets in the past 24 hours, mostly from Bybit, Binance stepped in to clear the air. Binance announced that cross-exchange liquidation was a major contributor to the OM price crash today . According to Binance, the significant change in OM tokenomics is also a major contributor to today’s capitulation. Moreover, the MANTRA team increased the circulating supply of OM from 888,888,888 to 1,777,777,777. Additionally, the MANTRA team uncapped the supply of OM and introduced an annual inflation of around 3 percent to enhance staking rewards. “Since October of last year, Binance has implemented various risk control measures including reducing the leverage levels, with regard to the $OM token. Since January this year, Binance has also issued a pop-up warning for $OM on its spot trading page to inform users that the token has undergone significant changes to its tokenomics increasing its supply,” Binance noted . What Next? Following the selloff of more than 43.6 million OM coins, worth over $227 million earlier today, attention has shifted to the team allocation. Although the Mantra core developers have attempted to reassure investors of a stable project, a buyback from the secondary market is the only option to regain user trust. Moreover, the RWA space is fast growing and competition is stiff for investors to be trapped in a poorly managed project amid the anticipated altseason. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43316658,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149078,1744609756,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Shocking U-Turn: Trump Tariffs Slam Tech, Security Probe Intensifies",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/trump-tariffs-tech-security-probe/,"The tech world is reeling from a dramatic policy reversal as former U.S. President Donald Trump clarified his stance on tariffs, sending ripples of uncertainty through the electronics industry. Just when it seemed like tech devices had dodged a tariff bullet, Trump’s recent statements on Truth Social have confirmed that there will be no tariff exceptions for the tech sector. This sudden shift has sparked concerns about the future of the electronics supply chain and national security. Why the Sudden Shift on Trump Tariffs? In a move that has caught many off guard, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to set the record straight. His message was clear: reports of tariff exceptions for tech products were premature. According to Trump, these products aren’t getting a free pass; instead, they are being reclassified under the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs. This isn’t a new tax, but rather a reassignment to a different tariff “bucket,” as Trump put it. This clarification effectively means that tech devices, including smartphones and computers, are indeed subject to tariffs, contrary to earlier indications from Customs and Border Protection guidance released on April 11. Key Takeaways from Trump’s Statement: No Exceptions: Trump explicitly stated, “there was no Tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday” for tech products. Fentanyl Tariffs Apply: Tech products are now subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs. Reclassification, Not Relief: The products are simply “moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket,'” indicating no actual reduction in tariff pressure. This abrupt change in messaging highlights the volatile nature of trade policy and its immediate impact on industries heavily reliant on global supply chains. For the tech sector, which had briefly anticipated relief, this news brings renewed challenges and necessitates a swift reassessment of strategies. Electronics Supply Chain Under Scrutiny: What Does a Security Probe Mean? Beyond the immediate tariff implications, Trump’s statement hinted at a more profound concern: national security. He announced that “we are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” This signals a significant escalation beyond mere trade disputes, delving into the realm of national security implications within the tech sector. Understanding the National Security Angle: Semiconductor Focus: Semiconductors, the bedrock of modern electronics, are specifically highlighted for investigation. Broad Scope: The probe extends to the “WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN,” suggesting a comprehensive review from raw materials to finished products. National Security Justification: Framing tariffs under the umbrella of national security adds a layer of complexity and potential long-term implications. A national security investigation into the electronics supply chain could trigger far-reaching consequences. It could lead to stricter regulations, increased scrutiny of foreign manufacturers, and potentially incentivize domestic production of semiconductors and other critical electronic components. For businesses operating within this space, this means preparing for potential disruptions and adapting to a landscape where national security considerations are paramount. Impact on Semiconductor Tariffs and the Tech Industry The semiconductor industry, already navigating global chip shortages and geopolitical tensions, now faces another layer of uncertainty with the renewed focus on semiconductor tariffs . Trump’s emphasis on semiconductors within the national security investigation underscores the strategic importance of this sector. Tariffs on semiconductors can have a cascading effect throughout the tech industry, impacting everything from smartphone production to automotive manufacturing and beyond. Potential Impacts of Semiconductor Tariffs: Increased Costs: Tariffs directly increase the cost of imported semiconductors, potentially leading to higher prices for consumer electronics. Supply Chain Disruptions: Changes in tariff policies can disrupt established supply chains, forcing companies to seek alternative sources or absorb increased costs. Innovation Slowdown: Higher component costs and supply chain instability can hinder innovation and R&D investments in the tech sector. Competitive Disadvantage: U.S. tech companies may face a competitive disadvantage if tariffs raise their production costs compared to international rivals. For investors and industry stakeholders, monitoring developments related to semiconductor tariffs and the national security probe is crucial. The outcomes of these investigations could reshape the global electronics market and redefine international trade relationships. Navigating the New Tariff Landscape: Actionable Insights In the face of these evolving Trump tariffs and security probes, businesses in the tech and electronics sectors need to adopt a proactive and adaptable approach. Here are some actionable insights: Scenario Planning: Develop multiple scenarios based on different tariff outcomes and security regulations to prepare for various possibilities. Supply Chain Diversification: Explore diversifying supply chains to reduce reliance on any single region and mitigate tariff risks. Domestic Production Review: Assess the feasibility of increasing domestic production or sourcing components from countries less likely to be affected by tariffs. Lobbying and Advocacy: Engage in industry advocacy and lobbying efforts to communicate concerns and seek favorable policy adjustments. Cost Optimization: Identify areas for cost optimization within the supply chain and operations to absorb potential tariff impacts. The renewed tariff focus and national security probe represent significant challenges for the tech industry. However, by understanding the evolving landscape and taking strategic actions, businesses can navigate these uncertainties and position themselves for resilience in a dynamic global market. Conclusion: A Volatile Future for Tech and Trade? Donald Trump’s latest pronouncements have injected a fresh dose of volatility into the tech industry and the broader landscape of international trade. The clarification that tech tariffs are indeed in effect, coupled with the looming national security investigation into the electronics supply chain, signals a potentially turbulent period ahead. Businesses must remain vigilant, adaptable, and strategic to weather these policy shifts and capitalize on any emerging opportunities. The coming months will be critical in determining the long-term impact of these policies on the tech sector and the global economy.

You’re not alone. The crypto market’s temperature gauge, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , has just taken a significant dip, falling a sharp 14 points to land at 31. This movement, reported on April 14th, pushes the index deeper into the ‘Fear’ zone, signaling a palpable shift in crypto market sentiment . Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Sentiment Thermometer Think of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index as a sentiment thermometer for the often-turbulent cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, it offers a snapshot of the prevailing emotions driving investor behavior. A score of 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’, suggesting investors are overly worried and potentially selling off their assets, while a score of 100 reflects ‘Extreme Greed’, pointing to a market brimming with exuberance and potential overbuying. This index isn’t pulled from thin air; it’s a carefully calculated metric that blends six key factors to paint a comprehensive picture of market sentiment. Let’s break down what fuels this index: Volatility (25%): Large swings in the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin, can trigger fear. The index measures current and maximum drawdowns to gauge volatility-driven fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Strong buying volume indicates greed, while weak volume during price rallies might suggest fear and a lack of conviction in the market’s upward trajectory. Social Media (15%): Analyzing social media sentiment, particularly on platforms like Twitter and Reddit, provides insights into the general mood surrounding cryptocurrencies. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, periodic crypto surveys gauge investor sentiment directly, contributing to the overall index score. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear as investors flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin during market uncertainty. Conversely, decreasing Bitcoin dominance might suggest a risk-on sentiment favoring altcoins. Google Trends (10%): Analyzing Google Trends for crypto-related search terms helps understand general public interest and curiosity, reflecting potential shifts in sentiment. Index Value Market Sentiment 0-24 Extreme Fear 25-49 Fear 50-74 Greed 75-100 Extreme Greed Why Does a ‘Fear’ Zone Matter for Your Crypto Investments? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index dips into the ‘Fear’ zone, it’s more than just a number – it’s a potential indicator of market opportunities and risks for your crypto investment strategy . Historically, periods of high fear can present compelling buying opportunities. Why? Because fear often leads to undervaluation. When everyone is panicking and selling, asset prices can drop below their intrinsic value, creating a chance for savvy investors to accumulate crypto at discounted prices. However, it’s crucial to remember that the Fear & Greed Index is not a crystal ball. It’s a sentiment indicator, not a precise predictor of future price movements. A ‘Fear’ zone doesn’t guarantee an immediate price rebound. It simply suggests that market sentiment is leaning towards fear, which can be driven by various factors, including: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Global economic conditions, inflation concerns, and interest rate hikes can all contribute to market fear. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory attention or negative pronouncements from government bodies can dampen market enthusiasm. Black Swan Events: Unexpected events like exchange collapses or major hacks can trigger sharp drops in market confidence and a surge in fear. Market Volatility: As highlighted earlier, increased market volatility itself feeds into fear. Sharp price drops can trigger stop-loss orders and panic selling, further exacerbating the downward pressure. Navigating Market Anxiety: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, the index is flashing ‘Fear’ – what should you do? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Don’t Panic Sell: Resist the urge to make emotionally driven decisions. Fear can be contagious, but panic selling often locks in losses. Review Your Portfolio: Use this as an opportunity to reassess your portfolio. Are your holdings aligned with your long-term investment goals? Is your risk tolerance appropriate for the current market conditions? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider implementing a DCA strategy. Instead of trying to time the market bottom, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. This can help smooth out volatility and potentially lower your average entry price over time. Do Your Research (DYOR): ‘Fear’ periods can be a good time to research fundamentally strong crypto projects. Look for projects with solid technology, strong teams, and real-world use cases that are likely to weather market downturns. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on market news and developments. Understanding the underlying reasons for market fear can help you make more informed decisions. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Tool, Not a Rule The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool for gauging crypto market sentiment and understanding the prevailing emotions driving the market. However, it’s essential to use it as one data point among many in your overall crypto investment strategy . Don’t rely solely on the index to make buy or sell decisions. Combine it with your own research, fundamental analysis, and risk management strategies to navigate the exciting, yet often unpredictable, world of cryptocurrency investments. Remember, market cycles are a natural part of the crypto landscape. Periods of fear are often followed by periods of greed, and vice versa. By understanding market sentiment and adopting a rational, long-term approach, you can position yourself to potentially benefit from both the highs and the lows of the crypto market.

Chainlink, arguably the most notable blockchain oracle network, has added Pi Network to its 22 new data streams. According to the Pi News team, this is a ‘huge leap’ for underlying asset’s integration into the broader crypto ecosystem. BREAKING: Chainlink just added #PiNetwork to its 22 new Data Streams!

The system allows advertisers to use Pi to place ads in the ecosystem and native apps. It began with a pilot launch to 5 community apps and was ‘iterated along with these developers’ within the test phase. “The Ad Network is the first instantiation of a platform-level utility that leverages Pi Network’s collective resources to bring real, organic use cases to the Pi cryptocurrency,” reads the blog post . Most notably, the team informed that the first group of Pi Adds that operated in the pilot has now started to generate and receive ad revenue. Nevertheless, the ‘premise of selection is to be listed in the Mainnet Ecosystem Interface and compliant with developer ecosystem guidelines.’ The project’s disclaimer warned that simply applying does not guarantee the app in question will be included in the Pi Ad Network, as all requirements of the Mainneet ecosystem listing must be met. More on those – here . PI price recovery Following an extended turbulent and painful period for the protocol’s native token, in which its price tumled by over 80% within a month or so to an all-time low of $0.4, the asset has began an impressive recovery that rages on even today. It marked double-digit price increases for a few consecutive days, which could be attributed to positive developments, such as the ones mentioned above, or the overall market resurgence. However, PI is up by 2-3% today as well, even though most alts and BTC have retraced slightly. As a result of the bullish performance in the past week, PI has almost doubled its value since the ATL and now sits above $0.75. Its market cap has pushed the token within the top 30 alts by that metric. PI Token Price.

You’re not alone. The Altcoin Season Index, a key metric for gauging the pulse of the cryptocurrency market, has just flashed a signal, and it’s pointing straight to Bitcoin Season . According to CoinMarketCap (CMC), as of 00:34 UTC on April 14th, the index sits at a low 15, unchanged from the previous day. But what exactly does this mean for you, and is it time to rethink your crypto strategy? Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Crypto Market Weather Vane Think of the Altcoin Season Index as your crypto market weather vane. It’s a fascinating tool that helps us understand whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, or if Bitcoin is taking the center stage. Tracked diligently by CoinMarketCap, this index cuts through the noise to give a clear snapshot of market momentum. Let’s break down what makes this index tick: What it Measures: The index meticulously compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a pure reflection of market sentiment towards true crypto assets. The Score Spectrum: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. A higher score indicates a stronger ‘Altcoin Season,’ while a lower score points towards ‘Bitcoin Season.’ Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially in ‘Altcoin Season,’ a significant majority – at least 75% – of the top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This signifies broad-based growth across the altcoin spectrum. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ emerges when Bitcoin’s dominance shines. This happens when 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins have managed to surpass Bitcoin’s performance. The current reading of 15 firmly places us in this territory. Why Bitcoin Season Matters in the Crypto Market So, the Altcoin Season Index is flashing ‘Bitcoin Season’ – but why should you care? Understanding these market phases is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto landscape and making informed investment decisions. Here’s what Bitcoin Season typically implies for the crypto market : Bitcoin Dominance Reigns: During Bitcoin Season, Bitcoin tends to outperform a vast majority of altcoins. This often signals a market-wide trend where investors gravitate towards the perceived safety and established reputation of Bitcoin, especially during times of uncertainty or market correction. Altcoin Underperformance (Relatively): While altcoins might still experience growth during Bitcoin Season, their gains are generally less pronounced compared to Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are declining, but rather that Bitcoin is capturing a larger share of market momentum and investor attention. Capital Flow Dynamics: Bitcoin Season often sees capital flowing from altcoins back into Bitcoin. Investors might reduce their altcoin holdings to increase their Bitcoin positions, seeking refuge in the original cryptocurrency amidst market fluctuations or anticipation of Bitcoin-led rallies. Market Sentiment Shift: A prolonged Bitcoin Season can sometimes indicate a broader shift in market sentiment, potentially suggesting increased risk aversion or a flight to quality within the crypto space. Navigating Bitcoin Dominance: Opportunities and Strategic Moves While Bitcoin dominance might seem like altcoins are taking a backseat, astute crypto enthusiasts know that every market phase presents unique opportunities. Bitcoin Season is no exception. Let’s explore both the potential advantages and challenges this phase brings: Opportunities in Bitcoin Season: Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to strategically accumulate more Bitcoin. If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value, this period might offer chances to increase your holdings, potentially at more favorable prices relative to altcoins. Focus on Altcoin Gems: With the spotlight on Bitcoin, it’s an excellent time to delve deeper into researching fundamentally strong altcoins. Identify projects with solid technology, strong teams, and real-world use cases that might be undervalued during Bitcoin Season. These could be poised for significant growth when altcoin season eventually returns. Portfolio Rebalancing: Bitcoin Season provides a chance to re-evaluate your portfolio allocation. If you were heavily weighted in altcoins, you might consider rebalancing to increase your Bitcoin exposure, aligning your portfolio with the current market trend. Considerations During Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Portfolio Performance: Be aware that your altcoin portfolio might experience slower growth or even temporary declines during Bitcoin Season compared to Bitcoin’s performance. This is a natural part of market cycles and not necessarily a cause for alarm if you’ve invested in fundamentally sound projects. Market Cycle Awareness: Recognize that Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season are cyclical. Market dynamics are constantly shifting. Bitcoin Season is not permanent, and altcoins will likely regain momentum in future cycles. Patience and a long-term perspective are key. Actionable Insights: Thriving in a Bitcoin Season So, the Altcoin Season Index is at 15, confirming Bitcoin Season is upon us. What practical steps can you take to navigate this phase effectively and potentially even thrive? Here are some actionable insights: Portfolio Review and Adjustment: Take a close look at your current crypto portfolio. How is it performing in the current Bitcoin-dominant market? Is your asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance and investment goals in this phase? Consider adjustments, such as strategically increasing your Bitcoin allocation. In-depth Altcoin Research: Use this time to conduct thorough research on altcoins. Identify projects with strong fundamentals, innovative technologies, and dedicated communities. Look for altcoins that have the potential to outperform when market sentiment shifts back towards altcoins. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto market is incredibly dynamic. Stay updated on market trends, news, and the Altcoin Season Index . Be prepared to adapt your strategies as market conditions evolve. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Market cycles can evoke emotions. Resist the urge to make impulsive decisions based on short-term price fluctuations. Stick to your long-term investment strategy and make informed choices based on research and analysis, not fear or hype. Conclusion: Riding the Bitcoin Wave with Wisdom The Altcoin Season Index registering 15 is a clear indicator: we are currently navigating a Bitcoin Season in the crypto market . While the allure of altcoins might seem temporarily dimmed, this phase is far from a setback. It’s a natural rhythm in the ever-evolving crypto symphony, presenting savvy investors with unique opportunities. By understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin Season, making strategic portfolio adjustments, and staying informed, you can not only weather this phase but also position yourself for potential gains in the exciting cycles to come. Remember, in the world of crypto, knowledge and adaptability are your most powerful assets.

This fast-growing altcoin project has caught the attention of analysts for its rapid community growth, aggressive presale rollout, and unusually high upside potential for a coin still in its early stages. With Stage 6 SOLD OUT and Stage 7 now LIVE , the presale has become one of the most talked-about events in the altcoin space this quarter. ANALYST PREDICTIONS PUT MAGACOIN FINANCE ON THE MAP While XRP remains under its long-term resistance and Solana retraces from its highs, analysts are turning to smaller caps for early-stage opportunity . MAGACOIN FINANCE is now appearing in multiple April watchlists, with experts citing its ability to offer substantial returns with lower capital entry. The presale price of $0.0002908 (mentioned across recent reports) stands in stark contrast to its confirmed listing target of $0.007 — which represents a 25x ROI potential or more than 2,300% upside. In a market searching for the next wave of winners, those numbers are impossible to ignore. MAGACOIN FINANCE VS. LEGACY ALTCOINS Both XRP and Solana have proven themselves in past bull markets — XRP achieving legendary returns in 2017 and again in 2021 , while Solana’s meteoric rise brought it from obscurity to a top 10 coin in just months. But with those gains largely in the rearview, attention is shifting to emerging plays. MAGACOIN FINANCE , now considered a top altcoin to watch , offers a rare chance to enter before the open market does — something XRP and SOL holders can no longer access. More than 12,500 holders have already taken advantage of the early access, further strengthening the project’s community foundation. As one top trader noted in a recent forecast: “You don’t see this kind of momentum at this price point often. MAGACOIN FINANCE looks like it’s setting up for a 30x+ run if it follows through post-listing.” FINAL THOUGHTS: APRIL’S ALTCOIN STAR? 🔓 50% EXTRA BONUS LIVE — USE CODE MAGA50X BEFORE IT’S GONE! Forecasts can change quickly in crypto, but one thing is clear — MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum fast, and seasoned investors are taking notice.

Keeping a close eye on broader economic indicators and events is equally, if not more, crucial . This week is packed with potentially market-moving announcements and speeches from key figures at the Federal Reserve and other central banks. For crypto investors, understanding these economic events is paramount to anticipate market shifts and make informed decisions. Let’s dive into the key events happening this week that could ripple through the crypto sphere. Navigating the Week’s Economic Calendar: Why it Matters for Crypto Why should crypto enthusiasts care about traditional economic events ? The answer is simple: correlation and market sentiment. While cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 and are often perceived as detached from traditional finance, they are increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors. Interest rate decisions, inflation data, and statements from central bankers can significantly impact investor risk appetite, which in turn affects the flow of capital into and out of crypto assets. This week’s calendar is particularly dense with events that could provide clues about the future direction of monetary policy and economic health, both of which are vital for cryptocurrency market trends. Here’s a breakdown of the key economic events scheduled this week, with timings in UTC to keep you synchronized: Monday, April 14: FOMC Voices Begin to Speak The week kicks off with a trio of speeches from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. These speeches are closely watched as they can offer insights into the Fed’s thinking on the current economic situation and potential future policy moves. 16:00 UTC: FOMC Member Barkin Speaks – Thomas Barkin, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, will be sharing his perspectives. Market participants will be keen to analyze his remarks for any hints about the Fed’s stance on inflation and interest rates. 22:00 UTC: FOMC Member Harker Speaks – Patrick Harker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, follows later in the day. His views, particularly on regional economic conditions and labor markets, can provide a broader understanding of the US economic landscape. 23:40 UTC: FOMC Member Bostic Speaks – Raphael Bostic, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, concludes Monday’s FOMC speaker lineup. Bostic’s commentary is often scrutinized for his perspectives on economic inequality and inclusive growth, alongside traditional monetary policy views. Tuesday, April 15: More Fed Insights The FOMC speaker circuit continues into Tuesday, offering further opportunities to gauge the Fed’s current sentiment. 15:35 UTC: FOMC Member Barkin Speaks (Again) – Another appearance from Thomas Barkin might offer further clarity or elaboration on points he raised on Monday. Consistent messaging or shifts in tone will be closely monitored. 23:10 UTC: Fed Governor Lisa Cook Speaks – Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook’s speech is particularly noteworthy. As a Governor, her views carry significant weight in shaping Fed policy. Her insights on inflation, employment, and financial stability will be keenly analyzed by the markets. Wednesday, April 16: Powell’s Address – Will it Set the Tone? Wednesday brings the most anticipated event of the week – a speech from the top central banker himself. 17:15 UTC: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Speaks – Jerome Powell’s speech is the headline event. His words have the power to move markets significantly. Traders and investors across all asset classes, including cryptocurrency, will be hanging on every word for signals about the Fed’s future policy path, particularly regarding interest rates and inflation control. Will he maintain a hawkish stance, hinting at further rate hikes, or will he lean dovish, suggesting a pause or even potential rate cuts in the future? The market’s reaction will be immediate and potentially volatile. Thursday, April 17: Interest Rates and Jobless Data in Focus Thursday is a crucial day with two major interest rate decisions and key employment data releases. 01:00 UTC: South Korea Interest Rate Decision (Apr.) – While geographically distant, South Korea’s interest rate decision can offer insights into global economic trends and central bank thinking. Emerging market rate decisions can sometimes foreshadow broader global monetary policy shifts. 12:30 UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims – U.S. jobless claims are a timely indicator of the health of the labor market. Higher-than-expected claims could signal a slowing economy, potentially leading to a more dovish stance from the Fed, which could be positive for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, lower claims could reinforce the Fed’s hawkish stance. 13:15 UTC: EU ECB Interest Rate Decision (Apr.) – The European Central Bank’s (ECB) interest rate decision is a major event for global markets. The Eurozone’s economic health and the ECB’s monetary policy significantly impact global financial conditions. Any surprises in the ECB’s decision or forward guidance can trigger volatility across markets, including crypto. 15:45 UTC: Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr Speaks – Michael Barr, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision, will be speaking later in the day. His remarks are particularly relevant for the financial sector, and any comments on financial stability and regulation could indirectly impact cryptocurrency markets, especially concerning regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. Friday, April 18: Good Friday – A Quieter Day? Friday marks Good Friday in the U.S., a public holiday. This typically means reduced trading volumes in traditional markets, but cryptocurrency markets remain open 24/7. However, the holiday in traditional finance centers could still lead to lower liquidity and potentially increased volatility in crypto markets due to thinner order books. Holiday U.S. Good Friday – U.S. markets are closed. Be mindful of potentially lower liquidity in crypto markets. 15:00 UTC: FOMC Member Daly Speaks – Even on a holiday, FOMC members continue to engage. Mary Daly, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, is scheduled to speak. Her perspectives on the labor market and inflation, particularly from a West Coast perspective, can add further nuance to the overall Fed outlook. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how can crypto investors use this information to their advantage? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on financial news outlets for real-time updates and analysis of these economic events . Manage Risk: Be prepared for potential market volatility around these announcements, especially Powell’s speech and the interest rate decisions. Consider adjusting your trading positions and risk management strategies accordingly. Listen for Nuances: Pay attention to the tone and language used by FOMC members. Are they sounding more hawkish or dovish? Look for keywords and phrases that might indicate future policy shifts. Consider Global Impact: Remember that these events have global repercussions. The US Fed and ECB’s actions influence global financial conditions, which in turn affect cryptocurrency markets worldwide. Conclusion: Navigating Economic Winds in the Crypto Seas This week presents a wealth of economic events that could significantly influence the cryptocurrency market. From FOMC member speeches to crucial interest rate decisions and jobless claims data, staying informed and understanding the potential impact of these events is vital for navigating the crypto seas. Jerome Powell’s speech on Wednesday stands out as a potentially market-moving event. By closely monitoring these developments and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can better position yourself to capitalize on opportunities and mitigate risks in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

In Taiwan, shares in Foxconn, Apple’s largest iPhone assembler, rose about 4% during Monday morning trading. Contract laptop maker Quanta showed an even stronger jump, up 7%. Inventec, which produces artificial intelligence servers and other electronics, also rose by 4%. Their gains helped lift the broad index by around 1%. China-based Apple suppliers Goertek and Lens Tech experienced increases of 3% and 1.1%, respectively. Further north in South Korea, Samsung Electronics, which supplies Apple and holds the second spot in the U.S. smartphone market, advanced by 2%. Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei added 1.81%, although it has swung between sharp ups and downs in recent days due to changing headlines about the tariff situation. Japan’s Nikkei 225. Source: Google Finance The weekend development signaled a temporary easing of the pressure created by steep tariffs that threatened to drive up the prices of many electronic products. Reports also emerged that Apple chartered cargo flights last week to move 600 tons of iPhones—estimated to be as many as 1.5 million units—from India to the United States. This effort appeared to be a move to reduce any potential shortages or sudden price spikes in the event that the tariff situation deteriorated. Trump clarified that electronics and semiconductors will be excluded from tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump took to social media on Sunday to clarify that the electronics products excluded from the reciprocal tariffs “are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’” He added they would be reviewed, along with semiconductors, in a national security trade investigation on that sector. Although some investors found hope in the president’s comments, others remained cautious, particularly after Trump said aboard Air Force One that a tariff rate on imported semiconductors would be announced over the next week. He did note there could be flexibility for some companies, but the market reaction was mixed, reflecting uncertainty over how the final measures would play out. Amid that uncertainty, certain chipmakers went against the broader positive trend. TSMC, the largest contract chipmaker worldwide, dipped into negative territory despite an initial jump at the start of the day. TSMC stock price. Source: Google Finance Memory chip supplier SK Hynix in South Korea declined by 0.2%. Alex Huang, vice president of Mega International Investment Services, said the early Monday momentum might be premature. He pointed out that the specifics of Trump’s exemption plan were not yet fully disclosed, making it difficult for markets to price in the possible impact. He suggested it would be unlikely for semiconductors to receive a broad exemption from tariffs since any comprehensive relief would remove a critical bargaining chip in discussions with Washington. TSMC is scheduled to announce its first-quarter earnings on Thursday. It could offer more clues about how the tariff environment is affecting chip orders and production plans. In Europe, the euro edged up to $1.1384, just below the three-year high of $1.1474. Traders were keeping a close watch on the European Central Bank’s meeting slated for Thursday. Market participants consider it a certainty that the ECB will cut rates by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%. Also on tap is the Bank of Canada’s rate decision this week, where there is around a one-in-three chance of a cut from 2.75%.

The price of Mantra ( OM ) plunged over 90% on Apr. 13, falling from around $6.30 to below $0.50 within hours. In an Apr. 14 post on X, Mullin said the sharp drop in OM’s price was caused by forced liquidations triggered by centralized exchanges. He explained that these actions were taken suddenly and during low-liquidity hours on Sunday evening UTC, which may have amplified the market impact. Mullin clarified that the sell-off was not due to any token sales by the Mantra team or its investors, noting that OM tokens remain locked according to the project’s vesting schedule. He also reaffirmed the project’s long-term commitment and called for continued support from the community. Sherpas, OMies, and broader crypto community, First off, the team and I greatly appreciate the support that we have received over the past several hours, which we believe is a testament to the strong support MANTRA has among its investors and community.

One crypto analyst, Max Brown, claimed that the sell-off started when 3.9 million OM tokens were deposited on OKX by a wallet that was thought to be connected to the Mantra team. Given that the team allegedly controls almost 90% of the total supply, this move alarmed the market and triggered a sell-off. MANTRA CHAIN $OM CRASHED 90% IN AN HOUR AND $5.5 BILLION GOT WIPED OUT.

The token is trading at $0.8623 as of press time, down 90% from its February all-time high of $8.99. OM’s trading volume has jumped more than 2,500% in the last 24 hours, reaching $1.9 billion, as per crypto.news price tracker . Launched as a regulatory-compliant real world asset-focused layer-1, Mantra has made headlines in recent months for its partnerships and regulatory progress. In January, it signed a $1 billion deal with real estate giant DAMAC to tokenize assets. Mantra was also greenlighted to operate lawfully in the UAE after being granted a virtual asset service provider license by Dubai’s VARA in February. Even so, the crash has renewed earlier criticism of the project. Wu Blockchain, a popular X news channel, reposted a 2021 warning about Mantra’s founding team, linking them to a gambling website and previous false investment claims. Some traders have expressed concerns about transparency and exchange processes, comparing the crash to past collapses like that of Terra.

In an Apr. 13 post , CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson noted that the gap between Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) futures price and its spot price on Binance is starting to shrink. This gap, known as the perpetual-spot gap, shows the difference between what traders are paying in futures contracts versus the actual price of Bitcoin. Given that the gap is currently negative, futures market participants may be exercising caution or taking profits following Bitcoin’s previous surge to almost $90,000. However, the narrowing gap may indicate that selling pressure is easing. In the past, Bitcoin’s price often experienced a significant increase when this gap turned positive. This occurred in 2020 and early in 2024. Despite Bitcoin falling over 22% from its all-time high of $108,786 in January, on-chain accumulation signals remain strong. According to an Apr. 11 post on X by Glassnode, around 40,000 BTC has been purchased near the $79,000 level, while roughly 51,000 BTC was accumulated at around $82,080. If prices decline once more, these levels might serve as support. Looking at Cost Basis Distribution, #Bitcoin has built notable support at $79K, with ~40K $BTC accumulated there. It has also worked through the $82.08K cluster (~51K $BTC ). If this level holds, the next to test is $83.5K, with 48.5K $BTC positioned: https://t.co/YqeQ2uWJlV pic.twitter.com/9aE3UdsT2O — glassnode (@glassnode) April 11, 2025 You might also like: If the Fed prints more money, what’s at stake for Bitcoin?

On April 13, Mantra ( OM ) price dropped from $6.30 to below $0.50 , rapidly shedding over 90% of its $6 billion market cap. “We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders,” Mantra co-founder John Mullin wrote in an April 13 statement on X. “The timing and depth of the crash suggest that a very sudden closure of account positions was initiated without sufficient warning or notice,” he added. Source: John Mullin “That this happened during low-liquidity hours on a Sunday evening UTC, early morning Asia time, points to a degree of negligence at best, or possibly intentional market positioning taken by centralized exchanges.” Mullin told an X user they believe one exchange “in particular” was to blame but said they were still “figuring out the details.” He told others that the centralized exchange in question wasn’t Binance. Mantra has an upcoming community connect on X, where Mullin says the team would share more information. Source: John Mullin Some traders allege the token collapse was a rug pull , while others are speculating the Mantra team had used their tokens as collateral to take out a massive loan from a centralized exchange and the team fell prey to a loan risk parameter change, then a margin call. Mullin denied these theories in follow-up X posts, saying , “The team did not have a loan outstanding” and haven't orchestrated a rug pull. “Tokens remain locked and subject to the published vesting periods. OM’s tokenomics remain intact, as shared last week in our latest token report. Our token wallet addresses are online and visible,” Mullin said. Source: John Mullin The price of OM staged a minor recovery in the aftermath of the price collapse, briefly returning above $1, but it is back down and currently trading around $0.7894, according to CoinGecko. The token hit an all-time high of just under $9 on Feb. 23 and is now down over 91% from that figure. Source: Star Xu Millions of Mantra tokens moved in the week prior to collapse Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain said in an April 14 post to X that some OM whales moved 14.27 million tokens to the crypto exchange OKX three days before the crash. In March, the same whales picked up 84.15 million OM for $564.7 million. “Now, after a brutal 90% drop, their remaining 69.08 million OM is worth just $62.2 million, putting their total estimated loss at a staggering $406.3 million,” Spot On Chain said. “However, they may have hedged the position elsewhere, and it’s possible they contributed to the sharp drop.” Source: Spot On Chain At the same time, blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain said that since April 7, at least 17 wallets deposited 43.6 million OM into crypto exchanges, representing 4.5% of the circulating supply.

Investors and traders are keenly watching the token unlock schedule, and this week is packed with significant events! A massive $330 million worth of TRUMP tokens is leading the charge, alongside unlocks for other notable projects like STRK, ARB, and ZKJ. Understanding these crypto unlock events is crucial for navigating the market effectively. Let’s dive into what’s happening and what it could mean for your portfolio. What are Token Unlocks and Why Do They Matter? Before we delve into this week’s specific unlocks, let’s quickly recap what token unlocks are and why they’re such a hot topic in the crypto space. When new cryptocurrency projects launch, they often allocate a portion of their total token supply to the team, advisors, investors, and for ecosystem development. To prevent market dumps and ensure gradual decentralization, these tokens are usually locked up for a certain period, following a vesting schedule. A token unlock event is when these previously locked tokens become available and are released into circulation. Why does this matter? Increased token supply can potentially lead to increased selling pressure, which can impact the token’s price. However, unlocks can also be viewed positively as they represent a distribution of tokens to stakeholders who are often incentivized to contribute to the project’s long-term success. The market reaction to a crypto unlock can vary depending on factors like the project’s fundamentals, market sentiment, and the size of the unlock relative to the circulating supply. Key Token Unlocks This Week: A Detailed Schedule According to data from DropsTab, this week’s token unlock schedule is quite busy. Here’s a breakdown of the major unlocks you need to be aware of: Token Amount Unlocked Value (USD) Circulating Supply (%) Unlock Time (UTC) WLD 5.02 million $3.72 million 0.40% April 15, 00:00 STRK 128.05 million $16.17 million 4.41% April 15, 12:00 ARB 93.65 million $28.18 million 2.03% April 16, 00:00 VANA 1.24 million $6.57 million 4.14% April 16, 00:00 PRCL 161.70 million $9.59 million 58.88% April 16, 00:00 DBR 1.23 billion $27.83 million 68.38% April 17, 00:00 APE 15.38 million $6.52 million 2.04% April 17, 06:00 UXLINK 33.33 million $16.24 million 9.86% April 18, 00:00 IMX 27.31 million $11.28 million 1.52% April 18, 05:00 TRUMP 40.00 million $330.80 million 20.00% April 18, 06:00 ZKJ 15.50 million $35.17 million 25.66% April 19, 00:00 XDAO 6.44 million $332.76 million 25.29% April 20, 00:00 Data Source: DropsTab TRUMP Token Unlock: A Mammoth Event to Watch Undoubtedly, the most significant token unlock this week is for TRUMP. A staggering 40 million TRUMP tokens, valued at approximately $330.80 million, are set to be released on April 18th. This represents a substantial 20% of the current circulating supply! Such a large unlock can create considerable market volatility. Traders and investors will be closely monitoring the price action around this event. Will the market absorb this influx of tokens, or will we see a price dip? STRK and ARB Unlock: Layer-2 Tokens in Focus Alongside TRUMP, we have notable unlocks for layer-2 scaling solutions, STRK and ARB. STRK will see 128.05 million tokens unlocked (4.41% of circulating supply) on April 15th, while ARB will unlock 93.65 million tokens (2.03% of circulating supply) on April 16th. These unlocks, although smaller in dollar value compared to TRUMP, are still significant. STRK unlock and ARB unlock events are important for those invested in the layer-2 ecosystem. Keep an eye on how these unlocks impact the price and network activity of these tokens. Other Notable Token Unlocks: ZKJ, XDAO, and More While TRUMP, STRK, and ARB grab headlines, several other tokens have substantial unlocks scheduled this week. ZKJ, for instance, will unlock 15.50 million tokens (25.66% of circulating supply) on April 19th. XDAO’s unlock of 6.44 million tokens on April 20th is also noteworthy due to its high dollar value. Projects like PRCL and DBR are unlocking a very large percentage of their circulating supply, 58.88% and 68.38% respectively. These larger percentage unlocks, even with lower dollar values, can also lead to price fluctuations, especially for tokens with lower liquidity. Navigating Token Unlock Events: What Should You Do? So, how should you approach these crypto unlock events as an investor or trader? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of the token unlock schedules using resources like DropsTab and other crypto data providers. Do Your Research: Understand the tokenomics of the projects undergoing unlocks. Consider the percentage of circulating supply being unlocked and the project’s overall health. Manage Risk: Be prepared for potential price volatility around unlock dates. Consider adjusting your trading strategies or portfolio allocations accordingly. Look for Opportunities: Unlock events can sometimes create buying opportunities if the market overreacts negatively. Conversely, if the unlock is perceived positively and the project is strong, it could signal further growth potential. Conclusion: A Week of Critical Token Unlock Events This week is shaping up to be a crucial period for the crypto market, primarily due to the sheer volume and value of token unlocks scheduled. The $330 million TRUMP token unlock is the headline event, but unlocks for STRK, ARB, ZKJ, and others should not be overlooked. By staying informed, doing your research, and managing risk, you can navigate these events effectively and potentially capitalize on the opportunities they present. Keep a close watch on market movements and be ready to adapt your strategies as needed.

43317512,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=149093,1744611542,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Explosive Growth: Metaplanet Amasses 319 More Bitcoin in Strategic Move,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-adds-bitcoin-holdings/,"In a bold move signaling continued institutional interest in Bitcoin, Metaplanet, a publicly traded company based in Japan, has announced another significant purchase of Bitcoin. The company revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that it has acquired an additional 319 BTC. This latest acquisition dramatically increases Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin treasury to an impressive 4,525 BTC. For those closely watching corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies, this news is a powerful indicator of Bitcoin’s enduring appeal as a strategic asset. Why is Metaplanet Investing Heavily in Bitcoin? Metaplanet’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin investment raises an important question: What’s driving this Japanese company’s aggressive accumulation strategy? To understand this, we need to delve deeper into Metaplanet’s rationale and the broader context of Bitcoin adoption in Japan and globally. Here are some potential reasons behind Metaplanet’s strategic Bitcoin accumulation: Diversification and Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a valuable asset for portfolio diversification, offering a hedge against traditional market volatility and inflation. In an era of economic uncertainty, companies are looking for alternative stores of value, and Bitcoin fits the bill. Long-Term Value Proposition: Metaplanet likely views Bitcoin as a long-term investment with significant growth potential. Despite market fluctuations, the fundamental principles of Bitcoin – decentralization, scarcity, and increasing adoption – remain strong. Strategic Corporate Treasury Management: Holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet can be a strategic move for companies seeking to optimize their treasury management. In a low-yield environment, Bitcoin offers the potential for higher returns compared to traditional cash reserves. First-Mover Advantage in Japan: As a publicly listed Japanese company, Metaplanet’s foray into Bitcoin could position it as a leader in the emerging digital asset space within Japan. This first-mover advantage can attract investors and enhance the company’s brand image. Metaplanet’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: A Closer Look Let’s break down the numbers and understand the scale of Metaplanet’s BTC holdings : Metric Value Latest Bitcoin Purchase 319 BTC Total Bitcoin Holdings 4,525 BTC Company Status Publicly Listed (Japan) This table highlights the substantial nature of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin investment. Adding 319 BTC is not a trivial amount; it represents a significant commitment and belief in Bitcoin’s future. The fact that Metaplanet is a publicly listed company in Japan further underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional financial ecosystems. The Broader Picture: Institutional Bitcoin Investment is on the Rise Metaplanet’s actions are not isolated. They are part of a larger trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin investment globally. Major corporations, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds are starting to allocate portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This trend is fueled by several factors: Maturing Market: The Bitcoin market has matured significantly over the past decade. Improved infrastructure, regulatory clarity in some jurisdictions, and the emergence of institutional-grade custody solutions have made it easier and safer for institutions to invest in Bitcoin. Growing Acceptance: Bitcoin is moving from the fringes to the mainstream. Increased media coverage, educational resources, and endorsements from prominent figures in finance and technology are contributing to its growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): As Bitcoin’s price appreciates and institutional adoption accelerates, there’s a growing fear of missing out among traditional investors. Companies don’t want to be left behind as Bitcoin potentially becomes a more integral part of the global financial system. What Does Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Buy Mean for the Market? Metaplanet’s latest Bitcoin news and acquisition have several implications for the cryptocurrency market: Positive Sentiment Boost: Significant purchases like this tend to inject positive sentiment into the market. It reinforces the narrative of institutional adoption and can encourage further investment. Demand Pressure: Large Bitcoin purchases reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially putting upward pressure on the price, especially if this trend of institutional accumulation continues. Validation for Bitcoin Strategy: Metaplanet’s continued investment serves as validation for other companies considering a Bitcoin treasury strategy. It demonstrates a real-world example of a publicly listed company embracing Bitcoin. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Considerations While the benefits of Metaplanet Bitcoin investment and institutional adoption are clear, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Companies investing in Bitcoin must be prepared for potential short-term price swings and have a long-term investment horizon. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies need to navigate regulatory uncertainties and ensure compliance in their respective jurisdictions. Security and Custody: Securing and safely custodying large amounts of Bitcoin is paramount. Companies must employ robust security measures and consider using institutional-grade custody solutions. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting standards for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still developing. Companies need to address the complexities of accounting and financial reporting for their Bitcoin holdings. Actionable Insights: What Can We Learn from Metaplanet? Metaplanet’s strategic move offers valuable insights for both individual investors and other companies considering Bitcoin: Long-Term Perspective: Metaplanet’s actions underscore the importance of a long-term perspective when it comes to Bitcoin investment. Focus on the fundamental value proposition and potential for future growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. Diversification Benefits: Consider Bitcoin as a diversification tool within a broader investment portfolio. Its unique characteristics can help mitigate risk and enhance returns over the long run. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest developments in the cryptocurrency space, including regulatory changes, institutional adoption trends, and technological advancements. Bitcoin news and analysis are crucial for making informed decisions. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Bet Signals a Powerful Trend Metaplanet’s latest acquisition of 319 BTC is more than just a news headline; it’s a significant event that underscores the growing institutional embrace of Bitcoin. As Japan Bitcoin adoption gains momentum and companies like Metaplanet lead the charge, the future of Bitcoin as a mainstream asset class looks increasingly bright. This strategic accumulation highlights the explosive growth potential and the enduring appeal of Bitcoin in the evolving global financial landscape. Metaplanet’s bold move serves as a compelling example of how forward-thinking companies are positioning themselves for the digital future, with Bitcoin playing a central role.

Dù bạn chỉ mới bắt đầu với phân tích kỹ thuật hay là một trader lão luyện đang mài lợi thế cạnh tranh, hiểu đường trung bình động là một kỹ năng nền tảng có thể nâng cấp các quyết định giao dịch của bạn. Hãy bắt đầu với những điều cơ bản: SMA vs EMA. Đường Trung Bình Động là Gì? Chart giá có thể rối như tơ vò. Mỗi giây, giá nhảy nhót lên xuống, tạo ra một cơn lốc dữ liệu có thể nuốt chửng ngay cả những trader dày dạn kinh nghiệm. Đường trung bình động giúp bạn lùi lại khỏi sự hỗn loạn và bắt được xu hướng thực. Chúng làm mượt dữ liệu giá trong một khoảng thời gian cụ thể, giúp bạn dễ dàng xác định xem thị trường đang có xu hướng tăng, giảm hay chỉ đơn giản là đi ngang. Về bản chất, đường trung bình động được dùng để: Xác định hướng đi của thị trường Highlight các vùng vào/ra lệnh tiềm năng Xác nhận tín hiệu từ các chỉ báo khác Tránh giao dịch theo cảm xúc dựa trên biến động ngắn hạn Có hai loại đường trung bình động chính mà bạn sẽ thấy trên bất kỳ nền tảng giao dịch nào: Đường Trung Bình Động Giản Đơn (SMA) và Đường Trung Bình Động Luỹ Thừa (EMA). Hãy cùng mổ xẻ chúng. Đường Trung Bình Động Giản Đơn (SMA): Ống Kính Bình Tĩnh, Dài Hạn Trên Bitfinex, nó hiện lên là: Đường Trung Bình Động (MA) SMA lấy giá đóng cửa trong một số giai đoạn nhất định (ví dụ: 10, 50 hoặc 200), cộng chúng lại và chia cho số đó. Mọi mức giá đều có trọng lượng như nhau. SMA không phản ứng với mọi rung lắc, chỉ cho bạn hướng đi trung bình theo thời gian. Ví dụ: SMA 50 ngày cộng dồn giá đóng cửa của 50 ngày qua và chia cho 50. Các Trường Hợp Phổ Biến Được Sử Dụng: Swing trader thường dùng SMA 50 ngày và 200 ngày để đánh giá động lượng dài hạn. Trend follower theo dõi giá cắt lên hoặc xuống SMA để báo hiệu khả năng đảo chiều. Ưu điểm: Mượt mà và ổn định Tuyệt vời để lọc bỏ nhiễu ngắn hạn Xác nhận xu hướng dài hạn mạnh mẽ Nhược điểm: Phản ứng chậm với các thay đổi giá đột ngột Có thể bỏ lỡ các tín hiệu sớm trong các thị trường biến động nhanh Đường Trung Bình Động Luỹ Thừa (EMA): Thần Theo Dõi Xu Hướng Nhanh Nhạy Đường Trung Bình Động Luỹ Thừa cũng tính giá trung bình, nhưng nó ưu ái giá gần đây hơn , khiến nó nhạy hơn với các biến động thị trường hiện tại. Ví dụ: EMA 20 ngày vẫn bao gồm giá của 20 ngày qua, nhưng dữ liệu hôm nay ảnh hưởng đến nó nhiều hơn dữ liệu từ hai tuần trước. EMA được dân day trader và scalper ưa chuộng, những người cần phản ứng nhanh với sự thay đổi động lượng. Các Trường Hợp Sử Dụng Phổ Biến: Trader ngắn hạn dựa vào EMA 9 ngày, 12 ngày hoặc 20 ngày để bắt các xu hướng di chuyển nhanh. EMA thường được dùng trong các chiến lược giao cắt , trong đó EMA ngắn hạn cắt EMA dài hạn có thể báo hiệu tín hiệu vào hoặc ra lệnh. Ưu điểm: Phản ứng nhanh hơn với hành động giá gần đây Hữu ích để phát hiện sớm các đảo chiều xu hướng Được ưa chuộng trong môi trường giao dịch nhịp độ nhanh Nhược điểm: Có thể tạo ra nhiều tín hiệu sai hơn trong các thị trường chập chờn Có thể quá phản ứng trong các thị trường đi ngang SMA vs EMA – Nên Dùng Cái Nào? Không có câu trả lời một kích thước vừa vặn tất cả. Lựa chọn tốt nhất phụ thuộc vào phong cách giao dịch, khung thời gian và mục tiêu của bạn. Hầu hết các trader có kinh nghiệm đều dùng cả hai .

According to SoSoValue data , the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $713.3 million pulled out, over 300% more than the $172.7 million outflows from the week before. Every single day from April 7 to 11 saw money being pulled, continuing a streak that began on April 3. The biggest drop came on Tuesday, with $326.27 million in outflows, while Friday ended the week with just over $1 million leaving. BlackRock’s IBIT took the hardest hit with $342.6 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC with $160.9 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $74.6 million per Faside data . Other ETFs, like BITB, BTCO, ARKB, EZBC, BTCW, and HODL, also saw outflows ranging from about $11 million to $38 million. The only ETF to buck the bearish trend was Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin Trust, which recorded $2.4 million in net inflows, while Valkyrie’s BRRR saw no flows during the week. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs didn’t fare much better than their Bitcoin counterparts, with outflows jumping 65% to $82.47 million last week. It’s now the seventh straight week of Ethereum ETF withdrawals, adding up to more than $877 million in total. You might also like: Bitcoin nears breakout confirmation, enters new technical uptrend: analysts The main driver behind all this seems to be the uncertainty around Trump’s new tariff plans. He originally announced a 10% flat tariff on all imports starting in April, with even higher rates for major trading partners. Markets cooled off a bit on April 9, when he paused the tariff hikes for 75 allied countries. That relief didn’t last long . The U.S. then raised some tariffs on Chinese goods to as high as 145%, accusing China of unfair trade. In response, China hit back with tariffs of up to 125% on U.S. goods and stopped exporting rare-earth minerals. This ramped up fears of a full-blown trade war and made investors nervous about riskier assets like Bitcoin. At the time of writing, the overall crypto market was down around 2.1% in the past day. Despite this, Bitcoin has bounced from last week’s low of $74,773 to nearly $84,500 by Monday, April 14.

Does this mean Ethereum price has bottomed? Here are three reason why ETH could drop lower. 3 Reasons Why Ethereum Price Could Continue its Descent Ethereum price has tagged the 2018 ATH of $1,385, which has many believing that this could be the bottom. However, there are three critical reasons why a further crash could be possible for ETH. Reason 1: Weekly Price Chart Shows Key Resistance Level The 1-week TradingView chart shows that Ethereum price is revisiting $1,630, which is the highest volume traded level since February 2021. Since the recent crash pushed ETH below it, it is upon bulls to flip this hurdle into a support floor. As long as this resistance level stands, there is a good chance ETH’s value will continue to depreciate. Moreover, the intermediate demand zone at $1,280 is the next Ethereum price support floor that could absorb selling pressure. After this area from, $1,280 to $1,160, was fromed in December 2022, the price of ETH shot up more than 40% in the next three to four weeks without any pullbacks. Hence, a revisit of this zone is also likely. The absolute key support or demand zone extends from $890 to $715, which is a weekly buy-side imbalance that led to near 50% weekly candlestick. ETH/USDT 1-week chart Reason 2: RSI Yet to be Oversold On the weekly chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has not yet hit oversold territory. All the major rallies for Ethereum price have begun after RSI tagged an oversold level. Hence, the chances of a further drop are likely for ETH, potentially into the $1,280 to $1,160 and $890 to $715 zones. ETH 1-week RSI Reason 3: Uncertain Macroeconomic Conditions From a macroeconomic perspective, the Trump and Xi trade war between the US & China has caused additional volatility in the stock and crypto markets. This has left Ethereum price prediction bearish due to fears of recession. Additionally, this week has two major events: Fed Chair Powell’s speech and the March inflation announcement. The outcome of both critical news events could induce additional volatility that could kickstart a messy collapse. So, overall, the outlook for Ethereum price remains neutral-to-bearish. However investors need to be more cautious ahead of the upcoming events amid Trump-Xi trade war.

During the same period, imports declined 4.3% to $211.3 billion, leaving a trade surplus of $102.6 billion. Businesses rushed to ship goods before higher U.S. tariffs took effect. The jump in exports reflects efforts by Chinese companies to counter a series of tariff hikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump initially imposed a 10% increase in tariffs on imports from China after taking office. He later raised that figure to 20% and has now pushed it to 145% on most Chinese exports bound for the U.S. That situation has driven Chinese exporters to accelerate shipments to American buyers, hoping to evade the latest rises in import duties. China’s trade balance has been in the spotlight for some time. In 2024, the country’s trade surplus soared to a record $992.2 billion, with exports up 5.4%. Customs Administration data shows China’s trade surplus with the United States stood at $27.6 billion in March, boosted by a 4.5% rise in exports to that market. Over the first quarter, the surplus reached $76.6 billion, despite only a 2.3% increase in exports for the first two months of the year. “Export growth accelerated in March, as manufacturers rushed to ship goods to the U.S. ahead of ‘Liberation Day,’” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, in a note to clients. “But shipments are set to drop back over the coming months and quarters,” he added. “We think it could be years before Chinese exports regain current levels.” Observers also point to domestic factors undermining import growth, highlighted by the 4.3% drop in overall imports. While Chinese imports of crude oil rose in March, imports of soybeans, coal, iron ore, and unwrought copper declined. Imports from the United States may be feeling the effects of the tariff dispute, with total soybean imports diving 36.8% year-on-year in March. China wants to fight “to the end” Beijing has vowed to keep fighting U.S. tariffs “to the end.” It wants to protect the economy from “external shocks.” On Friday, President Xi Jinping reportedly told Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Beijing that China and the European Union should work together to oppose “unilateral acts of bullying,” according to the Xinhua news agency. The CSI300 Index modestly increased by 0.3% on Monday. Analysts say mixed signals from President Trump about possible exemptions on selected consumer electronics contributed to the slight uptick. Economists have revised their outlook for China’s full-year growth. Goldman Sachs reduced its 2025 GDP forecast to 4% from 4.5%. On the other hand, Citi reduced its projection from 4.7% to 4.2%. These revised numbers fall short of the government’s official target of “around 5%.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Since the market has been low over the past few months, investors unsurprisingly took this as an opportunity to get out at a somewhat higher price. This has led to more negative networks over the last few days, adding even more red to the month of April that has been dominated by outflows. XRP’s April Outflows Cross $300 Million According to data from Coinglass, XRP has been struggling with negative net flows for the better part of April, recording more red days than green. Even the green days have been quite muted and have fallen short of the volumes recorded on the red days. With only 13 days gone out the month so far, there has already been more than $300 million in outflows recorded for the month already. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out: Chart Pattern Targets $96,200 To $102,100 As Next Big Test Zone So far, only four out of the 13 days have ended with positive net flows, coming out to $56.08 million in inflows for the month. In contrast, the other nine days have been dominated by outflows, coming out to $311 million by Sunday. This consistent outflow suggests that sellers are still dominating the market, which explains why the XRP price has continued to remain low throughout this time. Additionally, if this negative net flow trend continues, then the XRP price could suffer further crashes from here. However, in comparison to the last three months, the month of April seems to be recording a slow down when it comes to outflows. For example, months of January and March recorded $150 million outflow days, whereas the highest so far in April has been $90 million, which occurred on April 6. One More Dip Coming? While there has been a return of positive sentiment among XRP investors, bearish expectations still abound, although mainly for the short-term. Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, a known XRP bull, has pointed out that the altcoin is likely to see another dip in price before a recovery. Nevertheless, the expectations for the long-term are still extremely bullish. Related Reading: Expert Analyst Warns Bitcoin/VIX Is Not Bullish: Bear Market Signals The crypto analyst highlights the possibility for the XRP price to dip to $1.4, but explains that he continues to hold his position.

Amidst this uncertainty, the American businessman advocates investing in Bitcoin, gold, and silver as a shield against the economic disaster. Robert Kiyosaki Advocates Buying Bitcoin, Here’s Why In his latest X post, Robert Kiyosaki warned against the impending economic recession, highlighting the US Dollar’s vulnerable position. Reiterating his previous predictions of the “biggest stock and bond market crash in history,” he cited, “That giant crash has arrived.” To safeguard against the looming economic downturn, Robert Kiyosaki recommends allocating assets to Bitcoin, gold, and silver as a protective measure. His words read, “Those who take action and acquire real gold, silver, and Bitcoin….MAY come out of this premeditated disaster… the new rich and the new leaders of the world.” Is the US Dollar Crash Imminent? According to Robert Kiyosaki, the biggest economic crash has begun. The recent fall in the stock and bond markets following US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement validates his statement. What Happened to the Stock Market? During the first week of April, the stock market saw its highest fall since 2020, casting shadows over the trajectory of Bitcoin. Highlighting Bitcoin’s strong correlation with the stock market, experts predicted Bitcoin’s short-term correction. Though Bitcoin stood resilient to the broader negative trends on the day, BTC plummeted to a four-month low of $74k the next day. However, the downturn was brief, and Bitcoin’s price rebounded sharply the next day. This sudden resurgence of Bitcoin also bolsters Robert Kiyosaki’s bullish stance on Bitcoin. Adding more insights into his analysis, Robert Kiyosaki posited that the US Dollar’s value is under threat. He wrote on his X thread, “The corrupt and crooked US dollar is being wiped out.” Moreover, traditional assets such as stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds are losing wealth due to the global banking system’s manipulation. He specifically points to central banks, including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements, as key players in this dynamic. Bitcoin Recovers, What’s Next? Currently, Bitcoin is on a positive track, recovering from the recent lows. As of press time, BTC is trading at $84,402, marking a notable 12% surge over the past week and a 0.54% uptick over the past month. The 24-hour trading volume has also seen a surge of 6%, currently at $31.17 billion. Driven by this positive sentiment, experts believe that BTC could retain its all-time high of $108k in the near future. However, as per CoinGape’s Bitcoin price prediction , the crypto’s highest point in 2025 is 84,590.98 The post Dollar Crash: Here’s Why Robert Kiyosaki Believes Bitcoin Is the Best Investment appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin VS US Dollar|Robert Kiyosaki,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|BTG,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-04-14 07:03:50

The trader shares a chart suggesting that Bitcoin will create a durable bottom between $66,000 and $80,000 for the rest of the year before launching a new bull run in 2026. “Trump path clearly is contraction for now. But in that world of less globalization and trust, Bitcoin is a good asset to have, becoming a ball held under water. Similar to how 2013 saw a short bear [market].” Source: Jack/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that Bitcoin will rally to as high as $297,000 by November of 2026. Jack says that one catalyst that could send Bitcoin flying is the potential capital rotation from gold to BTC. According to the trader, gold investors will eventually come to know that Bitcoin is far better than the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. “What if Gold is trading like it is because everyone is scrambling to redeem paper for physical, of which there is a scarcity, vs. all the paper that has been issued, essentially catching up to its true value that has been diluted with paper Bitcoin doesn’t have this issue and will rally once people realize it is the better alternative for trade due to this very specific property.” “Paper” gold refers to financial instruments that allow investors to gain exposure to the precious metal without having to deal with the expenses or logistics of physically possessing the commodity. Jack appears to be highlighting Bitcoin’s portability as BTC holders can easily store, access and transfer their coins as long as they have the keys to their wallet. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $84,244.

Here Are the Details…",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/mantra-om-ceo-made-a-statement-about-the-fall-targeted-a-stock-exchange-here-are-the-details/,"The sharp declines in altcoins listed on Binance such as ACT, TST, MASK and LEVER in the past weeks created a bomb effect on the market. After these declines, the altcoin named Mantra (OM), which is also listed on Binance, fell by 87% today. While this decline has a shocking effect on investors, everyone is asking why. At this point, MANTRA CEO John Patrick Mullin said in a statement that no team member or partner has sold OM tokens. Speaking at the 2025 BTCON RWA Summit in Seoul and making statements from his X account, MANTRA CEO touched on the recent drop in the price of the OM token. Mullin did not say that the drop was an exploit or an attack, but rather that they determined that the drop was triggered by centralized exchanges recklessly instituting forced shutdowns of OM account holders. Claiming that a large investor on a centralized exchange experienced a forced liquidation of their OM token, Mullin told an X user that they believe one exchange in particular is to blame but are still trying to sort out the details. He told another user that the centralized exchange in question was not Binance. The CEO emphasized that neither he, nor his team, nor the Swiss team, nor advisors, nor key partners sold any OM tokens, saying: “The timing and depth of the collapse suggest that account positions were closed very abruptly without adequate warning or notification. The fact that this occurred during low liquidity hours, Sunday evening UTC Asian time, suggests at best negligence or deliberate market positioning by centralized exchanges.” “Mantra's Decline is a Huge Scandal!” While the suspicion on the stock exchanges continues, a comment also came from OKX, one of the leading stock exchanges. Accordingly, OKX founder and CEO Star Xu said that the MANTRA collapse was a 'big scandal' and promised to release related reports soon. He emphasized that all on-chain data regarding token unlocks and deposits are publicly available, and collateral and liquidation data from major exchanges can be reviewed. He added that OKX will make all relevant reports available. Binance stated in its statement that initial findings showed that the sudden drop in the price of the OM token was due to liquidations between exchanges. OM continues to trade at $0.77 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Mantra (OM) CEO Made a Statement About the Fall, Targeted a Stock Exchange!

Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Dalio said the economy is at a critical juncture. “I think that right now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession,” he said. “And I’m worried about something worse than a recession if this isn’t handled well.” The billionaire hedge fund manager responded to a question about whether Trump’s return to aggressive tariffs could push the US economy into a downturn. Dalio pointed to what he called a breakdown in the global monetary system and drew comparisons to the 1930s, a period marked by economic depression, rising nationalism and global instability. “I’m worried about something much worse than a recession. We have something that is much more profound.” – Ray Dalio pic.twitter.com/fV20L5lFs9 — Spencer Hakimian (@SpencerHakimian) April 14, 2025 “We are having profound changes in our domestic order and we’re having profound changes in the world order. Such times are very much like the 1930s,” he said. Tariff Escalation and Debt Exposure Leave US Economy Vulnerable, Dalio Cautions He pointed to the convergence of high debt levels, geopolitical tensions and aggressive tariff use as destabilizing factors. In particular, Dalio has expressed concern over mounting US debt and the heavy exposure of foreign creditors, including China, to that debt. Trump recently raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, citing concerns over unfair trade practices and lack of market reciprocity. A universal 10% baseline tariff on most foreign goods, excluding those from USMCA partners, took effect on April 5. Just days later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on elevated tariffs for most countries, except China, rolling them back to the 10 per cent rate to allow time for trade negotiations. Dalio warned that the way these issues are handled could lead to outcomes far worse than a typical economic contraction. “How that’s handled could produce something that is much worse than a recession,” he said. Investor Veteran Sees Echoes of 2008, But Warns Today’s Crisis May Run Deeper He also cautioned that internal political conflict, weakening trust in money and rising international tensions could worsen the global fallout. “That is not the normal democracy as we know it,” he said, referring to political risks at home. In recent commentary, Dalio said a systemic economic breakdown is already underway. He pointed to current market volatility as a clear warning sign. Dalio, who correctly anticipated the 2008 financial crisis, has consistently advised investors to diversify away from debt-based assets. He has previously suggested gold and Bitcoin as potential hedges in a time of growing uncertainty and shifting global power dynamics.

43319060,https://cryptonews.com/?p=350775,1744614807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/43319060.jpeg,Mechanism Capital’s Andrew Kang Takes $200M Long Position on Bitcoin,https://cryptonews.com/news/mechanism-capitals-andrew-kang-takes-200m-long-position-on-bitcoin/,"Andrew Kang, founder of crypto venture firm Mechanism Capital, has reportedly doubled his bullish bet on Bitcoin, taking a $200 million long position, according to on-chain data analyzed by crypto analytics platform Arkham. In an April 12 post on X , Arkham revealed that a wallet tied to Kang made a second $100 million leveraged long bet on Bitcoin, bringing his total position to $200 million. The recent trade carries an estimated potential gain or loss of around $6.8 million, reflecting Kang’s confidence in a near-term Bitcoin rally. Kang Doubles Down on Bitcoin After Trump’s ‘Great Time to Buy’ Post The move comes just days after Kang initiated his first $100 million long on April 9, following a post by U.S. President Donald Trump on Truth Social that declared, “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.” Shortly after the post, the Trump administration announced a 90-day pause on its recently imposed global tariffs, reversing the negative market reaction from just hours earlier when the tariffs went into effect. In a separate post on April 12, Kang described the current environment as an ideal setup for Bitcoin, citing the Trump administration’s apparent shift in trade policy and what he referred to as a “Trump put”—a belief that Trump will prioritize market growth. According to Kang, these factors create “the perfect combination for BTC to reverse a multi-month downtrend.” Trump Put potentially in pic.twitter.com/hYkgbYTECr — Andrew Kang (@Rewkang) April 9, 2025 However, the situation has stirred controversy. On April 11, Senate Democrats urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate potential insider trading and market manipulation linked to Trump’s social media post, which they argue may have foreshadowed the tariff rollback. Bitcoin’s price has fluctuated amid the ongoing tariff uncertainty, swinging more than 2% in the past 24 hours. After dipping to $83,197, Bitcoin rebounded and was trading around $85,000 at press time, according to CoinGecko. In a follow-up post on April 13, Trump clarified there was no tariff “exception” but indicated that Chinese electronics would be reassigned to a new 20% tariff category—further fueling speculation and market volatility. Bitwise Sticks to $200K Bitcoin Price Target Despite mounting global trade tensions and economic uncertainty, institutional crypto investment firm Bitwise remains confident in its bold year-end Bitcoin price forecast. Last week, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan reiterated his December prediction that Bitcoin could hit $200,000 before the close of 2025. Hougan argued that recent developments in U.S. trade policy, particularly under former President Donald Trump’s renewed tariff push, could act as tailwinds for Bitcoin. According to Hougan, the administration’s apparent willingness to weaken the U.S. dollar—despite risking its role as the world’s reserve currency—could ultimately benefit decentralized assets like Bitcoin. Over the long run, Hougan envisions a move away from a single global reserve currency toward a diversified system. In this future, he sees Bitcoin and gold playing a more prominent role in international finance. “If the dollar’s stability comes into question, governments and corporations will have to look elsewhere,” he added.

Without active participation, even cutting-edge technology gathers dust. Ever heard of a blockchain that no one uses? It happens more often than you think. While the cryptocurrency space is full of innovation, but not every blockchain finds its tribe. Some are ghost towns with zero transactions, no developers and just a handful of holders stuck with worthless tokens . So, what makes a blockchain go quiet? And can they ever come back to life? Not all blockchains are built to last. Some blockchains, like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana, have survived harsh market conditions, proving their resilience. Terra, however, plummeted from top-tier status to near oblivion in 2022 after its algorithmic stablecoin imploded. Even well-intentioned projects can fail. Without ongoing development, user incentives or a strong community, blockchains can become unusable. Once the validators stop running nodes, the network effectively turns into a broken time capsule. Blockchain adoption challenges in 2025 Blockchain adoption in 2025 still faces hurdles like unclear regulation, fragmented developer tooling, infrastructure gaps and the struggle to attract real users over bots despite some chains like Ethereum and Solana paving the way forward. Regulatory uncertainty is one of the biggest roadblocks. Governments are still figuring out how to regulate crypto, and inconsistent or overly restrictive rules can strangle innovation before it takes root. Beyond policy, a thriving developer ecosystem is non-negotiable. Jumping between languages such as Solidity, Rust and Move-based systems demands versatility, and not every blockchain can lure the talent it needs to grow. Then there’s the user problem — chains are overrun with bots chasing airdrops instead of real people engaging with the tech. Without authentic activity, a network’s bustling metrics are just smoke and mirrors. Infrastructure is another major hurdle. Strong blockchains need robust tooling, high-quality remote procedure call (RPC) services and a decentralized validator set that ensures uptime and security. In the context of blockchains, RPC services refer to a mechanism that allows applications (like wallets, DApps or developer tools) to communicate with a blockchain network remotely. On top of that, a thriving blockchain must rally a strong community of users, builders and commentators who genuinely believe in its long-term success. Handling fear, uncertainty and doubt, or FUD, credibly is another test, especially when negative narratives arise; how a blockchain ecosystem responds can make or break trust. Keeping user loyalty while maintaining a sense of novelty is a delicate balance. Ethereum has mastered this across multiple market cycles, evolving while retaining its core developer and user base. Since the FTX collapse in 2022, Solana has demonstrated resilience , overcoming reputational damage to rebuild its ecosystem, attract developers, and drive real usage through improvements in speed, efficiency and community support. Did you know? Blockchain nodes expose RPC endpoints (often via HTTP or WebSocket protocols) that handle these requests. For example, when you use a decentralized app (DApp) on Ethereum, it might connect to an RPC service like Infura or Alchemy to fetch data or broadcast transactions. What blockchains are still active in 2025? As of April 2025, Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, BNB Chain, Polkadot, Near, Sui and Tron stand out as active blockchains, each excelling in distinct niches — DApps, speed, value storage, affordability, interoperability or scalability. Active chains show daily user engagement, developer momentum and sustained transaction volume, while inactive ones become digital graveyards. Not all blockchains are dead, but not all are thriving, either. Below are the insights into the standout survivors shaping the crypto landscape as of April 2025: Bitcoin: Bitcoin focuses on value storage, with a $1.636-trillion market capitalization on April 6, 2025, and regular transactions. The 2024 Bitcoin halving and approvals of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) keep it relevant. About 960 developers work on scalability, like Lightning Network, despite limited smart contract features. Ethereum: It powers decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and DApps, processing millions of daily transactions via layer 2s like Arbitrum as of April 2025. It had over 5,900 monthly active developers in June 2023. High total value locked (TVL) persists, though gas fees are a challenge without layer 2s. Solana: According to DefiLlama, Solana’s daily active addresses reached 3.68 million as of April 8, 2025. The surge is likely supported by its fast transactions and low fees. After the 2022 FTX dip, it recovered, supporting gaming and DeFi. It had over 1,400 developers in June 2023, with past outages noted as a concern. Also, the TRUMP token’s crash in March 2025, dropping over 85% from its January peak, strained Solana’s momentum. BNB Chain: Binance’s BNB Chain has 1.93 million daily users as of April 1, 2025, with affordable transactions. It shows notable TVL and volume, mainly in DeFi and gaming, though its centralized nature is debated. Polkadot: Polkadot connects blockchains, with over 1,900 developers in June 2023 working on interoperability. It supports multiple parachains , with moderate but growing activity as of April 2025, though it’s less accessible to casual users. Near Protocol: Near logs 3.18 million daily addresses as of April 1, 2025, using sharding for scalability. It supports DeFi and gaming, with developer tools aiding growth, but it’s still proving itself against larger chains. Sui: Sui , with 2.46 million daily users as of April 1, 2025, uses an object-oriented model for speed. Active in DeFi and gaming, it’s newer and lacks the ecosystem depth of older networks. Tron: Tron has 2.45 million daily addresses as of April 1, 2025, focusing on stablecoin transfers like Tether USDt ( USDT ). It handles high throughput but has limited DApp variety compared to others. Inactive chains like EOS and Terra, impacted by governance or collapse, contrast with the above blockchains. So, a blockchain’s success hinges on its daily activity. How many people are actually transacting on a blockchain every day? Are developers still building new DApps? Is there any meaningful transaction volume? If the answer to these questions is “not much,” the chain might be on its way to becoming a digital graveyard. Did you know? According to Santiment, the top five Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies by development activity in March 2025 were Chainlink ( LINK ), Starknet ( STRK ), Ether ( ETH ), EigenLayer ( EIGEN ) and Fuel Network (FUEL). This ranking reflects the volume of development work, a key indicator of potential growth and innovation in the crypto market. Blockchains that faded: What went wrong? Blockchains like EOS and Terra teach us that hype isn’t enough. A blockchain needs real utility, trust and continuous innovation to survive. Cases like EOS and Terra show that initial excitement isn’t enough to sustain a blockchain. Long-term survival seems tied to practical utility, trust and ongoing development rather than just hype. Some blockchains started with potential but struggled to maintain traction. EOS, once called an “Ethereum killer,” raised $4 billion in its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). By 2025, it saw minimal use, affected by governance challenges and low adoption. Terra and its LUNA token faced a steeper drop in 2022 when its algorithmic stablecoin unraveled, erasing billions in value. These examples suggest hype alone doesn’t ensure staying power — blockchains appear to need real use cases, solid security and active evolution. Community often marks the divide between a blockchain that endures and one that fades. Ethereum has weathered multiple downturns, supported by a large developer base and active users. Developers building DApps draw in users, creating a cycle of growth. Validators and stakers enhance trust, boosting liquidity. Without this participation, even technically advanced chains struggle to remain relevant. How to spot a living blockchain Metrics like transaction volume, TVL, developer activity and validator count are essential signs of whether a blockchain is alive and trusted. How can you tell if a blockchain is healthy? Transaction velocity and volume are major signs. A strong, active blockchain sees consistent transactions, while low activity is a red flag. Total value locked (TVL) is another critical metric because if DeFi users trust a chain, they’ll lock funds into its protocols. A declining TVL suggests that users are leaving. Developer activity is also crucial. Are new projects launching? Is there ongoing development? A stagnant developer ecosystem often signals trouble. Validator and node count matter, too. A high number of validators shows decentralization and network security. And finally, liquidity and the onchain economy play a big role. If liquidity is drying up, so is the chain’s future. Developers and founding teams move across blockchains if they can’t scale from where they are originally based. It comes with a cost, often to rebuild skills and user base. But multiple projects moving out of a chain can indicate a bearish trend for the chain, and vice versa could also be true. For example, on April 3, 2025, the gaming project Infecteddotfun announced that it was shifting from Base to Solana due to scaling struggles. The project’s viral speculative simulation game drew 130,000 signups in 48 hours, overwhelming Base with transaction demand, spiking gas prices and halting gameplay. The team pointed to Ethereum Virtual Machine chain limitations, favoring Solana’s user-centric culture and robust user base. What brings a blockchain back to life? Inactive chains can return if they find compelling use cases, have a strong community, offer strong incentives, or evolve into new forms like layer-2 solutions. So, can a dead blockchain come back to life? Sometimes. The key is finding a reason for people to return. A new use case can revive interest, especially if it solves a real problem. Protocol upgrades that improve scalability, fees or interoperability can also rekindle activity. Strong incentives, such as grants, airdrops or liquidity rewards, can attract developers and users back to a network. In some cases, struggling projects pivot into layer-2 solutions or merge with more active ecosystems to stay relevant. But most of all, a thriving community that has a high conviction on the future of a chain can lead to its resurgence from the worst. Solana’s rise from the FTX debacle due to a committed community is a case study in that respect. The blockchain world moves fast. Some networks thrive, and some fade into obscurity. The ones that last are those with strong community support, real-world utility and continuous innovation. If a blockchain is silent today, it doesn’t mean it’s gone forever, but reviving it takes more than just wishful thinking.",blockchain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-14 07:15:00

The possible gains come as Ripple rebounded over the weekend after reports that the Federal Reserve may intervene if financial markets experience more turmoil due to tariffs. XRP bounced from a crucial support level of $2 to a weekly high of $2.23. XRP Price in Focus Amid Potential SWIFT Partnership Speculation is rife across the crypto industry that the SWIFT global payments network could tap Ripple’s blockchain technology. Per market analyst John Squire, SWIFT will announce this deal within the next seven days. He opined, “In recent weeks, several influential voices have pointed to a possible announcement from SWIFT. It could be the official confirmation that XRP—through Ripple—will become part of SWIFT’s global payment infrastructure, used by over 11,000 financial institutions worldwide.” If Ripple partners with SWIFT for cross-border payments, the blockchain will be accessed by the top global financial institutions globally. Such a deal will bode well for the XRP price, making a $3 target likely. Squire added that this would not be the first time that Ripple was working with SWIFT. He noted that in 2023, Ripple participated in interoperability pilot programs conducted by SWIFT to integrate blockchain in cross-border payments. Hence, XRP price will rally to new highs past $3 in the near term if the deal with SWIFT materializes. Ripple Technical Analysis as XRP Teases Bullish Breakout XRP price is teasing a bullish breakout on its daily price chart after bouncing from the support level of $1.79. Ripple is currently attempting to flip resistance at the upper trendline of a descending parallel channel. If it is successful and creates a higher low, it will reverse the current trend from a downtrend to an uptrend. The next barrier that the XRP price faces is at the PoC line, where a lot of trading activity happened in the past. If it flips this resistance, the market structure will favor bulls, which will then trigger an upswing to $2.60. However, the RSI shows that the buying pressure is still weak. Unless buyers start accumulating Ripple aggressively, the lack of buying momentum may stall the rally and prevent an upswing to all-time high prices above $3. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart Considering the speculation around a partnership deal between Ripple and SWIFT, there might be a surge in buying activity in the near term. Therefore, it is likely that the XRP price will continue with its uptrend and reach $3 before the end of the month. Some analysts are also optimistic that Ripple will reach $45 if it follows past price actions.

But this time, it’s not just the traditional yellow metal that’s winning attention, its digital versions are catching fire too. Recently, Gold-backed cryptocurrencies like Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT) have been on a strong rally this year, climbing over 23% year-to-date. These digital tokens are pegged to physical gold and move in sync with its price. Khi thị trường vàng truyền thống tăng trưởng, các nhà đầu tư tiền điện tử cũng đang tìm đến các đồng tiền điện tử có tài sản bảo chứng vàng như Paxos Gold (PAXG) và Tether Gold (XAUT), với mức tăng trên 24% trong năm nay, tương đương với hiệu suất của vàng… pic.twitter.com/Pwgbv2dfid — CoinPhoton Việt Nam (@coinphoton_vn) April 14, 2025 In early 2025, both tokens touched new all-time highs above $3,300 before settling slightly lower. In comparison, Bitcoin has dropped over 11% this year, and the overall crypto market is down more than 30%, according to the CoinDesk 20 index. That’s why many investors are now turning to tokenized gold to protect their money. While Trump’s tariff war crashed the entire crypto market, Gold ETFs stayed strong and proved it’s still a valuable investment option. Why Tokenized Gold is Getting Attention The two top gainers PAXG and XAUT has become popular because they offer the best of both worlds, real-world asset backing and the flexibility of crypto. These tokens are backed by actual gold stored in vaults, but they can be traded easily on the blockchain . This makes them more liquid than traditional gold while still offering the same safe-haven qualities. With growing uncertainty in global markets, especially due to rising tensions between the U.S. and China, more investors are looking for stability, and gold is a natural choice. Big Money is Also Moving into Gold ETFs The rising interest in gold isn’t limited to the crypto space. Traditional investors are pouring money into gold ETFs as well. In the first quarter of 2025, inflows into gold ETFs reached 226.5 tonnes, the highest level in three years, according to the World Gold Council. North America led the trend, accounting for nearly 60% of that demand.

As traditional and crypto markets both face pressure, it’s clear that tokenized gold is becoming a go-to asset for investors who want security with digital convenience. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This warning comes as Donald Trump’s new tariff rules are creating more problems around the world. Despite this turmoil, Kiyosaki says it’s not too late to act—but only if people act fast and turn to gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Well-Planned Crash Happening According to Kiyosaki, the crash he predicted in his past books is now becoming a reality. He points out that the value of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs is quickly dropping, causing many people to lose their savings. PLEASE LISTEN to Gold, Silver, & Bitcoin. What are they telling you? Gold is at an all time high, demand for silver is exploding, and Bitcoin is roaring. Are you listening? REPEATING MYSELF, I warned of the biggest stock and bond market crash in history was coming in my… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 13, 2025 Kiyosaki suggests that this isn’t just a normal market dip. Instead, he believes it’s a planned disaster caused by powerful central banks. He specifically blames the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world for the crisis. Meanwhile, these banks are “corrupt and crooked,” and they are destroying the value of the U.S. dollar. By printing too much money and keeping interest rates low, they’ve caused inflation, which weakens the value of the U.S. dollar. People who thought their savings were safe are now losing money because the banks’ actions are slowly destroying the financial system. Can Bitcoin Save Your Savings? With traditional investments dropping, Kiyosaki suggests looking at gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Gold has hit $3,200 , silver demand is rising, and Bitcoin is climbing again, reaching $86,000. While Bitcoin has always been viewed as a hedge against inflation. With the fiat currency weakening, Kiyosaki suggests it’s time to focus on this digital asset . As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $84,614 refleitng a slight rise seen in the last 24 hours. However, Bitcoin is now facing resistance at the $88k level, and a breakout will push it towards $100k. Experts are going bullish because the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a key indicator of market momentum, remains above 60, suggesting that the price could continue to rise. Why Bitcoin Kiyosaki trust Bitcoin now? Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as digital gold, making it a good hedge against inflation and crashing markets. Is now a good time to invest in Bitcoin? Kiyosaki thinks so, as Bitcoin is near $85,000 and gaining strength. If it breaks $88K, it might head toward $100K, say experts.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|BTG,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 07:18:58

Within a few hours, the popular altcoin crashed by nearly 90%, leaving holders with losses. Although the issues have been identified, the downfall remains, leaving a group of investors in a $400M loss and many others. Mantra Price Crash Pushed Crypto Traders Into $400M Loss Amid the crypto market’s high volatility due to the US- China war , the Mantra price crash left investors with massive losses. This includes a group of 19 fresh crypto wallets or traders who moved 14.27M OM equivalent to $91M just three days before the crash. Spotonchain X’s post revealed that these investors have scooped a massive OM tokens holding, i.e., 84.15M ($564.7M) from Binance just three days ago. Now, with the OM price crash, their remaining 69.08M OM are worth only $62.2M, leaving them in a staggering $406.3M loss. Interestingly, crypto experts also anticipate that these investors could have contributed to the crash. Forced Liquidation Led to Mantra Price Crash The Mantra price crash has resulted in wiping out nearly $6 billion from the crypto market. Crypto experts like StarPlatinum have compared it to the LUNA crash, which affected the entire market. In a detailed analysis, StarPlatinum revealed that the crypto whales, failed Mantra airdrop, and investors’ panic resulted in the crash. The Mantra co-founder John Patrick Mullin and the team clarified that forced liquidators from OM crypto investors on centralized exchanges resulted in the crash. More importantly, he clarified that the team is not behind the crash. To be clear, this dislocation was not caused by the team, the MANTRA Chain Association, its core advisors, or MANTRA’s investors selling tokens. Tokens remain locked and subject to the published vesting periods. OM’s tokenomics remain intact, as shared last week in our latest token report. Our token wallet addresses are online and visible. A Lookonchain post also brought clarity to the situation, revealing that 17 crypto traders deposited nearly 4.5% of the OM’s circulating supply, equivalent to 227M participating in the crash. At the time of writing, the OM token price is still down, trading at $0.8 with a market capitalization of $761.45M. Investors are now eyeing the experts’ Mantra predictions to witness recovery.

In an April 14 X post , Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said the company now holds 4,525 BTC, worth roughly $386.3 million, at an average cost of around $85,366 per coin The announcement followed Metaplanet’s latest purchase of 319 BTC for approximately ¥3.78 billion (or $26.3 million), acquired at an average price of ¥11.85 million (~$82,549) per Bitcoin. To track the effectiveness of its treasury strategy, Metaplanet relies on BTC Yield, a metric that measures the growth of its Bitcoin holdings relative to its fully diluted share count. As previously reported by crypto.news, the metric surged 309.8% in Q4 2024 and 95.6% in the first quarter of 2025. Earlier this month, the Tokyo-listed firm added 160 BTC to its treasury for around $13.4 million. Metaplanet is aiming to accumulate over 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and ultimately reach 21,000 BTC by 2026. To support this aggressive strategy, Metaplanet has been raising funds through a mix of equity and debt, including a series of zero-coupon bond issuances and stock acquisition rights with EVO FUND. Since January, it has issued 21 million shares across five tranches under its “210 Million Plan.” You might also like: New Bitwise ETF targets Bitcoin-heavy firms like MicroStrategy, MARA Most recently, it exercised 8.6 million and 4.2 million shares under its 14th and 17th stock rights series, raising over ¥35 billion to date, which accounts for roughly 42% of the planned 21 million share issuance. The company has completed early redemptions on several bond tranches, including its 9th Series, which was fully repaid ahead of schedule. Originally maturing in September 2025, the ¥2 billion issuance was redeemed using proceeds from EVO FUND’s exercise of the 13th to 17th stock rights series. Last month, it announced plans to raise ¥2 billion ($13.3 million) through its 10th Series of Ordinary Bonds issued on March 31. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, Metaplanet is currently the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in Asia. Globally, U.S.-based Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of the flagship crypto with 528,185 BTC worth approximately $44.5 billion in their stash. However, the company recently alerted share holders it may have to sell part of its Bitcoin stash to meet financial obligations if it fails to raise fresh capital.

Mainly because Mantra was considered one of the fundamentally strong tokens and ranked number 1 in Real World Assets (RWA) tokens. In times when the markets are recovering from the latest bearish action, such events raise huge suspicion. The OM price was trading above $6, while the trading volume remained constrained below $100 million. In no time, the volume rose above $2 billion, which slashed the price by over 93% to as low as $0.43 in no time. Why Mantra (OM) Price Drop Drastically? Was it a Pre-Planned Rug-Pull? It all started when a single transaction was processed of a wallet linked to the Mantra team that sent over 3.9M OM to Okex. This raised huge concerns as 90% of the token supply is controlled by the insiders, which could hurt the token’s value anytime, which cropped up. The OM price dropped from $6 to $0.48, whipping over $6 billion from the markets. A month ago, the platform launched an airdrop and before this, they had blacklisted more than 50% of wallets, calling them ‘bots’ without any transparency. This followed a series of rumors that shook the confidence over the token. Insiders were allegedly running OTC token deals at 50% discounts, which triggered panic selling, stop-loss cascades and leverage liquidations, while most of them had no idea of what was going on behind the scenes. The OM price crash has shaken the entire crypto market with the excessive greed of the Mantra team. Since Q3, 2023, the OM token has been surging with a 200x upswing and the reason behind this jump was not fundamental but market manipulation. The changed tokenomics, controlled 90% supply, delayed community airdrop, OTC deals and Tier-1 market makers who inflated prices over the past 2 years. What’s Next for the Mantra (OM) Price? Will it Recover or be the Next LUNA? Initially, the dump was triggered by the sale of 4 million tokens, and as the liquidity was low on weekends, the price dropped below $3, pushing the OTC buyers into a loss. In no time, the liquidation cascade happened, and the MMs & OTC buyers rushed to sell first, causing the 90% dump. During all this, the second-largest wallet was delegating and sending OM tokens to exchanges. It points towards a perfectly planned dump to rug the community that was executed. The Terra ecosystem created a new token to revive the platform but failed. The same thing happened with the FTT token as well.

While ETH trades at $1,556, PEPE holds around $0.000007, and MUTM remains under-the-radar, analysts say it’s these very price points that are setting the stage for major upside. The fourth phase of Mutuum Finance presale continues while this high-growth altcoin sells for $0.025 and has collected $6.65 million. The next stage of the presale will boost MUTM’s price to $0.03 while attracting more than 8200 investors. The initial investors during this phase will receive a 140% profit when the launch price reaches $0.06. Here’s what investors need to know before the crowd catches on. A DeFi Giant on the Rise Mutuum Finance pushes forward decentralized lending through dual lending while promoting mass adoption because of its transformative structure. More than 8200 investors joined the presale funding to support the project which received $6.65 million in total. Mutuum Finance’s price currently reaches $0.025 in Phase 4 even though investors anticipate a 20% price increase in Phase 5 which will generate considerable profit potential. The analysts forecast MUTM to surge beyond $5 in upcoming months when it launches at $0.06 because its distinctive lending approach meets rising market requirements thus making it an underappreciated yet promising DeFi resource. MUTM has introduced tangible features, including a new dashboard leaderboard that tracks its top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their rank. As investors grow more utility-focused, MUTM’s rise signals what could be the next win in crypto, substance over spectacle. Mutuum Finance transforms DeFi lending through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending systems. Through the P2C model users can achieve passive income by lending their USDT through liquidity pools that operate automatically through smart contracts. The P2P model provides transactions which operate without intermediaries allowing users to personally manage their assets through direct deals. Mutuum Finance unites P2C and P2P lending methods to secure and streamline its decentralized operation thus creating profitable opportunities for investors looking to maximize yield in DeFi. Friendly Tokenomics for Lasting Expansion Tokenomics in the project follows a strategy designed for both limited token circulation management and continuous appreciation of value. The presale limitation combined with anti-inflationary procedures enables Mutuum Finance to establish scarcity which creates possible upward token value potential. Staking rewards users for token involvement by delivering valuable incentives that strengthen the ecosystem sustainability of its native token. Driving Community Growth with Investor Rewards To attract more community members Mutuum Finance implements profitable incentive programs at an aggressive pace. The program will use $100,000 to give ten investors $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens and the referral system gives rewards to users who bring in new investors to the platform. The platform gives early supporters exclusive benefits including staking pools and governance rights and VIP-exclusive updates to enhance their connection with the platform. A Reliable and Secure Financial Network Mutuum Finance creates a launch plan for its new collateralized USD-backed stablecoin developed for Ethereum blockchain usage. Insolvency risks that threaten algorithmic stablecoins will not affect this over-collateralized asset because it will maintain long-term reliability. A complete audit system of smart contracts together with transparent financial mechanisms establishes trust with investors as it fixes numerous security problems observed with past decentralized finance projects. Whale activity around Ethereum (ETH), Pepe (PEPE), and especially Mutuum Finance (MUTM) signals growing confidence in their upside potential. With ETH at $1,556, PEPE at $0.000007, and MUTM priced at $0.025 in Phase 4, raising $6.65 million from 8,200+ investors, the opportunity is clear. Early buyers stand to gain 140% when MUTM hits its $0.06 launch price, with forecasts aiming as high as $5. Secure your position now in the Mutuum Finance presale before the next price jump.

33767162,[object Object],1744615804,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Hoskinson Says Cardano Is Ready Without Him, Embarks On High-Risk Trip",https://bitcoinist.com/hoskinson-cardanoready-without-him-high-risk-trip/,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson delivered a new message to the community on April 12, declaring that the Cardano ecosystem has reached full decentralization while hinting at a potential step back from active involvement. In a livestream titled “See you on the other side”, Hoskinson reflected on a decade-long journey with Cardano, praised recent governance milestones, and announced plans for a perilous personal expedition. Cardano Fully Decentralized, Hoskinson Steps Back Briefly Speaking from his home office in Colorado following a trip to Paris , Hoskinson opened with a candid statement: “This time it’s to go somewhere to do something that is quite dangerous—so much so there is a possibility of death.” He characterized the livestream as a precaution, a chance to reflect on what has been built in the event something were to go wrong. While he reassured viewers that he expected to return safely, the tone of the address underscored a transition, both personal and professional. The central focus of Hoskinson’s message was the formal maturation of Cardano’s governance infrastructure. After more than a decade of development, he asserted that Cardano has now entered a fully decentralized phase, citing recent constitutional and institutional advancements made possible under the Voltaire governance framework. “We have passed a constitution both through a constitutional convention and an on-chain ratification,” he said. “We have passed an info action approving a roadmap. There are almost a thousand DREs [Delegated Representative Entities] registered and an interesting distribution of power amongst them.” These milestones mark a significant shift for Cardano, effectively transferring decision-making authority from the founding entities to the broader community. A transitional constitutional committee—partially elected—is currently in place, with fully democratic elections scheduled for later in the year. Budget reconciliation among DRAPs (Delegated Representative Action Plans) is ongoing and expected to conclude within the next 60 to 90 days. Hoskinson emphasized the significance of this structural shift: “I wanted to build something where I could spend my entire life working on it, but I didn’t want to be a dictator or a king.” He likened Cardano’s trajectory to Bitcoin’s early evolution, referencing Satoshi Nakamoto ’s departure from Bitcoin development as a precedent for decentralized growth. The founder also praised the ecosystem’s increasing technical plurality, highlighting the recent node diversity workshop in Paris. There, he met with teams from Pragma, TXPipe, Blink Labs, and Harmonic—independent development groups contributing alternative node implementations to strengthen the protocol’s resilience. “It was really impressive to spend some time with them and see them,” he said. “The end result of those conversations is basically an assurance that we will have multiple independent implementations by independent teams in the Cardano ecosystem.” In a notable moment of cross-chain collaboration, Hoskinson mentioned that even members of the Ethereum community were present at the workshop to discuss interoperability and client diversity. This broader dialogue reflects Cardano’s ambition to move beyond its insular beginnings and into a more heterogeneous blockchain environment. While affirming Input Output Global (IOG)’s continued presence in the ecosystem, Hoskinson made clear that the organization’s prominence would now be subject to the will of the community: “You ultimately get to decide how prominent that role is whether it be involved in core infrastructure or simply building on top of the protocol.” A New Era Hoskinson also discussed the growing enthusiasm around Midnight, a new privacy-oriented blockchain protocol under the Cardano umbrella, describing it as a potential gateway for “millions of users” into the ecosystem. He portrayed hybrid applications—bridging Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano to Midnight—as a promising direction for the space. Amid these technical updates, Hoskinson’s remarks turned reflective and philosophical. At 37, he noted that he now finds himself at a liminal point—not young, not old—and is increasingly seeking fulfillment outside the crypto sphere. “I’ve been chained down for the last decade,” he admitted, referencing his ventures into ranching, synthetic biology, and even fringe endeavors like the “alien salvage expedition in Papua New Guinea.” This upcoming venture, however, stands out in its severity. Although he declined to specify its nature, he admitted that it’s “one of the most challenging things I’ve ever done in my entire life,” and that it has been in preparation for over a year. “If I survive—which is very likely—I will record it and put it up on Twitter when I return,” he said. Hoskinson framed the journey as both a personal test and a necessary mental reset before entering the “long brutal march” of the next Cardano era, citing Midnight , Hydra scalability , Minotaur’s AVS (Active Validator Set) ambitions, and the roadmap’s transition to full realization. “Cardano’s roadmap is the best it’s ever been,” he asserted, referencing the system’s emerging functionality as a Bitcoin DeFi platform and its commitment to scalable governance. Yet behind the achievements lies a sense of fatigue with the broader crypto industry. Hoskinson expressed disenchantment with the market’s narrow focus on price movement at the expense of innovation and impact. “Every accomplishment doesn’t matter ]…] everything is chained to whether the price goes up or the price goes down. You have no idea how thoroughly boring that has become.” He concluded with a reaffirmation of Cardano’s resilience and a tacit acknowledgment that his role may soon evolve. “Cardano, like Bitcoin before it, is durable. It’s here to stay. All elements of centralization have been removed… that was my life’s work, and I’m proud of that.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.6452.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Cardano Charles Hoskinson News|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-14 07:30:04

According to Sun, the firm, along with a network of partners including Dubai-based Aria DMCC, deceived the stablecoin’s issuer into wiring the funds to an unrelated entity. He claims the money was re-routed through a fraudulent address switch and partially deposited into a Hong Kong account called “Glass Door.” You might also like: ‘Typical Justin Sun smear campaign’: First Digital denies allegations, threatens legal action Sun named several individuals allegedly involved and called the scheme a “major international financial fraud,” comparing it to a classic crypto wallet exploit.

The company is seeking to stop Sun from repeating the claims and is demanding retractions and damages. Earlier this month, the controversy caused the FDUSD to briefly lose its peg, falling as low as $0.87. At the time of writing, the stablecoin was trading at $0.99 after recovering.

According to the proposal, the initiative is intended to enhance visibility for USD1 ahead of its broader launch. The stablecoin, backed by U.S. Treasuries and managed by custodian BitGo, is part of WLFI’s effort to establish a regulated dollar-pegged digital asset. WLFI’s growing presence in the stablecoin space has not gone unnoticed by lawmakers. At an April 2 hearing before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee , Democratic Representative Maxine Waters expressed concern that Trump may seek to make USD1 a replacement for the U.S. dollar in federal transactions. Committee Chair French Hill echoed the sentiment, warning, “If there is no effort to block the president of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business, I cannot support this bill and urge others not to either.” The post Trump-Linked Crypto Project WLFI Adds $775K in SEI Tokens to Its Portfolio appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Trump|Trump Family|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|ONDO|SEI,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-14 07:37:29

With tools like OpenAI’s Custom GPTs, it is now possible for beginners and enthusiasts to create intelligent trading bots capable of analyzing data, generating signals and even executing trades. This guide analyzes the fundamentals of building a beginner-friendly AI crypto trading bot using Custom GPTs. It covers setup, strategy design, coding, testing and important considerations for safety and success. What is a custom GPT? A custom GPT (generative pretrained transformer) is a personalized version of OpenAI’s ChatGPT . It can be trained to follow specific instructions, work with uploaded documents and assist with niche tasks, including crypto trading bot development. These models can help automate tedious processes, generate and troubleshoot code, analyze technical indicators and even interpret crypto news or market sentiment, making them ideal companions for building algorithmic trading bots. What you’ll need to get started Before creating a trading bot, the following components are necessary : OpenAI ChatGPT Plus subscription (for access to GPT-4 and Custom GPTs). A crypto exchange account that offers API access (e.g., Coinbase , Binance, Kraken ). Basic knowledge of Python (or willingness to learn). A paper trading environment to safely test strategies. Optional: A VPS or cloud server to run the bot continuously. Did you know? Python’s creator, Guido van Rossum, named the language after Monty Python’s Flying Circus, aiming for something fun and approachable. Step-by-step guide to building an AI trading bot with custom GPTs Whether you’re looking to generate trade signals, interpret news sentiment or automate strategy logic, the below step-by-step approach helps you learn the basics of combining AI with crypto trading . With sample Python scripts and output examples, you'll see how to connect a custom GPT to a trading system, generate trade signals and automate decisions using real-time market data. Step 1: Define a simple trading strategy Start by identifying a basic rule-based strategy that is easy to automate. Examples include: Buy when Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) daily price drops by more than 3%. Sell when RSI (relative strength index) exceeds 70. Enter a long position after a bullish moving average convergence divergence (MACD) crossover. Trade based on sentiment from recent crypto headlines. Clear, rule-based logic is essential for creating effective code and minimizing confusion for your Custom GPT. Step 2: Create a custom GPT To build a personalized GPT model: Visit chat.openai.com Navigate to Explore GPTs > Create Name the model (e.g., “Crypto Trading Assistant”) In the instructions section, define its role clearly. For example: “You are a Python developer specialized in crypto trading bots.” “You understand technical analysis and crypto APIs.” “You help generate and debug trading bot code.” Optional: Upload exchange API documentation or trading strategy PDFs for additional context. Step 3: Generate the trading bot code (with GPT’s help) Use the custom GPT to help generate a Python script. For example, type: “Write a basic Python script that connects to Binance using ccxt and buys BTC when RSI drops below 30. I am a beginner and don’t understand code much so I need a simple and short script please.” The GPT can provide: Code for connecting to the exchange via API. Technical indicator calculations using libraries like ta or TA-lib. Trading signal logic. Sample buy/sell execution commands. Python libraries commonly used for such tasks are: ccxt for multi-exchange API support. pandas for market data manipulation. ta or TA-Lib for technical analysis. schedule or apscheduler for running timed tasks. To begin, the user must install two Python libraries: ccxt for accessing the Binance API, and ta (technical analysis) for calculating the RSI. This can be done by running the following command in a terminal: pip install ccxt ta Next, the user should replace the placeholder API key and secret with their actual Binance API credentials. These can be generated from a Binance account dashboard. The script uses a five-minute candlestick chart to determine short-term RSI conditions. Below is the full script: ==================================================================== import ccxt import pandas as pd import ta # Your Binance API keys (use your own) api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY' api_secret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET' # Connect to Binance exchange = ccxt.binance({ 'apiKey': api_key, 'secret': api_secret, 'enableRateLimit': True, }) # Get BTC/USDT 1h candles bars = exchange.fetch_ohlcv('BTC/USDT', timeframe='1h', limit=100) df = pd.DataFrame(bars, columns=['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']) # Calculate RSI df['rsi'] = ta.momentum.RSIIndicator(df['close'], window=14).rsi() # Check latest RSI value latest_rsi = df['rsi'].iloc[-1] print(f""Latest RSI: {latest_rsi}"") # If RSI if latest_rsi order = exchange.create_market_buy_order('BTC/USDT', 0.001) print(""Buy order placed:"", order) else: print(""RSI not low enough to buy."") ==================================================================== Please note that the above script is intended for illustration purposes. It does not include risk management features, error handling or safeguards against rapid trading. Beginners should test this code in a simulated environment or on Binance’s testnet before considering any use with real funds. Also, the above code uses market orders, which execute immediately at the current price and only run once. For continuous trading, you’d put it in a loop or scheduler. Images below show what the sample output would look like: The sample output shows how the trading bot reacts to market conditions using the RSI indicator. When the RSI drops below 30, as seen with “Latest RSI: 27.46,” it indicates the market may be oversold, prompting the bot to place a market buy order. The order details confirm a successful trade with 0.001 BTC purchased. If the RSI is higher, such as “41.87,” the bot prints “RSI not low enough to buy,” meaning no trade is made. This logic helps automate entry decisions, but the script has limitations like no sell condition, no continuous monitoring and no real-time risk management features, as explained previously. Step 4: Implement risk management Risk control is a critical component of any automated trading strategy . Ensure your bot includes: Stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms. Position size limits to avoid overexposure. Rate-limiting or cooldown periods between trades. Capital allocation controls, such as only risking 1–2% of total capital per trade. Prompt your GPT with instructions like: “Add a stop-loss to the RSI trading bot at 5% below the entry price.” Step 5: Test in a paper trading environment Never deploy untested bots with real capital. Most exchanges offer testnets or sandbox environments where trades can be simulated safely. Alternatives include: Running simulations on historical data (backtesting). Logging “paper trades” to a file instead of executing real trades. Testing ensures that logic is sound, risk is controlled and the bot performs as expected under various conditions. Step 6: Deploy the bot for live trading (Optional) Once the bot has passed paper trading tests: Replace test API keys: First, replace your test API keys with live API keys from your chosen exchange’s account. These keys allow the bot to access your real trading account. To do this, log in to exchange, go to the API management section and create a new set of API keys. Copy the API key and secret into your script. It is crucial to handle these keys securely and avoid sharing them or including them in public code. Set up secure API permissions (disable withdrawals): Adjust the security settings for your API keys. Make sure that only the permissions you need are enabled. For example, enable only “spot and margin trading ” and disable permissions like “withdrawals” to reduce the risk of unauthorized fund transfers. Exchanges like Binance also allow you to limit API access to specific IP addresses, which adds another layer of protection. Host the bot on a cloud server: If you want the bot to trade continuously without relying on your personal computer, you’ll need to host it on a cloud server. This means running the script on a virtual machine that stays online 24/7. Services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), DigitalOcean or PythonAnywhere provide this functionality. Among these, PythonAnywhere is often the easiest to set up for beginners, as it supports running Python scripts directly in a web interface. Still, always start small and monitor the bot regularly. Mistakes or market changes can result in losses, so careful setup and ongoing supervision are essential. Did you know? Exposed API keys are a top cause of crypto theft. Always store them in environment variables — not inside your code. Ready-made bot templates (starter logic) The templates below are basic strategy ideas that beginners can easily understand. They show the core logic behind when a bot should buy, like “buy when RSI is below 30.” Even if you’re new to coding, you can take these simple ideas and ask your Custom GPT to turn them into full, working Python scripts. GPT can help you write, explain and improve the code, so you don’t need to be a developer to get started. In addition, here is a simple checklist for building and testing a crypto trading bot using the RSI strategy: Just choose your trading strategy, describe what you want, and let GPT do the heavy lifting, including backtesting, live trading or multi-coin support. RSI strategy bot (buy Low RSI) Logic : Buy BTC when RSI drops below 30 (oversold). if rsi place_buy_order() Used for: Momentum reversal strategies. Tools: ta library for RSI. 2. MACD crossover bot Logic : Buy when MACD line crosses above signal line. if macd > signal and previous_macd place_buy_order() Used for: Trend-following and swing trading. Tools : ta.trend.MACD or TA-Lib. 3. News sentiment bot Logic : Use AI (Custom GPT) to scan headlines for bullish/bearish sentiment. if “bullish” in sentiment_analysis(latest_headlines): place_buy_order() Used for: Reacting to market-moving news or tweets. Tools: News APIs + GPT sentiment classifier. Risks concerning AI-powered trading bots While trading bots can be powerful tools, they also come with serious risks : Market volatility : Sudden price swings can lead to unexpected losses. API errors or rate limits : Improper handling can cause the bot to miss trades or place incorrect orders. Bugs in code : A single logic error can result in repeated losses or account liquidation. Security vulnerabilities : Storing API keys insecurely can expose your funds. Overfitting : Bots tuned to perform well in backtests may fail in live conditions. Always start with small amounts, use strong risk management and continuously monitor bot behavior. While AI can offer powerful support, it’s crucial to respect the risks involved. A successful trading bot combines intelligent strategy, responsible execution and ongoing learning. Build slowly, test carefully and use your Custom GPT not just as a tool — but also as a mentor.

Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-binance-made-a-statement-about-om-token-which-had-a-big-drop-here-are-the-details/,"Binance has released a statement acknowledging the recent price volatility surrounding the MANTRA project’s native token, OM, attributing the move to cross-exchange liquidations and significant changes to the token’s supply structure. Binance Announces OM Token Amid Cross-Exchange Liquidations and Tokenomics Shift The exchange stated risk control measures and ongoing monitoring following sharp price fluctuations in MANTRA’s native token. According to the exchange, its internal analysis shows that the price fluctuations observed over the past 24 hours were largely the result of gradual liquidations across multiple trading platforms. OM experienced sharp price movements that caught the attention of investors and led to the platform reaffirming its risk management practices. “Since October last year, Binance has proactively implemented various risk control measures, including reducing the available leverage for OM. These actions are part of our ongoing efforts to adjust risk exposure in response to evolving market conditions,” the company said in a statement. The exchange also noted that in January, OM published an alert message on its spot trading page to inform users about significant changes in token supply dynamics. This message refers to changes to OM’s tokenomics that have increased the circulating supply. In light of recent price action, Binance has updated this alert to highlight the token’s high volatility. Despite the turbulence, Binance reiterated its commitment to protecting users through continuous monitoring and responsive platform management. “We are committed to monitoring the situation closely and will continue to take appropriate measures to protect our users and preserve the integrity of our platform,” the exchange said. OM’s recent volatility highlights the broader risks associated with tokenomic changes and leveraged trading, particularly when amplified by fragmented liquidity across exchanges. Binance’s public statement and additional measures reflect increasing pressure on major trading platforms to improve transparency and risk mitigation in the face of increased market scrutiny. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, the scheme involved using translation and chat software to befriend foreigners, gain their trust and trick them into investment by defrauding their money. Over 66,000 Indians Fell To the Scam The case handled by the People’s Court of Heze Economic Development Zone in Shandong Province involved a total of 517 million Indian rupees which is about 40 million RMB targeting 66,800 Indians. The nine fraudsters were sentenced to prison and fined for their involvement in the large-scale scam targeting Indians. He Moutian was the mastermind behind the scam. In May 2023 he set up an office in Heze, China and formed a fraud gang with several other people. The group used overseas servers, appeared to be large investors, and targeted Indians through a fake investment platform called SENEE. Scammers Promised 8%-15% Returns, Stole Millions for USDT Conversion They pretended to be friendly investors on chat apps, offering high monthly returns of 8%-15% on smaller investments like 1,000 rupees. Once people put in larger sums of money, the gang would shut the platform and freeze the funds. The stolen money was then used to buy USDT through a third-party payment platform which was later converted into RMB or US dollars, with the group keeping 15% as profit. Scammers Used Fake Identities and Coordinated Closely One of the scammers, Li Mouwang, admitted to pretending to be a rich Indian woman who made money through smart investments. She used chat apps to build trust and fake relationships with Indian men and lured them into investing in the fake SENEE fund. Furthermore, the gang also posted fake lifestyle photos like gym selfies and travel pics and also set their app location to Indian cities. A fake company website with edited licenses, registration certificates and business documents was also created to make the investment platform seem genuine and gain customer trust. The court found that the group was highly organised with clear roles and tight coordination. All the nine members were sentenced to 5 to nearly 15 years in prison and fined. The Judge noted that although this case targeted foreigners, however online scams are common inside China too. It warned the public to not fall for promises of easy money, special insider tips or cashbacks for placing orders as they are all signs of scams. The authorities are increasingly cracking down on telecommunications network fraud and the judge has urged the fraudsters to surrender for lighter punishment.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Hack,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-14 07:42:37

On April 14, a day after the Mantra token’s market cap suffered a loss of $5.5 billion due to market volatility, Binance issued a statement through the exchange’s Customer Support account on X, reacting to the recent price crash. According to the recent post , Binance’s initial findings reveal that the price crash was due to a series of cross-exchange liquidations that occurred over the past day.

Our initial findings indicate that the developments over the past day are a result of cross-exchange liquidations.

Thank you for your continued trust in Binance,” said the Binance Help Desk account. At press time, the Mantra token has experienced a near 90% drop in the past 24 hours. Its market cap stands at $764 million, plummeting from a previous $6 billion high. The token is currently trading hands at $0.79, down 91% from its earlier all-time high of $8.99 from last February.

In addition, Binance also stated that it had decreased leverage levels for the OM token since October last year. Despite this fact, many traders in the comments section criticized the exchange for not delisting the token before the incident occurred. On the other hand, OKX CEO Star deemed the OM price drop as “a big scandal to the whole crypto industry.” Star also assured the crypto exchange will be preparing reports based on the incident, as all the information is available on-chain. “All of the on-chain unlock and deposit data is public, all major exchanges’ collateral and liquidation data can be investigated. OKX will make all of the reports ready!” stated Star in a recent post . On-chain data from CryptoNinjas revealed that 127 million OM or 13% of the token’s circulating supply has been withdrawn from Binance in the past month. Meanwhile, OKX has seen nearly 70 million token deposits, which was more than 50% of the amount withdrawn from Biannce. What happened to OM? Last weekend, OM experienced a major price crash by 90%, falling from $6.30 to under $0.50 in the span of just a few hours. Mantra chief executive officer JP Mullin alleged that OM’s recent price crash was due to “reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders.” Mullin claimed that the sell-off was not due to token sales by either the internal team or investors, stating that the OM tokens remain under lock based on the project’s vesting timeline. “Centralized exchange partners play an important role in providing liquidity to projects like ours. We work closely with them, however they continue to exercise enormously high levels of discretion,” said Mullin. However, on-chain analysts seem to disagree, with many stating that the sell-off began when 3.9 million OM was deposited on OKX by a wallet linked to the Mantra team. Crypto analyst Max Brown said the team allegedly holds almost 90% of the token’s total supply, which triggered the market sell-off that led to the token losing $5.5 billion in market cap.

Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,710.66 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price increased over the last 24 hours towards the resistance at $597. Buyers stepped in to buy the assets; However, the support floor at that level seems stable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is now trading below the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,710.66 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB was trading near the psychological mark of $600, which it still continues to do so in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-14 07:45:00

BTC has bounced to over $84,000 since probing lows under $75,000 last week. The recovery comes as the bond market chaos supposedly forced President Donald Trump to capitulate on tariffs just days after announcing sweeping import levies on several nations, including China. Late Friday, The Trump administration issued new guidelines, sparing key tech products like smartphones from his 125% China tariff and baseline 10% global levy. Hours later, Trump refuted the news, suggesting no relief on tariffs. Still, the price recovery saw emboldened traders chase upside in BTC through the Deribit-listed call options. A call gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, looking to profit from an expected price rise. A put buyer is said to be bearish, looking to hedge or profit from price swoons. ""Trump's bond-market-crisis fueled tariff-walkback flipped the vocal narrative from aggression to capitulation, and the markets from capitulation to aggressive bounce. Protective/Bear play BTC $75K-$78K [strike] Puts were dumped, and $85K-$100K [strike] Calls were lifted as BTC surged from $75K-$85K,"" Deribit said in a market update. The pivot to upside calls has normalized the options skew, which reflected strong put bias or downside fears early last week, according to data tracked by Amberdata. The skew measures the implied volatility (demand) for calls relative to puts and has been a reliable market sentiment indicator for years. The 30-, 60-, and 90-day skews have rebounded to just above zero, up from deeply negative levels a week ago, indicating a decrease in market panic and a resurgence of upside interest. Although the seven-day gauge remains negative, it reflects a notably weaker put bias than a week ago when it dropped to -14%. $100K is the most popular bet Another data point likely to energize the recently battered market participants is the distribution of open interest, highlighting the resurgence of the $100K call as the most favored options bet on Deribit, which accounts for over 75% of global options activity. As of writing, the $100K call boasted a cumulative notional open interest of nearly $1.2 billion. The notional figure represents the U.S. dollar value of the number of active option contracts at a given time. Calls at $100K and $120K were popular early this year before the market swoon saw traders deploy money in the $80K put last month. The chart shows the concentration of open interest in calls at strikes ranging from $95,000 to $120,000. Meanwhile, the $70K put is the second-most popular play with an open interest of $982 million.",Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-14 07:47:43

According to the team, several centralized exchanges closed the accounts of OM holders without thinking about the negative impact on the token’s price. The crash of Mantra (OM) was not due to the token’s ecosystem, but was probably due to the actions of centralized exchange operators. John Patrick Mullin, the project’s CEO, wrote a statement on the probable reason for the crash. “We have determined that the OM market movements were triggered by reckless forced closures initiated by centralized exchanges on OM account holders. The timing and depth of the crash suggest that a very sudden closure of account positions was initiated without sufficient warning or notice.” ~ wrote Mullin in a post on X. The statement arrived just hours after the crypto community set out doubts on the team’s involvement with the market crash. OM was already sliding in the days before the crash, and there were rumors of insider selling and an eventual rug-pull. Mullin explained the crash was partially due to the low liquidity late on Sunday, which coincided with the most inactive hours on the Asian market. He admitted centralized exchanges had their internal rules, but in the case of OM, the account closures were not coordinated with the team. Whale selling preceded OM crash, but CEO denies insider trading The crash did not happen due to the sale of OM tokens by the team, the MANTRA Chain Association, advisors, early backers, or any other entities selling tokens, added Mullin. A big part of the OM supply remains locked with a long-term vesting schedule. However, according to Arkham, in the days before the crash, several wallets deposited OM to exchanges. One of the wallets sent over 470K OM to Binance, while another address made a series of deposits to OKX. One of the wallets was tagged as belonging to Laser Digital , or LD Capital, one of the early backers of Mantra. The attempted selling also happened during low liquidity periods, meaning the insiders only realized a fraction of their value on paper. Laser Digital has also invested in Berachain (BERA), Plume Network (PLUME), Illuvium (ILV) and other high-profile Web3 projects. One of the high-profile sales happened just hours before the OM crash. A wallet linked to influencer and VC investor Shane Shin deposited 2M OM after a year of holding the tokens. Shin had mentioned OM multiple times and shilled the Mantra project. The selling was relatively minor compared to the subsequent loss of value for OM. The Mantra community relied on most of OM being locked and held closely, not expecting a rug pull from a well-established project. ZachXBT raised hypothesis of OM wallet exploits One of the hypotheses on the price effects for OM is that the selling was not intended, but a possible result of a hack. On-chain investigator ZachXBT claimed Mantra was not easily researched, since it is a Cosmos chain project, with limited tools for tracking and exploration. However, he allows the possibility for a hack or an exploit to explain the token sales. There’s no question it was a heavily manipulated token via MMs / supply control — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) April 13, 2025 Whatever the cause, the effect on OM was outsized. Hours after the crash, OM regained some of its positions, up to $0.80, but there are still doubts about the project’s soundness. The Mantra DAO is also suffering, remaining with just $1.9M in its reserves, as 99.7% of the treasury was held in OM tokens. Even during the OM market rally, there were rumors that the token’s price action was due to the influence of market makers . The rapid rise of OM and the chart’s rapid rise have led to risk warnings in the past few months. The existing doubts amplified the effect of the initial selling, leading to the erasing of over 98% of OM’s market capitalization. OM has been around since the 2020 market lows, trading at around $0.40 for years. The token only broke out during the 2024 bull cycle, when RWA tokenization became a hot narrative. Mantra (OM) erased most of its gains from the past years, raising suspicions the price growth was the effect of market makers. The Mantra project has taken a long time before its big rally, while the initial team and backers held at least 30% of the supply. The Mantra project launched with $11M from fundraising rounds, but the token’s value expanded to as much as $6B. The crash of OM wiped out the entire RWA token narrative. The collective tokens are now valued at $35B, with Chainlink (LINK) as the leading asset. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Speaking to ABC News on April 13, Lutnick said the exemption was short-lived and would soon give way to a broader, more targeted tariff regime focused on semiconductors, smartphones, and computing components. “President Trump has called out pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and autos,” Lutnick said, pointing to the administration’s sector-based tariff plans. “These aren’t bargaining chips. These are strategic industries that must be rebuilt here at home.” The quick reversal underscores the administration’s firm stance on economic nationalism, particularly regarding goods seen as vital to national security. While the initial exemption had raised hopes of easing tensions with China, Lutnick made it clear the administration isn’t budging on critical supply chains. “We can’t be relying on China for the things we fundamentally need,” he added, drawing a sharp line around sectors the White House deems non-negotiable. Policy Confusion Sends Markets Into a Tailspin The inconsistency in communication over tariff policy didn’t go unnoticed by investors. Stocks and crypto both surged after initial rumors of a 90-day tariff pause began circulating earlier in the week, pumping nearly $2 trillion back into markets. But the rally was short-lived. President Trump later denied the pause, sparking a rapid sell-off. Then, when the administration did in fact issue a reciprocal exemption—albeit briefly—markets bounced again, only to falter once more after Lutnick’s clarification on April 13. “Markets hate uncertainty, and this is a case study in it,” said one Wall Street analyst. “Every time they say one thing and do another, traders get burned.” Strategic or Chaotic? Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas pointed out that the S&P 500 had surpassed Bitcoin in volatility. According to him, the index hit a volatility score of 74 in April—higher than Bitcoin’s 71. While some see the administration’s tariff flip-flop as poor messaging , others believe it signals a calculated pivot toward long-term economic restructuring. With semiconductors and other tech products becoming modern-day lifelines, Lutnick’s remarks suggest the U.S. is preparing for a more entrenched and strategic trade stance—one that may continue to rattle markets before any sense of clarity returns.

Reveals Indicator to Follow for Risks in Altcoins!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-founder-cz-comments-on-mantra-om-crash-reveals-indicator-to-follow-for-risks-in-altcoins/,"A new one was added to the altcoins that have experienced sharp declines in recent weeks. Accordingly, Mantra (OM), listed on Binance, fell by more than 80% in seconds. While this decline has a shocking effect on investors, everyone is wondering why. At this point, MANTRA CEO John Patrick Mullin said that no team member or partner had sold OM tokens, while claiming that the decline was due to the deliberate action of centralized exchanges against OM account holders. While these claims continue to be debated in the crypto community, OKX founder and CEO Star Xu said that the MANTRA crash was a ‘big scandal’ and promised to release related reports soon. Binance stated in its statement that initial findings showed that the sudden drop in the price of the OM token was due to liquidations between exchanges. While the sharp decline in Mantra is still awaiting clarification, a statement came from Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). CZ commented, “Like everyone else, I'm wondering 'what happened to this?' I didn't know about the project until the crash.” He responded to questions about whether Binance was doing its due diligence on OM. CZ stated that Binance has been paying due attention, referring to Binance’s statement regarding the OM token. In its statement, Binance stated that it has implemented various risk control measures, including reducing leverage levels, regarding the OM token since October of last year. CZ said that neither CEXs nor DEXs should set up a listing process, access to all tokens should be allowed, and the investment process should be decided by users. Regarding how to understand the risks of projects like OM, CZ said that the “number of real users” is generally a good indicator of the risk situation in altcoins. Finally, CZ added that investors should focus on fundamentals such as user growth, revenue, and profitability when investing in altcoins rather than chasing hype or rumors. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) price led the wider altcoin market in a mild recovery last week. With on-chain data showing significant confidence from whale investors, the crazy crypto speculation is likely to happen in the coming weeks. XRP Price on the Rise As Bitcoin price rallied towards $85k last week, XRP price recorded a 28 percent surge to trade at about $2.12 on Monday, April 14 during the early London session. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $211 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $3.8 billion, has seen its total Futures Open Interest (OI) rise from $2.87 billion on April 9 to about $3.41 billion on Monday. Technical Analysis From a technical analysis standpoint, XRP price has been retesting the bullish breakout from the 2021 all-time high of about $1.9. In the weekly timeframe, XRP price has been forming a falling wedge, amid the macro bullish outlook. As a result, a consistent close above the falling logarithmic trend line, which was established since the beginning of this year, will trigger the next XRP price parabolic rally toward price discovery.
