According to Coinshares, institutional whales poured over $1 billion into crypto products last week despite or perhaps because of market weakness. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling for the 5th consecutive week totaling US$1.3bn, bringing inflows for the year so far to US$7.3bn. Recent price declines saw total assets under management in ETPs (exchange-traded products) fall to US$163bn, down from its all-time high set in late January of US$181bn. Trading volumes for the week held steady at US$20bn.” Source: CoinShares The US led the world regionally with $1 billion in inflows. Germany, Switzerland, and Canada also provided $61 million, $54 million, and $37 million, respectively. Even though Bitcoin ( BTC ) raked in $407 million last week, there was a surprising new leader for taking the lion’s share of inflows. “Ethereum stole the show this week, with the price falling recently close to US$2,100 leading to significant buying-on-weakness with inflows of US$793m, outpacing bitcoin for the first time this year.” While multi-asset investment vehicles, or products investing in a basket of digital assets, brought in $14.4 million in inflows, XRP led all non- ETH altcoins at $21.1 million in inflows. Solana ( SOL ) products brought in $11.2 million in inflows last week while Sui ( SUI ) investment vehicles enjoyed $4.3 million in inflows.

Musk’s Past with OpenAI and His Concerns Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 and left in 2019 over internal disagreements, has frequently criticized its transformation into a for-profit entity. He argues that OpenAI’s shift prioritizes revenue generation over its original mission of benefiting humanity, an issue that has fueled legal conflicts between the parties. Elon Musk’s AI firm, xAI, is leading the bid with financial support from Valor Equity Partners, 8VC, and Hollywood executive Ari Emanuel. Under Altman’s leadership, OpenAI has moved toward a for-profit structure, aggressively seeking funding to expand its AI research. Altman has defended the shift, arguing that substantial funding is essential for large-scale AI innovation. As part of this effort, he announced a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure through a joint venture, Stargate.

Grayscale, which last year broke through U.S. regulators' blockade against the bitcoin ETF, has never previously offered a standalone ADA investment vehicle despite making past moves to do so. But the Trump 2.0 SEC's pivot from policing the crypto industry to seemingly embracing it has emboldened issuers to think big about what they can get through. In recent weeks Grayscale filed for a Solana and XRP ETF as well. Those products would convert Grayscale's preexisting crypto trust products into more widely tradeable ETFs whereas the ADA ETF would be entirely new. Investor demand has always been high for the flagship asset of the Cardano blockchain. ADA ranks among the largest crypto assets by market cap, weighing in at $25 billion at press time. The token spiked 1.5% to 71 cents following the Grayscale news. Market observers increasingly believe the time is nigh for altcoin ETFs to clear the not-quite-as-skeptical SEC.

This rare feat highlights the uncertain nature of cryptocurrency mining and shows that solo miners can still achieve substantial rewards despite the dominance of large mining pools. Crypto journalist Pete Rizzo shared the news via X: BREAKING: ANOTHER SOLO MINER HAS MINED AN ENTIRE #BITCOIN BLOCK WORTH $300,000 BEATING UNBELIEVABLE ODDS pic.twitter.com/pjcivSu2PQ — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) February 10, 2025 On January 30, 2025, a solo Bitcoin miner reportedly used a “$200 BitAXE miner,” a home mining device, to successfully mine a block. However, another user speculated that the miner leveraged CKPOOL, a mining pool designed for solo miners. The miner was using an implementation of @ckpooldev but this does not seem to be from CKPOOL directly. Might have been a bitaxe. Digging in now! — Marshall Long (@OGBTC) February 10, 2025 Mining an entire Bitcoin block as a solo miner with limited computational power is statistically improbable, comparable to winning a lottery. The Bitcoin network is predominantly controlled by large mining pools that combine extensive computational power to increase their chances of mining new blocks. Understanding Solo Mining Solo mining involves a miner attempting to solve the complex mathematical problems required to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain without joining a mining pool. While this approach allows miners to keep the entire block reward, the probability of success remains low due to the extensive computational power required. As the Bitcoin network grows more competitive, solo mining becomes increasingly difficult. However, miners willing to invest in hardware and electricity, despite the slim odds, may still see occasional success. How the Crypto Market Reacted After the Block Win On Monday, the cryptocurrency market cap declined by 3% following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports , intensifying concerns over economic policy shifts. Following the broader market downturn, Bitcoin (BTC) declined 0.5% to $96,871, while Ethereum (ETH) dropped 1.5% to $2,627.

SAND, APT, BERA, and ARB face declining momentum, raising concerns among analysts. Market data suggests these tokens could underperform in the long run, making them potential sell candidates for risk-averse holders. 4 Altcoins To Sell Before Token Unlocks Trigger Market Volatility Upcoming token unlocks may lead to significant selling pressure. Data from Tokenomist indicates that over $742 million worth of tokens will be released between February 10 and 17. Notable unlocks include CONX, SAND, APT, BERA, and ARB, with individual values surpassing $5 million. The largest unlock is ARB, which will release 92.65 million tokens worth $40.57 million, representing 12.13% of its circulating supply. Meanwhile, SAND will see a 205.59 million token release worth $79.34 million, making up 8.41% of its supply. BERA, APT, and CONX will also experience substantial unlocks. The Sandbox (SAND) Sandbox (SAND), a blockchain-based virtual world, surged 10% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.396. The platform allows users to create, build, and exchange digital assets in a gaming environment. Despite the recent increase, SAND has declined 10% over the past week. A scheduled unlock of 205.59 million tokens worth $79.34 million could impact the market. This event positions SAND as an altcoin to sell, with potential selling pressure ahead. By leveraging DAOs and NFTs, Sandbox continues fostering a decentralized gaming ecosystem. Berachain (BERA) Berachain (BERA) is changing Layer-1 economics with its Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) mechanism, creating an efficient marketplace for validators, users, and applications. BERA is currently trading at $5.31, gaining 5.43% in the past 24 hours. A scheduled token release will introduce 12.98 million BERA tokens, valued at approximately $62.82 million. With a market cap of $570.82 million, BERA is under watch for potential volatility. Aptos (APT) Aptos (APT), a Layer 1 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, is experiencing a price surge, gaining 8% in the past 24 hours. The network, which utilizes the Move programming language initially developed by Meta’s former Diem engineers, has drawn attention amid a significant upcoming token unlock. The APT price is $6.19 and is set to release 11.31 million APT tokens, valued at approximately $64.35 million. This scheduled unlock could introduce selling pressure, potentially affecting the token’s price. Market analysts suggest that Aptos could be among the Altcoins to sell to mitigate long-term losses. Arbitrum (ARB) Arbitrum (ARB), an Ethereum layer-two scaling solution, utilizes optimistic rollups to improve transaction speeds and lower costs while maintaining Ethereum’s security. The network enhances scalability, making transactions more efficient. Recently, the ARB price experienced an 8% surge, reaching $0.4749 within 24 hours. This increase follows growing market activity. Meanwhile, concerns arise over potential volatility as token unlock events approach. Investors closely monitor the market’s reaction to these upcoming changes, making it altcoin to watch. Conclusion: Market trends indicate these altcoins may struggle to regain strong momentum. Investors should assess their portfolios and adjust strategies based on ongoing developments.

The presiding judge, Justice Jeong Woo-yong, said that the prosecution’s case included “no evidence of” Kim committing “a crime.” Kim Nam-guk Absolved: Court Says His Actions ‘Not Criminal’ The Coin Gate scandal galvanized South Korea , when allegations surfaced claiming that Kim had abused his position as a member of a National Assembly committee. The former South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-guk speaking to reporters outside a branch of the Seoul Southern District Court. (Source: KBS News/YouTube/Screenshot) News reports claimed Kim sold unnamed cryptoassets after hearing news of imminent changes to crypto-related law. Prosecutors had hoped to charge Kim on insider trading-related charges. However, they later decided to charge him with “obstructing officials in the course of their duties.” They claimed that Kim had made “false declarations” about his cryptoassets to the National Assembly. Prosecutors claimed that Kim had tried to “hide the fact that he owned a large amount of cryptocurrency.” They told the court that Kim had “hidden” the fact that he had “made a large profit from crypto investments during his two National Assembly asset declarations in 2021 and 2022.” Prosecution’s Case Prosecution officials said that Kim sold some of his crypto holdings. They said he then transferred the fiat “to a bank deposit account to match his total assets.” He then allegedly “converted the remaining assets” into crypto, prosecutors said. And this, they claimed, was part of a bid to “obstruct the National Assembly Ethics Committee’s” probe into his assets. A courtroom in the Seoul Southern District Court. (Source: YTN/YouTube/Screenshot) Prosecutors Wanted to Jail Kim for 6 Months Prosecutors told the court that Kim held crypto worth “approximately 9.9 billion won (over $6.8 million)” at the time of the 2021 asset declaration process. However, Kim reportedly claimed his total assets were worth approximately 1.2 billion won (around $827,000), and that the funds “in the same way” in 2022. In December last year, prosecution officials asked the court to jail Kim for six months if he was found guilty. But the court rejected the prosecution’s case. It stated that at the time, cryptoassets “were not subject to declarations.” As such, the judge said, it was impossible to consider “that [Kim] was under obligation to declare” his holdings. The judge conceded that some declaration details had been “insufficient or inaccurate.” But Jeong added that it was “not easy to rule that the Ethics Committee” had been “obstructed.” President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment trial entered its final stage this week, with just two formal hearings remaining, and legal circles expecting the verdict would be out in mid-March. https://t.co/oWkDO7MdMF #YoonSukYeol #Impeachment #southKorea #News — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) February 10, 2025 New Declarations The judge concluded that, on the basis of the evidence it had seen, there was “insufficient” reason to rule against Kim without further “evidence to support” the prosecution’s claims. Since the scandal first broke, the National Assembly has introduced new crypto declaration rules for all sitting lawmakers. Seoul has gone on to apply the same rules to scores of civil service roles. This means that a large number of public sector workers are now obliged to file annual crypto declarations. Trump's deportation crackdowns impact Koreans https://t.co/QZ4gVN5GpD — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) February 10, 2025 The lengthy court case launched in October last year, with Kim – a trained lawyer – vowing to clear his name.

The crypto space is buzzing with new meme coins, but only a handful offer true potential. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is catching the spotlight as it enters Aqua Frost, its 10th presale phase, with a jaw-dropping 13,451.72% ROI ahead of its listing. Meanwhile, Popcat (POPCAT) has climbed to $0.3058, gaining traction as demand rises, and Brett (BRETT) continues its recovery after its December 2024 peak of $0.2342. With meme coin momentum showing no signs of slowing down, investors are eyeing strategic entries. Let’s dive into the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Popcat (POPCAT), and Brett (BRETT) and why the APC stands tall among the top new meme coins to buy today. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Mission-Driven Crypto Revolution: Why Investors Are Diving In So, the top new meme coins to buy today aren’t just about hype; they need a unique vision. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another dog-themed project—it’s built on an engaging mythical adventure where Arctic Pablo explores hidden realms, unveiling a financially rewarding journey. This isn’t just a storytelling gimmick. The project integrates real utility, allowing holders to earn passive income through 66% APY staking, referral rewards, and community incentives​. Arctic Pablo also operates on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for low-cost, high-speed transactions, making it a strategic alternative to meme coins facing congestion issues. With a token burn mechanism that ensures scarcity, Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model enhances value appreciation. Investors aren’t just holding a meme coin—they’re part of a project that mixes mythology, gamification, and strong economics to create something truly unique​. Aqua Frost Presale Gains Momentum: Arctic Pablo’s 10th Phase Is Heating Up As Arctic Pablo Coin advances into Aqua Frost, its 10th presale phase, the urgency to invest grows stronger. At the moment, 1 APC is priced at $0.000059, with over $1.1 million already raised​. With its final listing price set at $0.008, the potential return is staggering—an ROI of 13,451.72% for early adopters. At this rate, a $3,000 investment in Stage 10 would secure 50,847,458 APC, translating into a massive $406,779 when it hits the exchange​. Time is running out, as each stage features an automatic token burn, ensuring that unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. The earlier investors get in, the higher their potential gains. As price increases with each new phase, the chance to enter at the rock-bottom pricing is slipping away. Popcat Hits $0.3058 as It Rebounds From Recent Lows Popcat (POPCAT) has been making headlines after bouncing back from a recent dip, currently trading at $0.3058. The meme token, which once hit an all-time high of $1.07 in September 2024, has since experienced a pullback, but traders are closely watching its movements. With a market cap that previously crossed $1 billion, Popcat continues to be a notable player in the meme coin space. Despite its recent volatility, interest in Popcat remains strong. The token’s community engagement and widespread meme appeal keep it in the spotlight, and investors are watching closely to see if it can regain momentum. Brett Sees Market Correction After Hitting $0.0459 Brett (BRETT) has seen a minor pullback, currently priced at $0.0459. This comes after its impressive run in December 2024, when it reached an all-time high of $0.2342 with a market cap of $2 billion. While some investors anticipated further upward movement, BRETT has yet to secure a listing on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. Despite this short-term correction, Brett’s presence in the meme coin market remains significant. The project continues to garner attention, and many believe that if a major exchange listing materializes, it could reignite bullish momentum. Conclusion: Where to Put Your Money? Based on current market trends and ongoing developments, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the strongest opportunity among meme coins right now. With its lucrative staking program, strategic presale structure, and deflationary mechanics, APC is poised for explosive growth. Popcat and Brett remain key contenders, with their own market movements keeping investors engaged. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale momentum and high ROI potential make it an unmatched investment opportunity in the top new meme coins to buy today . As Aqua Frost continues to gain traction, the time to act is now. Secure your spot in the Arctic Pablo presale before prices rise again. Join the presale today and be part of this exciting adventure!

Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing a surge in whale transactions, hinting at a possible rally, while Avalanche (AVAX) faces intense selling pressure, with analysts warning of a drop below $20. But Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as the most compelling crypto of February, disrupting the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector with a fully decentralized marketplace. While Chainlink and Avalanche rely on traditional price cycles and market sentiment, Web3Bay offers real-world utility and a massive adoption potential. With over $1 million raised and 280 million tokens sold in presale, Web3Bay is not just another speculative bet—it’s a fundamental shift in how online commerce operates. With a projected 4,200% ROI at launch, it presents the strongest investment case among the three. Chainlink (LINK) Price Surges in Whale Transactions – Is a Rally Coming? Chainlink (LINK) price is drawing attention as whale transactions hit a 14-month high, with 1,659 transfers exceeding $100,000 recorded in a single day. On-chain data from Santiment reveals that active wallets have climbed to 9,531, the highest in four weeks. This surge in large transactions often signals an impending price shift, as institutional investors position themselves ahead of major market moves. Despite a 20% drop in the past week, Chainlink (LINK) price is consolidating between its 50-day moving average at $22.76 and the 200-day MA at $15.88. Historically, increased whale accumulation during a dip has led to strong rebounds. Analysts remain bullish, projecting a climb to $32 in February, $41 in March, and a potential $48 by May, marking an 88% increase from current levels. Avalanche (AVAX) Drops Below $27 – Will It Crash to $20? Avalanche (AVAX) has fallen below $27, extending its downward trend as bearish momentum intensifies. Over the past week, AVAX has dropped 18.3%, with a 3.6% decline in the last 24 hours, pushing its market cap below $11 billion. Analysts warn that if selling pressure continues, the token could slide toward the $20 support level. Technical indicators suggest further downside risk. AVAX recently broke below its 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $28.91, a key support zone. The Trend Strength Index (TSI) at -0.89 and a sharp drop in the 20-day EMA confirm strong bearish momentum. If AVAX fails to reclaim this level, the next major support sits near $19.55. Web3Bay: The Must-Buy Crypto of February 2025 Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as the top crypto investment for February, revolutionizing e-commerce with its decentralized marketplace. Unlike traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay, which impose high fees and centralized control, Web3Bay enables buyers and sellers to transact directly on the blockchain, eliminating middlemen and reducing costs. With blockchain security, tamper-proof transactions, and a governance model controlled by 3BAY token holders via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Web3Bay is reshaping online commerce. The Web3Bay presale is on fire, with over $1 million raised and 280 million tokens sold. Currently priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, the token is projected to launch at $0.1959, offering a staggering 4,200% ROI for early investors. Additionally, Web3Bay introduces staking rewards, allowing token holders to earn passive income while benefiting from lower transaction fees. With the global e-commerce industry surpassing $7 trillion, Web3Bay presents a real-world use case with massive upside potential. As crypto adoption accelerates, 3BAY is the one coin investors can’t afford to miss this February. Its high-growth trajectory, real utility, and strong investor demand make it the most compelling crypto presale right now. Web3Bay Leads the Charge as the Market’s Best Bet Chainlink’s whale accumulation signals potential upside, but its price remains volatile. Avalanche is battling critical resistance levels, with risks of further losses if market sentiment doesn’t improve. However, Web3Bay offers more than just speculation—it’s an ecosystem with long-term growth potential. With staking rewards, decentralized governance, and real-world adoption, Web3Bay is far more than a short-term play. Investors looking for a crypto with massive upside and tangible use cases should not overlook this presale. While LINK and AVAX have their strengths, Web3Bay stands out as February’s best crypto investment—offering early backers the chance to secure life-changing gains before its official launch.

Still priced at just $0.042 in presale, this rising crypto is flashing a strong buy signal, with analysts eyeing an 80,000% surge. Dogecoin Price Struggles As It Risks Dropping To $0.22 Support The Dogecoin price has struggled to gain traction, failing to break through key resistance levels. Currently trading at $0.2651, DOGE remains locked in a tight range, with traders showing caution as volume declines. Technical charts indicate the Dogecoin price limited buying pressure, with the weekly chart showing a 19.2% drop and the daily chart indicating a 1.3% decline. Market analysts warn that DOGE may retest a $0.22 support level with the current market situation. With volatility increasing, some DOGE holders are beginning to diversify into stronger-performing assets, looking for better returns elsewhere. This has led investors to explore new options, particularly WallitIQ (WLTQ), which has gained traction as a top-performing presale asset. Unlike DOGE, which depends heavily on speculation, this presale sensation offers a strong value proposition backed by security and automation features that appeal to long-term investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Signals Massive 80,000% Surge While the Dogecoin price continues to show uncertainty, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has emerged as one of the most attractive investment opportunities in the market. Analysts tracking the presale activity have noted a strong buy signal ahead of a jaw-dropping 80,000% upside as early investors rush to secure this affordable presale token at its current price of $0.042.

Unlike the Dogecoin price, which remains speculative, the altcoin is backed by tangible technological advancements that augment digital asset security and usability. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) SolidProof-audited smart contract and a CoinMarketCap listing already secured, investor confidence continues to grow, making WLTQ one of the most sought-after presale tokens on the market.

Investors recognize that once it completes its presale phase, the price will rise significantly, making now the best time to enter before significant price increases occur. This emerging altcoin presents a strategic advantage over the current Dogecoin price for investors seeking a high-upside opportunity with reduced risk. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Next Big Crypto Move The Dogecoin price remains volatile, with analysts forecasting a potential drop toward $0.22 support levels. The DOGE struggling to regain momentum has left many traders questioning its ability to deliver sustainable gains in the coming months. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has continued to flash a strong buy signal, attracting investors looking for a more secure and functional investment option. With its smart contract security, portfolio automation , and MVP crypto wallet management app, it has positioned itself as a leader in digital asset management poised for an 80,000% surge.

Ethereum Prices Fall & Chainlink Rally Faces Uncertainty,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-draws-attention-with-a-350-bonus-ethereum-prices-fall-chainlink-rally-faces-uncertainty/,"Ethereum’s (ETH) price has plummeted due to various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory updates, market manipulation, and global events impacting the cryptocurrency market. Not only has the Ethereum price been affected—Chainlink is also experiencing declines. However, Chainlink has formed a partnership with a notable stablecoin issuer which could potentially lead to a Chainlink rally. As participants seek out promising coins, BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as a notable contender, offering a substantial 350% bonus on BDAG acquisitions. This offer represents a unique chance in the current market climate. Despite the downturn in Ethereum prices, BlockDAG continues to attract attention, remaining stable amidst market volatility. With $193.5 million already raised in its ongoing presale and a 2380% price increase, BDAG is positioning itself as a leading coin for 2025. Ethereum Price Suffers Amidst Market Volatility In the last 24 hours, the Ethereum price has faced significant losses, with its trading volume decreasing by 27.68% to $57.61 billion. This reduction highlights the numerous factors that influence the Ethereum price, including market dynamics, geopolitical issues, celebrity endorsements, and market manipulations. Community sentiment plays a critical role, and even events like token burning can sway the market’s direction. The current technical indicators are not favorable for the Ethereum price, showing signs of a downward trend. If these indicators persist, traders might begin shorting their positions, potentially triggering a broader sell-off. Chainlink Partners with Usual—Potential for a Chainlink Rally? Many coins employ various strategies to recover after significant losses. Chainlink has partnered with Usual, a major stablecoin issuer overseeing over $1.2 billion in assets, in hopes of sparking a Chainlink rally. This partnership allows Usual-stablecoins USD0 and USD0++ to utilize Chainlink’s infrastructure, including Price Feeds, Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and Proof of Reserve, enhancing the security and transparency of Usual’s ecosystem. This strategic alliance could pave the way for a Chainlink rally, although it remains uncertain whether a partnership alone can initiate such a movement. BlockDAG’s Final Call Campaign Captures Global Attention BlockDAG’s “FINALCALL700” campaign is quickly becoming the buzz of the cryptocurrency world. This unprecedented 350% bonus marks the most significant promotion in BlockDAG’s history, serving as a token of gratitude towards its dedicated community and early supporters for their steadfast commitment to the project. Initially priced at $0.001, BDAG has seen a significant rise to $0.0248, with predictions pointing towards further increases as demand continues to grow. Market experts anticipate that BDAG will reach $20 by 2027 after raising over $193.5 million and distributing 18.3 billion coins. As news of BlockDAG’s extraordinary bonus offer spreads, a global rush of buyers is emerging, eager to enhance their holdings by purchasing BDAG at its current low price. BlockDAG is committed to rewarding both new and early participants fairly, creating an even playing field. With the current promotional wave, the rapid sale of batch 27 seems inevitable, suggesting a swift uptake in the presale and a continued surge in BDAG’s market value. Navigating Market Instability with Promising Opportunities Amid the ongoing turmoil in the cryptocurrency market, where uncertainty and skepticism prevail, certain coins are feeling the pressure. Ethereum is battling to regain its footing, supported by a dedicated base of long-term holders. Meanwhile, LINK is collaborating with notable stablecoin issuer Usual in an effort to stabilize its position. In contrast, BlockDAG is navigating these turbulent times with remarkable steadiness. The opportunity to claim a 350% bonus on BDAG purchases through the “FINALCALL700” code offers a unique chance for participants to secure one of the top crypto coins for 2025, even as the market faces ongoing challenges.

40171661,https://coingape.com/?p=238252,1739232157,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Grayscale Files For Cardano ETF With NYSE as Race Heats Up,https://coingape.com/grayscale-files-for-cardano-etf-with-nyse-as-race-heats-up/,"Grayscale Investments has submitted an application to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for a Cardano exchange-traded fund (ETF). This marks a step in the growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. The move is part of the company’s strategy to expand its crypto ETF offerings, following its recent filings for XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs. The Cardano ETF filing adds to the increasing list of institutional moves aiming to provide regulated exposure to popular cryptos. Grayscale Joins Race with Cardano ETF Application to NYSE In a recent filing , Grayscale submitted its proposal for a Cardano ETF with the NYSE, further diversifying its crypto offerings. The filing comes as part of a larger push by Grayscale to expand its presence in the growing cryptocurrency market. The firm has already filed similar ETF applications for other popular cryptos, such as XRP, Solana, and Litecoin. With the increasing institutional interest in digital assets, this move is a significant step toward regulated exposure for institutional investors seeking access to Cardano. Grayscale’s Cardano ETF application comes when institutional interest in cryptocurrency is expanding. With Cardano (ADA) becoming one of the top-performing assets, this ETF could offer a regulated route for traditional investors to gain ADA exposure. The Cardano network has gained substantial recognition for its focus on scalability, security, and sustainability, factors that appeal to investors. Moreso, these developments come when the US SEC seeks public comments on Grayscale’s Litecoin ETF proposal, allowing for a 21-day submission period. Litecoin ETFs are gaining attention as the SEC assesses Grayscale’s request to convert its Litecoin Trust into an exchange-traded product. Recently, asset managers like Grayscale and Coinshares have taken steps to expand crypto ETF offerings, signaling growing interest. Competition in the Crypto ETF Space Grayscale’s filing is part of a trend in the crypto market, where multiple asset managers are vying to offer ETFs linked to popular digital assets. Recently, other firms, including WisdomTree and Bitwise, have submitted similar applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for XRP ETFs. Additionally, Swedish asset manager Virtune AB launched a Cardano exchange-traded product (ETP) on Nasdaq Helsinki, catering to institutional investors. As the market continues to mature, more financial institutions are exploring the idea of crypto ETFs, especially for major cryptos like Cardano. The introduction of a Cardano ETF by Grayscale will provide more opportunities for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with ADA exposure. Impact on Cardano Price The introduction of a Cardano ETF could have a significant effect on ADA price and market sentiment. As more institutional investors gain exposure to Cardano, increased demand could lead to upward pressure on ADA price. Currently, the ADA remains relatively stable, but the potential for more institutional capital entering the space through an ETF could cause a rise in its price. In addition, if Cardano price holds above the $0.67–$0.81 support range, it could signal strength and set the stage for an ADA price rally . Technical indicators, including the TD Sequential buy signal, further support the possibility of a bullish reversal. However, if Cardano price fails to maintain this support, a drop below the range will lead to further declines. At the time of writing, Cardano price stands at $0.7068, reflecting a 3% increase in the past 24 hours. The market cap has risen to $24.87B, and the trading volume is up by 11.15%, reaching $752.82M.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Wall Street Pepe has officially sold out its presale, while Pepeto emerges as the next big meme coin contender. Table of Contents Pepeto’s rise: The God of Frogs set to take over Pepeto’s exchange and cross-chain bridge Pepeto landing a Binance listing Conclusion Two major players have risen in the ongoing meme coin frenzy: Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) and Pepeto (PEPETO). While both projects bring distinct value to the market, Pepeto now holds a strategic advantage as its presale remains open, presenting a prime opportunity for early investors. Wall Street Pepe, which aims to empower smaller traders with trading signals, alpha calls, and staking rewards, has successfully sold out its presale, with an official exchange listing soon to be announced. The demand for WEPE signals strong market interest, but new investors must now wait for its official debut on exchanges. Pepeto’s rise: The God of Frogs set to take over Dubbed the “God of Frogs,” Pepeto is setting itself apart with a powerful ecosystem, deep narrative appeal, and transformative utilities. Currently priced at $0.000000109 per token, PEPETO remains one of the most affordable and high-upside opportunities in the meme coin market . Key features driving its momentum include: Zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap – Eliminating transaction costs for meme coin traders. A cutting-edge cross-chain bridge – Enhancing interoperability and reducing friction between networks. Staking rewards at 387% APY – Providing lucrative incentives for long-term holders. With a thriving community of over 65,600 supporters and growing daily, PEPETO is capturing global attention. Its strong narrative, real-world use case, and bullish sentiment are fueling speculation that it could become one of the biggest meme coin success stories of 2025. You might also like: Pepeto hits $4m in presale, emerges as next big meme coin to watch Pepeto’s exchange and cross-chain bridge The anticipation surrounding PepetoSwap, a zero-fee exchange built for meme coin traders, is reaching new heights. Designed to solve key market inefficiencies such as high fees and fragmented liquidity, PepetoSwap is expected to set a new standard for seamless trading experiences. Additionally, Pepeto’s cross-chain bridge technology aims to redefine blockchain connectivity by allowing users to transfer assets effortlessly across networks. These developments not only strengthen Pepeto’s long-term potential but also reinforce its position as a leader in the evolving meme coin landscape. As the presale nears its conclusion, excitement around these utilities is at an all-time high. With the next crypto bull run on the horizon, PEPETO is emerging as one of the most promising contenders in the meme coin market. Pepeto landing a Binance listing While Wall Street Pepe eyes listings on exchanges like BingX, Gate.io, and MEXC, Pepeto’s combination of utility, price advantage, and market momentum has positioned it as a prime candidate for a Binance listing. Adding to the intrigue, rumors are swirling that an ex-founder of Pepe is involved with Pepeto, drawing further comparisons between the two projects. Given that PEPETO mirrors Pepe’s iconic 420T token supply, speculation continues to mount that a Binance listing could be in its future. Conclusion As the crypto world watches for the next breakout project, all eyes are on Pepeto as a top contender for Binance’s next meme coin listing. The countdown to the next major exchange listing has begun. To learn more about Pepeto, visit the website , Twitter , or Telegram .

Waters unveils bipartisan stablecoin bill ahead of House subcommittee hearing,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/waters-unveils-bipartisan-stablecoin-bill/,"Ranking member of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters has released proposed stablecoin legislation she and her colleague Patrick McHenry drafted during the previous session of Congress. She unveiled the bill on Feb. 10, the day before the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Asset, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence is scheduled to meet. The Waters-McHenry bill does not have a name yet. The lawmakers prepared the bill as a bipartisan team and had hoped it could be considered by the 118th Congress. McHenry retired as chair of the committee at the end of the congressional session. The bill is not what the committee is waiting for A press release from the Financial Services Committee Democrats said the bill created a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. It prevents non-financial commercial companies from issuing stablecoins and imposes restrictions. In addition, it includes consumer protections. The bill also “protects the existing authorities of the Treasury, CFPB, SEC, and CFTC with respect to any entity covered by the Act.” This is problematic, as the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) is under fire from the new administration. At the time of writing, that agency’s homepage displays a 404:Page Not Found error message. Water’s goal in releasing the draft bill is not immediately evident. The agenda for the Feb. 11 Financial Services subcommittee meeting includes a discussion of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, but not the Waters-McHenry bill. The Senate has the GENIUS Act on stablecoins The STABLE Act, authored by Republicans French Hill and Bryan Steil, was released on Feb. 7. A press release from the Financial Services Committee said it builds on McHenry’s efforts. Hill is now the chair of the committee and Steil is the chair of the digital assets subcommittee. The committee promised in its press release to work with Senate members in the Bicameral Working Group on Digital Assets to pass stablecoin legislation. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS Act) was introduced into the Senate on Feb. 4. The Senate bill was drafted by Bill Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Democratic Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis.

The strongest candidate for the next string of ETF approvals is, apparently, Litecoin—the experts note its favorable regulatory standing, which CFTC cleared out in its KuCoin lawsuit. The commodity status distinguishes the fork of Bitcoin (often referred to as the ”silver” to Bitcoin's “gold”) from assets that could be potentially considered unregistered securities. Meanwhile, much to the dismay of its ironclad fanbase, XRP has the lowest chance (65%) of approval, according to analysts, trailing behind Litecoin (90%), Dogecoin (75%), and Solana (70%). Balchunas noted that for their predictions, they only considered ETF filings structured similarly to BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which operates under the '33 Act framework. However, should the SEC greenlight the initial applications, the alternative ETF formats—such as those based on futures contracts or Cayman Islands subsidiaries regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940—could also have a path to approval. “Keep in mind all of this stuff (except Litecoin which was always high) was True to their name, some members of XRPArmy chimed in to defend their favorite coin against FUD, arguing against the “NO” put for XRP under the header “Does SEC currently view as commodity?”. A Twitter/X user @OnChainMayo pointed out that while the SEC appealed the decision in favor of Ripple, it didn’t contest the XRP status as a commodity. In response, Seyffart clarified that until all litigation between SEC and Ripple is settled, the prospect of XRP ETF will remain a far-off goal. Although the 19b-4 filings for DOGE and XRP will likely be acknowledged already this week, any meaningful development would have to wait until the end of 2025, when the SEC and Commissioner Heaster Peirce's Crypto task force are expected to start clearing the backlog of security vs commodity lawsuits left by previous leadership. On Monday, NASDAQ formally filed 19b-4 forms for Coinshares’ XRP and Litecoin ETFs, following the same filing from Cboe last week for spot XRP exchange-traded funds managed by WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary. For a crypto ETF to launch in the US, two key approvals are typically required: S-1 and 19b-4. The S-1 is a registration statement filed by the ETF issuer to register the fund with the SEC, while the 19b-4 is submitted by the exchange seeking permission to list and trade the product. Once the 19b-4 is submitted, the SEC must formally acknowledge the filing and publish it in the Federal Register. This marks the start of a public comment period, during which industry stakeholders and the public can provide feedback. After the comment period, the SEC has up to 240 days to review the application and decide whether to approve or reject it.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BTC|BTG|LTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-11 00:21:57

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Big money is shifting from DOGE and SHIB to RCO Finance, as its DeFi model attracts over $13 million in investments. Table of Contents Dogecoin: Still holding meme coin credibility Shiba Inu: From underdog to household name RCO Finance: An AI-powered alternative Conclusion Big money is flowing in unexpected directions. After years of hype around Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), a wave of traders is setting their sights on RCO Finance (RCOF). With the token priced at $0.1, a colossal breakout may be on the horizon. Market participants recall how Dogecoin turned small bets into fortunes during its heyday, while Shiba Inu shocked the crypto world with sudden, viral growth. Now, cracks in the meme-coin model are prompting a shift toward advanced tools and analytics. Against this backdrop, investors have funneled over $13 million into the new contender. Dogecoin: Still holding meme coin credibility No discussion of meme coins is complete without mentioning Dogecoin , which soared from fractions of a cent to nearly a dollar. Its spirited community and endorsement by high-profile figures drew millions of newcomers into the crypto space. However, the coin’s price has stalled well below its all-time high. Some observers argue it relies too heavily on cultural moments and viral social media bursts. While it continues to rank among the top digital assets, with a market cap of $37.89 billion, long-term investors yearn for a more reliable growth path. Shiba Inu: From underdog to household name If Dogecoin is the original meme coin juggernaut, Shiba Inu is its most famous protégé. Billed as the “Dogecoin killer,” it transformed investments into life-changing sums for those who got in at the right time. Its rapid ascent and playful branding made it a social media star, dominating headlines and amassing a loyal global following. Shiba Inu claims a multi-billion-dollar market cap, yet volumes rarely breach the billion-dollar mark. Ecosystem additions like decentralized exchanges and NFTs have helped sustain momentum, but the token hasn’t matched its previous meteoric spikes. That’s left many holders pondering whether the coin’s glory days are behind it — or if a second renaissance is still possible. You might also like: DOGE hints at ascending triangle formation, this alternative eyes a rally RCO Finance: An AI-powered alternative RCO Finance is an emerging force in decentralized finance. Priced at $0.1, its token has already attracted over $13 million in backing, spurring curiosity about whether it can deliver a massive rally. But RCO Finance is no ordinary project. A non-KYC DeFi hub, it will let users buy stocks, bonds, and even real estate directly with cryptocurrency, bypassing cumbersome fiat steps. This practical integration of traditional and digital assets sets it apart. Core to RCO Finance’s appeal is the Robo Advisor, a machine learning engine that aggregates market signals from Bloomberg and Reuters, along with on-chain analytics and social media sentiment. The Robo Advisor emphasizes data accuracy and timing. It excels in spotting breakout tokens early, advising users when to mitigate risk, and prompting them to take profits when momentum cools. A striking example would be the Newton Project (NEW), which jumped from $0.0018 to $0.0127 — a 5,470% leap. By sifting through global news feeds, RCO Finance aims to give traders a head start on similar trends. The platform’s emphasis on user control is evident in its beta platform , which lets participants test advanced features before the full release. A SolidProof audit confirms the code’s security, giving large-scale investors and retail participants a sense of reliability. Conclusion RCO Finance’s approach aligns with a maturing crypto environment where data matters more. With its token at $0.1 and upward of $13 million raised, RCO Finance has proven it can draw big money from all market corners. The current buzz suggests this might be the beginning of a longer, potentially explosive chapter in the crypto’s evolving story.

As of today, BTC’s price has steadily climbed, hovering above $97,000 at the time of writing—a 1.3% gain in the past day. Amid this Bitcoin price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Lion has identified a meaningful decline in leverage and open interest (OI) ratios since November 21, following the presidential election. What does this indicate for the Bitcoin market? Related Reading: Could Fear Fuel Bitcoin’s Comeback? Analyst Spots a Surprising Pattern Leverage Ratio Decrease And Its Implications In a recent QuickTake post titled “Leverage ratio decreased. Risk Off,” Crypto Lion explained that the leverage ratio of Bitcoin has fallen, along with the derivatives buy-sell ratio and the OI-to-market-cap ratio. This suggests a gradual unwinding of leverage as more Bitcoin leaves centralized exchanges (CEXs). The analyst also highlighted that much of this Bitcoin has shifted to Coinbase Prime or been used to back exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating a shift toward long-term holding and possibly a broader “risk-off” stance among large investors. The analyst particularly wrote: The large decrease in the leverage ratio means that OI is decreasing relative to the CEX BTC reserve. It is important to note that the CEX reserve has been declining for a long time and has been moved to the coinbase prime and bought to back ETFs. This means that risk-off may be more advanced than it appears. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach 2022 Levels Adding to this narrative, another CryptoQuant analyst, Papi, reported a significant development in Bitcoin’s exchange dynamics. According to Papi, the largest net outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges since 2022 occurred last week, reducing the supply of Bitcoin on these platforms by 3%. The last time outflows reached a comparable scale was shortly after the collapse of FTX, a major exchange event that reshaped market sentiment. This latest exodus of Bitcoin from exchanges may signal growing confidence among institutional players and long-term holders. Despite recent price fluctuations, large buyers appear to be “stacking on dips,” as Papi noted. This behavior suggests that these entities anticipate future price appreciation and are accumulating while prices remain comparatively low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Signals Short-Term Holders Have Been Taking Profits – Is The Next Rally Near? The shift of funds off exchanges into private wallets or institutional custody often reflects a strategy of long-term holding rather than short-term trading, potentially providing a stable foundation for future market growth. Looking ahead, the reduced leverage ratios, coupled with significant outflows from exchanges, could point to a more cautious yet optimistic market sentiment. If these patterns continue, they may set the stage for a more sustained recovery in Bitcoin’s price and a shift toward healthier market conditions over time.

According to data insight from Santiment, Layer-1 networks have collectively seeing 44.2% of social discussions on specific coins. This shift, the analytics firm imply might mean a potential return to the bull era. Bitcoin, Toncoin and L1 Protocols Back In Limelight According to Santiment on X , memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and PEPE are currently being discussed less in the market. The platform attributed this shift to the recent volatility that pushed the dominance of speculative altcoin price behind. The data giant acknowledged that Bitcoin and L1s like Ethereum and Toncoin are the foundational infrastructure in the industry. It noted that the increased focus on these assets by traders often signals market maturity. It hinted that an L1 focus is a sign investors are prioritizing security, innovation and real world adoption. Per the Santiment insight, memecoin frenzies generally come before the market falls. Historically, it noted that speculative excesses often lead to sharp reversal when the hype has faded. However, it pointed out that this shift implies a more balanced market will emerge once the excessive leverage bets are wiped off. Is Bitcoin, Toncoin and L1s Ready for Rally? According to the Santiment projection, a shift away from memecoin is proof that the market might be tilting toward sustainable trends. It confirmed that the gambling mindset associated with memecoins is paving the way for better fundamentals. This forecast aligns with speculations from analysts that the altcoin selling will stop soon, paving the way for rapid rebound. As of writing, BTC price was changing hands for $97,380.20, up 1.81% in 24 hours. The sentiment has also trickled down to Ethereum, Toncoin, and Cardano. These altcoins are up 1.44%, 0.56% and 3.30% to $2,668, $3.806 and $0.7172 respectively. While it remains unclear whether the bull run is finally return, Santiment is optimistic the market is in a healthy cool-down period. Altcoins With ETF In Spotlight Altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin are in the spotlight owing to the growing push for spot ETFs to track their prices. As reported earlier by CoinGape, Grayscale has filed for Cardano ETF with the US SEC. The growing number of crypto ETF applications has signaled that a massive adoption era is on enroute.

The market risks from AI and crypto have not stopped these traders from continuing to pile into leveraged funds to make trading gains in stocks such as Microsoft, Tesla, and semiconductor companies. Retail traders drive surge in leveraged tech and crypto ETFs As of last week, assets in long equity leveraged ETFs stood at about $95 billion. These funds, designed to magnify stock movements by two or three times, have outpaced their bearish counterparts, which collectively hold just $9 billion. Athanasios Psarofagis, an ETF analyst, said the market is extremely attractive for ‘degen traders’ as ETF investors see the nearly euphoric sentiment, a constant ‘buy the dip’ approach and a record number of leveraged products. These traders generally pursue high-risk and leveraged investments. The leveraged ETFs that focus on technology have been particularly positive. The MSFU and SOXL from Direxion Daily have both seen back-to-back weeks of inflows. The TSLL also saw its net asset growth over the past ten weeks, which hasn’t been seen since 2023. The link between cryptocurrency and ETFs has also witnessed a strong rebound in retail participation. The 2X Ether ETF (ETHU) saw its highest weekly inflows after a drop in the price of Ether. The fund’s retail trading was triggered by a social media promotion from Eric Trump, and the fund saw the highest cash inflows to date. Analysts raise concerns over leveraged ETFs amid rising speculation There are concerns about the sustainability of leveraged ETFs. These funds are usually meant for short-term traders because high-frequency trading products can result in substantial tracking errors over extended periods. Therefore, some individuals may be using these products the wrong way and lose a lot of money in the current volatile markets. “The speculation is there,” noted Jim Chanos, founder of Chanos & Co., in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Not quite where it was in 2021 — which was the most speculative market I have seen — but it is getting back there.” The dominance of long-leveraged ETFs in the market is evidence that retail traders are still positive about the market. As long as tech firms’ earnings keep on growing and monetary policy remains lax, the speculative frenzy may not subside. However, not all leveraged ETFs have been enrolled in the boom. NVDL, the Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 1.5X Shares, lost clients last week after Direxion’s fund had attracted a record rise the week before. Indeed, Direxion’s fund on the opposite side of AI and big data (AIBD) has also fared poorly and has built assets of less than $2 million over the last nine months.

Crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 124,300 followers on the social media platform X that Solana appears to be trading in an ascending channel – a pattern suggesting that an asset is in an uptrend. According to Martinez, Solana seems to be holding the diagonal support of the pattern, indicating that a rise to the top end of the channel is on the table. “Solana SOL is testing a key support level at the lower boundary of this parallel channel.

Looking at Solana’s on-chain activities, Martinez notes that the network is seeing strong adoption. “The Solana SOL network is expanding at a strong pace, with over 5 million new addresses created per day!” Source: Ali Martinez/X As for Bitcoin, Martinez says that more than $6.794 billion worth of BTC have been taken out of crypto exchanges in the last seven days. “Over 70,000 Bitcoin BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past week, signaling long-term confidence!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,932.

Ethereum (ETH) price action has been a hot topic, with the asset trading around $2,610 after a recent drop. Analysts are eyeing a bullish breakout, with a four-year ascending triangle pattern pointing to a potential $7,500 target. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price has shown resilience, with a 5,277% surge in large-holder netflows hinting at growing accumulation. Despite this, the burn rate has slowed, and trading volume has dipped, raising questions about its short-term momentum. While traders navigate these shifts, Web3Bay is turning heads in the web3 crypto space. Its 3BAY token isn’t just another presale—it’s a gateway to real e-commerce utility. With rewards for both buyers and sellers, early supporters have a chance to secure a strong position before prices climb higher. Web3 Crypto Shopping: How Web3Bay Rewards Buyers and Sellers Web3Bay is setting up a new way to buy and sell online, and its 3BAY token is at the center of it. Unlike traditional platforms that take a cut from every sale, Web3Bay removes middlemen, lowers costs, and gives back to users. Sellers keep more of their profits, while buyers get better prices—all powered by blockchain and smart contracts. The 3BAY token is more than just a payment method; it’s a reward system that benefits both sides. Users can earn discounts, cashback, and governance rights, letting them have a say in how the platform develops. The Web3Bay presale is quickly gaining momentum, with over 280 million tokens sold and $1.1 million raised so far. Right now, 3BAY is priced at $0.004562625, with higher price stages ahead before its final launch price of $0.1959. Early supporters stand to benefit from these increases, locking in their position before demand drives prices higher. This isn’t just another web3 crypto presale—it’s a real utility token tied to a working e-commerce model that’s built for long-term growth. Web3Bay is offering a more direct way to use crypto. With flexible payment options—including both crypto and traditional methods like PayPal (planned integration)—the platform makes it easy for anyone to participate. This isn’t just another speculative token; it’s changing how online shopping works. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action Signals a Big Move Ahead Ethereum (ETH) price action has been unpredictable, with the asset trading around $2,610 after a recent pullback. Analysts are watching a four-year ascending triangle pattern, which suggests a potential breakout to $7,500. If this structure holds, Ethereum could see a strong upward move. At the same time, the SEC’s delay on Ethereum ETFs has kept market sentiment uncertain. However, more than 50% of Ethereum validators support a gas limit increase, which could improve network efficiency and lower fees. Despite short-term volatility, Ethereum remains a key player in the market, with increasing adoption and developer activity. While traders focus on price levels, long-term holders see Ethereum’s growing use case in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts as reasons to stay confident. If momentum picks up, ETH could be gearing up for its next major run. Shiba Inu Price Sees Big Holder Moves While Burn Rate Slows Shiba Inu price has been showing mixed signals, with a 5,277% surge in large holder netflows pointing to increased accumulation. This suggests that major wallets are stocking up, which could set the stage for future price moves. At the same time, a whale transaction of 3.36 trillion SHIB tokens ($51.15 million) has raised speculation about market activity. Despite this buying pressure, trading volume has dropped below $400 million, and the burn rate has slowed by 61%, signaling a potential cooling-off period. While traders focus on Ethereum (ETH) price action, Shiba Inu continues to rely on community strength and long-term utility development. However, with the top 10 wallets controlling 61.3% of SHIB supply, the risk of volatility remains. If accumulation continues, SHIB could see stronger momentum ahead. Summing Up Ethereum (ETH) price action is showing signs of a potential breakout, with analysts watching a $7,500 target while network upgrades could improve efficiency. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price has seen major accumulation from large holders, but its burn rate slowdown raises questions about its next move. Both assets remain closely followed, with traders looking for momentum shifts. While these established tokens navigate market shifts, Web3Bay is offering something different. The web3 crypto project isn’t just about speculation—it’s building a decentralized e-commerce ecosystem where buyers and sellers earn real rewards. With over 280 million tokens sold and $1.1M raised, the 3BAY token is positioning itself for strong growth. As presale prices rise toward $0.1959, early supporters have a chance to lock in lower prices before demand increases.

However, this savvy analyst concludes that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token has a greater potential to deliver a 100x surge much sooner. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The DeFi Vanguard Set to Deliver 100x Returns The WallitIQ (WLTQ) token’s position is well-established in the crypto space as a valuable asset with immense utility and potential for massive price increases. The token’s extensive utility is recognized globally among investors, offering passive income opportunities to those who buy and stake them to earn up to 180% APY. Moreover, the token is usable for paying transaction fees, curbing the hassle of converting other cryptocurrencies. Governance participation further boosts token holders, allowing them to impact the platform’s evolution and guaranteeing its development aligns with investor interests. Experts’ verified analysis projects that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is in line for an astonishing 100x price surge. This means that if the token, currently available in the presale at $0.0420, reaches its target, early investors could witness life-altering gains. Picture yourself investing $1,000 today; at the projected 100x value, you could potentially earn $100,000 in profits. The same goes for a $10,000 stake; the potential ROI is $1 million, and $100,000 worth of the token could result in returns exceeding $10 million only if you seize the opportunity now, before the imminent launch of the beta platform. Beyond ROIs, investors are signing up to the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform for its top-of-the-line security features like the Push Protocol technology that delivers real-time on-chain notifications, maintaining the transparency and security of every transaction. The platform also features Physical 2 Digital (P2D) technology that allows users to easily integrate physical assets, such as collectibles, with digital tokens. By bridging physical and digital finance, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform significantly broadens the scope of DeFi and tokenized assets. This blend of the physical and digital positions the platform in an area that few other projects have approached. Additionally, its CoinMarketCap listing and SolidProof smart contract audit add gloss to its reputation as a transparent platform. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform also makes provision for users to access live market data through the CoinGecko API integrated into the crypto wallet management mobile app. The app offers comprehensive real-time sentiment analysis and advanced biometric authentication. This real-world utility and a fast-selling presale provide more than enough incentive for you to jump at the discounted price of $ 0.0420 and acquire as many tokens as you’d expect to benefit from ahead of the anticipated 100x rally. Dogecoin Price: Will DOGE’s Potential Rebound Sustain? In recent days, the Dogecoin price has experienced a sharp move to the upside, sending DOGE to new heights. However, many experts caution that such Dogecoin price movements may be short-lived. The volatility of the Dogecoin price, driven primarily by speculative trading and social media hype, raises questions about its long-term sustainability. While DOGE once enjoyed monumental gains, its future prospects appear increasingly uncertain as market fundamentals shift. DOGE faithfuls watching the Dogecoin price must consider whether the current surge is temporal or a precursor to lasting growth. As the Dogecoin price shows signs of overextension, many DOGE investors are reevaluating their portfolios and seeking safer, more rewarding alternatives. Conclusion: Get 100x ROI Faster With WallitIQ (WLTQ) While the Dogecoin price rally is sparking momentary enthusiasm, the underlying fundamentals of DOGE may not support sustained, long-term gains. In contrast, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is emerging as the definitive altcoin for forward-thinking investors. With its advanced AI-driven technology, intuitive multi-asset management , and competitive staking rewards, the valuable token is set to deliver a 100x surge that could transform modest investments into life-changing fortunes.

However, Dogecoin (DOGE) has captured the spotlight with its meme-driven popularity, and a new AI crypto is set to make a far more significant impact. WallitIQ (WLTQ) —an innovative, AI-driven platform that promises to redefine the future of digital assets. Dogecoin’s $5 Ambition? Experts Predict DOGE Won’t Make It Dogecoin (DOGE) has sparked much speculation, with some enthusiasts hoping it will reach $5. However, experts caution that such a goal seems unrealistic. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at around $0.26, and reaching $5 would require an increase of 610% to 1,082%, a level rarely seen in the crypto market. Experts note that Dogecoin’s (DOGE) speculative nature and lack of tangible utility make this target even more difficult. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks strong use cases or institutional adoption, limiting its growth potential. Additionally, broader market conditions and Bitcoin’s performance may impact Dogecoin’s (DOGE) future. As experts suggest, the dream of Dogecoin (DOGE) reaching $5 remains unlikely, making it a risky bet for long-term investors.

Well turns out it is a logjam of confirmation hearings. The Senate has nine cabinet members in line ahead of Atkins, and no one knows exactly when his turn will come. His hearing before the Senate Banking Committee hasn’t even been scheduled. Until it is, nothing moves forward, and the full Senate vote remains out of reach. The wait is becoming a problem for Trump’s crypto-friendly agenda, which can’t hit full throttle without Atkins at the wheel. Gary Gensler, former president Biden’s anti-crypto SEC chair, also had to wait, as he was nominated in January 2021 but didn’t get Senate confirmation until April. Jay Clayton, who served during Trump’s first term, wasn’t confirmed until May 2017, despite also being nominated in January that year. History is repeating itself, but this time, the stakes for the crypto industry are much higher. Hester Peirce leads the SEC’s crypto reset amid delays In the meantime, Hester Peirce is holding the line. Known as “Crypto Mom” in the community, Hester is now in charge of the SEC’s newly formed crypto task force , which is on a mission to repair the damage done under Gary’s leadership. “It took us a long time to get into this mess, and it is going to take us some time to get out of it,” Hester wrote. She is of course referring to the chaos left by Gensler, who spent much of his tenure suing major crypto firms instead of providing clear rules. The former SEC chair repeatedly said that most digital assets qualified as securities, leaving companies guessing what would trigger a lawsuit. Hester criticized this “regulation by enforcement” approach, promising that the task force would take a different approach. “The crypto road trip on which the newly announced crypto task force has embarked likewise should be more enjoyable and less risky than the crypto road trip the Commission has taken the industry on for the last decade,” Hester wrote. President Trump campaigned on promises of deregulation, and he even launched his own Solana-based meme coin before taking office on Jan. 20. The very next day on Jan. 21, Trump signed an executive order for a digital asset stockpile. Crypto’s hero, Wall Street’s hero Meanwhile, on the other side, Wall Street’s waiting for a savior to breathe life back into the sluggish IPO market, and they think Atkins might be the guy. President Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has investors hoping for fewer rules, fewer headaches, and a wave of new stock-market debuts. Under Gary Gensler, bankers felt like they were drowning in regulations. Gary loved enforcement actions over there too and pushed for stricter rules on corporate disclosures, which Wall Street blamed for choking off IPOs. Now, with Atkins—who served on the SEC under George W. Bush—potentially taking over, the industry is betting on a more business-friendly approach. If confirmed, Atkins is expected to review key banking regulations passed during the Biden era, potentially rolling back policies that companies view as obstacles to going public. But even Atkins can’t fix everything. Wild stock market swings, like those seen in Trump’s first week back in office, make it tough for companies to pin down their valuations. IPOs hate uncertainty. The bigger problem though is that many companies are staying private longer because they have access to insane amounts of private capital. On top of that, public listings come with expensive regulations and the risk of lawsuits. The Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes during the pandemic didn’t help either, slamming the brakes on new listings. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda admitted in January that some of the rules passed over the past four years have added burdens that could “negatively affect companies’ willingness to go public.” Atkins might be tasked with cleaning up that mess. Atkins hasn’t laid out any concrete plans for the SEC yet, but some insiders are expecting his confirmation to happen this month. But even if he does get confirmed, he likely won’t step into the role until March. He has already pointed out key problems making public markets less attractive. “One is the cost of regulation and two, other things like the fear of litigation,” Atkins famously said in a 2017 Bloomberg TV interview.

It allows people to send money directly to each other without banks or middlemen. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin uses a network of computers to keep track of transactions in a shared ledger called the blockchain. Miners confirm these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They get rewarded with new bitcoins for their efforts. This process ensures that the system is secure and resistant to fraud. Every four years, the rewards for mining are cut in half in an event called “halving,” which controls the supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. Today, Bitcoin is seen by many as digital gold. Its potential lies in its ability to provide a global, decentralized financial system. Investors find it attractive due to its limited supply and increasing mainstream adoption. Others point out challenges like price swings and competition from newer coins. Conclusion While established coins like BTC perform well, XYZ unites sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem, aiming for 20,000% growth in this bull run.

The investment is part of the European country’s plan to become a competitive hub for AI development, just as the US is currently. Macron announced the news during a two-day artificial intelligence summit which took place in Paris. Key investors were from private and public sectors The deal includes a mix of new and previously announced investments from Amazon.com Inc., Brookfield Asset Management, and Apollo Global Management Inc. A significant portion of the funding also comes from the United Arab Emirates, which is committing €50 billion ($51 million), according to officials in Macron’s office. Since ChatGPT’s launch over two years ago, countries have struggled to outdo each other as they race towards becoming AI superpowers. Tech firms have also invested billions in the various industries that make AI computing possible. These include computer chips, data centers, and energy projects that support building more advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, while the rest of the world is embracing AI and making new waves, Macron and some others are worried Europe, which responded to the birth of AI with caution and regulation that stifled growth, is lagging behind the US and China on AI development. More investment plans involving France Macron’s latest announcement highlights France’s commitment to advancing AI technology. He likened the scale of the AI investment in France to Donald Trump’s Stargate announcement. The joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. will commit about $500 billion to AI infrastructure over the next four years. That amount is almost x5 the total investment touted by Macron. Nearly half of the funds announced by Macron will come from the UAE, which previously had an agreement to invest between €30 billion and €50 billion, according to what the officials said. Emirati ruler Mohamed bin Zayed reportedly promised Macron over dinner last week to spend €50 billion. Meanwhile Brookfield said Sunday that it also plans to invest €20 billion to develop data centers and AI infrastructure in France over the next five years. Other investments include €5 billion from Apollo to boost energy connectivity, €5 billion from US-based Digital Realty to build data centers, and €10 billion for UK company Fluidstack to put together a supercomputer. Amazon is also one of the companies investing in France’s AI pursuit. It plans to invest €6 billion to create a data center and work on cloud infrastructure, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The e-commerce platform announced plans last year to invest more than €1.2 billion in the development of its cloud infrastructure services in France by 2031. This is part of the €6 billion from Amazon, the officials have said. The AI projects mentioned above are expected to be developed over the next two to five years. If President Emmanuel Macron’s initiative works, in the coming years, France could emerge as a leading destination for AI development, fostering both domestic and international collaboration in the sector.

Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum MAGACOINOFFICIAL is generating. Don’t Miss Out on MAGACOINOFFICIAL The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but MAGACOINOFFICIAL might just be that opportunity.

Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that charge high fees and limit user control, Web3Bay runs on blockchain, cutting out unnecessary costs and giving buyers and sellers more freedom. Holding 3BAY isn’t just about transactions—it’s about unlocking real perks like lower fees, access to exclusive deals, and future staking rewards. This shift could redefine online shopping, giving users more control over their purchases while earning along the way. One of the biggest advantages of 3BAY is its governance power. Instead of being stuck with platform rules set by corporations, users can vote on decisions that shape Web3Bay’s future. Whether it’s deciding on new features or platform fees, 3BAY holders have a say, making it a real Web3 crypto marketplace where users influence its direction. This is a major difference from centralized platforms, where users have little control over policy changes. With XRP value being watched closely for its role in digital payments, Web3Bay is showing how blockchain can be used beyond just trading. The 3BAY token makes online shopping cheaper and more rewarding while giving users more influence over the platform. As the demand for decentralized commerce grows, Web3Bay has raised more than $1.1 million and is currently seeing its 4th stage selling out in record time. Web3Bay tokens are priced at $0.004562. The project is positioning itself as the go-to marketplace for blockchain-powered shopping in 2025. XRP Value Gains Attention as ETF Hopes Rise XRP value is in the spotlight as discussions around an XRP-spot ETF heat up. With the price hovering around $2.40, analysts are watching how potential regulatory approvals could impact demand. The introduction of XRP Depository Receipts (DRs) is already making it easier for institutional players to gain exposure to XRP without buying directly from exchanges. If an ETF gets approved, it could drive even more adoption, similar to what happened with Bitcoin’s ETFs. Beyond market speculation, XRP’s legal battle with the SEC continues to see major shifts. A recent leadership change in the SEC’s legal team has fueled speculation about a resolution. At the same time, European markets have launched XRP-backed investment products, further expanding its accessibility. With all these developments, XRP’s next moves could be game-changing for its long-term value. Solana ETF Speculation Grows as Price Outlook Shifts Solana ETF discussions are gaining momentum, with Grayscale filing for a Solana-based fund and the SEC reviewing applications. Analysts predict that an approved ETF could fuel major price growth, with projections placing SOL at $520 by the end of 2025. Institutional interest is increasing, but recent market fluctuations have kept Solana’s price around $193, with traders waiting for the next move. Large transactions within the Solana ecosystem have also caught attention. The platform Pump.Fun has transferred over 1 million SOL (worth $208 million) to Kraken, raising speculation about liquidity shifts. Meanwhile, XRP value is being closely monitored alongside Solana’s developments, as both cryptos are at the center of growing institutional adoption. If ETF approvals come through, Solana could see a major shift in demand. Summing Up With talks of an XRP-spot ETF, institutional interest in XRP value is growing, and legal shifts could push it even further. Meanwhile, speculation around a Solana ETF is building, with analysts eyeing a potential rally if approvals come through. Both cryptos are in a critical phase, with market movements expected to accelerate based on upcoming regulatory decisions. While these assets fight for dominance, Web3 crypto is evolving beyond just trading. Web3Bay is proving that blockchain isn’t just about speculation—it’s about real-world use. The 3BAY token isn’t just for spending; it provides discounts, governance rights, and potential staking rewards. As crypto adoption expands, Web3Bay positions itself as a smarter way to shop, giving users more control and more ways to earn in 2025.

Since early December, Cardano has dropped over 61%, with its price action reflecting a persistent downtrend that has shaken investor confidence. Despite several attempts, the price has yet to show clear signs of reversing the bearish momentum that has dominated its performance over the past months. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Below $2,800 Resistance – Bulls Need A Higher Low To Recover Currently, Cardano is trading at a critical level, one that must hold to spark a potential change in its market trajectory. The importance of this level cannot be overstated, as losing it could lead to further declines and heightened uncertainty for ADA investors. However, hope remains on the horizon for Cardano bulls. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared a promising technical signal, revealing that Cardano is beginning to show signs of a potential rebound on the daily chart. According to Martinez, key indicators are aligning to suggest that a recovery could be in the making, offering a glimmer of optimism for traders and long-term holders alike. The coming days will be crucial for Cardano, as it remains at a crossroads that could determine whether the current trend continues or a much-needed rebound finally takes shape. Cardano Could Start A Recovery Cardano could be on the verge of a recovery rally as it finds strong demand at current levels, with bears unable to push the price into lower demand zones. After months of persistent selling pressure and bearish sentiment, Cardano appears to be stabilizing, creating an opportunity for bulls to regain control. However, reclaiming key levels above the $0.72 mark will be critical to confirming the start of a meaningful recovery. Adding to this optimism, top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical signal on X, indicating that Cardano may be poised to rebound. Martinez highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the daily chart, a development that has caught the attention of many ADA investors. The TD Sequential is a widely used technical analysis tool designed to identify potential price reversals and points of trend exhaustion, making it a valuable indicator during volatile market conditions. This positive signal offers a glimmer of hope for Cardano investors who have been waiting for a rally, not just for ADA but also across the altcoin market. If bulls can hold the current demand level and push the price above $0.72, a recovery rally could gain momentum in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Below $2,800 Resistance – Bulls Need A Higher Low To Recover Breaking through this key level and sustaining higher prices will likely attract more buyers and fuel bullish sentiment, potentially marking the start of a new upward trend. However, failure to reclaim key levels could result in extended consolidation or further declines, making the next few days crucial for Cardano’s price trajectory. ADA Price Testing Crucial Demand Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.69 after enduring days of selling pressure and heightened volatility. Last Monday’s dramatic 38% drop, followed by an impressive 60% recovery, showcased the intensity of the current market conditions. However, despite the swift rebound, ADA has struggled to reclaim the $0.85 level, a critical resistance zone that bulls must conquer to establish a sustainable uptrend. For Cardano to gain momentum, it is essential for bulls to hold current price levels and push the price above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which stands at $0.7225. This EMA serves as a crucial indicator of long-term strength, and a reclaim above it would signal renewed bullish momentum. Breaking above this level could pave the way for a rally, potentially bringing ADA closer to challenging the $0.85 mark again. Related Reading: Solana Holds Support Above Key Indicator – Expert Sees Push To ATH If Momentum Returns Failing to hold the current price or reclaim the 200-day EMA could lead to further consolidation or even another leg down, as market sentiment remains fragile. The coming days will be critical for ADA as it tests its ability to maintain support and establish a bullish trend. Investors will closely watch these key levels, as holding and breaking above them could signal the start of a recovery rally.

33767162,[object Object],1739241027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Difficulty Jumps 5.6% To Set New Record: What’s The Cause?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-jumps-5-6-set-new-record-cause/,"On-chain data shows Bitcoin just got harder to mine as the network Difficulty has witnessed an increase during the latest adjustment. Bitcoin Difficulty Has Just Set A New All-Time High According to data from CoinWarz , the Bitcoin Difficulty has gone up in the most recent adjustment. The “ Difficulty ” here refers to a feature on the BTC blockchain that controls how hard the miners would find it to mine blocks on the network right now. It’s measured in units of ‘hashes.’ The metric’s value changes about every two weeks during what is known as a network ‘ adjustment .’ Just like with the other aspects of the BTC blockchain, no human has any control over adjustments; the code written by Satoshi automatically conducts these events. As for why the pseudonymous creator added this feature into the cryptocurrency, the reason is so that the block time on the chain remains consistent at around 10 mins per block. If the block time exceeds 10 mins, it means the miners are performing their task slower than usual. To correct this, the network drops the Difficulty in the next adjustment. Similarly, it ups the metric if miners are churning out blocks at a rate faster than 10 minutes for each. The latest Bitcoin adjustment occurred during this past weekend. Below is a chart that shows how the Difficulty changed in this event. As is visible in the graph, the network has sharply risen its Difficulty during this adjustment. Prior to the event, the metric stood at 108.1 terahashes, but now it has jumped to 114.1 terahashes, a new all-time high (ATH). This significant positive change of 5.6% means that the miners have been much faster during the last couple of weeks as compared to the two-week period before then. The faster pace of the miners is a result of the aggressive expansion that they have recently participated in. Below is a chart from Blockchain.com for the Hashrate , that showcases this growth in mining farms. The “Hashrate” here is an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of computing power that the miners have currently connected to the Bitcoin network. Its value is denoted in terms of ‘hashes per second.’ From the chart, it’s apparent that the Hashrate was stuck in consolidation during the second half of last month, but bullish momentum in the metric has reignited this month and in quite a spectacular fashion at that. Following the relentless miner expansion, the indicator set a new ATH of around 845,200 terahashes per second this past Saturday. While miners have displayed enthusiasm recently, it’s possible that the Difficulty explosion would cause some of them to roll back in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $98,200, up almost 4% in the last seven days.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin difficulty|bitcoin hashrate|Bitcoin Miners|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-11 02:30:27

According to expert technical analysis, ETH has recently broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the four-hour time frame. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if ETH holds above the breakout area, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 10% to reach the $3,000 level in the near future. This shift in sentiment and recent breakout occurred after the overall cryptocurrency market began experiencing upside momentum, attracting significant attention from traders and investors. Ether Bullish On-Chain Metrics According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass, ETH open interest (OI) has jumped by 6.50%, indicating rising participation and the formation of new positions, which supports a bullish outlook. However, Coinglass data also reveals that intraday traders are currently betting strongly on long positions. At press time, the major liquidation levels are near $2,620 on the lower side and $2,725 on the upper side, with traders being over-leveraged at these levels. If market sentiment remains unchanged and the price rises to the $2,725 level, nearly $100 million worth of short positions will be liquidated. Conversely, if sentiment shifts and the price drops to the $2,620 level, nearly $570 million worth of long positions will be liquidated. Source: Coinglass This liquidation data shows that traders are strongly betting on the long side, currently holding more than five times the value in long positions compared to short positions. Ethereum (ETH) Current Outlook With rising interest and bullish price action, Ether is currently trading near the $2,685 level, having surged over 4% in the past 24 hours.

Table of Contents The Trump pump Upgrades and listings for iDEGEN in February Conclusion President Trump has already been great for crypto — but with a new crypto-friendly SEC locked in, a crypto task force appointed, and new regulations making life easier for traders, things are about to get even better. iDEGEN, the AI agent being raised from scratch by degens on X, is primed to benefit from the great American crypto acceleration. It’s already raised over $20.4m in its viral presale, and with exchange listings due on 27th February, Trump’s stance on crypto could send IDGN to the moon once it hits the open market. The Trump pump Donald Trump campaigned heavily in crypto circles and has already come through on several promises — he even launched his own meme coin , bringing unprecedented levels of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency world. An executive order signed in week one of Trump’s presidency set out to promote the use of crypto, create a national reserve of digital currencies, and foster pro-crypto regulation in the US. At the same time, repealing the SAB 121 bill makes it far easier for American businesses to hold crypto — something that was far more difficult under Joe Biden. But there’s more: Trump has appointed both an SEC task force to create a more hospitable regulatory environment and a crypto council, as well as bringing crypto bulls David Sacks and Scott Bessent into the administration in major roles. The writing on the wall is clear: Biden’s hawkish crypto policies are over, suggesting potential for major bullishness for crypto at large. And with Project Stargate promising to take the US’ AI development to the next level as well, crypto AI projects like iDEGEN are uniquely positioned to benefit. You might also like: AI and crypto will come together in this Bitcoin cycle | Opinion Upgrades and listings for iDEGEN in February While major catalysts align in the macro environment, iDEGEN is undergoing some major upgrades — and has already dropped an absolute banger. Video content is now live: short-form works of art are being beamed worldwide via RedNote, one of the most popular platforms. The same entity that got banned twice from X for being too biased is now creating moving pictures across multiple channels; the viral potential speaks for itself. With exchange listings locked in for 27th February and the video upgrade already rolling, it’s a perfect storm of catalysts. The project has already raised $20.4m in its presale, with each upgrade driving new waves of buying pressure — with another upgrade on the horizon. iDEGEN has integrated DeepSeek, the viral open-source AI model blowing up the tech industry, to offer fans a new flavor of the chaotic agent. The original, uncensored model continues to post. Eventually, the community will decide whether the new iDEGEN will win — or whether the original, violent, chaotic model will win. One thing is certain: iDEGEN’s internal battle will cash in on DeepSeek’s hype, as well as giving the community some serious fireworks. The project is trending yet again, and could end in even more investment ahead of listings. Conclusion iDEGEN has proven its ability to attract both ardent supporters and haters, even turning multiple social media bans into million-dollar buying sprees. Each attempt to contain it only made it stronger, with the community growing more dedicated with every comeback, resulting in a $20.4m presale raise. With that amount already in the bag and even more developments on the horizon ahead of exchange listings, a massive rally could be in the cards. To learn more about iDEGEN, visit its website .

The token distribution of course comes after WazirX completed its rebalancing process for Net Liquid Platform Assets (NLPA), which realigns platform assets with its liabilities. WazirX’s recovery plan includes three main strategies: profit-sharing, stolen asset recovery, and the launch of a decentralized exchange (DEX). “We will do everything we can to help create value for our tribe,” Shetty said , addressing WazirX users directly. How WazirX will execute its first major token distribution The Singapore High Court greenlit WazirX’s parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd, to hold a meeting with its Scheme Creditors on January 23 where creditors will vote on whether to proceed with the Scheme of Arrangement, which includes the immediate distribution of rebalanced assets. If approved, creditors will receive compensation in the form of tokens rather than fiat, giving them market exposure for possible price appreciation. According to WazirX’s official blog post on the matter, users can now check their allocation on the platform’s First Distribution page, which shows their computed token breakdown, current market value, and their effective USD recovery percentage. Under Shetty’s post, a user raised concerns about the fluctuating token values and discrepancies in displayed balances. “NLPA value is different and current value in USD is different. Please explain,” the user asked. Shetty clarified that: “You get to keep any market upside or downside from here on.” The planned token distribution will be executed within 10 days of Scheme approval, according to WazirX’s blog, though certain tokens like ANT, LOVELY, PUSH, GFT, OOKI, MDX, BOB, and WRX, which have low market liquidity, will be partially distributed in their original denominations. Any remaining balance will be settled in USDT or another stablecoin, said the exchange. WazirX’s plans for future recoveries A creditor questioned Shetty directly: “If you currently display 85% USD value for July 18, 1 PM, where’s the 15% USD value? How are you going to show it?” Shetty confirmed that the missing portion ties directly to the newly issued RT tokens. According to WazirX’s statement, if the Scheme is rejected by the creditors, that would force them to wait until ownership disputes over the platform are resolved, a process the exchange believes will be messy and slow. WazirX also said that token prices are based on live market data from Coinmarketcap, and values are subject to change. By toggling between INR and USD, users can view their recovery amounts in real-time. But WazirX did warn that minor variances of up to 0.5% in recovery amounts are possible due to the large number of token transactions during rebalancing and crypto price volatility.

40176198,https://coingape.com/?p=238255,1739242447,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Maxine Waters Unveils New Stablecoin Regulation Draft Amid GOP Push,https://coingape.com/maxine-waters-unveils-new-stablecoin-regulation-draft-amid-gop-push/,"House Financial Services Committee ranking member Maxine Waters has introduced a new proposal for stablecoin regulation, adding to ongoing legislative efforts from both Democrats and Republicans. The draft legislation, obtained by Punchbowl News, outlines federal oversight of stablecoins and sets requirements for issuers. This development follows a separate Republican-led draft released last week, reflecting bipartisan efforts to establish clear rules for stablecoin regulation. Maxine Waters Proposes Stablecoin Regulation Draft Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has introduced a discussion draft aimed at stablecoin regulation under federal supervision. The draft assigns regulatory responsibilities to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It also includes a role for state regulators. The proposal requires stablecoin issuers to maintain reserves on a one-to-one basis to ensure stability. Waters’ approach differs from previous Republican efforts, which she had previously criticized. In 2022, she opposed a Republican-led bill that would have allowed state regulators to approve stablecoin issuers without Federal Reserve involvement. Republican Lawmakers Push Separate Stablecoin Bill Like Maxine Waters, republicans are also advancing their own stablecoin regulation. Last week, Representative French Hill, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative Bryan Steil introduced a draft bill. Their proposal gives the OCC the authority to oversee federally approved nonbank stablecoin issuers instead of relying on the Federal Reserve for regulatory oversight. The Republican-backed bill builds on past legislative discussions and could open the door for financial technology companies to enter the stablecoin market. It seeks to establish clear licensing rules for nonbank firms that issue payment stablecoins, aligning with broader GOP efforts to shape digital asset regulations. Bipartisan Efforts Continue in the Senate Concurrent with Maxine Waters proposal, Stablecoin regulation is also gaining attention in the Senate. Senator Bill Hagerty introduced the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins” Act. His proposal aims to create a national framework for stablecoin oversight, focusing on risk management and compliance standards. A working group involving members from the Senate Banking Committee, House Financial Services Committee, Senate Agriculture Committee, and House Agriculture Committee has also been formed. Lawmakers in this group are working toward a broader regulatory framework for stablecoins and other digital assets. These bills have increased amid Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino’s concerns about competition in the stablecoin market. Stablecoin Rules a Priority Under Trump Administration The push for stablecoin regulation comes as digital assets remain a focal point in Washington. Under President Donald Trump’s administration, both parties have introduced competing proposals, signaling that stablecoin oversight is a legislative priority. Maxine Waters has emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation, having previously called for a “grand bargain on stablecoins.” While past efforts to pass stablecoin legislation have stalled, ongoing discussions suggest a renewed push for regulation. Consequently, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers proposing different approaches, negotiations in Congress will likely continue in the months ahead.

The filing lands as Grayscale continues expanding its crypto offerings, with regulatory approvals on its radar thanks to president Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration. According to NYSE Arca, the proposed rule change would allow ADA to trade like a typical exchange-traded product, which it claims would “enhance competition” and benefit investors by opening up a new layer of market activity. The filing said: “The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change will facilitate the listing and trading of an additional type of exchange-traded product, and the first such product based on ADA, which will enhance competition among market participants, to the benefit of investors and the marketplace.” The ETF’s filing of course included a 19b-4 form, which is essential for any crypto ETF application. Once the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledges it, the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, which then kicks off the formal approval process. The SEC filing also revealed that Grayscale’s Cardano Trust won’t be actively managed. There’s no team of analysts trying to outperform ADA’s price or hedge risks. The trust is designed to simply track ADA’s value, minus expenses, according to the trust’s sponsors. Moreover, the trust isn’t registered under the Investment Company Act, which means it operates outside typical mutual fund regulations. NYSE Acra said the goal is to replicate ADA’s performance through an index price while giving investors a cost-effective alternative to directly owning the asset. The NAV per share is determined by dividing the NAV by the number of shares in circulation. The trust agreement details how ADA valuations are conducted, for the sake of price accuracy. XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and now Cardano Just last week, on February 8, Grayscale submitted its application to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF, though it isn’t alone. On February 7, Cboe submitted four 19b-4 filings to the SEC on behalf of WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital—all wanting spot XRP ETFs approved. Meanwhile, Swedish asset manager Virtune AB entered the ADA game when it launched a Cardano exchange-traded product (ETP) on Nasdaq Helsinki on February 6. In late January, Tuttle Capital followed up with its own proposal—a 2x leveraged Cardano ETF designed to amplify ADA’s daily price swings. Grayscale, of course, already has Bitcoin and Ether ETFs trading on the US stock market. Grayscale has applied for DOGE, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs too.

While heavyweights like Chainlink (LINK), Ripple (XRP), and Sui (SUI) continue to dominate the conversation, a rising star is stealing the spotlight— Lightchain AI. With its groundbreaking blockchain innovations and explosive early momentum, Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as a high-growth contender. The numbers are already speaking volumes: $15.3 million raised in its presale and a token price of just $0.006. Early investors are taking notice, but how does it stack up against market leaders like LINK, XRP, and SUI? If you’re looking to transform $2000 into something extraordinary , let’s dive into what makes these four projects potential game-changers. Top Cryptos to Watch for 2025 – Chainlink (LINK), Ripple (XRP), and Sui (SUI) As of February 7, 2025, the crypto market is buzzing with activity, and a few standout coins are catching investors’ eyes. Chainlink (LINK) is priced at $18.69 today, with a slight dip of 2.56%. Despite this, its decentralized oracle network remains a game-changer, seamlessly connecting smart contracts with real-world data and reinforcing its vital role in the blockchain ecosystem. XRP, Ripple’s native token, is holding at $2.33, down 2.51% today. Even with recent fluctuations, it’s been on an impressive upward streak over the past year. Analysts are optimistic it could hit $5 to $7 in early 2025, fueled by Ripple’s innovations and easing regulatory challenges. Sui (SUI) is trading at $3.16, down 5.11% today. Known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds and scalability, Sui has captured attention as a high-potential investment. However, its volatility adds an extra layer of risk for adventurous investors willing to take the plunge. Which of these will define the next wave of crypto success? Stay tuned! Lightchain AI – New Contender for 2025 While LINK, XRP, and SUI have established themselves in the market, Lightchain AI is emerging as a strong competitor with unique blockchain-driven innovations. One of its standout features is its intelligent network optimization, designed to improve transaction speeds and ensure seamless execution even during high-traffic periods. This makes it an attractive alternative to traditional blockchains struggling with congestion. Another major factor in Lightchain AI’s appeal is its developer incentives program, which provides funding and resources to encourage the growth of decentralized applications. By supporting developers in creating real-world blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI is fostering a robust ecosystem that could drive significant adoption in the coming years. Verdict – Which Project Offers the Best Potential? Each of these four projects has the potential to deliver strong gains in 2025. Chainlink’s oracle services remain essential for smart contract functionality, Ripple’s institutional adoption continues to grow, and Sui is positioning itself as a leading Layer 1 network. However, Lightchain AI’s early-stage growth and commitment to blockchain innovation make it one of the most intriguing opportunities for investors looking to maximize returns. With its intelligent network optimization and developer incentives program, Lightchain AI is setting itself apart in the blockchain industry. For those willing to take an early bet on a high-potential project, Lightchain AI could be the breakout star of the next bull run.

XRP has plunged 26%, leaving traders questioning whether it will rebound or slide further. Meanwhile, Ondo (ONDO) is on the verge of a breakout, testing critical resistance levels as bulls push for higher price targets. But while these two assets battle technical levels, Web3Bay (3BAY) is rewriting the rules of crypto investing, offering something neither XRP nor Ondo can—real-world utility in the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. Web3Bay is not just another speculative asset; it is a blockchain-powered alternative to Amazon and eBay, eliminating middlemen and giving full control to users. With over $1.1 million raised and 290 million tokens sold, Web3Bay’s presale momentum suggests explosive potential far beyond the price swings of traditional crypto assets. XRP Drops 26%: Will It Rebound or Fall Further? XRP has fallen 26% in four days, now testing key support at $2.17. While the drop has raised concerns, it appears to be a normal market correction rather than a full reversal. XRP has maintained an overall uptrend for months, and its next move depends on whether buyers step in at this level. If XRP rebounds from $2.17, it could push back to the $2.60-$2.73 range, where the 50-day EMA currently sits. A breakout above this level would confirm strength and set the stage for another attempt at $3.00 in the coming weeks. Alternatively, XRP could enter a sideways consolidation phase between $2.17 and $2.40, allowing the market to stabilize and regain strength before its next major move. This scenario would give traders time to assess sentiment and volume before XRP picks a direction. Ondo (ONDO) Eyes Breakout as Price Targets $2 Ondo (ONDO) is showing signs of a potential breakout after bouncing from its recent low of $0.91. Following a prolonged correction, ONDO is now consolidating near $1.40, testing key resistance at $1.54. A decisive move above this level could signal further upside, with $1.77 and $2.10 as the next major targets. Technical indicators suggest bullish momentum is building. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recovered from oversold conditions, while the price is forming a base around $1.36, a critical Fibonacci retracement level. Analysts are watching for a breakout that could push ONDO into its next upward phase. Web3Bay: The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape by eliminating intermediaries and creating a fully decentralized, user-controlled marketplace. Unlike platforms like Amazon and eBay, which impose high fees and restrictive policies, Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology to provide a trustless, transparent, and fee-efficient shopping experience. Through its 3BAY token, buyers and sellers have complete control over transactions, pricing, and platform governance. A major highlight of Web3Bay is its smart contract renouncement post-presale, ensuring that no central entity can manipulate the system. Governance is entirely handled by 3BAY token holders via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), making it one of the few truly community-driven marketplaces. Additionally, Web3Bay integrates staking rewards, allowing users to earn passive income while benefiting from lower transaction fees. The Web3Bay presale is gaining massive traction, having raised over $1.1 million, with 290 million tokens sold across multiple stages. Currently, 3BAY is priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, with a projected launch price of $0.1959—offering an estimated 4,200% ROI for early investors. Why Web3Bay Offers More Than Just a Short-Term Play Investors looking for a quick price recovery may find XRP’s $2.17 support level an attractive entry point, but the market remains uncertain, with a potential retest of $3.00 dependent on buying pressure. Ondo’s technical breakout setup offers upside, but it still faces major resistance zones before confirming a long-term trend. However, Web3Bay is in an entirely different league. While XRP and Ondo remain tied to market sentiment and price speculation, Web3Bay is actively disrupting a trillion-dollar industry. The platform’s smart contract renouncement, staking rewards, and decentralized governance make it one of the most promising crypto investments of 2025.

ETH might gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,740 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,700 level. The price is trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,700 and $2,740. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2,920 resistance, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,800 and $2,700 support levels to move into a short-term bearish zone. The price dipped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. The bulls appeared near the $2,525 zone. The price is now moving higher and attempting a fresh increase above the $2,600 level. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,700 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,740 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,850 or $2,910. A clear move above the $2,910 resistance might send the price toward the $2,950 resistance. An upside break above the $2,950 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,600 level. The first major support sits near the $2,525 zone. A clear move below the $2,525 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,240.

Notably, short positions in ETH have soared by 500% since November 2024, indicating heightened bearish sentiment toward the digital asset. Institutional Investors Losing Faith In Ethereum? According to a recent post on X by The Kobeissi Letter, Ethereum price is witnessing mounting challenges as short positioning in the cryptocurrency has ballooned in recent times. Notably, ETH short positions are up 40% in the last week, while they are up 500% in the last three months. It is worth highlighting that this is the highest level ever that Wall Street funds have been short Ethereum. Earlier this month, the crypto market got an indication of this bearish ETH positioning, as the digital asset crashed 37% in 60 hours amid Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say Interestingly, capital inflows to Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) were significantly high in December 2024. In just 3 weeks, ETH ETFs attracted more than $2 billion in new funds, with a record breaking weekly inflow of $854 million. However, hedge funds’ positioning on ETH suggests that they are not very confident in the cryptocurrency’s short-term price outlook. Several factors could be at play for institutional investor’s waning interest in ETH. For instance, ETH is currently trading almost 45% below its current all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 recorded way back in November 2021. In contrast, Bitcoin (BTC) has had a stellar 2024, hitting multiple new ATH, and commanding a market cap that is almost six times larger than that of ETH. The Kobeissi Letter attributes ETH’s current lacklustre price performance to potential “market manipulation, harmless crypto hedges, to bearish outlook on Ethereum itself.” However, the market commentator indicates that this excessive bearish outlook may set ETH up for a short squeeze. They add: This extreme positioning means big swings like the one on February 3rd will be more common. Since the start of 2024, Bitcoin is up ~12 TIMES as much as Ethereum. Is a short squeeze set to close this gap? ETH Short Squeeze To Initiate Altseason? A short squeeze on ETH could teleport its price to as high as $3,000, or even $4,000. However, according to seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, ETH must defend the $2,600 support level to climb higher. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery Recent reports indicate that ETH has likely bottomed, paving the way for a trend reversal to the upside. Another report by Steno Research suggests that ETH is likely to outperform BTC in 2025, with potential targets as high as $8,000. That said, concerns still remain about the Ethereum Foundation regularly dumping ETH. At press time, ETH trades at $2,661, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

Grayscale has taken another ambitious step in the crypto ETF race by filing a 19b-4 form with the SEC for a spot Cardano ( ADA ) ETF, marking the first-ever attempt to bring ADA into the U.S. spot ETF market.

First one in US and ballpark 60th crypto ETF filed this year so far pic.twitter.com/alj7EjtfIS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 11, 2025 The move reflects Grayscale’s push to expand institutional access to digital assets beyond Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that this is roughly the 60th crypto ETF filing this year, highlighting the rapid pace at which asset managers are scrambling to secure approvals in a shifting regulatory era. The 19b-4 filing is a key requirement for listing a new ETF on an exchange, essentially a formal request for a rule change. Even if approved, a spot ETF also requires an effective S-1 registration statement before it can begin trading. Since the announcement, ADA has surged nearly 11% in 24 hours, reaching $0.74 as of this writing on Feb. 11. Despite the rally, the token remains 76% below its all-time high of $3.10, recorded in September 2021. The market’s reaction suggests growing optimism around altcoin ETFs, particularly as analysts anticipate more filings in the coming months. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Balchunas estimate a 90% chance for a Litecoin ( LTC ) ETF approval and 70% for Solana ( SOL ), both of which already have pending 19b-4 approvals. NEW: @EricBalchunas and I took a look at the filings for spot crypto ETFs. We're putting out relatively high odds of approval across the board.

The proposal, submitted by NYSE Arca on behalf of Grayscale, seeks to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Cardano Trust. This move positions Grayscale among other asset managers racing to launch crypto ETFs, and it also represents the first time Grayscale has offered a standalone product dedicated exclusively to Cardano, separate from its larger funds. Grayscale has already included Cardano in its Digital Large Cap Fund and Smart Contract Ethereum Fund, but this new trust would focus exclusively on ADA, offering both retail and institutional investors a more direct, cost-effective way to invest in Cardano without the complexities of acquiring and securing ADA themselves. “The proposed rule change is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest in that there is a considerable amount of ADA price and market information available on public websites and through professional and subscription services,” the company said in the filing.

Recently, Virtune, a Finnish-based platform, filed for its own standalone Cardano ETP, and 21Shares launched a Cardano-based ETF with over $69 million in assets. The move by Grayscale, a trusted asset manager, is seen as a positive sign for Cardano’s long-term prospects.

The price is now facing hurdles near the $2.50 and $2.60 levels. XRP price started a recovery wave from the $2.280 zone. The price is now trading above $2.40 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Eyes Upside XRP price started a recovery wave from the $2.280 support zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . A base was formed and the price started an increase above the $2.32 and $2.35 levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.7849 swing high to the $2.2794 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2.450 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.

The first major resistance is near the $2.5320 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.7849 swing high to the $2.2794 low. The next resistance is $2.60. A clear move above the $2.60 resistance might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.780 resistance or even $2.80 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.880. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.50 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.380 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $2.280 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.280 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.140 support. The next major support sits near the $2.050 zone.
