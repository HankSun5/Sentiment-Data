According to Coinshares, institutional whales poured over $1 billion into crypto products last week despite or perhaps because of market weakness. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling for the 5th consecutive week totaling US$1.3bn, bringing inflows for the year so far to US$7.3bn. Recent price declines saw total assets under management in ETPs (exchange-traded products) fall to US$163bn, down from its all-time high set in late January of US$181bn. Trading volumes for the week held steady at US$20bn.” Source: CoinShares The US led the world regionally with $1 billion in inflows. Germany, Switzerland, and Canada also provided $61 million, $54 million, and $37 million, respectively. Even though Bitcoin ( BTC ) raked in $407 million last week, there was a surprising new leader for taking the lion’s share of inflows. “Ethereum stole the show this week, with the price falling recently close to US$2,100 leading to significant buying-on-weakness with inflows of US$793m, outpacing bitcoin for the first time this year.” While multi-asset investment vehicles, or products investing in a basket of digital assets, brought in $14.4 million in inflows, XRP led all non- ETH altcoins at $21.1 million in inflows. Solana ( SOL ) products brought in $11.2 million in inflows last week while Sui ( SUI ) investment vehicles enjoyed $4.3 million in inflows.

Musk’s Past with OpenAI and His Concerns Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 and left in 2019 over internal disagreements, has frequently criticized its transformation into a for-profit entity. He argues that OpenAI’s shift prioritizes revenue generation over its original mission of benefiting humanity, an issue that has fueled legal conflicts between the parties. Elon Musk’s AI firm, xAI, is leading the bid with financial support from Valor Equity Partners, 8VC, and Hollywood executive Ari Emanuel. Under Altman’s leadership, OpenAI has moved toward a for-profit structure, aggressively seeking funding to expand its AI research. Altman has defended the shift, arguing that substantial funding is essential for large-scale AI innovation. As part of this effort, he announced a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure through a joint venture, Stargate.

Grayscale, which last year broke through U.S. regulators' blockade against the bitcoin ETF, has never previously offered a standalone ADA investment vehicle despite making past moves to do so. But the Trump 2.0 SEC's pivot from policing the crypto industry to seemingly embracing it has emboldened issuers to think big about what they can get through. In recent weeks Grayscale filed for a Solana and XRP ETF as well. Those products would convert Grayscale's preexisting crypto trust products into more widely tradeable ETFs whereas the ADA ETF would be entirely new. Investor demand has always been high for the flagship asset of the Cardano blockchain. ADA ranks among the largest crypto assets by market cap, weighing in at $25 billion at press time. The token spiked 1.5% to 71 cents following the Grayscale news. Market observers increasingly believe the time is nigh for altcoin ETFs to clear the not-quite-as-skeptical SEC.

This rare feat highlights the uncertain nature of cryptocurrency mining and shows that solo miners can still achieve substantial rewards despite the dominance of large mining pools. Crypto journalist Pete Rizzo shared the news via X: BREAKING: ANOTHER SOLO MINER HAS MINED AN ENTIRE #BITCOIN BLOCK WORTH $300,000 BEATING UNBELIEVABLE ODDS pic.twitter.com/pjcivSu2PQ — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) February 10, 2025 On January 30, 2025, a solo Bitcoin miner reportedly used a “$200 BitAXE miner,” a home mining device, to successfully mine a block. However, another user speculated that the miner leveraged CKPOOL, a mining pool designed for solo miners. The miner was using an implementation of @ckpooldev but this does not seem to be from CKPOOL directly. Might have been a bitaxe. Digging in now! — Marshall Long (@OGBTC) February 10, 2025 Mining an entire Bitcoin block as a solo miner with limited computational power is statistically improbable, comparable to winning a lottery. The Bitcoin network is predominantly controlled by large mining pools that combine extensive computational power to increase their chances of mining new blocks. Understanding Solo Mining Solo mining involves a miner attempting to solve the complex mathematical problems required to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain without joining a mining pool. While this approach allows miners to keep the entire block reward, the probability of success remains low due to the extensive computational power required. As the Bitcoin network grows more competitive, solo mining becomes increasingly difficult. However, miners willing to invest in hardware and electricity, despite the slim odds, may still see occasional success. How the Crypto Market Reacted After the Block Win On Monday, the cryptocurrency market cap declined by 3% following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports , intensifying concerns over economic policy shifts. Following the broader market downturn, Bitcoin (BTC) declined 0.5% to $96,871, while Ethereum (ETH) dropped 1.5% to $2,627.

SAND, APT, BERA, and ARB face declining momentum, raising concerns among analysts. Market data suggests these tokens could underperform in the long run, making them potential sell candidates for risk-averse holders. 4 Altcoins To Sell Before Token Unlocks Trigger Market Volatility Upcoming token unlocks may lead to significant selling pressure. Data from Tokenomist indicates that over $742 million worth of tokens will be released between February 10 and 17. Notable unlocks include CONX, SAND, APT, BERA, and ARB, with individual values surpassing $5 million. The largest unlock is ARB, which will release 92.65 million tokens worth $40.57 million, representing 12.13% of its circulating supply. Meanwhile, SAND will see a 205.59 million token release worth $79.34 million, making up 8.41% of its supply. BERA, APT, and CONX will also experience substantial unlocks. The Sandbox (SAND) Sandbox (SAND), a blockchain-based virtual world, surged 10% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.396. The platform allows users to create, build, and exchange digital assets in a gaming environment. Despite the recent increase, SAND has declined 10% over the past week. A scheduled unlock of 205.59 million tokens worth $79.34 million could impact the market. This event positions SAND as an altcoin to sell, with potential selling pressure ahead. By leveraging DAOs and NFTs, Sandbox continues fostering a decentralized gaming ecosystem. Berachain (BERA) Berachain (BERA) is changing Layer-1 economics with its Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) mechanism, creating an efficient marketplace for validators, users, and applications. BERA is currently trading at $5.31, gaining 5.43% in the past 24 hours. A scheduled token release will introduce 12.98 million BERA tokens, valued at approximately $62.82 million. With a market cap of $570.82 million, BERA is under watch for potential volatility. Aptos (APT) Aptos (APT), a Layer 1 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, is experiencing a price surge, gaining 8% in the past 24 hours. The network, which utilizes the Move programming language initially developed by Meta’s former Diem engineers, has drawn attention amid a significant upcoming token unlock. The APT price is $6.19 and is set to release 11.31 million APT tokens, valued at approximately $64.35 million. This scheduled unlock could introduce selling pressure, potentially affecting the token’s price. Market analysts suggest that Aptos could be among the Altcoins to sell to mitigate long-term losses. Arbitrum (ARB) Arbitrum (ARB), an Ethereum layer-two scaling solution, utilizes optimistic rollups to improve transaction speeds and lower costs while maintaining Ethereum’s security. The network enhances scalability, making transactions more efficient. Recently, the ARB price experienced an 8% surge, reaching $0.4749 within 24 hours. This increase follows growing market activity. Meanwhile, concerns arise over potential volatility as token unlock events approach. Investors closely monitor the market’s reaction to these upcoming changes, making it altcoin to watch. Conclusion: Market trends indicate these altcoins may struggle to regain strong momentum. Investors should assess their portfolios and adjust strategies based on ongoing developments.

The presiding judge, Justice Jeong Woo-yong, said that the prosecution’s case included “no evidence of” Kim committing “a crime.” Kim Nam-guk Absolved: Court Says His Actions ‘Not Criminal’ The Coin Gate scandal galvanized South Korea , when allegations surfaced claiming that Kim had abused his position as a member of a National Assembly committee. The former South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-guk speaking to reporters outside a branch of the Seoul Southern District Court. (Source: KBS News/YouTube/Screenshot) News reports claimed Kim sold unnamed cryptoassets after hearing news of imminent changes to crypto-related law. Prosecutors had hoped to charge Kim on insider trading-related charges. However, they later decided to charge him with “obstructing officials in the course of their duties.” They claimed that Kim had made “false declarations” about his cryptoassets to the National Assembly. Prosecutors claimed that Kim had tried to “hide the fact that he owned a large amount of cryptocurrency.” They told the court that Kim had “hidden” the fact that he had “made a large profit from crypto investments during his two National Assembly asset declarations in 2021 and 2022.” Prosecution’s Case Prosecution officials said that Kim sold some of his crypto holdings. They said he then transferred the fiat “to a bank deposit account to match his total assets.” He then allegedly “converted the remaining assets” into crypto, prosecutors said. And this, they claimed, was part of a bid to “obstruct the National Assembly Ethics Committee’s” probe into his assets. A courtroom in the Seoul Southern District Court. (Source: YTN/YouTube/Screenshot) Prosecutors Wanted to Jail Kim for 6 Months Prosecutors told the court that Kim held crypto worth “approximately 9.9 billion won (over $6.8 million)” at the time of the 2021 asset declaration process. However, Kim reportedly claimed his total assets were worth approximately 1.2 billion won (around $827,000), and that the funds “in the same way” in 2022. In December last year, prosecution officials asked the court to jail Kim for six months if he was found guilty. But the court rejected the prosecution’s case. It stated that at the time, cryptoassets “were not subject to declarations.” As such, the judge said, it was impossible to consider “that [Kim] was under obligation to declare” his holdings. The judge conceded that some declaration details had been “insufficient or inaccurate.” But Jeong added that it was “not easy to rule that the Ethics Committee” had been “obstructed.” President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment trial entered its final stage this week, with just two formal hearings remaining, and legal circles expecting the verdict would be out in mid-March. https://t.co/oWkDO7MdMF #YoonSukYeol #Impeachment #southKorea #News — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) February 10, 2025 New Declarations The judge concluded that, on the basis of the evidence it had seen, there was “insufficient” reason to rule against Kim without further “evidence to support” the prosecution’s claims. Since the scandal first broke, the National Assembly has introduced new crypto declaration rules for all sitting lawmakers. Seoul has gone on to apply the same rules to scores of civil service roles. This means that a large number of public sector workers are now obliged to file annual crypto declarations. Trump's deportation crackdowns impact Koreans https://t.co/QZ4gVN5GpD — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) February 10, 2025 The lengthy court case launched in October last year, with Kim – a trained lawyer – vowing to clear his name.

The crypto space is buzzing with new meme coins, but only a handful offer true potential. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is catching the spotlight as it enters Aqua Frost, its 10th presale phase, with a jaw-dropping 13,451.72% ROI ahead of its listing. Meanwhile, Popcat (POPCAT) has climbed to $0.3058, gaining traction as demand rises, and Brett (BRETT) continues its recovery after its December 2024 peak of $0.2342. With meme coin momentum showing no signs of slowing down, investors are eyeing strategic entries. Let’s dive into the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Popcat (POPCAT), and Brett (BRETT) and why the APC stands tall among the top new meme coins to buy today. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Mission-Driven Crypto Revolution: Why Investors Are Diving In So, the top new meme coins to buy today aren’t just about hype; they need a unique vision. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another dog-themed project—it’s built on an engaging mythical adventure where Arctic Pablo explores hidden realms, unveiling a financially rewarding journey. This isn’t just a storytelling gimmick. The project integrates real utility, allowing holders to earn passive income through 66% APY staking, referral rewards, and community incentives​. Arctic Pablo also operates on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for low-cost, high-speed transactions, making it a strategic alternative to meme coins facing congestion issues. With a token burn mechanism that ensures scarcity, Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model enhances value appreciation. Investors aren’t just holding a meme coin—they’re part of a project that mixes mythology, gamification, and strong economics to create something truly unique​. Aqua Frost Presale Gains Momentum: Arctic Pablo’s 10th Phase Is Heating Up As Arctic Pablo Coin advances into Aqua Frost, its 10th presale phase, the urgency to invest grows stronger. At the moment, 1 APC is priced at $0.000059, with over $1.1 million already raised​. With its final listing price set at $0.008, the potential return is staggering—an ROI of 13,451.72% for early adopters. At this rate, a $3,000 investment in Stage 10 would secure 50,847,458 APC, translating into a massive $406,779 when it hits the exchange​. Time is running out, as each stage features an automatic token burn, ensuring that unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. The earlier investors get in, the higher their potential gains. As price increases with each new phase, the chance to enter at the rock-bottom pricing is slipping away. Popcat Hits $0.3058 as It Rebounds From Recent Lows Popcat (POPCAT) has been making headlines after bouncing back from a recent dip, currently trading at $0.3058. The meme token, which once hit an all-time high of $1.07 in September 2024, has since experienced a pullback, but traders are closely watching its movements. With a market cap that previously crossed $1 billion, Popcat continues to be a notable player in the meme coin space. Despite its recent volatility, interest in Popcat remains strong. The token’s community engagement and widespread meme appeal keep it in the spotlight, and investors are watching closely to see if it can regain momentum. Brett Sees Market Correction After Hitting $0.0459 Brett (BRETT) has seen a minor pullback, currently priced at $0.0459. This comes after its impressive run in December 2024, when it reached an all-time high of $0.2342 with a market cap of $2 billion. While some investors anticipated further upward movement, BRETT has yet to secure a listing on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. Despite this short-term correction, Brett’s presence in the meme coin market remains significant. The project continues to garner attention, and many believe that if a major exchange listing materializes, it could reignite bullish momentum. Conclusion: Where to Put Your Money? Based on current market trends and ongoing developments, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the strongest opportunity among meme coins right now. With its lucrative staking program, strategic presale structure, and deflationary mechanics, APC is poised for explosive growth. Popcat and Brett remain key contenders, with their own market movements keeping investors engaged. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale momentum and high ROI potential make it an unmatched investment opportunity in the top new meme coins to buy today . As Aqua Frost continues to gain traction, the time to act is now. Secure your spot in the Arctic Pablo presale before prices rise again. Join the presale today and be part of this exciting adventure!

Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing a surge in whale transactions, hinting at a possible rally, while Avalanche (AVAX) faces intense selling pressure, with analysts warning of a drop below $20. But Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as the most compelling crypto of February, disrupting the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector with a fully decentralized marketplace. While Chainlink and Avalanche rely on traditional price cycles and market sentiment, Web3Bay offers real-world utility and a massive adoption potential. With over $1 million raised and 280 million tokens sold in presale, Web3Bay is not just another speculative bet—it’s a fundamental shift in how online commerce operates. With a projected 4,200% ROI at launch, it presents the strongest investment case among the three. Chainlink (LINK) Price Surges in Whale Transactions – Is a Rally Coming? Chainlink (LINK) price is drawing attention as whale transactions hit a 14-month high, with 1,659 transfers exceeding $100,000 recorded in a single day. On-chain data from Santiment reveals that active wallets have climbed to 9,531, the highest in four weeks. This surge in large transactions often signals an impending price shift, as institutional investors position themselves ahead of major market moves. Despite a 20% drop in the past week, Chainlink (LINK) price is consolidating between its 50-day moving average at $22.76 and the 200-day MA at $15.88. Historically, increased whale accumulation during a dip has led to strong rebounds. Analysts remain bullish, projecting a climb to $32 in February, $41 in March, and a potential $48 by May, marking an 88% increase from current levels. Avalanche (AVAX) Drops Below $27 – Will It Crash to $20? Avalanche (AVAX) has fallen below $27, extending its downward trend as bearish momentum intensifies. Over the past week, AVAX has dropped 18.3%, with a 3.6% decline in the last 24 hours, pushing its market cap below $11 billion. Analysts warn that if selling pressure continues, the token could slide toward the $20 support level. Technical indicators suggest further downside risk. AVAX recently broke below its 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $28.91, a key support zone. The Trend Strength Index (TSI) at -0.89 and a sharp drop in the 20-day EMA confirm strong bearish momentum. If AVAX fails to reclaim this level, the next major support sits near $19.55. Web3Bay: The Must-Buy Crypto of February 2025 Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as the top crypto investment for February, revolutionizing e-commerce with its decentralized marketplace. Unlike traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay, which impose high fees and centralized control, Web3Bay enables buyers and sellers to transact directly on the blockchain, eliminating middlemen and reducing costs. With blockchain security, tamper-proof transactions, and a governance model controlled by 3BAY token holders via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Web3Bay is reshaping online commerce. The Web3Bay presale is on fire, with over $1 million raised and 280 million tokens sold. Currently priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, the token is projected to launch at $0.1959, offering a staggering 4,200% ROI for early investors. Additionally, Web3Bay introduces staking rewards, allowing token holders to earn passive income while benefiting from lower transaction fees. With the global e-commerce industry surpassing $7 trillion, Web3Bay presents a real-world use case with massive upside potential. As crypto adoption accelerates, 3BAY is the one coin investors can’t afford to miss this February. Its high-growth trajectory, real utility, and strong investor demand make it the most compelling crypto presale right now. Web3Bay Leads the Charge as the Market’s Best Bet Chainlink’s whale accumulation signals potential upside, but its price remains volatile. Avalanche is battling critical resistance levels, with risks of further losses if market sentiment doesn’t improve. However, Web3Bay offers more than just speculation—it’s an ecosystem with long-term growth potential. With staking rewards, decentralized governance, and real-world adoption, Web3Bay is far more than a short-term play. Investors looking for a crypto with massive upside and tangible use cases should not overlook this presale. While LINK and AVAX have their strengths, Web3Bay stands out as February’s best crypto investment—offering early backers the chance to secure life-changing gains before its official launch.

Still priced at just $0.042 in presale, this rising crypto is flashing a strong buy signal, with analysts eyeing an 80,000% surge. Dogecoin Price Struggles As It Risks Dropping To $0.22 Support The Dogecoin price has struggled to gain traction, failing to break through key resistance levels. Currently trading at $0.2651, DOGE remains locked in a tight range, with traders showing caution as volume declines. Technical charts indicate the Dogecoin price limited buying pressure, with the weekly chart showing a 19.2% drop and the daily chart indicating a 1.3% decline. Market analysts warn that DOGE may retest a $0.22 support level with the current market situation. With volatility increasing, some DOGE holders are beginning to diversify into stronger-performing assets, looking for better returns elsewhere. This has led investors to explore new options, particularly WallitIQ (WLTQ), which has gained traction as a top-performing presale asset. Unlike DOGE, which depends heavily on speculation, this presale sensation offers a strong value proposition backed by security and automation features that appeal to long-term investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Signals Massive 80,000% Surge While the Dogecoin price continues to show uncertainty, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has emerged as one of the most attractive investment opportunities in the market. Analysts tracking the presale activity have noted a strong buy signal ahead of a jaw-dropping 80,000% upside as early investors rush to secure this affordable presale token at its current price of $0.042.

Unlike the Dogecoin price, which remains speculative, the altcoin is backed by tangible technological advancements that augment digital asset security and usability. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) SolidProof-audited smart contract and a CoinMarketCap listing already secured, investor confidence continues to grow, making WLTQ one of the most sought-after presale tokens on the market.

Investors recognize that once it completes its presale phase, the price will rise significantly, making now the best time to enter before significant price increases occur. This emerging altcoin presents a strategic advantage over the current Dogecoin price for investors seeking a high-upside opportunity with reduced risk. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Next Big Crypto Move The Dogecoin price remains volatile, with analysts forecasting a potential drop toward $0.22 support levels. The DOGE struggling to regain momentum has left many traders questioning its ability to deliver sustainable gains in the coming months. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has continued to flash a strong buy signal, attracting investors looking for a more secure and functional investment option. With its smart contract security, portfolio automation , and MVP crypto wallet management app, it has positioned itself as a leader in digital asset management poised for an 80,000% surge.

Ethereum Prices Fall & Chainlink Rally Faces Uncertainty,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-draws-attention-with-a-350-bonus-ethereum-prices-fall-chainlink-rally-faces-uncertainty/,"Ethereum’s (ETH) price has plummeted due to various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory updates, market manipulation, and global events impacting the cryptocurrency market. Not only has the Ethereum price been affected—Chainlink is also experiencing declines. However, Chainlink has formed a partnership with a notable stablecoin issuer which could potentially lead to a Chainlink rally. As participants seek out promising coins, BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as a notable contender, offering a substantial 350% bonus on BDAG acquisitions. This offer represents a unique chance in the current market climate. Despite the downturn in Ethereum prices, BlockDAG continues to attract attention, remaining stable amidst market volatility. With $193.5 million already raised in its ongoing presale and a 2380% price increase, BDAG is positioning itself as a leading coin for 2025. Ethereum Price Suffers Amidst Market Volatility In the last 24 hours, the Ethereum price has faced significant losses, with its trading volume decreasing by 27.68% to $57.61 billion. This reduction highlights the numerous factors that influence the Ethereum price, including market dynamics, geopolitical issues, celebrity endorsements, and market manipulations. Community sentiment plays a critical role, and even events like token burning can sway the market’s direction. The current technical indicators are not favorable for the Ethereum price, showing signs of a downward trend. If these indicators persist, traders might begin shorting their positions, potentially triggering a broader sell-off. Chainlink Partners with Usual—Potential for a Chainlink Rally? Many coins employ various strategies to recover after significant losses. Chainlink has partnered with Usual, a major stablecoin issuer overseeing over $1.2 billion in assets, in hopes of sparking a Chainlink rally. This partnership allows Usual-stablecoins USD0 and USD0++ to utilize Chainlink’s infrastructure, including Price Feeds, Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and Proof of Reserve, enhancing the security and transparency of Usual’s ecosystem. This strategic alliance could pave the way for a Chainlink rally, although it remains uncertain whether a partnership alone can initiate such a movement. BlockDAG’s Final Call Campaign Captures Global Attention BlockDAG’s “FINALCALL700” campaign is quickly becoming the buzz of the cryptocurrency world. This unprecedented 350% bonus marks the most significant promotion in BlockDAG’s history, serving as a token of gratitude towards its dedicated community and early supporters for their steadfast commitment to the project. Initially priced at $0.001, BDAG has seen a significant rise to $0.0248, with predictions pointing towards further increases as demand continues to grow. Market experts anticipate that BDAG will reach $20 by 2027 after raising over $193.5 million and distributing 18.3 billion coins. As news of BlockDAG’s extraordinary bonus offer spreads, a global rush of buyers is emerging, eager to enhance their holdings by purchasing BDAG at its current low price. BlockDAG is committed to rewarding both new and early participants fairly, creating an even playing field. With the current promotional wave, the rapid sale of batch 27 seems inevitable, suggesting a swift uptake in the presale and a continued surge in BDAG’s market value. Navigating Market Instability with Promising Opportunities Amid the ongoing turmoil in the cryptocurrency market, where uncertainty and skepticism prevail, certain coins are feeling the pressure. Ethereum is battling to regain its footing, supported by a dedicated base of long-term holders. Meanwhile, LINK is collaborating with notable stablecoin issuer Usual in an effort to stabilize its position. In contrast, BlockDAG is navigating these turbulent times with remarkable steadiness. The opportunity to claim a 350% bonus on BDAG purchases through the “FINALCALL700” code offers a unique chance for participants to secure one of the top crypto coins for 2025, even as the market faces ongoing challenges.

40171661,https://coingape.com/?p=238252,1739232157,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Grayscale Files For Cardano ETF With NYSE as Race Heats Up,https://coingape.com/grayscale-files-for-cardano-etf-with-nyse-as-race-heats-up/,"Grayscale Investments has submitted an application to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for a Cardano exchange-traded fund (ETF). This marks a step in the growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. The move is part of the company’s strategy to expand its crypto ETF offerings, following its recent filings for XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs. The Cardano ETF filing adds to the increasing list of institutional moves aiming to provide regulated exposure to popular cryptos. Grayscale Joins Race with Cardano ETF Application to NYSE In a recent filing , Grayscale submitted its proposal for a Cardano ETF with the NYSE, further diversifying its crypto offerings. The filing comes as part of a larger push by Grayscale to expand its presence in the growing cryptocurrency market. The firm has already filed similar ETF applications for other popular cryptos, such as XRP, Solana, and Litecoin. With the increasing institutional interest in digital assets, this move is a significant step toward regulated exposure for institutional investors seeking access to Cardano. Grayscale’s Cardano ETF application comes when institutional interest in cryptocurrency is expanding. With Cardano (ADA) becoming one of the top-performing assets, this ETF could offer a regulated route for traditional investors to gain ADA exposure. The Cardano network has gained substantial recognition for its focus on scalability, security, and sustainability, factors that appeal to investors. Moreso, these developments come when the US SEC seeks public comments on Grayscale’s Litecoin ETF proposal, allowing for a 21-day submission period. Litecoin ETFs are gaining attention as the SEC assesses Grayscale’s request to convert its Litecoin Trust into an exchange-traded product. Recently, asset managers like Grayscale and Coinshares have taken steps to expand crypto ETF offerings, signaling growing interest. Competition in the Crypto ETF Space Grayscale’s filing is part of a trend in the crypto market, where multiple asset managers are vying to offer ETFs linked to popular digital assets. Recently, other firms, including WisdomTree and Bitwise, have submitted similar applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for XRP ETFs. Additionally, Swedish asset manager Virtune AB launched a Cardano exchange-traded product (ETP) on Nasdaq Helsinki, catering to institutional investors. As the market continues to mature, more financial institutions are exploring the idea of crypto ETFs, especially for major cryptos like Cardano. The introduction of a Cardano ETF by Grayscale will provide more opportunities for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with ADA exposure. Impact on Cardano Price The introduction of a Cardano ETF could have a significant effect on ADA price and market sentiment. As more institutional investors gain exposure to Cardano, increased demand could lead to upward pressure on ADA price. Currently, the ADA remains relatively stable, but the potential for more institutional capital entering the space through an ETF could cause a rise in its price. In addition, if Cardano price holds above the $0.67–$0.81 support range, it could signal strength and set the stage for an ADA price rally . Technical indicators, including the TD Sequential buy signal, further support the possibility of a bullish reversal. However, if Cardano price fails to maintain this support, a drop below the range will lead to further declines. At the time of writing, Cardano price stands at $0.7068, reflecting a 3% increase in the past 24 hours. The market cap has risen to $24.87B, and the trading volume is up by 11.15%, reaching $752.82M.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Wall Street Pepe has officially sold out its presale, while Pepeto emerges as the next big meme coin contender. Table of Contents Pepeto’s rise: The God of Frogs set to take over Pepeto’s exchange and cross-chain bridge Pepeto landing a Binance listing Conclusion Two major players have risen in the ongoing meme coin frenzy: Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) and Pepeto (PEPETO). While both projects bring distinct value to the market, Pepeto now holds a strategic advantage as its presale remains open, presenting a prime opportunity for early investors. Wall Street Pepe, which aims to empower smaller traders with trading signals, alpha calls, and staking rewards, has successfully sold out its presale, with an official exchange listing soon to be announced. The demand for WEPE signals strong market interest, but new investors must now wait for its official debut on exchanges. Pepeto’s rise: The God of Frogs set to take over Dubbed the “God of Frogs,” Pepeto is setting itself apart with a powerful ecosystem, deep narrative appeal, and transformative utilities. Currently priced at $0.000000109 per token, PEPETO remains one of the most affordable and high-upside opportunities in the meme coin market . Key features driving its momentum include: Zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap – Eliminating transaction costs for meme coin traders. A cutting-edge cross-chain bridge – Enhancing interoperability and reducing friction between networks. Staking rewards at 387% APY – Providing lucrative incentives for long-term holders. With a thriving community of over 65,600 supporters and growing daily, PEPETO is capturing global attention. Its strong narrative, real-world use case, and bullish sentiment are fueling speculation that it could become one of the biggest meme coin success stories of 2025. You might also like: Pepeto hits $4m in presale, emerges as next big meme coin to watch Pepeto’s exchange and cross-chain bridge The anticipation surrounding PepetoSwap, a zero-fee exchange built for meme coin traders, is reaching new heights. Designed to solve key market inefficiencies such as high fees and fragmented liquidity, PepetoSwap is expected to set a new standard for seamless trading experiences. Additionally, Pepeto’s cross-chain bridge technology aims to redefine blockchain connectivity by allowing users to transfer assets effortlessly across networks. These developments not only strengthen Pepeto’s long-term potential but also reinforce its position as a leader in the evolving meme coin landscape. As the presale nears its conclusion, excitement around these utilities is at an all-time high. With the next crypto bull run on the horizon, PEPETO is emerging as one of the most promising contenders in the meme coin market. Pepeto landing a Binance listing While Wall Street Pepe eyes listings on exchanges like BingX, Gate.io, and MEXC, Pepeto’s combination of utility, price advantage, and market momentum has positioned it as a prime candidate for a Binance listing. Adding to the intrigue, rumors are swirling that an ex-founder of Pepe is involved with Pepeto, drawing further comparisons between the two projects. Given that PEPETO mirrors Pepe’s iconic 420T token supply, speculation continues to mount that a Binance listing could be in its future. Conclusion As the crypto world watches for the next breakout project, all eyes are on Pepeto as a top contender for Binance’s next meme coin listing. The countdown to the next major exchange listing has begun. To learn more about Pepeto, visit the website , Twitter , or Telegram .

Waters unveils bipartisan stablecoin bill ahead of House subcommittee hearing,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/waters-unveils-bipartisan-stablecoin-bill/,"Ranking member of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters has released proposed stablecoin legislation she and her colleague Patrick McHenry drafted during the previous session of Congress. She unveiled the bill on Feb. 10, the day before the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Asset, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence is scheduled to meet. The Waters-McHenry bill does not have a name yet. The lawmakers prepared the bill as a bipartisan team and had hoped it could be considered by the 118th Congress. McHenry retired as chair of the committee at the end of the congressional session. The bill is not what the committee is waiting for A press release from the Financial Services Committee Democrats said the bill created a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. It prevents non-financial commercial companies from issuing stablecoins and imposes restrictions. In addition, it includes consumer protections. The bill also “protects the existing authorities of the Treasury, CFPB, SEC, and CFTC with respect to any entity covered by the Act.” This is problematic, as the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) is under fire from the new administration. At the time of writing, that agency’s homepage displays a 404:Page Not Found error message. Water’s goal in releasing the draft bill is not immediately evident. The agenda for the Feb. 11 Financial Services subcommittee meeting includes a discussion of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, but not the Waters-McHenry bill. The Senate has the GENIUS Act on stablecoins The STABLE Act, authored by Republicans French Hill and Bryan Steil, was released on Feb. 7. A press release from the Financial Services Committee said it builds on McHenry’s efforts. Hill is now the chair of the committee and Steil is the chair of the digital assets subcommittee. The committee promised in its press release to work with Senate members in the Bicameral Working Group on Digital Assets to pass stablecoin legislation. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS Act) was introduced into the Senate on Feb. 4. The Senate bill was drafted by Bill Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Democratic Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis.

The strongest candidate for the next string of ETF approvals is, apparently, Litecoin—the experts note its favorable regulatory standing, which CFTC cleared out in its KuCoin lawsuit. The commodity status distinguishes the fork of Bitcoin (often referred to as the ”silver” to Bitcoin's “gold”) from assets that could be potentially considered unregistered securities. Meanwhile, much to the dismay of its ironclad fanbase, XRP has the lowest chance (65%) of approval, according to analysts, trailing behind Litecoin (90%), Dogecoin (75%), and Solana (70%). Balchunas noted that for their predictions, they only considered ETF filings structured similarly to BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which operates under the '33 Act framework. However, should the SEC greenlight the initial applications, the alternative ETF formats—such as those based on futures contracts or Cayman Islands subsidiaries regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940—could also have a path to approval. “Keep in mind all of this stuff (except Litecoin which was always high) was True to their name, some members of XRPArmy chimed in to defend their favorite coin against FUD, arguing against the “NO” put for XRP under the header “Does SEC currently view as commodity?”. A Twitter/X user @OnChainMayo pointed out that while the SEC appealed the decision in favor of Ripple, it didn’t contest the XRP status as a commodity. In response, Seyffart clarified that until all litigation between SEC and Ripple is settled, the prospect of XRP ETF will remain a far-off goal. Although the 19b-4 filings for DOGE and XRP will likely be acknowledged already this week, any meaningful development would have to wait until the end of 2025, when the SEC and Commissioner Heaster Peirce's Crypto task force are expected to start clearing the backlog of security vs commodity lawsuits left by previous leadership. On Monday, NASDAQ formally filed 19b-4 forms for Coinshares’ XRP and Litecoin ETFs, following the same filing from Cboe last week for spot XRP exchange-traded funds managed by WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary. For a crypto ETF to launch in the US, two key approvals are typically required: S-1 and 19b-4. The S-1 is a registration statement filed by the ETF issuer to register the fund with the SEC, while the 19b-4 is submitted by the exchange seeking permission to list and trade the product. Once the 19b-4 is submitted, the SEC must formally acknowledge the filing and publish it in the Federal Register. This marks the start of a public comment period, during which industry stakeholders and the public can provide feedback. After the comment period, the SEC has up to 240 days to review the application and decide whether to approve or reject it.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BTC|BTG|LTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-11 00:21:57

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Big money is shifting from DOGE and SHIB to RCO Finance, as its DeFi model attracts over $13 million in investments. Table of Contents Dogecoin: Still holding meme coin credibility Shiba Inu: From underdog to household name RCO Finance: An AI-powered alternative Conclusion Big money is flowing in unexpected directions. After years of hype around Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), a wave of traders is setting their sights on RCO Finance (RCOF). With the token priced at $0.1, a colossal breakout may be on the horizon. Market participants recall how Dogecoin turned small bets into fortunes during its heyday, while Shiba Inu shocked the crypto world with sudden, viral growth. Now, cracks in the meme-coin model are prompting a shift toward advanced tools and analytics. Against this backdrop, investors have funneled over $13 million into the new contender. Dogecoin: Still holding meme coin credibility No discussion of meme coins is complete without mentioning Dogecoin , which soared from fractions of a cent to nearly a dollar. Its spirited community and endorsement by high-profile figures drew millions of newcomers into the crypto space. However, the coin’s price has stalled well below its all-time high. Some observers argue it relies too heavily on cultural moments and viral social media bursts. While it continues to rank among the top digital assets, with a market cap of $37.89 billion, long-term investors yearn for a more reliable growth path. Shiba Inu: From underdog to household name If Dogecoin is the original meme coin juggernaut, Shiba Inu is its most famous protégé. Billed as the “Dogecoin killer,” it transformed investments into life-changing sums for those who got in at the right time. Its rapid ascent and playful branding made it a social media star, dominating headlines and amassing a loyal global following. Shiba Inu claims a multi-billion-dollar market cap, yet volumes rarely breach the billion-dollar mark. Ecosystem additions like decentralized exchanges and NFTs have helped sustain momentum, but the token hasn’t matched its previous meteoric spikes. That’s left many holders pondering whether the coin’s glory days are behind it — or if a second renaissance is still possible. You might also like: DOGE hints at ascending triangle formation, this alternative eyes a rally RCO Finance: An AI-powered alternative RCO Finance is an emerging force in decentralized finance. Priced at $0.1, its token has already attracted over $13 million in backing, spurring curiosity about whether it can deliver a massive rally. But RCO Finance is no ordinary project. A non-KYC DeFi hub, it will let users buy stocks, bonds, and even real estate directly with cryptocurrency, bypassing cumbersome fiat steps. This practical integration of traditional and digital assets sets it apart. Core to RCO Finance’s appeal is the Robo Advisor, a machine learning engine that aggregates market signals from Bloomberg and Reuters, along with on-chain analytics and social media sentiment. The Robo Advisor emphasizes data accuracy and timing. It excels in spotting breakout tokens early, advising users when to mitigate risk, and prompting them to take profits when momentum cools. A striking example would be the Newton Project (NEW), which jumped from $0.0018 to $0.0127 — a 5,470% leap. By sifting through global news feeds, RCO Finance aims to give traders a head start on similar trends. The platform’s emphasis on user control is evident in its beta platform , which lets participants test advanced features before the full release. A SolidProof audit confirms the code’s security, giving large-scale investors and retail participants a sense of reliability. Conclusion RCO Finance’s approach aligns with a maturing crypto environment where data matters more. With its token at $0.1 and upward of $13 million raised, RCO Finance has proven it can draw big money from all market corners. The current buzz suggests this might be the beginning of a longer, potentially explosive chapter in the crypto’s evolving story.

As of today, BTC’s price has steadily climbed, hovering above $97,000 at the time of writing—a 1.3% gain in the past day. Amid this Bitcoin price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Lion has identified a meaningful decline in leverage and open interest (OI) ratios since November 21, following the presidential election. What does this indicate for the Bitcoin market? Related Reading: Could Fear Fuel Bitcoin’s Comeback? Analyst Spots a Surprising Pattern Leverage Ratio Decrease And Its Implications In a recent QuickTake post titled “Leverage ratio decreased. Risk Off,” Crypto Lion explained that the leverage ratio of Bitcoin has fallen, along with the derivatives buy-sell ratio and the OI-to-market-cap ratio. This suggests a gradual unwinding of leverage as more Bitcoin leaves centralized exchanges (CEXs). The analyst also highlighted that much of this Bitcoin has shifted to Coinbase Prime or been used to back exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating a shift toward long-term holding and possibly a broader “risk-off” stance among large investors. The analyst particularly wrote: The large decrease in the leverage ratio means that OI is decreasing relative to the CEX BTC reserve. It is important to note that the CEX reserve has been declining for a long time and has been moved to the coinbase prime and bought to back ETFs. This means that risk-off may be more advanced than it appears. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach 2022 Levels Adding to this narrative, another CryptoQuant analyst, Papi, reported a significant development in Bitcoin’s exchange dynamics. According to Papi, the largest net outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges since 2022 occurred last week, reducing the supply of Bitcoin on these platforms by 3%. The last time outflows reached a comparable scale was shortly after the collapse of FTX, a major exchange event that reshaped market sentiment. This latest exodus of Bitcoin from exchanges may signal growing confidence among institutional players and long-term holders. Despite recent price fluctuations, large buyers appear to be “stacking on dips,” as Papi noted. This behavior suggests that these entities anticipate future price appreciation and are accumulating while prices remain comparatively low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Signals Short-Term Holders Have Been Taking Profits – Is The Next Rally Near? The shift of funds off exchanges into private wallets or institutional custody often reflects a strategy of long-term holding rather than short-term trading, potentially providing a stable foundation for future market growth. Looking ahead, the reduced leverage ratios, coupled with significant outflows from exchanges, could point to a more cautious yet optimistic market sentiment. If these patterns continue, they may set the stage for a more sustained recovery in Bitcoin’s price and a shift toward healthier market conditions over time.

According to data insight from Santiment, Layer-1 networks have collectively seeing 44.2% of social discussions on specific coins. This shift, the analytics firm imply might mean a potential return to the bull era. Bitcoin, Toncoin and L1 Protocols Back In Limelight According to Santiment on X , memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and PEPE are currently being discussed less in the market. The platform attributed this shift to the recent volatility that pushed the dominance of speculative altcoin price behind. The data giant acknowledged that Bitcoin and L1s like Ethereum and Toncoin are the foundational infrastructure in the industry. It noted that the increased focus on these assets by traders often signals market maturity. It hinted that an L1 focus is a sign investors are prioritizing security, innovation and real world adoption. Per the Santiment insight, memecoin frenzies generally come before the market falls. Historically, it noted that speculative excesses often lead to sharp reversal when the hype has faded. However, it pointed out that this shift implies a more balanced market will emerge once the excessive leverage bets are wiped off. Is Bitcoin, Toncoin and L1s Ready for Rally? According to the Santiment projection, a shift away from memecoin is proof that the market might be tilting toward sustainable trends. It confirmed that the gambling mindset associated with memecoins is paving the way for better fundamentals. This forecast aligns with speculations from analysts that the altcoin selling will stop soon, paving the way for rapid rebound. As of writing, BTC price was changing hands for $97,380.20, up 1.81% in 24 hours. The sentiment has also trickled down to Ethereum, Toncoin, and Cardano. These altcoins are up 1.44%, 0.56% and 3.30% to $2,668, $3.806 and $0.7172 respectively. While it remains unclear whether the bull run is finally return, Santiment is optimistic the market is in a healthy cool-down period. Altcoins With ETF In Spotlight Altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin are in the spotlight owing to the growing push for spot ETFs to track their prices. As reported earlier by CoinGape, Grayscale has filed for Cardano ETF with the US SEC. The growing number of crypto ETF applications has signaled that a massive adoption era is on enroute.

The market risks from AI and crypto have not stopped these traders from continuing to pile into leveraged funds to make trading gains in stocks such as Microsoft, Tesla, and semiconductor companies. Retail traders drive surge in leveraged tech and crypto ETFs As of last week, assets in long equity leveraged ETFs stood at about $95 billion. These funds, designed to magnify stock movements by two or three times, have outpaced their bearish counterparts, which collectively hold just $9 billion. Athanasios Psarofagis, an ETF analyst, said the market is extremely attractive for ‘degen traders’ as ETF investors see the nearly euphoric sentiment, a constant ‘buy the dip’ approach and a record number of leveraged products. These traders generally pursue high-risk and leveraged investments. The leveraged ETFs that focus on technology have been particularly positive. The MSFU and SOXL from Direxion Daily have both seen back-to-back weeks of inflows. The TSLL also saw its net asset growth over the past ten weeks, which hasn’t been seen since 2023. The link between cryptocurrency and ETFs has also witnessed a strong rebound in retail participation. The 2X Ether ETF (ETHU) saw its highest weekly inflows after a drop in the price of Ether. The fund’s retail trading was triggered by a social media promotion from Eric Trump, and the fund saw the highest cash inflows to date. Analysts raise concerns over leveraged ETFs amid rising speculation There are concerns about the sustainability of leveraged ETFs. These funds are usually meant for short-term traders because high-frequency trading products can result in substantial tracking errors over extended periods. Therefore, some individuals may be using these products the wrong way and lose a lot of money in the current volatile markets. “The speculation is there,” noted Jim Chanos, founder of Chanos & Co., in an interview with Bloomberg Television. “Not quite where it was in 2021 — which was the most speculative market I have seen — but it is getting back there.” The dominance of long-leveraged ETFs in the market is evidence that retail traders are still positive about the market. As long as tech firms’ earnings keep on growing and monetary policy remains lax, the speculative frenzy may not subside. However, not all leveraged ETFs have been enrolled in the boom. NVDL, the Direxion Daily NVDA Bull 1.5X Shares, lost clients last week after Direxion’s fund had attracted a record rise the week before. Indeed, Direxion’s fund on the opposite side of AI and big data (AIBD) has also fared poorly and has built assets of less than $2 million over the last nine months.

Crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 124,300 followers on the social media platform X that Solana appears to be trading in an ascending channel – a pattern suggesting that an asset is in an uptrend. According to Martinez, Solana seems to be holding the diagonal support of the pattern, indicating that a rise to the top end of the channel is on the table. “Solana SOL is testing a key support level at the lower boundary of this parallel channel.

Looking at Solana’s on-chain activities, Martinez notes that the network is seeing strong adoption. “The Solana SOL network is expanding at a strong pace, with over 5 million new addresses created per day!” Source: Ali Martinez/X As for Bitcoin, Martinez says that more than $6.794 billion worth of BTC have been taken out of crypto exchanges in the last seven days. “Over 70,000 Bitcoin BTC have been withdrawn from exchanges in the past week, signaling long-term confidence!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $96,932.

Ethereum (ETH) price action has been a hot topic, with the asset trading around $2,610 after a recent drop. Analysts are eyeing a bullish breakout, with a four-year ascending triangle pattern pointing to a potential $7,500 target. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price has shown resilience, with a 5,277% surge in large-holder netflows hinting at growing accumulation. Despite this, the burn rate has slowed, and trading volume has dipped, raising questions about its short-term momentum. While traders navigate these shifts, Web3Bay is turning heads in the web3 crypto space. Its 3BAY token isn’t just another presale—it’s a gateway to real e-commerce utility. With rewards for both buyers and sellers, early supporters have a chance to secure a strong position before prices climb higher. Web3 Crypto Shopping: How Web3Bay Rewards Buyers and Sellers Web3Bay is setting up a new way to buy and sell online, and its 3BAY token is at the center of it. Unlike traditional platforms that take a cut from every sale, Web3Bay removes middlemen, lowers costs, and gives back to users. Sellers keep more of their profits, while buyers get better prices—all powered by blockchain and smart contracts. The 3BAY token is more than just a payment method; it’s a reward system that benefits both sides. Users can earn discounts, cashback, and governance rights, letting them have a say in how the platform develops. The Web3Bay presale is quickly gaining momentum, with over 280 million tokens sold and $1.1 million raised so far. Right now, 3BAY is priced at $0.004562625, with higher price stages ahead before its final launch price of $0.1959. Early supporters stand to benefit from these increases, locking in their position before demand drives prices higher. This isn’t just another web3 crypto presale—it’s a real utility token tied to a working e-commerce model that’s built for long-term growth. Web3Bay is offering a more direct way to use crypto. With flexible payment options—including both crypto and traditional methods like PayPal (planned integration)—the platform makes it easy for anyone to participate. This isn’t just another speculative token; it’s changing how online shopping works. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action Signals a Big Move Ahead Ethereum (ETH) price action has been unpredictable, with the asset trading around $2,610 after a recent pullback. Analysts are watching a four-year ascending triangle pattern, which suggests a potential breakout to $7,500. If this structure holds, Ethereum could see a strong upward move. At the same time, the SEC’s delay on Ethereum ETFs has kept market sentiment uncertain. However, more than 50% of Ethereum validators support a gas limit increase, which could improve network efficiency and lower fees. Despite short-term volatility, Ethereum remains a key player in the market, with increasing adoption and developer activity. While traders focus on price levels, long-term holders see Ethereum’s growing use case in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts as reasons to stay confident. If momentum picks up, ETH could be gearing up for its next major run. Shiba Inu Price Sees Big Holder Moves While Burn Rate Slows Shiba Inu price has been showing mixed signals, with a 5,277% surge in large holder netflows pointing to increased accumulation. This suggests that major wallets are stocking up, which could set the stage for future price moves. At the same time, a whale transaction of 3.36 trillion SHIB tokens ($51.15 million) has raised speculation about market activity. Despite this buying pressure, trading volume has dropped below $400 million, and the burn rate has slowed by 61%, signaling a potential cooling-off period. While traders focus on Ethereum (ETH) price action, Shiba Inu continues to rely on community strength and long-term utility development. However, with the top 10 wallets controlling 61.3% of SHIB supply, the risk of volatility remains. If accumulation continues, SHIB could see stronger momentum ahead. Summing Up Ethereum (ETH) price action is showing signs of a potential breakout, with analysts watching a $7,500 target while network upgrades could improve efficiency. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu price has seen major accumulation from large holders, but its burn rate slowdown raises questions about its next move. Both assets remain closely followed, with traders looking for momentum shifts. While these established tokens navigate market shifts, Web3Bay is offering something different. The web3 crypto project isn’t just about speculation—it’s building a decentralized e-commerce ecosystem where buyers and sellers earn real rewards. With over 280 million tokens sold and $1.1M raised, the 3BAY token is positioning itself for strong growth. As presale prices rise toward $0.1959, early supporters have a chance to lock in lower prices before demand increases.

However, this savvy analyst concludes that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token has a greater potential to deliver a 100x surge much sooner. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The DeFi Vanguard Set to Deliver 100x Returns The WallitIQ (WLTQ) token’s position is well-established in the crypto space as a valuable asset with immense utility and potential for massive price increases. The token’s extensive utility is recognized globally among investors, offering passive income opportunities to those who buy and stake them to earn up to 180% APY. Moreover, the token is usable for paying transaction fees, curbing the hassle of converting other cryptocurrencies. Governance participation further boosts token holders, allowing them to impact the platform’s evolution and guaranteeing its development aligns with investor interests. Experts’ verified analysis projects that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is in line for an astonishing 100x price surge. This means that if the token, currently available in the presale at $0.0420, reaches its target, early investors could witness life-altering gains. Picture yourself investing $1,000 today; at the projected 100x value, you could potentially earn $100,000 in profits. The same goes for a $10,000 stake; the potential ROI is $1 million, and $100,000 worth of the token could result in returns exceeding $10 million only if you seize the opportunity now, before the imminent launch of the beta platform. Beyond ROIs, investors are signing up to the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform for its top-of-the-line security features like the Push Protocol technology that delivers real-time on-chain notifications, maintaining the transparency and security of every transaction. The platform also features Physical 2 Digital (P2D) technology that allows users to easily integrate physical assets, such as collectibles, with digital tokens. By bridging physical and digital finance, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform significantly broadens the scope of DeFi and tokenized assets. This blend of the physical and digital positions the platform in an area that few other projects have approached. Additionally, its CoinMarketCap listing and SolidProof smart contract audit add gloss to its reputation as a transparent platform. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform also makes provision for users to access live market data through the CoinGecko API integrated into the crypto wallet management mobile app. The app offers comprehensive real-time sentiment analysis and advanced biometric authentication. This real-world utility and a fast-selling presale provide more than enough incentive for you to jump at the discounted price of $ 0.0420 and acquire as many tokens as you’d expect to benefit from ahead of the anticipated 100x rally. Dogecoin Price: Will DOGE’s Potential Rebound Sustain? In recent days, the Dogecoin price has experienced a sharp move to the upside, sending DOGE to new heights. However, many experts caution that such Dogecoin price movements may be short-lived. The volatility of the Dogecoin price, driven primarily by speculative trading and social media hype, raises questions about its long-term sustainability. While DOGE once enjoyed monumental gains, its future prospects appear increasingly uncertain as market fundamentals shift. DOGE faithfuls watching the Dogecoin price must consider whether the current surge is temporal or a precursor to lasting growth. As the Dogecoin price shows signs of overextension, many DOGE investors are reevaluating their portfolios and seeking safer, more rewarding alternatives. Conclusion: Get 100x ROI Faster With WallitIQ (WLTQ) While the Dogecoin price rally is sparking momentary enthusiasm, the underlying fundamentals of DOGE may not support sustained, long-term gains. In contrast, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) token is emerging as the definitive altcoin for forward-thinking investors. With its advanced AI-driven technology, intuitive multi-asset management , and competitive staking rewards, the valuable token is set to deliver a 100x surge that could transform modest investments into life-changing fortunes.

However, Dogecoin (DOGE) has captured the spotlight with its meme-driven popularity, and a new AI crypto is set to make a far more significant impact. WallitIQ (WLTQ) —an innovative, AI-driven platform that promises to redefine the future of digital assets. Dogecoin’s $5 Ambition? Experts Predict DOGE Won’t Make It Dogecoin (DOGE) has sparked much speculation, with some enthusiasts hoping it will reach $5. However, experts caution that such a goal seems unrealistic. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at around $0.26, and reaching $5 would require an increase of 610% to 1,082%, a level rarely seen in the crypto market. Experts note that Dogecoin’s (DOGE) speculative nature and lack of tangible utility make this target even more difficult. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks strong use cases or institutional adoption, limiting its growth potential. Additionally, broader market conditions and Bitcoin’s performance may impact Dogecoin’s (DOGE) future. As experts suggest, the dream of Dogecoin (DOGE) reaching $5 remains unlikely, making it a risky bet for long-term investors.

Well turns out it is a logjam of confirmation hearings. The Senate has nine cabinet members in line ahead of Atkins, and no one knows exactly when his turn will come. His hearing before the Senate Banking Committee hasn’t even been scheduled. Until it is, nothing moves forward, and the full Senate vote remains out of reach. The wait is becoming a problem for Trump’s crypto-friendly agenda, which can’t hit full throttle without Atkins at the wheel. Gary Gensler, former president Biden’s anti-crypto SEC chair, also had to wait, as he was nominated in January 2021 but didn’t get Senate confirmation until April. Jay Clayton, who served during Trump’s first term, wasn’t confirmed until May 2017, despite also being nominated in January that year. History is repeating itself, but this time, the stakes for the crypto industry are much higher. Hester Peirce leads the SEC’s crypto reset amid delays In the meantime, Hester Peirce is holding the line. Known as “Crypto Mom” in the community, Hester is now in charge of the SEC’s newly formed crypto task force , which is on a mission to repair the damage done under Gary’s leadership. “It took us a long time to get into this mess, and it is going to take us some time to get out of it,” Hester wrote. She is of course referring to the chaos left by Gensler, who spent much of his tenure suing major crypto firms instead of providing clear rules. The former SEC chair repeatedly said that most digital assets qualified as securities, leaving companies guessing what would trigger a lawsuit. Hester criticized this “regulation by enforcement” approach, promising that the task force would take a different approach. “The crypto road trip on which the newly announced crypto task force has embarked likewise should be more enjoyable and less risky than the crypto road trip the Commission has taken the industry on for the last decade,” Hester wrote. President Trump campaigned on promises of deregulation, and he even launched his own Solana-based meme coin before taking office on Jan. 20. The very next day on Jan. 21, Trump signed an executive order for a digital asset stockpile. Crypto’s hero, Wall Street’s hero Meanwhile, on the other side, Wall Street’s waiting for a savior to breathe life back into the sluggish IPO market, and they think Atkins might be the guy. President Trump’s pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has investors hoping for fewer rules, fewer headaches, and a wave of new stock-market debuts. Under Gary Gensler, bankers felt like they were drowning in regulations. Gary loved enforcement actions over there too and pushed for stricter rules on corporate disclosures, which Wall Street blamed for choking off IPOs. Now, with Atkins—who served on the SEC under George W. Bush—potentially taking over, the industry is betting on a more business-friendly approach. If confirmed, Atkins is expected to review key banking regulations passed during the Biden era, potentially rolling back policies that companies view as obstacles to going public. But even Atkins can’t fix everything. Wild stock market swings, like those seen in Trump’s first week back in office, make it tough for companies to pin down their valuations. IPOs hate uncertainty. The bigger problem though is that many companies are staying private longer because they have access to insane amounts of private capital. On top of that, public listings come with expensive regulations and the risk of lawsuits. The Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes during the pandemic didn’t help either, slamming the brakes on new listings. Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda admitted in January that some of the rules passed over the past four years have added burdens that could “negatively affect companies’ willingness to go public.” Atkins might be tasked with cleaning up that mess. Atkins hasn’t laid out any concrete plans for the SEC yet, but some insiders are expecting his confirmation to happen this month. But even if he does get confirmed, he likely won’t step into the role until March. He has already pointed out key problems making public markets less attractive. “One is the cost of regulation and two, other things like the fear of litigation,” Atkins famously said in a 2017 Bloomberg TV interview.

It allows people to send money directly to each other without banks or middlemen. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin uses a network of computers to keep track of transactions in a shared ledger called the blockchain. Miners confirm these transactions by solving complex puzzles. They get rewarded with new bitcoins for their efforts. This process ensures that the system is secure and resistant to fraud. Every four years, the rewards for mining are cut in half in an event called “halving,” which controls the supply. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. Today, Bitcoin is seen by many as digital gold. Its potential lies in its ability to provide a global, decentralized financial system. Investors find it attractive due to its limited supply and increasing mainstream adoption. Others point out challenges like price swings and competition from newer coins. Conclusion While established coins like BTC perform well, XYZ unites sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem, aiming for 20,000% growth in this bull run.

The investment is part of the European country’s plan to become a competitive hub for AI development, just as the US is currently. Macron announced the news during a two-day artificial intelligence summit which took place in Paris. Key investors were from private and public sectors The deal includes a mix of new and previously announced investments from Amazon.com Inc., Brookfield Asset Management, and Apollo Global Management Inc. A significant portion of the funding also comes from the United Arab Emirates, which is committing €50 billion ($51 million), according to officials in Macron’s office. Since ChatGPT’s launch over two years ago, countries have struggled to outdo each other as they race towards becoming AI superpowers. Tech firms have also invested billions in the various industries that make AI computing possible. These include computer chips, data centers, and energy projects that support building more advanced artificial intelligence systems. However, while the rest of the world is embracing AI and making new waves, Macron and some others are worried Europe, which responded to the birth of AI with caution and regulation that stifled growth, is lagging behind the US and China on AI development. More investment plans involving France Macron’s latest announcement highlights France’s commitment to advancing AI technology. He likened the scale of the AI investment in France to Donald Trump’s Stargate announcement. The joint venture between OpenAI, SoftBank Group Corp. and Oracle Corp. will commit about $500 billion to AI infrastructure over the next four years. That amount is almost x5 the total investment touted by Macron. Nearly half of the funds announced by Macron will come from the UAE, which previously had an agreement to invest between €30 billion and €50 billion, according to what the officials said. Emirati ruler Mohamed bin Zayed reportedly promised Macron over dinner last week to spend €50 billion. Meanwhile Brookfield said Sunday that it also plans to invest €20 billion to develop data centers and AI infrastructure in France over the next five years. Other investments include €5 billion from Apollo to boost energy connectivity, €5 billion from US-based Digital Realty to build data centers, and €10 billion for UK company Fluidstack to put together a supercomputer. Amazon is also one of the companies investing in France’s AI pursuit. It plans to invest €6 billion to create a data center and work on cloud infrastructure, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The e-commerce platform announced plans last year to invest more than €1.2 billion in the development of its cloud infrastructure services in France by 2031. This is part of the €6 billion from Amazon, the officials have said. The AI projects mentioned above are expected to be developed over the next two to five years. If President Emmanuel Macron’s initiative works, in the coming years, France could emerge as a leading destination for AI development, fostering both domestic and international collaboration in the sector.

Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum MAGACOINOFFICIAL is generating. Don’t Miss Out on MAGACOINOFFICIAL The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but MAGACOINOFFICIAL might just be that opportunity.

Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that charge high fees and limit user control, Web3Bay runs on blockchain, cutting out unnecessary costs and giving buyers and sellers more freedom. Holding 3BAY isn’t just about transactions—it’s about unlocking real perks like lower fees, access to exclusive deals, and future staking rewards. This shift could redefine online shopping, giving users more control over their purchases while earning along the way. One of the biggest advantages of 3BAY is its governance power. Instead of being stuck with platform rules set by corporations, users can vote on decisions that shape Web3Bay’s future. Whether it’s deciding on new features or platform fees, 3BAY holders have a say, making it a real Web3 crypto marketplace where users influence its direction. This is a major difference from centralized platforms, where users have little control over policy changes. With XRP value being watched closely for its role in digital payments, Web3Bay is showing how blockchain can be used beyond just trading. The 3BAY token makes online shopping cheaper and more rewarding while giving users more influence over the platform. As the demand for decentralized commerce grows, Web3Bay has raised more than $1.1 million and is currently seeing its 4th stage selling out in record time. Web3Bay tokens are priced at $0.004562. The project is positioning itself as the go-to marketplace for blockchain-powered shopping in 2025. XRP Value Gains Attention as ETF Hopes Rise XRP value is in the spotlight as discussions around an XRP-spot ETF heat up. With the price hovering around $2.40, analysts are watching how potential regulatory approvals could impact demand. The introduction of XRP Depository Receipts (DRs) is already making it easier for institutional players to gain exposure to XRP without buying directly from exchanges. If an ETF gets approved, it could drive even more adoption, similar to what happened with Bitcoin’s ETFs. Beyond market speculation, XRP’s legal battle with the SEC continues to see major shifts. A recent leadership change in the SEC’s legal team has fueled speculation about a resolution. At the same time, European markets have launched XRP-backed investment products, further expanding its accessibility. With all these developments, XRP’s next moves could be game-changing for its long-term value. Solana ETF Speculation Grows as Price Outlook Shifts Solana ETF discussions are gaining momentum, with Grayscale filing for a Solana-based fund and the SEC reviewing applications. Analysts predict that an approved ETF could fuel major price growth, with projections placing SOL at $520 by the end of 2025. Institutional interest is increasing, but recent market fluctuations have kept Solana’s price around $193, with traders waiting for the next move. Large transactions within the Solana ecosystem have also caught attention. The platform Pump.Fun has transferred over 1 million SOL (worth $208 million) to Kraken, raising speculation about liquidity shifts. Meanwhile, XRP value is being closely monitored alongside Solana’s developments, as both cryptos are at the center of growing institutional adoption. If ETF approvals come through, Solana could see a major shift in demand. Summing Up With talks of an XRP-spot ETF, institutional interest in XRP value is growing, and legal shifts could push it even further. Meanwhile, speculation around a Solana ETF is building, with analysts eyeing a potential rally if approvals come through. Both cryptos are in a critical phase, with market movements expected to accelerate based on upcoming regulatory decisions. While these assets fight for dominance, Web3 crypto is evolving beyond just trading. Web3Bay is proving that blockchain isn’t just about speculation—it’s about real-world use. The 3BAY token isn’t just for spending; it provides discounts, governance rights, and potential staking rewards. As crypto adoption expands, Web3Bay positions itself as a smarter way to shop, giving users more control and more ways to earn in 2025.

Since early December, Cardano has dropped over 61%, with its price action reflecting a persistent downtrend that has shaken investor confidence. Despite several attempts, the price has yet to show clear signs of reversing the bearish momentum that has dominated its performance over the past months. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Below $2,800 Resistance – Bulls Need A Higher Low To Recover Currently, Cardano is trading at a critical level, one that must hold to spark a potential change in its market trajectory. The importance of this level cannot be overstated, as losing it could lead to further declines and heightened uncertainty for ADA investors. However, hope remains on the horizon for Cardano bulls. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shared a promising technical signal, revealing that Cardano is beginning to show signs of a potential rebound on the daily chart. According to Martinez, key indicators are aligning to suggest that a recovery could be in the making, offering a glimmer of optimism for traders and long-term holders alike. The coming days will be crucial for Cardano, as it remains at a crossroads that could determine whether the current trend continues or a much-needed rebound finally takes shape. Cardano Could Start A Recovery Cardano could be on the verge of a recovery rally as it finds strong demand at current levels, with bears unable to push the price into lower demand zones. After months of persistent selling pressure and bearish sentiment, Cardano appears to be stabilizing, creating an opportunity for bulls to regain control. However, reclaiming key levels above the $0.72 mark will be critical to confirming the start of a meaningful recovery. Adding to this optimism, top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical signal on X, indicating that Cardano may be poised to rebound. Martinez highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on the daily chart, a development that has caught the attention of many ADA investors. The TD Sequential is a widely used technical analysis tool designed to identify potential price reversals and points of trend exhaustion, making it a valuable indicator during volatile market conditions. This positive signal offers a glimmer of hope for Cardano investors who have been waiting for a rally, not just for ADA but also across the altcoin market. If bulls can hold the current demand level and push the price above $0.72, a recovery rally could gain momentum in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Ethereum Stuck Below $2,800 Resistance – Bulls Need A Higher Low To Recover Breaking through this key level and sustaining higher prices will likely attract more buyers and fuel bullish sentiment, potentially marking the start of a new upward trend. However, failure to reclaim key levels could result in extended consolidation or further declines, making the next few days crucial for Cardano’s price trajectory. ADA Price Testing Crucial Demand Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.69 after enduring days of selling pressure and heightened volatility. Last Monday’s dramatic 38% drop, followed by an impressive 60% recovery, showcased the intensity of the current market conditions. However, despite the swift rebound, ADA has struggled to reclaim the $0.85 level, a critical resistance zone that bulls must conquer to establish a sustainable uptrend. For Cardano to gain momentum, it is essential for bulls to hold current price levels and push the price above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), which stands at $0.7225. This EMA serves as a crucial indicator of long-term strength, and a reclaim above it would signal renewed bullish momentum. Breaking above this level could pave the way for a rally, potentially bringing ADA closer to challenging the $0.85 mark again. Related Reading: Solana Holds Support Above Key Indicator – Expert Sees Push To ATH If Momentum Returns Failing to hold the current price or reclaim the 200-day EMA could lead to further consolidation or even another leg down, as market sentiment remains fragile. The coming days will be critical for ADA as it tests its ability to maintain support and establish a bullish trend. Investors will closely watch these key levels, as holding and breaking above them could signal the start of a recovery rally.

According to expert technical analysis, ETH has recently broken out of a symmetrical triangle pattern on the four-hour time frame. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical patterns, if ETH holds above the breakout area, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 10% to reach the $3,000 level in the near future. This shift in sentiment and recent breakout occurred after the overall cryptocurrency market began experiencing upside momentum, attracting significant attention from traders and investors. Ether Bullish On-Chain Metrics According to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass, ETH open interest (OI) has jumped by 6.50%, indicating rising participation and the formation of new positions, which supports a bullish outlook. However, Coinglass data also reveals that intraday traders are currently betting strongly on long positions. At press time, the major liquidation levels are near $2,620 on the lower side and $2,725 on the upper side, with traders being over-leveraged at these levels. If market sentiment remains unchanged and the price rises to the $2,725 level, nearly $100 million worth of short positions will be liquidated. Conversely, if sentiment shifts and the price drops to the $2,620 level, nearly $570 million worth of long positions will be liquidated. Source: Coinglass This liquidation data shows that traders are strongly betting on the long side, currently holding more than five times the value in long positions compared to short positions. Ethereum (ETH) Current Outlook With rising interest and bullish price action, Ether is currently trading near the $2,685 level, having surged over 4% in the past 24 hours.

Table of Contents The Trump pump Upgrades and listings for iDEGEN in February Conclusion President Trump has already been great for crypto — but with a new crypto-friendly SEC locked in, a crypto task force appointed, and new regulations making life easier for traders, things are about to get even better. iDEGEN, the AI agent being raised from scratch by degens on X, is primed to benefit from the great American crypto acceleration. It’s already raised over $20.4m in its viral presale, and with exchange listings due on 27th February, Trump’s stance on crypto could send IDGN to the moon once it hits the open market. The Trump pump Donald Trump campaigned heavily in crypto circles and has already come through on several promises — he even launched his own meme coin , bringing unprecedented levels of legitimacy to the cryptocurrency world. An executive order signed in week one of Trump’s presidency set out to promote the use of crypto, create a national reserve of digital currencies, and foster pro-crypto regulation in the US. At the same time, repealing the SAB 121 bill makes it far easier for American businesses to hold crypto — something that was far more difficult under Joe Biden. But there’s more: Trump has appointed both an SEC task force to create a more hospitable regulatory environment and a crypto council, as well as bringing crypto bulls David Sacks and Scott Bessent into the administration in major roles. The writing on the wall is clear: Biden’s hawkish crypto policies are over, suggesting potential for major bullishness for crypto at large. And with Project Stargate promising to take the US’ AI development to the next level as well, crypto AI projects like iDEGEN are uniquely positioned to benefit. You might also like: AI and crypto will come together in this Bitcoin cycle | Opinion Upgrades and listings for iDEGEN in February While major catalysts align in the macro environment, iDEGEN is undergoing some major upgrades — and has already dropped an absolute banger. Video content is now live: short-form works of art are being beamed worldwide via RedNote, one of the most popular platforms. The same entity that got banned twice from X for being too biased is now creating moving pictures across multiple channels; the viral potential speaks for itself. With exchange listings locked in for 27th February and the video upgrade already rolling, it’s a perfect storm of catalysts. The project has already raised $20.4m in its presale, with each upgrade driving new waves of buying pressure — with another upgrade on the horizon. iDEGEN has integrated DeepSeek, the viral open-source AI model blowing up the tech industry, to offer fans a new flavor of the chaotic agent. The original, uncensored model continues to post. Eventually, the community will decide whether the new iDEGEN will win — or whether the original, violent, chaotic model will win. One thing is certain: iDEGEN’s internal battle will cash in on DeepSeek’s hype, as well as giving the community some serious fireworks. The project is trending yet again, and could end in even more investment ahead of listings. Conclusion iDEGEN has proven its ability to attract both ardent supporters and haters, even turning multiple social media bans into million-dollar buying sprees. Each attempt to contain it only made it stronger, with the community growing more dedicated with every comeback, resulting in a $20.4m presale raise. With that amount already in the bag and even more developments on the horizon ahead of exchange listings, a massive rally could be in the cards. To learn more about iDEGEN, visit its website .

The token distribution of course comes after WazirX completed its rebalancing process for Net Liquid Platform Assets (NLPA), which realigns platform assets with its liabilities. WazirX’s recovery plan includes three main strategies: profit-sharing, stolen asset recovery, and the launch of a decentralized exchange (DEX). “We will do everything we can to help create value for our tribe,” Shetty said , addressing WazirX users directly. How WazirX will execute its first major token distribution The Singapore High Court greenlit WazirX’s parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd, to hold a meeting with its Scheme Creditors on January 23 where creditors will vote on whether to proceed with the Scheme of Arrangement, which includes the immediate distribution of rebalanced assets. If approved, creditors will receive compensation in the form of tokens rather than fiat, giving them market exposure for possible price appreciation. According to WazirX’s official blog post on the matter, users can now check their allocation on the platform’s First Distribution page, which shows their computed token breakdown, current market value, and their effective USD recovery percentage. Under Shetty’s post, a user raised concerns about the fluctuating token values and discrepancies in displayed balances. “NLPA value is different and current value in USD is different. Please explain,” the user asked. Shetty clarified that: “You get to keep any market upside or downside from here on.” The planned token distribution will be executed within 10 days of Scheme approval, according to WazirX’s blog, though certain tokens like ANT, LOVELY, PUSH, GFT, OOKI, MDX, BOB, and WRX, which have low market liquidity, will be partially distributed in their original denominations. Any remaining balance will be settled in USDT or another stablecoin, said the exchange. WazirX’s plans for future recoveries A creditor questioned Shetty directly: “If you currently display 85% USD value for July 18, 1 PM, where’s the 15% USD value? How are you going to show it?” Shetty confirmed that the missing portion ties directly to the newly issued RT tokens. According to WazirX’s statement, if the Scheme is rejected by the creditors, that would force them to wait until ownership disputes over the platform are resolved, a process the exchange believes will be messy and slow. WazirX also said that token prices are based on live market data from Coinmarketcap, and values are subject to change. By toggling between INR and USD, users can view their recovery amounts in real-time. But WazirX did warn that minor variances of up to 0.5% in recovery amounts are possible due to the large number of token transactions during rebalancing and crypto price volatility.

40176198,https://coingape.com/?p=238255,1739242447,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Maxine Waters Unveils New Stablecoin Regulation Draft Amid GOP Push,https://coingape.com/maxine-waters-unveils-new-stablecoin-regulation-draft-amid-gop-push/,"House Financial Services Committee ranking member Maxine Waters has introduced a new proposal for stablecoin regulation, adding to ongoing legislative efforts from both Democrats and Republicans. The draft legislation, obtained by Punchbowl News, outlines federal oversight of stablecoins and sets requirements for issuers. This development follows a separate Republican-led draft released last week, reflecting bipartisan efforts to establish clear rules for stablecoin regulation. Maxine Waters Proposes Stablecoin Regulation Draft Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, has introduced a discussion draft aimed at stablecoin regulation under federal supervision. The draft assigns regulatory responsibilities to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It also includes a role for state regulators. The proposal requires stablecoin issuers to maintain reserves on a one-to-one basis to ensure stability. Waters’ approach differs from previous Republican efforts, which she had previously criticized. In 2022, she opposed a Republican-led bill that would have allowed state regulators to approve stablecoin issuers without Federal Reserve involvement. Republican Lawmakers Push Separate Stablecoin Bill Like Maxine Waters, republicans are also advancing their own stablecoin regulation. Last week, Representative French Hill, Chair of the House Financial Services Committee, and Representative Bryan Steil introduced a draft bill. Their proposal gives the OCC the authority to oversee federally approved nonbank stablecoin issuers instead of relying on the Federal Reserve for regulatory oversight. The Republican-backed bill builds on past legislative discussions and could open the door for financial technology companies to enter the stablecoin market. It seeks to establish clear licensing rules for nonbank firms that issue payment stablecoins, aligning with broader GOP efforts to shape digital asset regulations. Bipartisan Efforts Continue in the Senate Concurrent with Maxine Waters proposal, Stablecoin regulation is also gaining attention in the Senate. Senator Bill Hagerty introduced the “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins” Act. His proposal aims to create a national framework for stablecoin oversight, focusing on risk management and compliance standards. A working group involving members from the Senate Banking Committee, House Financial Services Committee, Senate Agriculture Committee, and House Agriculture Committee has also been formed. Lawmakers in this group are working toward a broader regulatory framework for stablecoins and other digital assets. These bills have increased amid Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino’s concerns about competition in the stablecoin market. Stablecoin Rules a Priority Under Trump Administration The push for stablecoin regulation comes as digital assets remain a focal point in Washington. Under President Donald Trump’s administration, both parties have introduced competing proposals, signaling that stablecoin oversight is a legislative priority. Maxine Waters has emphasized the need for bipartisan cooperation, having previously called for a “grand bargain on stablecoins.” While past efforts to pass stablecoin legislation have stalled, ongoing discussions suggest a renewed push for regulation. Consequently, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers proposing different approaches, negotiations in Congress will likely continue in the months ahead.

The filing lands as Grayscale continues expanding its crypto offerings, with regulatory approvals on its radar thanks to president Donald Trump’s crypto-friendly administration. According to NYSE Arca, the proposed rule change would allow ADA to trade like a typical exchange-traded product, which it claims would “enhance competition” and benefit investors by opening up a new layer of market activity. The filing said: “The Exchange notes that the proposed rule change will facilitate the listing and trading of an additional type of exchange-traded product, and the first such product based on ADA, which will enhance competition among market participants, to the benefit of investors and the marketplace.” The ETF’s filing of course included a 19b-4 form, which is essential for any crypto ETF application. Once the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledges it, the proposal will be published in the Federal Register, which then kicks off the formal approval process. The SEC filing also revealed that Grayscale’s Cardano Trust won’t be actively managed. There’s no team of analysts trying to outperform ADA’s price or hedge risks. The trust is designed to simply track ADA’s value, minus expenses, according to the trust’s sponsors. Moreover, the trust isn’t registered under the Investment Company Act, which means it operates outside typical mutual fund regulations. NYSE Acra said the goal is to replicate ADA’s performance through an index price while giving investors a cost-effective alternative to directly owning the asset. The NAV per share is determined by dividing the NAV by the number of shares in circulation. The trust agreement details how ADA valuations are conducted, for the sake of price accuracy. XRP, Solana, Litecoin, and now Cardano Just last week, on February 8, Grayscale submitted its application to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF, though it isn’t alone. On February 7, Cboe submitted four 19b-4 filings to the SEC on behalf of WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary Capital—all wanting spot XRP ETFs approved. Meanwhile, Swedish asset manager Virtune AB entered the ADA game when it launched a Cardano exchange-traded product (ETP) on Nasdaq Helsinki on February 6. In late January, Tuttle Capital followed up with its own proposal—a 2x leveraged Cardano ETF designed to amplify ADA’s daily price swings. Grayscale, of course, already has Bitcoin and Ether ETFs trading on the US stock market. Grayscale has applied for DOGE, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs too.

While heavyweights like Chainlink (LINK), Ripple (XRP), and Sui (SUI) continue to dominate the conversation, a rising star is stealing the spotlight— Lightchain AI. With its groundbreaking blockchain innovations and explosive early momentum, Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as a high-growth contender. The numbers are already speaking volumes: $15.3 million raised in its presale and a token price of just $0.006. Early investors are taking notice, but how does it stack up against market leaders like LINK, XRP, and SUI? If you’re looking to transform $2000 into something extraordinary , let’s dive into what makes these four projects potential game-changers. Top Cryptos to Watch for 2025 – Chainlink (LINK), Ripple (XRP), and Sui (SUI) As of February 7, 2025, the crypto market is buzzing with activity, and a few standout coins are catching investors’ eyes. Chainlink (LINK) is priced at $18.69 today, with a slight dip of 2.56%. Despite this, its decentralized oracle network remains a game-changer, seamlessly connecting smart contracts with real-world data and reinforcing its vital role in the blockchain ecosystem. XRP, Ripple’s native token, is holding at $2.33, down 2.51% today. Even with recent fluctuations, it’s been on an impressive upward streak over the past year. Analysts are optimistic it could hit $5 to $7 in early 2025, fueled by Ripple’s innovations and easing regulatory challenges. Sui (SUI) is trading at $3.16, down 5.11% today. Known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds and scalability, Sui has captured attention as a high-potential investment. However, its volatility adds an extra layer of risk for adventurous investors willing to take the plunge. Which of these will define the next wave of crypto success? Stay tuned! Lightchain AI – New Contender for 2025 While LINK, XRP, and SUI have established themselves in the market, Lightchain AI is emerging as a strong competitor with unique blockchain-driven innovations. One of its standout features is its intelligent network optimization, designed to improve transaction speeds and ensure seamless execution even during high-traffic periods. This makes it an attractive alternative to traditional blockchains struggling with congestion. Another major factor in Lightchain AI’s appeal is its developer incentives program, which provides funding and resources to encourage the growth of decentralized applications. By supporting developers in creating real-world blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI is fostering a robust ecosystem that could drive significant adoption in the coming years. Verdict – Which Project Offers the Best Potential? Each of these four projects has the potential to deliver strong gains in 2025. Chainlink’s oracle services remain essential for smart contract functionality, Ripple’s institutional adoption continues to grow, and Sui is positioning itself as a leading Layer 1 network. However, Lightchain AI’s early-stage growth and commitment to blockchain innovation make it one of the most intriguing opportunities for investors looking to maximize returns. With its intelligent network optimization and developer incentives program, Lightchain AI is setting itself apart in the blockchain industry. For those willing to take an early bet on a high-potential project, Lightchain AI could be the breakout star of the next bull run.

XRP has plunged 26%, leaving traders questioning whether it will rebound or slide further. Meanwhile, Ondo (ONDO) is on the verge of a breakout, testing critical resistance levels as bulls push for higher price targets. But while these two assets battle technical levels, Web3Bay (3BAY) is rewriting the rules of crypto investing, offering something neither XRP nor Ondo can—real-world utility in the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. Web3Bay is not just another speculative asset; it is a blockchain-powered alternative to Amazon and eBay, eliminating middlemen and giving full control to users. With over $1.1 million raised and 290 million tokens sold, Web3Bay’s presale momentum suggests explosive potential far beyond the price swings of traditional crypto assets. XRP Drops 26%: Will It Rebound or Fall Further? XRP has fallen 26% in four days, now testing key support at $2.17. While the drop has raised concerns, it appears to be a normal market correction rather than a full reversal. XRP has maintained an overall uptrend for months, and its next move depends on whether buyers step in at this level. If XRP rebounds from $2.17, it could push back to the $2.60-$2.73 range, where the 50-day EMA currently sits. A breakout above this level would confirm strength and set the stage for another attempt at $3.00 in the coming weeks. Alternatively, XRP could enter a sideways consolidation phase between $2.17 and $2.40, allowing the market to stabilize and regain strength before its next major move. This scenario would give traders time to assess sentiment and volume before XRP picks a direction. Ondo (ONDO) Eyes Breakout as Price Targets $2 Ondo (ONDO) is showing signs of a potential breakout after bouncing from its recent low of $0.91. Following a prolonged correction, ONDO is now consolidating near $1.40, testing key resistance at $1.54. A decisive move above this level could signal further upside, with $1.77 and $2.10 as the next major targets. Technical indicators suggest bullish momentum is building. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recovered from oversold conditions, while the price is forming a base around $1.36, a critical Fibonacci retracement level. Analysts are watching for a breakout that could push ONDO into its next upward phase. Web3Bay: The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is revolutionizing the e-commerce landscape by eliminating intermediaries and creating a fully decentralized, user-controlled marketplace. Unlike platforms like Amazon and eBay, which impose high fees and restrictive policies, Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology to provide a trustless, transparent, and fee-efficient shopping experience. Through its 3BAY token, buyers and sellers have complete control over transactions, pricing, and platform governance. A major highlight of Web3Bay is its smart contract renouncement post-presale, ensuring that no central entity can manipulate the system. Governance is entirely handled by 3BAY token holders via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), making it one of the few truly community-driven marketplaces. Additionally, Web3Bay integrates staking rewards, allowing users to earn passive income while benefiting from lower transaction fees. The Web3Bay presale is gaining massive traction, having raised over $1.1 million, with 290 million tokens sold across multiple stages. Currently, 3BAY is priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, with a projected launch price of $0.1959—offering an estimated 4,200% ROI for early investors. Why Web3Bay Offers More Than Just a Short-Term Play Investors looking for a quick price recovery may find XRP’s $2.17 support level an attractive entry point, but the market remains uncertain, with a potential retest of $3.00 dependent on buying pressure. Ondo’s technical breakout setup offers upside, but it still faces major resistance zones before confirming a long-term trend. However, Web3Bay is in an entirely different league. While XRP and Ondo remain tied to market sentiment and price speculation, Web3Bay is actively disrupting a trillion-dollar industry. The platform’s smart contract renouncement, staking rewards, and decentralized governance make it one of the most promising crypto investments of 2025.

ETH might gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,740 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $2,700 level. The price is trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,700 and $2,740. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $2,920 resistance, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $2,800 and $2,700 support levels to move into a short-term bearish zone. The price dipped and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. The bulls appeared near the $2,525 zone. The price is now moving higher and attempting a fresh increase above the $2,600 level. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,700 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,740 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,850 or $2,910. A clear move above the $2,910 resistance might send the price toward the $2,950 resistance. An upside break above the $2,950 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,600 level. The first major support sits near the $2,525 zone. A clear move below the $2,525 support might push the price toward the $2,440 support or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $2,125 swing low to the $2,922 high. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,350 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,240.

Notably, short positions in ETH have soared by 500% since November 2024, indicating heightened bearish sentiment toward the digital asset. Institutional Investors Losing Faith In Ethereum? According to a recent post on X by The Kobeissi Letter, Ethereum price is witnessing mounting challenges as short positioning in the cryptocurrency has ballooned in recent times. Notably, ETH short positions are up 40% in the last week, while they are up 500% in the last three months. It is worth highlighting that this is the highest level ever that Wall Street funds have been short Ethereum. Earlier this month, the crypto market got an indication of this bearish ETH positioning, as the digital asset crashed 37% in 60 hours amid Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. Related Reading: Ethereum Poised For A Bullish Q1 2025? Here’s What Experts Say Interestingly, capital inflows to Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) were significantly high in December 2024. In just 3 weeks, ETH ETFs attracted more than $2 billion in new funds, with a record breaking weekly inflow of $854 million. However, hedge funds’ positioning on ETH suggests that they are not very confident in the cryptocurrency’s short-term price outlook. Several factors could be at play for institutional investor’s waning interest in ETH. For instance, ETH is currently trading almost 45% below its current all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 recorded way back in November 2021. In contrast, Bitcoin (BTC) has had a stellar 2024, hitting multiple new ATH, and commanding a market cap that is almost six times larger than that of ETH. The Kobeissi Letter attributes ETH’s current lacklustre price performance to potential “market manipulation, harmless crypto hedges, to bearish outlook on Ethereum itself.” However, the market commentator indicates that this excessive bearish outlook may set ETH up for a short squeeze. They add: This extreme positioning means big swings like the one on February 3rd will be more common. Since the start of 2024, Bitcoin is up ~12 TIMES as much as Ethereum. Is a short squeeze set to close this gap? ETH Short Squeeze To Initiate Altseason? A short squeeze on ETH could teleport its price to as high as $3,000, or even $4,000. However, according to seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez, ETH must defend the $2,600 support level to climb higher. Related Reading: Will Ethereum Bounce Back? Crypto Analysts Discuss Potential Price Recovery Recent reports indicate that ETH has likely bottomed, paving the way for a trend reversal to the upside. Another report by Steno Research suggests that ETH is likely to outperform BTC in 2025, with potential targets as high as $8,000. That said, concerns still remain about the Ethereum Foundation regularly dumping ETH. At press time, ETH trades at $2,661, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

Grayscale has taken another ambitious step in the crypto ETF race by filing a 19b-4 form with the SEC for a spot Cardano ( ADA ) ETF, marking the first-ever attempt to bring ADA into the U.S. spot ETF market.

First one in US and ballpark 60th crypto ETF filed this year so far pic.twitter.com/alj7EjtfIS — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) February 11, 2025 The move reflects Grayscale’s push to expand institutional access to digital assets beyond Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that this is roughly the 60th crypto ETF filing this year, highlighting the rapid pace at which asset managers are scrambling to secure approvals in a shifting regulatory era. The 19b-4 filing is a key requirement for listing a new ETF on an exchange, essentially a formal request for a rule change. Even if approved, a spot ETF also requires an effective S-1 registration statement before it can begin trading. Since the announcement, ADA has surged nearly 11% in 24 hours, reaching $0.74 as of this writing on Feb. 11. Despite the rally, the token remains 76% below its all-time high of $3.10, recorded in September 2021. The market’s reaction suggests growing optimism around altcoin ETFs, particularly as analysts anticipate more filings in the coming months. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Balchunas estimate a 90% chance for a Litecoin ( LTC ) ETF approval and 70% for Solana ( SOL ), both of which already have pending 19b-4 approvals. NEW: @EricBalchunas and I took a look at the filings for spot crypto ETFs. We're putting out relatively high odds of approval across the board.

The proposal, submitted by NYSE Arca on behalf of Grayscale, seeks to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Cardano Trust. This move positions Grayscale among other asset managers racing to launch crypto ETFs, and it also represents the first time Grayscale has offered a standalone product dedicated exclusively to Cardano, separate from its larger funds. Grayscale has already included Cardano in its Digital Large Cap Fund and Smart Contract Ethereum Fund, but this new trust would focus exclusively on ADA, offering both retail and institutional investors a more direct, cost-effective way to invest in Cardano without the complexities of acquiring and securing ADA themselves. “The proposed rule change is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors and the public interest in that there is a considerable amount of ADA price and market information available on public websites and through professional and subscription services,” the company said in the filing.

Recently, Virtune, a Finnish-based platform, filed for its own standalone Cardano ETP, and 21Shares launched a Cardano-based ETF with over $69 million in assets. The move by Grayscale, a trusted asset manager, is seen as a positive sign for Cardano’s long-term prospects.

Whether you’re a seasoned trader or someone just dipping their toes into the crypto world, finding the best crypto for huge gains can be a daunting task. With so many options out there, it can be tough to sift through the noise and figure out which coins are truly worth your investment. In today’s post, we’re diving deep into three prominent projects— Qubetics ($TICS), Monero, and Kaspa. All three have carved their niche in the digital finance space, but which one is primed for big returns? If you’re on the hunt for the best crypto for huge gains, buckle up, because we’re going to break down each project in detail and give you the scoop on why Qubetics might just be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. Now, as we dig into these coins, let’s talk about Qubetics. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that simply aim to provide a decentralized network, Qubetics promises to solve real-world issues that have hindered other blockchain projects in the past. With its unique interoperability and forward-thinking tech, Qubetics is poised to revolutionize how businesses, professionals, and individuals interact with blockchain. It’s time to find out why $TICS could be the best crypto for huge gains today. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Interoperability Qubetics has quickly grabbed the attention of crypto enthusiasts, and for a good reason. If you’ve been on the lookout for the best crypto for huge gains, Qubetics ($TICS) has the potential to deliver some of the highest returns in the industry. With its innovative interoperability solution, it stands out from the crowd by making it easier for businesses and individuals to bridge gaps between different blockchains. In ongoing Qubetics presale ,it has already sold more than 469 million tokens, raising over $12.4 million from more than 19,300 holders. The current price of $TICS is $0.0733 per token in Stage 21, and analysts predict significant growth once the presale ends. If you’re wondering why Qubetics could be the best crypto for huge gains, its scalability and integration potential give it a huge edge over older projects that have struggled with limited compatibility. One of the key features that make Qubetics stand out is its focus on interoperability. In an era where businesses are looking for seamless connections across multiple networks, Qubetics offers a simple yet powerful solution. Imagine a world where businesses can send transactions and exchange data between different blockchains without the need for complicated processes or third-party intermediaries. This is exactly what Qubetics brings to the table, ensuring that companies can leverage multiple blockchain ecosystems while maintaining a high level of efficiency. What sets Qubetics apart from the competition is how it addresses real-world problems. Many blockchain projects have faced issues related to scalability, security, and compatibility, but Qubetics has designed its network to solve these challenges. The team behind the project is committed to enhancing the user experience, and with the ongoing presale’s massive success, it’s clear that investors are excited about its potential. Monero: A Privacy-Focused Giant with Strong Demand Monero has been a leader in the cryptocurrency space for a long time, mainly due to its focus on privacy and security. As a privacy-centric coin, Monero has gained a loyal following among users who value anonymity in their transactions. For those seeking the best crypto for huge gains, Monero’s consistent performance in the market is an important factor to consider. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where transactions are traceable on the blockchain, Monero uses sophisticated cryptographic techniques to ensure that every transaction is private and untraceable. This has made it a go-to choice for individuals and businesses who prioritize confidentiality in their digital dealings. As privacy concerns continue to grow worldwide, the demand for Monero is likely to remain strong. Monero’s biggest strength is its ability to operate on a completely decentralized network with no central authority. This gives it a degree of resilience against government crackdowns or surveillance efforts, which is something that many other cryptocurrencies struggle with. It’s also highly liquid, meaning that users can easily buy or sell Monero on most major exchanges. However, one challenge Monero faces is its scalability. While privacy is a significant advantage, it does come at a cost in terms of transaction speeds and network congestion. As demand for Monero grows, the project will need to find solutions to these issues to maintain its position as one of the best crypto for huge gains in the long run. Kaspa: Speed and Scalability Make it a Contender Kaspa is another cryptocurrency that’s made waves in recent months, and for good reason. With its innovative consensus algorithm, Kaspa offers lightning-fast transaction speeds and impressive scalability. If you’re searching for the best crypto for huge gains, Kaspa might just be the underdog you should keep your eye on. What makes Kaspa stand out is its ability to process transactions at incredible speeds, even during high-demand periods. Unlike traditional proof-of-work blockchains, which can experience slowdowns as network traffic increases, Kaspa’s unique architecture allows it to scale effortlessly. This makes it an appealing option for developers and businesses looking for a high-performance blockchain solution. Kaspa has also garnered attention due to its commitment to decentralization. With thousands of nodes spread across the globe, it’s one of the most decentralized networks in the crypto space. This makes it a strong contender for anyone who wants to invest in a blockchain project that prioritizes security and resilience. While Kaspa shows great promise, its long-term success will depend on its ability to attract a large user base and developer community. If it can continue to innovate and scale effectively, Kaspa could be a top contender for the best crypto for huge gains in the future. Understanding Interoperability and Its Importance in the Future of Blockchain When it comes to blockchain technology, interoperability is one of the most crucial factors that will define the success of a project. Blockchain interoperability refers to the ability of different blockchain networks to communicate and share information seamlessly. For businesses and professionals, this is key to enabling efficient and secure transactions across various platforms. Qubetics has placed interoperability at the heart of its design, allowing it to connect multiple blockchains in a way that older projects simply can’t. This is what gives Qubetics a competitive edge, making it easier for users to access different services and networks while avoiding the complications that come with fragmented ecosystems. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, interoperability will play a critical role in determining which projects thrive and which ones fall behind. Conclusion: As we’ve explored in this article, there are several exciting crypto projects that have the potential for huge gains. While Monero and Kaspa each offer unique advantages, it’s Qubetics that truly stands out in terms of its interoperability, scalability, and real-world application. The ongoing presale has already sold over 469 million tokens, raising more than $12.4 million, which speaks volumes about its growing popularity among investors. If you’re looking for the best crypto for huge gains , don’t miss out on Qubetics. The potential for growth is staggering, with analysts predicting a 240% ROI by the end of the presale and up to a 20,000% ROI after the mainnet launch. With its cutting-edge solutions and strong market momentum, Qubetics ($TICS) might just be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.

As such, the agency has reportedly initiated discussions within a closed study group comprising experts to assess the current regulatory framework governing crypto assets. FSA’s Crypto Reform According to a report by ‘The Nikkei’ on February 10, the FSA intends to determine the direction of potential system reforms based on the study group’s findings by the end of June, after which it will seek opinions from the Financial System Council, scheduled to convene in the autumn. Following these discussions, the agency aims to draft and submit a bill to amend relevant laws during the 2026 ordinary Diet session. If the regulatory changes result in crypto assets being legally classified on par with securities, the approval of crypto asset spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in Japan may become a possibility. However, the specifics of the new framework remain under discussion. The key focus includes whether to incorporate crypto assets into the existing securities framework outlined in the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, introduce a new regulatory framework within the same law, or address them under the Payment Services Act. Additionally, deliberations will determine the scope of crypto assets subject to regulation, including whether restrictions should apply only to major cryptocurrencies. The debate over the classification of crypto assets has been ongoing. In August last year, the FSA Commissioner Hideki Ito stated that the approval of cryptocurrency-linked ETFs requires careful consideration. A few months later, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba adopted a cautious stance and questioned whether cryptocurrency should be made more accessible for public investment. During the same period, however, the domestic cryptocurrency industry has pushed for regulatory clarity. In October, the Domestic Cryptocurrency ETF Study Group, for instance, published a set of recommendations advocating for the establishment of cryptocurrency ETFs in Japan. Their proposals sought to prioritize major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, boosting the development of necessary regulatory frameworks and implementing a separate tax structure for cryptocurrency ETFs and spot transactions. Reluctance For Bitcoin Reserves in Japan Despite the latest news, Japan remains skeptical about adopting Bitcoin as part of its national reserves, citing concerns over security, liquidity, and volatility. Prime Minister Ishiba had recently stated that the country lacks sufficient information on international strategies, particularly from the US, making it difficult to take a definitive stance. While global interest in Bitcoin reserves is rising, Japan’s government insists that its foreign exchange reserves prioritize stability. Meanwhile, the Government Pension Investment Fund is exploring Bitcoin for diversification.

Per the Ukrainian-language media outlet Minfin , the comments came from the lawmaker Danylo Hetmantsev, the head of the Verkhovna Rada’s Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy. Hetmantsev claimed that the main text of the crypto “legalization” bill is “already fully ready.” Legalize Crypto: Ukrainian Lawmaker Says ‘Main Points’ of Bill Are ‘Ready’ Lawmakers, Hetmantsev added, are still discussing several issues. These include the way regulators and law enforcers apply “financial monitoring” methods to crypto transactions. Ukrainian lawmaker Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the Verkhovna Rada’s Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy. (Source: 373eva [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Hetmantsev added that the bill’s architects must finalize taxation-related matters before the draft law is sent to the Rada. No Disparity With TradFi? The lawmaker added that Kyiv will not offer any “bonuses or benefits” to companies and individuals who use crypto. Hetmantsev justified this stance by explaining that Kyiv has consulted “international experts on legalization issues.” These experts, he said, believe that any “preferential regime” could “create an uneven tax burden on traditional industries that use crypto.” On this weekend's episode of Reuters World News: What went wrong with Biden's arms shipments to Ukraine. Listen now: https://t.co/cmCP5gbahc pic.twitter.com/6nzw8HGJ5A — Reuters (@Reuters) February 10, 2025 Hetmantsev argued that Kyiv plans to ensure that crypto transactions are “taxed at a level similar to other investment assets,” with a “normal” system of tax rates. In some nations, crypto is taxed at a higher rate – or using a lower threshold – than investment in assets like stocks. What Issues Remain Unresolved? Lawmakers are reportedly still working on several issues. One of these is a proposed “transition period” for people “who have already invested in cryptoassets, but cannot provide proof of their purchases.” Hetmantsev also spoke about regulatory matters. He noted that the National Securities and Stock Market Commission “should take charge of crypto regulation.” However, he added that this body does not currently have the “institutional capability” to police the industry. Instead, he claimed, the central bank – the National Bank of Ukraine – may likely need to take temporary charge of the matter. “We still believe that, at this stage, the National Bank should take control of regulatory matters.” Danylo Hetmantsev, head of the Verkhovna Rada’s Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy. The National Bank of Ukraine in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Source: Max/Maxxcell [CC BY 3.0]) First Reading Imminent? Hetmantsev added that the long-awaited draft crypto law would be “ready for a first reading in the first quarter” of the year. This would presumably be followed by a return to the committee stage as bill architects continue to iron out wrinkles. Hetmantsev explained: “I can promise you for sure that we will do everything possible. We want to ensure that this law passes [the Rada] by the summer of this year at the latest.” At the end of 2024, Hetmantsev spoke about the imminent launch of a bill to “legalize crypto” in the “first and second quarters of 2025.” Yuriy Boyko, the head of the National Securities and Stock Market Commission, said this was a “very likely scenario.” Kyiv has previously revealed it has worked on the bill with representatives from the International Monetary Fund.

Pitchbook data from Feb. 7 shows that Q4 2024 funding rebounded modestly from Q3. However, the year closed at nearly the same level as 2023. Additionally, Q4 deal value climbed 13.6%, rising from $2.2b to $2.5. In contrast, the number of deals fell 14.6%, dropping from 411 to 351. The funding rebound shows that investors still back established teams and innovative technologies. However, the drop in deal count reveals growing investor selectivity—a trend that emerged in Q3. Meanwhile, Pitchbook senior analyst Robert Le explained that this shift reflects the crypto market’s normalization, with capital now focusing on fewer, more promising projects. “Three years ago, anyone could raise capital with a white paper and very little traction,” Le said. “Now, you’re seeing that’s not the case. Any founder going out to raise capital from the market right now has to really show a significant amount or traction or something else other than a technical white paper.” Stable Deal Flow, Escalating Valuations For the full year, crypto VC funding reached $10b from 1,940 deals, compared to $10.3b from 1,936 deals in 2023. Moreover, valuations surged across all funding stages in 2024. Seed-stage valuations jumped 70.2%, rising from $11.8m to $20m. Meanwhile, early-stage figures more than doubled—up 109% from $25m to $52.3m. In contrast, late-stage rounds increased modestly by 3.8%, moving from $43.7m to $45.3m. Overall, median valuations surged 78%, from $18m to $32.1m. This trend shows fierce competition at the earliest stages, especially for infrastructure and decentralized AI startups. Deal sizes mirrored the surge in valuations. For example, the median check at the seed stage jumped 20%, rising from $2.5m in 2023 to $3m in 2024. Similarly, early-stage medians increased by 26.9%, from $3.8m to $4.8m. Meanwhile, late-stage deal sizes dipped slightly by 1.6%, falling from $6.4m to $6.3m. Source: Pitchbook This trend suggests that founders at mature companies prefer smaller, more strategic rounds over larger checks from previous cycles. In addition, this cautious approach reflects uncertain exit conditions, ongoing macroeconomic pressure and a desire to minimize dilution while extending runway. Crypto Venture Capital Shifts Toward Infrastructure, AI and Strategic Acquisitions In Q4, investors focused on infrastructure projects that boost scalability, interoperability, and developer tooling. Meanwhile, investment in decentralized AI gained momentum. Since mid-2024, both crypto-native and traditional VCs have shown strong interest in these startups. In Q4, M&A activity continued, though at a slower pace than in Q2 and Q3. Additionally, deals still included exchanges, custodians and decentralized identity platforms. Meanwhile, strategic buyers targeted complementary capabilities instead of merely absorbing smaller competitors. In 2024, crypto venture capital investors proved resilient despite macro challenges and shifting US regulations . They pushed seed and early-stage valuations higher by funding promising projects in high-performance blockchains, stablecoins and tokenization. Conversely, late-stage firms raised smaller rounds to balance growth with caution. Looking ahead, Pitchbook said it expects further consolidation among infrastructure providers, exchanges and custody services. Moreover, investors plan to target next-generation protocols and AI-driven innovations. Although 2024 funding fell short of previous peaks, steady totals and strong valuations reveal a maturing market. This pattern mirrors trends in other tech sectors that have refined their strategies amid economic uncertainties.

The crypto’s intraday low and peak were $199.59 and $208.83, respectively. Despite the odds of an SOL ETF also gaining weight, the coin is yet to witness a pump alongside other altcoins.

Bitcoin is currently trying to rise above the $99,000 levels and is up by more than one percent in the last 24 hours. Cardano has climbed by more than 9% in the last 24 hours and Dogecoin has also gained 4%. As for XRP, it has been moving along with the market, and XRP/BTC is showing slight upward movement. However, nothing major is happening right now. XRP is still bouncing from a short-term support zone, ranging between $2.25 and $2.30. I f the price stays above this level, it could maintain the bounce. However, if XRP closes a daily candle below $2.25, the next support level is around $2, specifically between $1.95 and $2.05. On the upside, the resistance to watch is between $2.58 and $2.63. If XRP pushes above this zone, stronger resistance could be found around $3.20 to $3.30. Current Market Sentiment While XRP is still under a larger bearish divergence, which is impacting the price on the daily and 3-day charts, we are currently experiencing a short-term bullish divergence on the 8-hour chart. This has provided a brief relief from the downward trend, leading to some sideways movement or a small bounce. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Rally Imminent? 73% of Traders Go Long , Short-Term Outlook The current relief could continue for a few more days, but it’s important to note that this isn’t a full reversal into a bullish trend. It’s more of a pause in the ongoing bearish trend. A continued bounce or sideways movement is likely, but the overall market still faces pressure in the longer term. The SEC Case and XRP’s Future The big hurdle for XRP continues to be the ongoing legal battle with the SEC . Once this case is resolved, we could see a significant boost in XRP’s price, as all the positive momentum currently building up will likely surge at once. If the SEC case is settled, it could see XRP make bigger moves. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, some market watchers noted that ETH has tapped an “interesting level” against Bitcoin, which could signal the time to celebrate is not here yet. Related Reading: Analyst Says Prepare For Ethereum Price To Hit $17,000, Here’s Why Ethereum Holds Key Support Level Over a week ago, the crypto market saw its biggest retrace in months, sending Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies to monthly lows. Ethereum dropped to $2,120, hitting its lowest price range since the early August correction. Since then, ETH has moved within the $2,600-$2,830 price range, struggling to turn the range’s upper level into support for the past week. Yesterday’s market pullback, seemingly fueled by Donald Trump’s latest tariffs on steel and aluminum, saw Ethereum drop below the $2,600 support, a key resistance level before the Q3 2024 breakout. On Monday, the King of Altcoin reclaimed the recently lost support, trading above the $2,650 mark throughout the morning. Some market watchers noted that ETH remains in its “bounce or die” multi-year support. Ethereum has been in an uptrend support since 2022, retesting this trendline four times before. Each retest has been followed by a rebound to a key horizontal level in the following weeks. ETH faced resistance at the $1,900-$2,200 zone during the 2022 retests of the ascending trendline before breaking out. Meanwhile, the 2023 and 2024 rebounds saw ETH bounce from the uptrend support to face resistance at the $4,000-$4,100 levels. Market observer and investor Ted Pillows noted that Ethereum held its uptrend support since May 2023 after the recent retest, which could indicate that a rebound is near. If the pattern repeats, the cryptocurrency could break past the $4,100 resistance level and aim for new highs soon. ETH Price Action Resembles 2020-2021 Rally Ted also pointed out that ETH’s recent “capitulation candle” looked like March 2020’s. He explained that Ethereum recorded a major dump that led investors to believe the altcoin’s rally was over. However, the cryptocurrency bounced back, resulting in a “long-term structure breakout for Ethereum.” According to analyst Crypto Jelle, ETH currently trades in a multi-year ascending triangle, and the recent performance suggests that the next move “will be the real deal.” He noted that Ethereum’s next attempt would be the fourth retest of the $4,000 mark this cycle, which could “be the charm” as the resistance level weakens. A breakout and reclaim of this key resistance would potentially lead to a retest of the $4,878 all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: SUI Defies The Odds: Another Comeback From $2.8 Sparks Bullish Run Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that the ETH/BTC trading pair moved back to its 2016-2020 levels when it hovered between 0.023-0.036. The range’s upper zone served as a key resistance throughout these years, propelling ETH to ATH and local highs against BTC once turned into support. The trader considers that ETH/BTC could sit within this level “for quite a while” and that “the time to get excited again is when this retakes 0.036 at the very minimum.” As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,659, a 1.2% increase in the daily timeframe.

Now, with the crypto’s price dropping below the $0.25 range, investors who previously focused on meme coins also seem keen on finding projects with a use case. Top 3 Coins To Consider For High Returns In The Coming Weeks Bitcoin’s price movement, however, has resulted in even utility tokens taking a major price hit. The best bet for investors right now may be to park into projects that are either brand new, trending, or have a concept that can result in high profits in the coming days. Solana (SOL) Solana is one of the most desirable blockchains for developers, with a native crypto that’s equally appealing to all. It has a large market cap exceeding $99 billion, but can still be clubbed with projects that boast high potential. Since 2024, its increasing adoption rate has pushed the SOL token to become a highly sought-after asset. The project has managed to prove that it’s not just another trending altcoin but rather a legitimate contender for further growth. While Dogecoin drops below $0.25, Solana price is currently trading near the lower $200 range. This is a price level that has always attracted heavy buying interest for the token. Both major corporations and retail investors seem to be highly bullish on the token, despite the current volatility of frontrunner crypto Bitcoin plaguing the market. Given that big players have been consistently accumulating SOL, it signals confidence in its long-term viability. Beyond its price action, Solana has also become known as a formidable alternative to Ethereum, especially in this bull cycle. The blockchain’s ultra-fast transactions and cost-effective structure have made it a developer favorite, with many projects migrating to its ecosystem. Source: CoinMarketCap The community believes that this increased demand could fuel a parabolic price trajectory, with the potential to hit $1,000 if its current growth pace sustains itself. A fivefold increase from its current level would be impressive, especially considering Solana’s standing as a large-cap asset with comparatively lower risk than smaller, speculative projects. For investors looking for both stability and explosive growth, Solana remains an undeniable frontrunner in the market. DexBoss (DEBO) For those who still have an appetite for meme-driven hype like Dogecoin, but want a functional platform attached, DexBoss could be the ideal pick. It represents a blend of meme coin virality, real-world utility, and a trending concept that has the potential to drive strong investor interest. Source: DexBoss As its name suggests, DexBoss considered itself the “Boss of DEX,” creating the next-generation decentralized exchange that can outperform existing options in terms of liquidity, user experience, and advanced trading features. Unlike traditional DEX platforms, DexBoss plans to launch with over 2,000+ tokens already listed, giving traders a vast selection from day one. But what really sets it apart is its AI-powered trading terminal, which integrates lightning-fast order execution and deep analytics, making it a more refined and efficient trading environment than many of its competitors. The project’s viral traction across social media, coupled with the current surge in interest around DEX-focused cryptos, gives it strong positioning in the market. Beyond just trading, DexBoss offers: High-quality trading tools to cater to all types of investors and traders Cross-chain compatibility, allowing investors to choose their preferred blockchains while buying or selling Exclusive user perks, including access to high-potential DEX listings before they go mainstream A no-lag trading environment, ensuring smooth execution even in volatile condition The market has already taken notice. DexBoss has raised over $560k in presale, largely thanks to its laid-back yet high-roller branding that appeals to retail investors and whales alike. As crypto sentiment improves, DexBoss could transition from an under-the-radar presale to a major player in the decentralized exchange sector. Investors who enter now may secure a position in a high-upside project before its market debut. Source: DexBoss Ondo (ONDO) Unlike many speculative tokens, Ondo has been steadily gaining recognition across major crypto media outlets and industry news channels—and for good reason. This relatively newer project has introduced a fresh take on blockchain-based financial products, making it a unique addition to the market. Ondo focuses on tokenized assets and real-world financial products, bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized investments. By offering structured yield-bearing products that appeal to institutional and retail investors alike, Ondo is carving out a niche that sets it apart from typical DeFi projects. Source: CoinMarketCap Unlike Dogecoin’s dropping price, the ONDO price has held its ground, maintaining a value of around $1.30. This resilience signals strong buying pressure, which is an early indicator of potential growth once market conditions improve. The ability to sustain price levels during widespread corrections is often a sign of strong investor confidence and organic demand. Beyond price action, Ondo’s strategic partnerships with major industry players and institutions further reinforce its long-term potential. These collaborations add legitimacy to the project, offering a bullish catalyst for future expansion. With the market still in a volatile phase, Ondo stands out as a well-positioned asset with long-term utility and solid fundamentals. Investors seeking a resilient project amid choppy market conditions may find it an intriguing option. Conclusion As Dogecoin struggles, Solana, DexBoss, and Ondo present compelling opportunities for investors seeking stability, utility, and high growth potential. Each offers unique advantages, from Solana’s scalability to DexBoss’s trading innovations and Ondo’s real-world asset integration, making them strong contenders this cycle.

DOGE is now consolidating and might face hurdles near $0.2655. DOGE price started a recovery wave above the $0.2500 and $0.2520 levels. The price is trading above the $0.250 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.2515 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.260 and $0.2655 resistance levels.

Berachain ( BERA ), the highly anticipated layer-1 blockchain, officially launched its mainnet on Feb. 6, introducing an ambitious “Proof of Liquidity” mechanism and one of the largest airdrops of the year. Berachain’s origins trace back to the Bong Bears NFT collection, a cannabis-themed project that launched in 2021. Major exchanges, including Binance, MEXC, Upbit, and Bithumb, quickly listed BERA, fueling excitement around its ecosystem. As of Feb. 11, the project reached a total value locked of $3.1 billion just days after its launch, making it one of the most discussed blockchain launches in recent months. However, concerns over its airdrop allocations, tokenomics, and insider trading activity have overshadowed the initial hype. Users who participated in Berachain’s testnet expressed disappointment, claiming they received far fewer BERA tokens than expected. Frustrations intensified when analysts uncovered deeper issues in the token’s structure, particularly how early investors and insiders were benefiting from the network’s staking mechanics. Berachain’s blockchain is built around three interconnected tokens—BERA, BGT, and HONEY—each serving distinct functions. Critics argue that private investors, who hold over 35% of the total BERA supply, can stake BERA, earn BGT, burn BGT for additional BERA, and sell it, creating a potential loophole that allows early backers to extract liquidity while regular holders bear the downside. “Wait, so insiders can cycle through the token mechanics and dump on retail? This can’t be real,” one frustrated trader remarked. Wait, so all the huge insiders of Berachain, with locked $BERA tokens, can stake the $BERA , receive $BGT , burn the $BGT for $BERA and then dump the $BERA ???? Please tell me this isn't true… It's almost criminal pic.twitter.com/iZvmoSyBW0 — yugo (@yugoviking) February 6, 2025 Adding to the controversy, data suggests that one of Berachain’s core developers, known as “DevBear,” received 200,000 BERA from the airdrop and sold portions of it shortly after launch. A long thread about my thoughts regarding Berachain’s current situation As many of you know, I’ve been very vocal about Berachain and I’ve spent a lot of time and effort in the ecosystem. After all this, I feel that I have to share my honest opinion regarding the launch, the… pic.twitter.com/X3WAnVNwDO — Ericonomic (@ericonomic) February 9, 2025 “A co-founder selling tokens immediately after launch? That’s not a great look,” one observer pointed out, raising concerns that insiders were offloading their allocations while the broader market absorbed the selling pressure. As these revelations spread, BERA’s price, which reached a high of $14.99 on Feb. 6, has plummeted 63% to $5.57 as of Feb. 11. While volatility is common in newly launched tokens, the rapid decline raises the question of whether Berachain’s pre-launch hype was sustainable or if the token’s structure inherently benefits insiders more than retail participants.",News|layer 1,EN,0,0,AIRDROP|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-11 05:13:18

Blockchain enthusiast Alessio Meloni recently emphasized the importance of Franklin Templeton’s move to tokenize assets on Stellar, stating , “When Franklin Templeton, with $1.6 TRILLION in assets, is tokenizing on Stellar , you know something BIG is happening. If you’re still sleeping on $XLM, it’s time to wake up. The future of finance is being built RIGHT NOW.” When Franklin Templeton, with $1.6 TRILLION in assets, is tokenizing on Stellar, you know something BIG is happening. If you’re still sleeping on $XLM , it’s time to wake up. The future of finance is being built RIGHT NOW. #Stellar #XLM #CryptoRevolution — Alessio Meloni (@Panzbaby777) February 9, 2025 Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a strong advocate for blockchain adoption, highlighted this development. In response to Franklin Templeton’s use of Stellar, he tweeted , “Imagine dismissing $XLM, while Franklin Templeton managing over $1.6 trillion in assets is actively tokenizing on Stellar.” His statement underscores the significance of the institutional adoption of blockchain technology and the growing role of Stellar in the financial sector. Franklin Templeton’s Blockchain Integration Franklin Templeton, a global investment management firm, has been at the forefront of integrating blockchain technology into traditional financial products. In 2021, the company launched the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX), making it the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to process transactions and record share ownership on a public blockchain. The fund initially operated on the Stellar network but expanded its blockchain integration to include platforms such as Polygon, Aptos, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Base. The firm’s decision to leverage Stellar was driven by the network’s efficiency in asset tokenization and transaction processing. Stellar’s design allows for seamless issuance and transfer of digital assets, making it an ideal choice for financial institutions looking to modernize their operations. Using blockchain, Franklin Templeton enhances transparency, reduces operational costs, and provides investors with real-time access to transaction data. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As of March 31, 2023, the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund had surpassed $270 million in assets under management. The fund primarily invests in government securities, cash, and repurchase agreements collateralized by government securities, ensuring liquidity and stability. In October 2024, Franklin Templeton expanded the fund’s accessibility by launching it on Coinbase’s Base blockchain, becoming the first asset manager to do so. This move highlights the firm’s commitment to embracing innovative technologies to improve investor experience and operational efficiency. The Future of Blockchain in Financial Services Franklin Templeton’s initiatives mark a broader shift in the financial sector, where institutions increasingly adopt blockchain for asset management and transaction processing. By integrating blockchain, financial firms can benefit from enhanced transparency, faster settlements, and reduced costs. The endorsements from industry figures like Alessio Meloni and Edo Farina reflect the growing awareness of blockchain’s transformative potential. As major financial institutions continue to explore and implement blockchain solutions, the future of finance is being reshaped by these innovations.

Meanwhile, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has reaffirmed its commitment to Bitcoin with a fresh purchase of 7,633 BTC, further solidifying its position as the largest corporate holder of the asset. Despite Bitcoin’s recent recovery from weekly lows, analysts remain cautious, highlighting the need for sustained momentum above $100,000 to signal a definitive trend shift. As institutional interest grows and corporate accumulation continues, Bitcoin’s market trajectory remains a focal point for traders and investors alike. Strategy Makes First Bitcoin Purchase After Rebrand, Strengthens Corporate Treasury Strategy In a bold continuation of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, Strategy —formerly known as MicroStrategy—has announced its first Bitcoin purchase following its recent rebranding. The firm acquired 7,633 BTC at an average price of $97,255 per Bitcoin between Feb. 3 and Feb. 9, 2025, according to a Form 8-K filing submitted on Feb. 10. The February purchase pushes Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 478,740 BTC, with an average acquisition price of $65,033 per Bitcoin since the company’s first purchase in August 2020. Since the start of 2025, Strategy has acquired 32,340 BTC, representing a 7% increase in its overall holdings in just over a month. This aggressive accumulation strategy aligns with the firm’s long-term vision under its “21/21 plan”, which involves issuing and selling $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities over the next three years to fund additional Bitcoin acquisitions. As with its past purchases, Strategy funded this latest Bitcoin acquisition using proceeds from the issuance and sale of shares under a convertible notes agreement. This financial strategy enables the company to increase its Bitcoin exposure without depleting its cash reserves, positioning itself to benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation. Strategy's Bitcoin yield—an indicator measuring the percentage change in BTC holdings relative to its diluted shares—stood at 4.1% for the period from Jan. 1 to Feb. 9, 2025. However, this figure is notably lower than its 2024 full-year BTC yield of 74.3%. The company’s recent $670 million net loss in Q4 2024 prompted a more conservative target for 2025, with its Bitcoin yield goal lowered to 15%. Despite this adjustment, Strategy’s BTC gains in early 2025 have already reached $1.8 billion, marking an 18% increase from its $10 billion BTC gain target for the year. This suggests that the company is on track to surpass expectations if Bitcoin maintains its upward momentum. For 2024, Strategy recorded an astonishing $140,538 gain per Bitcoin, amounting to $13.1 billion in total BTC profits. Given Bitcoin’s strong performance in 2025, the firm remains optimistic about achieving significant returns on its holdings. The firm’s transition from MicroStrategy to Strategy, officially announced on Feb. 5, 2025, shows its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin. Under the leadership of Michael Saylor, who founded the company in 1989, Strategy has pivoted from a traditional software and analytics firm into a Bitcoin-centric corporate treasury powerhouse. Saylor has long been a vocal advocate of Bitcoin as a store of value, and the company’s transformation reflects his conviction. The rebranding has been well received in the crypto industry, with figures such as Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, stating that the change aligns with Strategy’s broader mission. Strategy's corporate shift comes at a time when US lawmakers are exploring the adoption of a national Bitcoin reserve strategy, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a global financial asset. Adding to the growing institutional confidence in Strategy, BlackRock recently increased its stake in the company to 5%, signaling that major financial players see value in Strategy’s Bitcoin-centric approach. BlackRock’s investment aligns with its broader interest in Bitcoin, particularly through its spot Bitcoin ETF offerings. What’s Next for Strategy? With 478,740 BTC now on its balance sheet, Strategy remains the undisputed leader in corporate Bitcoin accumulation. The firm’s 2025 BTC yield targets, planned equity and bond issuances, and ongoing Bitcoin acquisitions indicate that it has no intention of slowing down. As Bitcoin’s institutional adoption grows, Strategy’s bold approach could serve as a blueprint for other corporations considering Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat devaluation and macroeconomic uncertainty. With its “21/21 plan” in full motion, Strategy appears poised to play a central role in shaping the future of corporate Bitcoin investment. Strategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition cements its place as the largest corporate holder of BTC, with nearly half a million Bitcoin on its balance sheet. With BlackRock increasing its stake and US lawmakers considering Bitcoin reserves, Strategy is positioning itself at the forefront of institutional Bitcoin adoption. As 2025 progresses, all eyes will be on Strategy’s next moves, as it continues its ambitious Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy. Bitcoin Eyes $100,000 as Market Awaits Breakout Catalyst In related news, Bitcoin continues to inch toward the highly anticipated $100,000 level as traders assess key resistance and support zones. Despite a lack of major volatility drivers, BTC has maintained its upward trajectory, briefly reaching $98,349 on Bitstamp before stabilizing around $97,614. This push higher comes after BTC rebounded from a weekly low of $94,750, signaling renewed market confidence. However, analysts remain cautious, noting that the $100,000 mark remains the pivotal level that could determine Bitcoin’s next major price move. Bitcoin has been locked in a three-month range, fluctuating within well-defined support and resistance zones. Despite its recent recovery from sub-$95,000 levels, traders are hesitant to call for a full-fledged breakout until Bitcoin decisively clears $100,000. Prominent trader CJ highlighted the importance of $96,300 as a key defense level if BTC experiences another pullback. “Finally got a fill into that 95k level. I now want to see 96.3k defended if we pull back during NY,” CJ stated. At the same time, Skew, another well-known trader, pointed out that liquidity sweeps on both sides of the market indicate a battle between buyers and sellers. “Still stuck within the same current range, although notably, the market has now swept liquidity both ways - ask liquidity & bid liquidity,” Skew noted. For Bitcoin to establish a significant trend shift, a reclaim of $100,000 is necessary, according to analysts. This key level serves as both psychological resistance and a major technical barrier that could unlock further price discovery. Analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that Bitcoin’s uptrend remains intact as long as higher lows are maintained on the weekly timeframe. For now, Bitcoin appears to be trading in a tight range between $96,500 and $98,500, with $100,000 as the next crucial resistance. Should BTC fail to reclaim $97,900, a deeper retracement toward $95,000 or lower remains a possibility. Bitcoin Market Sentiment Remains Strong Despite Short-Term Dips Despite Bitcoin’s overnight dip to $95,000, trading firm QCP Capital reassured investors that this move was not driven by a broader risk-off sentiment. “Commodities were largely unchanged, while Asian equities dipped, and BTC briefly dropped to $95K before rebounding—suggesting a sentiment-driven move rather than a fundamental shift in risk appetite,” QCP Capital noted. While Bitcoin’s volatility is skewed toward downside risk until April, the overall market remains bullish in the long term. Many investors are positioning themselves ahead of key macroeconomic events that could impact BTC’s trajectory in the coming months. With $100,000 acting as the critical resistance level, Bitcoin’s next move will likely depend on whether bulls can generate enough momentum to break out of its three-month range. Traders are watching key support levels at $96,500 and $95,000, while upside targets remain $100,000 and beyond. If Bitcoin manages to decisively break above $100,000, it could trigger a fresh wave of buying, pushing BTC into uncharted territory. However, failure to reclaim this level could see further range-bound trading in the short term. As the week progresses, all eyes remain on Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its momentum and challenge $100,000, setting the stage for a potential new all-time high in 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-11 05:30:00

Three cryptocurrencies stand out as the best buys this February: Rollblock (RBLK) , Litecoin (LTC), and MANTRA (OM). These coins lead the way with their distinctive qualities, expanding market share, and long-term growth potential. Rollblock’s GambleFi Ecosystem Attracts Thousands of New Users Rollblock’s (RBLK) boasts an innovative Web3 gaming platform that is creating attention in the crypto market. The platform saw a huge increase in new sign-ups, a 600% increase in December alone, indicating growing interest despite the general market collapse. As the excitement surrounding Rollblock continues to grow, $10 million has already been raised in its ongoing presale. What sets Rollblock apart is its unique GambleFi ecosystem, which offers over 7,000 games from top gaming providers. Rollblock offers a game for every player, whether they like the newest AI-driven live tables or traditional favorites like slots and roulette. To guarantee total transparency and remove the possibility of outside intervention, every transaction is safe and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Using the finest Web3 technology, Rollblock facilitates simple deposits and withdrawals by supporting more than 20 cryptocurrencies. With seamless integrations like Google Pay and Ripple Pay, users can deposit fiat currency with just a few clicks. Unlike traditional Web2 platforms, Rollblock allows instant withdrawal of large fiat sums, all while offering enhanced transparency thanks to Ethereum’s robust blockchain security. Rollblock also stands out due to its innovative tokenomics. The platform uses up to 30% of its profits to buy back $RBLK tokens, burning 60% to reduce the supply. The remaining tokens are distributed as staking rewards, where users can earn up to 30% APY, adding extra value to holding $RBLK tokens. MANTRA (OM): A Steady Performer with Real-World Use MANTRA (OM) is quietly thriving in crypto, resisting market fluctuations, and stands at $6.13. The platform’s core focus on staking rewards and providing solutions for DeFi makes it appealing to investors looking for more than speculation. MANTRA recently collaborated with Dubai-based developer DAMAC Group to tokenize $1 billion of assets in the Middle East. This partnership positioned MANTRA as an innovative blockchain platform with real-world utility. Analysts forecast that interest in the DeFi space will continue driving MANTRA’s price upward as even more businesses and people embrace decentralized financial services. MANTRA has also been drawing interest in futures markets, where open interest implies that investors are betting on its potential success. Litecoin (LTC): A Time Tested, Reliable Asset. Litecoin (LTC) is currently trading for $118.44 , signaling an 11% increase in 24 hours. After Litecoin’s recent rally, public interest and favorable industry sentiment pushed the coin higher by over 10%. One key factor driving this positive trend is the growing belief that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve a spot Litecoin ETF soon. Recently, the SEC recognized Canary Fund’s plan to introduce such an investment option in the U.S. market. With the growing developments, industry experts think Litecoin might soon break through the $137 resistance level and resume a bullish pattern, making it a top altcoin to watch. Join the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today! Analysts predict that MANTRA, Litecoin, and Rollblock are the top coins to buy for an explosive February. Rollblock stands out with its presale selling out fast, and each RBLK token goes for $0.053.

Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could draw attention as a hybrid Layer-2 solution that could enhance Bitcoin’s functionality. By improving transaction speeds, reducing fees, and allowing compatibility with Ethereum-based applications, PlutoChain may offer a way to modernize Bitcoin without changing its core structure. Let’s check out the details. Ethereum Price Prediction: Can Eric Trump’s Endorsement Drive ETH to a New ATH? ETH is currently valued at around $2,595. It did soar from around $2,400 to over $2,900 in less than 24 hours on Monday, capping a wild ride three-day performance. But, the big news came when Eric Trump wrote on X that he thinks now is a great time to add ETH. Trump’s choice of words was somewhat cryptic as it is unclear whether his recommendation to “add” Ethereum was directed at investors in general, or if it also implied the digital currency should have a role in the country’s larger strategic calculations. In recent weeks, there have been ongoing rumors that the U.S. is set to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and, on Monday, President Trump signed an executive action to create a sovereign wealth fund for the country. Neither the President nor senior White House officials appear to have designated Ethereum as a priority for either of these initiatives. The Trump family, however, does have a vested interest in Ethereum in the form of World Liberty Financial, a new decentralized finance (DeFi) project backed by the President that has significant cryptocurrency holdings. A popular Ethereum educator and investor, sassal0x, tweeted a few weeks ago that Trump now owns 55,000 ETH. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Could Transform Bitcoin With Faster Transactions and Lower Costs Bitcoin faces long-standing issues that include slow transaction speeds, high fees, and network congestion. While blockchains like Ethereum and Solana have introduced innovative scaling solutions, Bitcoin has yet to fully evolve to meet the growing demands of the market. PlutoChain, a hybrid Layer-2 solution, could be the key to unlocking Bitcoin’s next phase of adoption. Designed to improve efficiency and usability, PlutoChain could operate alongside Bitcoin to ease congestion and optimize transaction processing without altering Bitcoin’s core infrastructure. One of PlutoChain’s biggest advantages is speed. Instead of waiting around 10 minutes for a single block confirmation, PlutoChain offers 2 second block time on its own L2 chain. PlutoChain could also tackle Bitcoin’s expensive transaction fees. By dramatically reducing fees, it could lower barriers for users looking to adopt Bitcoin for everyday use. As a fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network, PlutoChain could allow Ethereum-based applications, including DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and AI-driven platforms, to seamlessly integrate with Bitcoin. This could redefine Bitcoin’s role and expand it from a simple store of value to a multi-functional asset within the broader ecosystem. PlutoChain has already demonstrated its potential during testing by successfully handling 43,200 transactions in a single day without any network disruptions. Security is also a top priority — the platform has undergone rigorous audits by SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi. It also performs regular code reviews and stress testing to reinforce its reliability. Instead of relying solely on developers or central authorities, it empowers the community to propose and vote on key decisions, from protocol upgrades to strategic partnerships. Final Thoughts With Eric Trump endorsing ETH on Twitter, we might see another bull rally for the world’s largest altcoin soon. While that is happening, PlutoChain could generate substantial buzz because of its features that could improve Bitcoin’s functionality, it may help Bitcoin evolve beyond a store of value. —- This article does not offer financial advice.

This has suggested the token is bracing itself for a strong price action, which has materialized since the start of the week. With this, Litecoin regained its position within the top 15 cryptos, surpassing Hedera, Shiba Inu, and Toncoin with a market capitalization close to $10 billion. In the times when traders thought LTC to be a ‘dead coin’, a more than 100% rise in the trading volume suggests they are considering the token. The main reason why bulls, market participants, and whales have become bullish on Litecoin is the growing optimism around the ETF. Besides, a Bloomberg ETF analyst believes Litecoin ETF has the highest chance, of about 90% chance of approval, as LTC is not classified as a security, unlike XRP or SOL. Currently, the LTC price is displaying immense strength against USD and weekly SPF on the BTC pair. Therefore, the token looks extremely bullish as it is getting ready for a massive breakout towards $180 to $200. The weekly chart of Litecoin appears to be extremely bullish, as the price is constantly forming higher highs and lows since the start of 2023. This suggests the bulls continued to accumulate strength for more than 20 months, and hence the upcoming breakout could trigger a monstrous rally. The previous touch points at the ascending resistance were not supported by bullish sentiments, while currently, the traders are optimistic following the speculation of an ETF approval. Hence, a continued ascending trend appears to be imminent, elevating the price towards the immediate target of $155. On the other hand, the token is about to experience the very first weekly ‘Golden Cross’ with the 50-day & 200-day weekly MA heading towards a bullish crossover. The weekly Golden Cross with Bitcoin & Ethereum elevated the levels towards a new ATH and hence a similar price action is expected with the LTC price rally. Hence, if the Litecoin price manages to breach the resistances at $152, $167 and $198, a rise to $225 could be imminent, which may further offer a strong push towards a new ATH. However, the Litecoin price rally does not appear to stop after reaching $400, as a rise to $500 seems to be imminent in this upcoming bull run.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|LTC|SHIB|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-11 05:40:24

Expert Breaks Down the Ultimate Crypto Dream",https://timestabloid.com/can-xrp-reach-10000-expert-breaks-down-the-ultimate-crypto-dream/,"The future price potential of XRP remains a widely debated topic in the crypto community. Some proponents believe the asset could reach a five-digit valuation, arguing that its real-world utility and institutional adoption could drive significant demand. Others remain skeptical, citing market constraints and regulatory uncertainties. In a recent post on X, market analyst Gen A examined whether XRP could reach the ambitious $10,000 price target. He assessed both bullish and bearish perspectives, outlining the key factors that could influence such an outcome. Can XRP Reach $10,000? The Ultimate Breakdown of a Crypto Dream Why Do Some Believe XRP Can Hit $10,000? What Would It Take for XRP to Reach $10,000? What Are the Experts Saying? Final Verdict: Can XRP Hit $10,000? pic.twitter.com/Fftmqgdbx7 — gen A (@genAbilsav) February 7, 2025 Factors Supporting a $10,000 XRP Price One of the primary reasons some believe XRP could achieve extreme price growth is its utility within the global financial system. Unlike many digital assets that rely solely on speculation, XRP is designed to facilitate fast and cost-effective cross-border transactions. Gen A emphasized that Ripple has worked for over a decade to integrate XRP into financial institutions and government frameworks. XRP’s potential role in improving global liquidity is another reason for optimism. Current financial networks, such as SWIFT, process trillions of dollars daily through inefficient and costly systems. If institutions began using XRP on a large scale, demand for the asset could increase significantly, leading to price appreciation. Additionally, Gen A pointed to the rising interest in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger. Tokenization of assets such as real estate, commodities, and securities could expand XRP’s use cases, attracting more investors and institutions. Ripple CTO David Schwartz, in 2023, suggested that the XRPL could become a leading platform for this emerging sector. Speculation on Price Suppression Some XRP advocates argue that the asset’s price has been artificially restrained. Gen A discussed this belief, explaining that the prolonged legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) created uncertainty that discouraged institutional participation. He suggested that if the lawsuit were to resolve, particularly one favorable to Ripple, more institutions could adopt XRP. Increased institutional use could lead to higher liquidity and price growth. What Would Be Required for XRP to Reach $10,000? While Gen A acknowledged the optimistic outlook for XRP, he also analyzed the immense challenges associated with a $10,000 valuation. One major obstacle is the sheer market capitalization required. At that price, XRP’s fully diluted market cap would exceed $1 quadrillion—an extraordinary figure considering the global stock market was valued at approximately $111 trillion by the end of 2023. For perspective, Bitcoin’s market capitalization is currently around $2 trillion, while the total cryptocurrency market stands near $3 trillion. Given these figures, Gen A noted that XRP would need to absorb massive financial flows, including those from forex and remittance markets, to justify a $10,000 valuation. He expressed skepticism that this could occur without a fundamental shift in the global financial system. Supply and Demand Dynamics Gen A also analyzed XRP’s supply and demand mechanics. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a capped supply of 21 million coins, XRP has a maximum supply of 100 billion tokens. However, approximately 37 billion are locked in escrow, restricting the circulating supply. If major financial institutions began using XRP as a reserve asset, its available supply could shrink further. Some reports suggest that the U.S. government considers XRP part of a proposed digital asset reserve. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, XRP transactions include a built-in burn mechanism , where small amounts of XRP are permanently removed from circulation with each transfer. If transaction volumes were to surge, this mechanism could slowly increase scarcity. However, Gen A maintained that supply constraints alone would not be enough to push XRP to $10,000. The Bull and Bear Cases for XRP Gen A presented both the bullish and bearish perspectives on XRP’s future. He stated that widespread institutional adoption and regulatory clarity could propel XRP’s value significantly. If the asset became the standard for global liquidity, the price could experience substantial growth. Furthermore, the real-world assets tokenization could serve as a major catalyst for demand. However, he also emphasized the considerable challenges. Reaching a $1 quadrillion market capitalization under the current financial structure seems highly improbable. Competition from other digital assets could further limit XRP’s market dominance. Additionally, ongoing regulatory hurdles may continue to slow institutional adoption. While proponents believe XRP has strong fundamentals, achieving such an extreme price level would require unprecedented global adoption and a fundamental transformation of the financial system.

Meanwhile, South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-kuk was acquitted of crypto concealment charges after a court ruled that he was not legally required to disclose his holdings at the time. In Spain, a UK-based crypto broker escaped kidnappers that were demanding a €30,000 ransom by jumping from a balcony. The perpetrators were arrested and charged with multiple offenses.. Plea Deal for SEC X Account Hacker US authorities proposed a plea agreement for Eric Council Jr., who is the person accused of compromising the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) X account in January of 2024. A recent filing in the US District Court for the District of Columbia outlines a proposed forfeiture order requiring Council to pay $50,000, an amount he allegedly gained from a misleading social media post falsely claiming that the SEC approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for the first time. As part of the agreement, Council will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud. Council is accused of being part of a group that orchestrated a SIM swap attack that allowed them to take control of the SEC’s official X account temporarily. This breach led to the publication of a false announcement featuring an image of then-SEC Chair Gary Gensler seemingly confirming the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The SEC quickly removed the post and officially announced the approval of these investment vehicles less than 24 hours later. The case is currently awaiting a decision from US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who has not yet signed off on the forfeiture order. Council was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in October of 2024 and initially pleaded not guilty to the felony charge. According to the Congressional Research Service, the charges against him carry a minimum prison sentence of two years. The fake Bitcoin ETF announcement was posted on Jan. 9, 2024, and happened at a critical moment for the crypto industry as market participants were eagerly waiting for the SEC’s ruling on spot Bitcoin ETFs. After the false post, Bitcoin’s price surged by more than $1,000 before Gensler publicly denied its legitimacy. Since his arrest, Council was released on a personal recognizance bond and was granted permission to leave the jurisdiction for the holidays. A recent court order indicates that he is scheduled to return for sentencing on May 16, 2025. South Korean Lawmaker Acquitted of Crypto Concealment Charges Meanwhile, South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-kuk has been acquitted of charges related to concealing cryptocurrency holdings after the court ruled that he was not legally required to disclose virtual assets under the country’s laws at the time. Judge Jeong Woo-Yong of the 9th Criminal Division of the Southern Seoul District Court issued the ruling that cleared Kim of accusations that he obstructed public duty by deceit. Kim faced allegations of liquidating crypto assets and failing to report roughly $4.5 million in profits before South Korean lawmakers enforced the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule. This rule requires the disclosure of crypto holdings. The controversy surrounding the case led to his departure from the Democratic Party, as he wanted to distance himself from the burden the lawsuit placed on his colleagues. Kim Num-kuk Prosecutors argued that Kim deliberately concealed his cryptocurrency holdings to interfere with the National Assembly’s Ethics Committee’s review of lawmakers’ financial disclosures. On Dec. 18, 2024, they requested a six-month prison sentence after alleging that in 2021, he reported his total assets as 1.2 billion won ($834,000) despite holding nearly 9.9 billion won ($6.8 million) in cryptocurrency. The prosecution also claimed that holding such a large amount of digital assets could pose a potential conflict of interest, thereby obstructing the Ethics Committee’s review. However, the court ruled that at the time, virtual assets were not subject to mandatory disclosure under South Korea’s Public Service Ethics Act. It determined that there was no legal basis to conclude that Kim was obligated to report his crypto holdings. Kim Nam-kuk Judge Jeong also stated that while the Ethics Committee was not able to determine Kim’s total assets, it was unclear whether this constituted an obstruction of its authority through deceit. The court ultimately concluded that there was not enough criminal evidence to support the charges. Although Kim was acquitted, prosecutors can still appeal the decision in a higher court. As a member of the National Assembly, he had some influence over digital asset regulations and supported legislation proposing the deferral of a 20% tax on cryptocurrency gains. Critics have also raised some concerns over whether his crypto holdings created a conflict of interest, though he has denied any wrongdoing. Crypto Broker’s Quick Thinking Foils Kidnapping While some crypto holders are being charred by the law, a UK-based crypto broker reportedly leaped 30 feet from a balcony to escape kidnappers who threatened to torture and kill him for his cryptocurrency. According to a report from UK media outlet Metro, three British men were arrested in connection with the abduction. The broker was allegedly lured to an apartment in Estepona, Spain, under the pretense of having drinks. Upon arrival, he was confronted by the kidnappers, who demanded that he transfer 30,000 euros, or $30,917, from his customers’ accounts or face torture and death. In a desperate attempt to look for help, the victim pretended to call a customer for access codes but instead contacted a friend in London who alerted his mother. She then contacted the police, which made it possible for authorities to track down the apartment. While the kidnappers were distracted by the arrival of the police, the broker tried to escape by jumping from the balcony, breaking both of his ankles in the fall. Spanish authorities witnessed the victim’s attempt to climb down before he fell, and immediately transported him to a hospital for medical treatment. A search of the apartment uncovered two firearms, 10,000 euros in cash, a money counter, three knives, and 25 grams of pink cocaine. The three men were arrested and charged with kidnapping, wounding, illegal possession of weapons, belonging to a criminal organization, and drug trafficking. After a court appearance, they were remanded to prison. Unfortunately, incidents of in-person crypto-related robberies have been on the rise over the past few years. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported in October that he received an increasing number of messages from victims in Western Europe that were targeted in home invasions for their digital assets. Jameson Lopp, a cypherpunk and co-founder of self-custodial firm Casa, compiled a GitHub list documenting offline crypto robberies dating back to 2014, when computer scientist Hal Finney was allegedly extorted for 1,000 Bitcoin that was worth $400,000 at the time. More recently, criminals broke into a home in Brazil and forced a husband and wife to transfer $16,000 in cryptocurrency. Lopp’s data shows that there have already been nine recorded cases of in-person crypto robberies this year. About 28 incidents were recorded in 2024, 17 in 2023, and 32 in 2021.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-11 05:42:25

This decline has sparked concern among investors and traders, as fewer ETH holders are now in profit. The negative sentiment is causing many retail traders to sell off their tokens, and with Ethereum underperforming compared to other major cryptocurrencies , questions are rising about its ability to recover. However the scene is changing, in the downtrend, Ethereum has experienced a historic event that could shape its price journey in 2025. Between February 8 and 9, around 224,410 ETH were moved off exchanges—marking the largest single-day net outflow in nearly two years, as reported by Santiment. This change in investor behavior suggests growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value. There was a historic milestone of ~224,410 ETH moving away from exchanges in the 24 hours between February 8th and 9th. This was the most amount of net coins moving off of known exchange wallets in a single day in 23 months. Though more of a long-term metric, this is a… pic.twitter.com/G2e2AausPh — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 11, 2025 What Does This Mean for Ethereum? When large amounts of crypto are moved off exchanges, it’s usually seen as a bullish sign. Investors tend to shift their assets to personal wallets when they plan to hold onto them for the long term, reducing the supply available for trading. This creates less selling pressure, which can support price increases. At the time of this outflow, ETH was priced around $2,850, and it quickly responded with a 3.5% jump, reaching $2,950 within 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s trading volume on major exchanges like Binance hit 1.2 million ETH, with a total volume across all platforms reaching $3.4 billion. This outflow also coincided with Bitcoin seeing similar behavior, as 10,000 BTC were moved off exchanges, reflecting a broader trend of investors choosing to hold rather than sell. Investor Confidence on the Rise Interestingly, this large-scale movement is a sure sign of investor confidence back in the no 2 asset. Notably, the number of active Ethereum addresses jumped by 8% to 500,000, showing increased network activity. Investors seem bullish about Ethereum’s long-term potential, possibly anticipating upcoming developments or institutional interest. ETH met the negative sentiment after Trump announced its tariff rate plan and also due to increased scrutiny of ETH staking models worldwide. However the market is taking such events as a short term block as they are confident over its long term potential once the market stabilizes. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Faces a Surge in Short Positions: Is ETH Price Aiming for a Bearish Comeback? , Technical Indicators Support the Trend From a technical standpoint, Ethereum’s price action looks promising. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stood at 65, indicating healthy momentum without being overbought. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also showed a bullish crossover, hinting at continued upward movement. Trading volumes increased by over 8%, while the Bollinger Bands signaled rising volatility, with ETH prices touching the upper band. Additing to bullish call, Ali Martinez said that Ethereum is showing signs of a potential rebound, with the TD Sequential indicator flashing a buy signal on both the weekly and daily charts. This suggests a possible bullish trend ahead for ETH. #Ethereum $ETH looks ready to rebound as the TD Sequential indicator presents a buy signal on the weekly and daily chart! pic.twitter.com/j2fa8610DP — Ali (@ali_charts) February 10, 2025 .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

However, the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market value, is still down 36% from its December high of around $1.37. Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager, filed to list the first ever spot ADA fund on the New York Stock Exchange. A spot ETF would enable investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to own it directly. Bitcoin and ether spot ETFs began trading in the U.S. last year, attracting billions in investor funds since their inception and bolstering the narrative of institutional adoption. Note that the U.S. SEC's approval of spot BTC and ETH ETFs was primarily based on the assumption that the CME's surveillance system for bitcoin and ether futures would mitigate concerns about price manipulation. In other words, CME futures have been a prerequisite for obtaining spot ETF approval. The global derivatives giant is yet to list ADA futures. The market doesn't seem worried about that, as evidenced by ADA's price spike. Focus on Layer 1 coins The cryptocurrency and its Layer 1 peers like BTC, ETH, SOL and others could remain well supported in days ahead as social media chatter suggests a shift in investor bias from memecoins to layer 1 coins, according to analytics firm Santiment. ""The crypto community has largely shifted their attention to Bitcoin and other Layer 1 assets like Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Cardano. Collectively, the top Layer 1 assets are getting 44.2% of discussions among specific coins. Meanwhile, top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are being discussed less and less across social media,"" Santiment said on X. ""A shift in trader attention from meme coins to Bitcoin and Layer 1 assets is generally a sign of a more stable and sustainable market environment,"" Santiment added. BTC in stasis Bitcoin continues to trade lacklustre between $95,000 to $100,000, with upside likely capped by trade war fears and rising inflation expectations in the U.S. Ether, the second-largest token by market value, has been locked between $2,500-$2,900 since recovering from last Monday's crash to $2,000 on several exchanges. Macro traders have recently pivoted to gold, sending the yellow metal's price to all time highs above $2,900 per ounce. Some analysts said bitcoin will have the last laugh. ""The recent decrease in volatility, coupled with the rising price of gold, should highlight Bitcoinʼs growing appeal as an alternative store of value. Despite short-term fluctuations, Bitcoinʼs fundamental narrative remains intact, with increasing institutional interest and its positioning as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation continuing to support its long-term potential,"" analysts at Bitfinex said. ""A shift [away from gold] may be underway. Over $196 billion worth of Bitcoin is now held by ETFs, public and private companies, and even nation states. With central banks expanding money supply and fiat devaluation risks rising, Bitcoinʼs fixed-supply narrative is becoming increasingly attractive,"" analysts added.",Markets|Cardano|ADA|Markets|Bitcoin|Ether,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 05:50:26

This is the first major development in the Binance lawsuit after Chairman Mark Uyeda took charge of the SEC last month. As per the joint motion filed with the court, both parties have cited the establishment of the crypto task force under Hester Peirce as the reason behind it. Binance Lawsuit to Pause for 60 Days, What’s Next? Both parties in the Binance lawsuit have filed a joint motion to pause the legal proceedings for a period of 60 days. The filing cites the potential implications of the SEC’s newly formed crypto task force by Chairman Mark Uyeda, under the leadership of crypto mom Hester Peirce. The motion was filed on February 10, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Both parties agree the task force’s work could impact case resolution. At the end of the 60-day period, they will submit a status report on whether an extension is needed. The temporary pause aims to conserve resources and potentially avoid further court proceedings if an early resolution is reached. The motion notes this would eliminate the need to address Binance’s pending motions to dismiss the amended complaint, as per the filing. Last month in January, both Binance and founder Changepng Zhao (CZ) filed a motion to dismiss the ongoing Binance lawsuit stating that the US SEC has failed to demonstrate how its complaint satisfies the Howey test. They further argued that the SEC has not provided a clear framework for the court to differentiate between tokens sold as investment contracts and those sold as commodities, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Will US SEC Drop More Lawsuits Like Ripple, Kraken, Etc? Following the development in the Binance lawsuit, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett anticipates that other non-fraud crypto cases involving entities such as Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken may follow a similar path. The move highlights a potential shift in how regulatory cases against cryptocurrency firms are being approached under the SEC’s new leadership. The Story is developing further….

Ethereum Price Reclaims $2,700 Resistance after Weekend Consolidation Ethereum (ETH) has recorded a strong rebound, climbing 4% over the last three days to breach the $2,720 resistance level on February 11. The recent surge comes amid broader capital inflows into the altcoin market, even as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum remained relatively flat over the weekend. Notably, other major altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC), Solana ( SOL ), and Ripple ( XRP ) experienced significant gains, shifting investor sentiment and paving the way for Ethereum’s bullish momentum. The TradingView chart below shows that ETH price surged from $2,560 on Monday to a local high of $2,725, marking a 3.7% increase over 48 hours. Ethereum Price Action, Feb 11, 2025 This uptrend also signals the fourth consecutive day without losses for Ethereum, an important psychological milestone for market participants. However, while ETH price action appears bullish, declining trading volume suggests that the rally may be losing steam. Without substantial demand and follow-through buying pressure, ETH could struggle to advance past the next resistance zone, potentially leading to a reversal or period of consolidation. Fake-Out Signals Emerge as Investors Withdraw 200,000 ETH from Ethereum 2.0 Staking Contracts Despite Ethereum’s resilience over the past four days, on-chain staking data raises concerns that the ongoing rally may be unsustainable. The chart below tracks daily changes in the total balance of ETH deposited into Ethereum 2.0’s Beacon Chain staking and network validation contracts. As of February 4, Ethereum staking deposits stood at 33.7 million ETH. However, within the last seven days, investors have withdrawn over 200,000 ETH, bringing the total staked balance down to 33.5 million as of February 11. These outflows, valued at approximately $540 million at current prices, introduce potential bearish implications for ETH’s price trajectory. Ethereum ETH 2.0 Staking Deposits as of Feb 11, 2025 | Source: Beaconcha.in First, an influx of unstaked ETH increases the available market supply, which could dilute bullish momentum and make it difficult for ETH to sustain price gains. Large sell-offs from recently withdrawn funds may put downward pressure on ETH’s price, limiting its ability to surpass key resistance levels. Moreover, staking withdrawals can be interpreted as a signal of diminishing confidence among major stakeholders and network validators. For Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks like Ethereum, a decline in staking participation could negatively impact network security and efficiency, further reinforcing a cautious market outlook. Given these bearish signals, Ethereum’s 3.7% rally may turn out to be a fake-out rather than the start of a sustained bullish trend. If ETH fails to maintain support above $2,700 and trading volume remains subdued, a retracement toward lower support levels, such as $2,560 or even $2,500, could be imminent. Conversely, a decisive breakout above $2,750, backed by strong trading volume, could invalidate the bearish outlook and pave the way for further gains. Ethereum Price Forecast: ETH Could Tumble to $2,400 if this key support level caves Ethereum price prediction charts suggests a precarious balance between bullish recovery and bearish continuation. Currently trading at $2,703, ETH has reclaimed the $2,700 psychological level after a modest 3.7% rebound. However, the declining trading volume and persistent bearish market structure hint at potential downside risks. The volume delta indicator reflects a weakening buying momentum, with recent green volume bars failing to match the intensity of previous selling pressure. This suggests that the current relief rally lacks the conviction needed to break higher resistance levels. Ethereum Price Forecast (ETHUSD) The Bollinger Bands show that ETH remains near the lower boundary at $2,436, reinforcing the idea that price action is still weak despite the recent bounce. While the VWAP at $2,696 aligns closely with the current price, indicating temporary stabilization, it remains below the midline of the Bollinger Band, implying that ETH has yet to reclaim its bullish posture. If bears regain control, a breakdown below $2,660 could trigger a selloff toward $2,400, where the lower Bollinger Band awaits. Conversely, a breakout above $2,725 could pave the way toward the $2,972 resistance.

This has left investors uncertain about ADA’s future, causing them to turn to RCO Finance (RCOF) for maximum gains in 2025. RCO Finance is gaining attention because of its promising AI features. The ongoing presale has raised over $12 million in funding, signaling strong interest in the altcoin. Cardano Price Tanks as Whales Dump ADA Holdings With the Cardano price tanking, whales are selling off their holdings to protect their gains. Whales recently dumped 330 million ADA, sparking the downtrend that has seen the Cardano price fall to $0.6884. The Cardano price is now down 29% in the past year, with more losses predicted for the layer-1 blockchain network. Analysts warn that ADA could slide to $0.5 by Q2. However, there are prospects that a Cardano ETF launched by a Swedish investment firm can attract institutional capital. If the institutional appetite rises, experts argue that the Cardano price could surge back to $1 in H1 2025. RCO Finance Thrives as the Market Slips RCO Finance is catching investors’ eyes as the market slides. Experts are predicting a 44,000% surge for the AI altcoin in 2025, outperforming the market. The emerging altcoin aims to redefine the financial sector with cutting-edge technology and features. Its main feature is the Robo Advisor, a tool that can transform the lives of traders by offering personalized investments, asset allocation, and portfolio management. It uses machine learning to monitor portfolios and optimize asset allocation. The Robo Advisor monitors real-time financial data feeds from reputable sources such as Bloomberg to identify opportunities and minimize risks. With its quick execution engine, RCO Finance pulls the trigger quickly, enabling users to reap huge profits. Sometimes, it is necessary to close trades soon before the market falls sharply, as when crypto traders lost over $2 billion in liquidations. The Robo Advisor can snipe the best-performing low-cap altcoins for the benefit of traders. Users would have bought Hide the Plain Harold (PAIN) meme coin before it jumped over 4,000% in 24 hours. RCO Finance has also released its beta platform for public testing. The team is internally adding new features and tools to the beta platform and the Robo Advisor. The DeFi platform has grown to over 10,000 users, with more signing up daily. One of its key advantages is the lack of KYC requirements. This ensures that RCO Finance serves many users while maintaining their privacy requirements. Additionally, the project is introducing debit cards to help users spend their crypto assets at various pay points in the real world. Furthermore, the AI trading platform gives users access to over 120,000 assets, including stocks, bonds, and commodities. ADA Falters as RCOF Takes Off The Cardano price was high just a few months ago when the uptrend began. In November 2024, ADA was trading at $0.32 and quickly surged to $1.30 in a few months. This marked a 400% growth in less than 4 months. However, Cardano (ADA) has lost momentum in line with the entire market. Additionally, RCO Finance has completed its smart contract audit with SolidProof to eliminate any loopholes that bad actors might exploit. The audit guarantees water-tight security, ensuring that investor funds are safe. Investors are Scooping RCOF in Anticipation of Major Gains RCOF is tipped to surge 44,000% by Q2 2025 as the AI altcoin generates momentum during the ongoing presale. The project has raised over $12 million and is on course for additional funding. At only $0.1, RCOF is highly undervalued, making it the best altcoin to invest in. The project has launched its beta platform for testing. The beta platform and the Robo Advisor are undergoing enhancements. With over 10,000 users, RCO Finance is set to help traders conquer the markets. Invest in RCO Finance’s presale to grow a $1K investment into $440,000.

An X post by renowned crypto technical and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez notes that the crypto market has seen a notable capital inflow of over $6 billion in the past week. It appears that the inflow has helped the market regain its lost momentum. In the last seven days, the market has experienced a growth of 0.63%. Meanwhile, another crypto expert, identified as MR, notes that the inflow needs to be sustained to have a real impact. Crypto Inflow: Is It a Positive Sign? Ali states that the crypto market has witnessed an impressive capital inflow of over $6 billion in the past week. With this statement, he attempts to portray that the crypto market has regained its momentum. Capital inflows into the crypto market are starting to pick up, with $6 billion added in the past week. Signs of renewed momentum! pic.twitter.com/gK3tZKObxk — Ali (@ali_charts) February 11, 2025 At the start of this month, the total market cap of the crypto market stood at $3.45T. In the first seven days alone, the market dropped by over 11.65%. On February 7, the market touched as low as $3.09T . However, since February 8, the market has surged by nearly 2.91% . Currently, the market stands at $3.18T. It is clear that lately, the market has made a strong effort to recover from the early February correction. Sustaining Liquidity: The Key to Long-Term Growth in the Crypto Market MR’s response to Ali’s post suggests that just one week of increased investment does not guarantee long-term growth. The response highlights the importance of consistent liquidity. It also advises shifting focus from news headlines and social media trends to actual trading volume. It even emphasises the significance of closely monitoring the movements of crypto whales . Solid inflow, but let's not get carried away. $6B's a blip if liquidity isn't sustained. Watch for real volume shifts, not just headlines. Remember, spot volume > Twitter hype. Momentum's fragile unless fundamentals align. Keep eyes on whales, they're the real movers. — MR.

Seyffart made similar predictions for bitcoin (BTC) ETFs before the products went live in 2024. Several providers have filed ETFs for various major tokens in the past year under the Biden administration to low interest from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). LTC is up 15% in the past 24 hours, beating a 2% increase in bitcoin (BTC), with DOGE up 6%. A shifting regulatory climate has buoyed approval hopes, however, with the SEC already passing initial checks for certain tokens in the past weeks. “We're putting out relatively high odds of approval across the board. Mainly focused on Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin for now,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s Seyffart said. “Big implications/expectations in these odds are that Filings will be acknowledged. Likely this week for XRP and Dogecoin.” “The odds for everything on this list --Aside from maybe Litecoin-- would have been VERY very low if Dems were still in control,” Seyffart added. Prospective litecoin ETFs could see inflows of up to $580 million if investors adopt them at the same rate as the bitcoin ETFs, as CoinDesk previously reported . Odds given by the analyst XRP and SOL products are under 70% as of Tuesday. Headwinds for XRP products come from a chance of possible appeals of the now-settled SEC’s case against related company Ripple Labs.",Markets|Litecoin|ETF,EN,0,0,LTC|DOGE|XRP|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 07:06:31

While Ethereum (ETH) and XRP are up by 2-3% each, Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) have gained anywhere between 10-15% each amid higher odds of these crypto ETF approvals. Analysts are hopeful of an altcoin season moving ahead, however, it will be interesting to see if this could be the turning point. Greater Odds of Crypto ETFs for Litecoin, Cardano Approval Push Altcoins Higher The altcoins market is once again seeing a ray of hope with Litecoin (LTC) and Cardano (ADA) leading the rally as the odds of a Litecoin ETF approval surge to a massive 90%. On the other hand, crypto asset manager Grayscale has filed for a spot Cardano ETF amid the growing interest in different digital assets. Amid the chatter around altcoin crypto ETFs picking up, Bloomberg ETF strategists Eric Balchunas and James Seyyfart have disclosed the approval odds for each. While everyone is betting on a spot XRP ETF following the settlement of Ripple vs SEC lawsuit, the XRP ETF has a 65% chance of approval, said the analysts. However, they believe that Litecoin ETF approval odds are at 90%, and even the Dogecoin ETF approval chances are at 75%, higher than XRP. Litecoin Price Leads with Nearly 15% Gains The approval odds of the crypto ETFs appears to be the primary reason why LTC and ADA are outperforming other altcoins today. As of press time, Litecoin price is trading 14.85% up at $130.04 with daily trading volumes surging by 86.3% to more than $1.7 billion. As per the Coinglass data , the LTC open interest has surged by a massive 26% to more than $700 million, with the 24-hour liquidations shooting to $4.21 million of which $3.46 million is in short liquidations. Over the past few months, the LTC price has been oscillating in the range of $100 on the lower end and $140 on the upper price band. A breakout above $140 could set the stage for a mega rally moving ahead. Besides, a recent Litecoin price prediction shares further details on the crypto’s potential performance ahead. Source: Altcoin Sherpa Cardano (ADA) price has also surged by a strong 11% moving to $0.76 with its daily trading volumes surging 13.67% to $867 million. Similarly, the ADA futures open interest has shot up by 13% to $700 million as the crypto ETF speculations soared. Altseason to Begin Soon? Amid the crypto ETF buzz, popular crypto analyst Crypto Rover reported that we will soon witness a bullish cross-over of the 100-week moving average above the 200-week moving average. This is when the mega altcoin rally would begin. The last time such a cross-over took place in 2021, it triggered a 500% surge in the overall altcoin market. Several other analysts have also been hopeful for the start of an altcoin season despite the recent greater market turbulence.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. The crypto market is heating up, and with Rollblock poised for huge growth, alongside Litecoin and Uniswap, these projects are set to deliver massive returns in 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock prepares to leave its presale Litecoin bounces hard Uniswap rolls out update Rollblock to supercharge portfolios in 2025 The crypto market is once again heating up and Litecoin, Uniswap, and Rollblock (RBLK) look ready for a period of huge growth. Rollblock in particular is being tipped for an astonishing 50x rally as it has recently smashed through $10 million in assets under management. Here’s why these crypto projects could deliver massive returns in 2025. Rollblock prepares to leave its presale Rollblock (RBLK) is staging a gaming revolution with its web3 platform that saw a 600% surge in new users this past December. Investors have been flocking to its popular presale offering as more than $10 million has been raised in a matter of a few months. With Rollblock’s massive range of more than 7,000 games plus a cutting-edge sports prediction league, Rollblock is set to finally shake up the $500 billion gaming industry with blockchain-backed transparency. Gamers can now verify for themselves that everything is fully above board, without having to trust a shady centralized third party. This will ensure phenomenal growth as it has emerged in recent years that over 9% of traditional platforms have admitted to working against their customers for their own financial gain. Rollblock reinvests 30% of its profits each week into buying back RBLK. Of these tokens, 60% are permanently destroyed to reduce the overhanging supply while the remaining 40% fund a generous staking rewards program that allows holders to earn up to 30% in risk free passive income. Stage 10 RBLK tokens are selling fast at $0.053. Litecoin bounces hard Litecoin has fallen by 7% today, hitting support at $100. Litecoin holders have had to endure a 12% drawdown over the past month as the Litecoin price was unable to sustain itself above $140. It recently bounced from $87 in the recent crypto crash, where Litecoin holders stepped in with massive volume to buy the dip. Recently, the SEC officially acknowledged a Litecoin spot ETF filing from Canary Capital, which opens a 21-day window for feedback. This has been seen as a strong hint that a dedicated Litecoin ETF will soon be approved, which could send Litecoin up to $450 this year. Uniswap rolls out update Uniswap has also seen a severe decline recently, falling by a significant 41% in the past month to reach $8.89. 11% of this drop was recorded in the last 24 hours alone, which corresponds to a 61% decline in trading volume for Uniswap on exchanges. Despite this recent downtrend, Uniswap V4 recently launched to much fanfare from the DeFi industry. This update introduced hooks, which allow developers to customize how liquidity pools and swaps are managed on-chain. This makes Uniswap much more cost-effective and should propel Uniswap back above $18 during Q1 of 2025. Rollblock to supercharge portfolios in 2025 Litecoin and Uniswap have proven themselves with impressive adoption, while Rollblock is about to emerge from its presale to disrupt a $500 billion industry. Rollblock could soon see a violent repricing as it is tipped to surge to $1 this year. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and socials.

This comes under the leadership of the SEC’s acting chair, Mark Uyeda, who formed a new crypto task force on Feb. 4. Both Binance and the SEC believe this task force could influence the outcome of the case, court documents revealed today. The motion, filed in a US district court, reportedly says, “The work of this task force may impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case.” The request asks for a pause in proceedings until both parties can determine whether continuing litigation makes sense after the task force’s work progresses, then a joint status report will be submitted at the end of the 60-day period. The SEC had accused Binance, including its CEO Changpeng Zhao, BAM Trading Services Inc., BAM Management US Holdings Inc., and Binance Holdings Ltd., of more than one violation, including of course trading unregistered securities and misusing customer assets. Binance denied the allegations and went to court to challenge the SEC’s claims. How the motion will work According to the motion, both sides agree that pausing the case could save resources. The filing says that the ongoing discovery process, where both sides exchange evidence, may become unnecessary if a resolution can be reached. “A brief stay will promote the efficient use of the court’s resources,” the motion said. This means the court won’t have to spend time ruling on Binance’s pending motions to dismiss the amended complaint filed against them. Courts have wide discretion to pause cases, and the law recognizes that certain criteria must be met for a stay to be granted. According to Clinton v. Jones and other precedent cases, courts typically evaluate three factors: harm to either party if the stay is denied, whether the requesting party has a legitimate need for the pause, and whether a stay would streamline judicial proceedings. If the 60-day break is granted, the pause could delay ongoing legal procedures, like the court’s review of Binance’s dismissal requests. For Binance, this stay is an opportunity to regroup and reduce legal exposure during the discovery phase which, in cases like this, often includes producing internal documents, emails, and other materials, which could reveal sensitive company operations. The court documents go into detail about why both sides see this stay as necessary, saying, “There is no prejudice to any party here, and a stay could save the Parties resources because, if an early resolution could be reached, it would obviate the need to continue merits discovery.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",Regulation|Binance|SEC|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BNB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-11 07:17:55

The attack led to a fake post that falsely claimed the SEC had approved a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), causing a temporary surge in Bitcoin’s price before the SEC clarified the message was unauthorized. Bitcoin Price Surge Following SEC Twitter Hack During a hearing at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Council admitted to conspiracy charges related to identity theft and access device fraud. The fraudulent post resulted in a market reaction, with Bitcoin’s price spiking by over $1,000, before the SEC confirmed the announcement was a result of the hack. The incident brought to attention the vulnerability of high-profile accounts and the potential impact of misinformation on financial markets. Council, who initially pleaded not guilty to the felony charge, has been free on a personal recognizance bond since his arrest in October 2024. Federal prosecutors have proposed a plea agreement, requiring Council to pay $50,000, which authorities claim he gained from the scheme. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: Joint Thai-Chinese Operation Freezes $2.5 Million in Cryptocurrency Tied to Scammers , SIM Swap Attack Exposes Security Risks in Government Agencies The attack was part of a larger SIM swap operation, where Council and his co-conspirators tricked a phone store employee into transferring control of the SEC’s official phone number. This breach stressed the importance of stronger security protocols for government agencies to prevent similar cyberattacks in the future. Council’s sentencing is scheduled for May 2025, and he could face a minimum of two years in prison if convicted. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $35.7 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $1.1 billion, pumped over 15 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about 79 cents on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, during the early European session. After a heavy liquidation of the crypto-leveraged market in the past two weeks, bullish sentiment is gradually building up, led by layer one (L1) chains such as Toncoin (TON), Cardano, Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH). Cardano ETF on the Horizon Grayscale Investment officially filed to launch a spot Cardano exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The behemoth crypto fund manager filed with the SEC to offer institutional investors a chance to invest in shares that mirror ADA price action as they are backed by underlying assets. The move to list Grayscale Cardano Trust is largely inspired by the change of U.S. leadership through President Donald Trump Donald Trump Donald Trump is an American former president politician, businessman, and media personality, who served as the 45th president of the U.S. between 2017 to 2021. Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President With more fund managers seeking to offer altcoins ETFs , the approval in the next 12 -24 months will significantly increase the liquidity flow to the altcoin industry ahead. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will Crypto Market Bounce Back Amid a $6 Billion Inflow? , Major Rebound for ADA Price Ahead #Cardano $ADA is testing a key support zone between $0.67 and $0.81. Holding above this range could set the stage for a strong rebound. Watch closely for confirmation! pic.twitter.com/9rDTi4ES79 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 10, 2025 After being trapped in bearish sentiment in the past five weeks, Cardano’s price has signaled the onset of the much anticipated bullish outlook. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, ADA price must hold above the support level of 67 cents and 81 cents to invalidate further bearish sentiments. A successful rebound from the support range above 81 cents will propel ADA price towards its all-time high above $3. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Both coins feature distinctive qualities, but Pepeto is quickly gaining traction, primarily due to its ongoing presale phase, which provides investors with an excellent chance for early participation. Wall Street Pepe has established itself as a trader-centric platform, equipped with features like alpha calls, trading signals, and staking rewards. Its presale has completely sold out, indicating strong interest, and an official exchange listing is imminent. However, this presents a challenge for new investors, as they will have limited purchasing options until $WEPE is available to the public. On the other hand, $PEPETO is still in presale, offering investors a cost-effective entry point before a potential price increase. With a solid ecosystem tailored for long-term viability, Pepeto represents a compelling investment opportunity for those aiming to invest early. Pepeto’s Momentum: A New Era for Meme Coins Referred to as the “God of Frogs,” Pepeto is making waves in the market with its robust branding and ecosystem. Priced affordably at $0.000000109 during its presale, $PEPETO opens the door for investors aiming for significant gains. The project boasts a fee-free exchange, an advanced cross-chain bridge, and an enticing staking option that offers an impressive 387% APY, all positioning Pepeto as a formidable player among meme coins. A key factor contributing to Pepeto’s success is its swiftly growing community. With over 65,600 followers and counting, the project is building momentum every day. Its inventive applications, captivating marketing tactics, and compelling storyline have made it a hot topic in the meme coin arena. The anticipation deepens as Pepeto prepares to unveil PepetoSwap, a zero-fee exchange poised to address prevalent challenges like high transaction fees and liquidity issues within the meme coin market. Moreover, the state-of-the-art cross-chain bridge technology promises to enhance blockchain compatibility, setting a new benchmark for both efficiency and user experience. Is Pepeto the Next Big Binance Listing? While Wall Street Pepe targets listings on platforms like BingX, Gate.io, and MEXC, Pepeto aims even higher. Fueled by strong community involvement, increasing momentum, and rumors of an ex-founder from Pepe supporting the project, enthusiasm for $PEPETO is on the rise. The token’s supply of 420 trillion is aligned with that of the original Pepe, enhancing its validity and attraction. Combining advanced technology, cost-effectiveness, and viral momentum, Pepeto emerges as a promising contender for a Binance listing. Achieving this goal could significantly transform the meme coin market, setting new standards for future projects. Conclusion: Pepeto Takes the Lead in the Meme Coin Race As competition intensifies in the ever-evolving meme coin sector, Pepeto has emerged as a remarkably exceptional contender that demands attention. With an ecosystem that is not only growing rapidly but also diversifying in innovative ways, Pepeto is positioning itself at the forefront of this digital revolution. The project’s robust community backing speaks volumes about the trust and enthusiasm that investors and supporters share, fostering an environment ripe for collaboration and growth. Moreover, the anticipation of a potential listing on Binance—a highly regarded exchange—adds an exciting layer of credibility and visibility to Pepeto. This could significantly amplify its reach and market presence, making it an enticing prospect for savvy investors. For those on the lookout for the next significant breakout in the crypto landscape, Pepeto solidifies its status as a top choice, presenting a unique blend of promise and potential that could transform the way we perceive meme coins in the future.

It added that, collectively, the top L1 assets are getting 44% of discussions among specific cryptocurrencies, while top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe are being discussed less and less across social media. “This is likely thanks to the recent volatility and speculative altcoin price dominance falling behind,” analysts noted. More Sustainable Market Environment Santiment suggested that this was a positive shift in trader attention, which is “generally a sign of a more stable and sustainable market environment.” Meme coins, which are driven by “hype, viral trends, and a gambling mindset rather than fundamental value,” signal a phase of “excess greed where traders chase rapid, short-term gains without considering long-term viability,” it said. Bitcoin and layer-1 networks represent the foundational infrastructure of the crypto space, it said before adding that “increased focus on these assets usually reflects a more mature and informed approach by the community, which prioritizes security, innovation, and real-world adoption.” “When traders pivot back to assets with strong utility and established market positions, it suggests a healthier market cycle.” The crypto community has largely shifted their attention to Bitcoin and other Layer 1 assets like Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Cardano.

Recent meme coin mania was fueled by the launch of Donald Trump’s namesake coin (TRUMP) in mid-January. The token, which has no utility whatsoever, surged to around $73 before crashing by 78% to current levels around $16 just three weeks later.

The recent findings revealed that a savvy crypto trader with more considerable holdings has often managed to identify golden opportunities despite the chaos. More importantly, the trader earned a staggering $7M in profits, astonishing the crypto community. Let’s discuss the details of this whale’s trades and how it profited $7M from just three meme coins. Crypto Whale Makes Millions With New Meme Coins According to a Solonchain X post , the crypto whale is adept at identifying early opportunities, especially meme currencies that eventually reach a market cap of $100 million. In the last two to three days, the trader has earned $3 million by investing in two buzzy and trending meme coins: JAILSTOOL and CAR. As these meme-themed cryptocurrencies gained market traction, the whale succeeded in making millions, with returns as high as 100x. Interestingly, the whale also made headlines three weeks earlier when it invested in Donald Trump’s TRUMP token. With a series of smart crypto trading strategies and decisions, the trader earned $7M within a month. How did the whale Earn $7M from TRUMP, JAILSTOOL, and CAR? The whale began with the TRUMP meme coin three weeks ago, earning a $4M profit. Next comes Dave Portnoy’s JAILSTOOL coin , which surged 119,000% after Portnoy’s endorsement. In this rally, the crypto trader also benefitted, making a 100x return on initial investment. Whale’s consistent buying indicates its confidence in the token and its skills, and the same happened because the coin moved from a $2M to a $200M market cap. Lastly, there is the CAR meme coin, for which the whale made multiple swaps of 100 SOL for the CAR token when the price ranged between $0.0263 and $0.0403. This showcases that the crypto whale had continuously bought the token even when the CAR price began to drift . Eventually, the whale sold at a high price, making 26.6x returns on the initial investment. The CAR’s market cap surged from $30M to $800M in this period. These profits are more significant as all three meme coins are crashing due to high volatility, showcasing the whale’s proper judgment during the golden period. Meme Currencies Struggles Continue Although this crypto whale has won big on meme currencies, the category’s overall performance is still poor. An earlier CoinGape blog mentioned that the meme coin valuation had declined 37% over three weeks, facing a loss of $44 billion. This happened as the meme coins’ market cap fell from $117.60 billion to $69.87 billion amid the market’s rising volatility, liquidity issues, investors’ bearish sentiments, and PUMP. Fun flooding the market with millions of new cryptos. Analysts say this crash has impacted the performance of meme-themed cryptocurrencies and diverted the altcoin season. Experts also believe that the affected tokens may never hit their prime again after this crash. However, some assets are still showing bullish momentum, and three of them made the aforementioned whale $7M. Key Lesson From This Crypto Trading Accomplishment The crypto whales had three back-to-back profiting experiences, earning $7M within just three weeks. More importantly, the whale took the biggest risk by investing in newly launched coins, which went right as the overall meme coins market was struggling. With this, the biggest lesson is adaptability and quick decision-making. With the buying and selling history, it’s clear that the crypto trader is quite experienced, so the investor should just blindly copy their trading steps and do detailed research. Overall, the trader’s $7M profit in three meme currencies is astonishing, where the TRUMP, JAILSTOOL, and CAR became the best digital assets for the trader.

Remittix (RTX) is one such project rapidly gaining popularity because of its novel approach to international payments. Because of its distinct strategy and applications, Remittix is proving to be a better investment than other top altcoins , like Shiba Inu and Polygon . Shiba Inu’s Recent Struggles and Market Sentiment The Shiba Inu price has been under pressure after storming the crypto community in January. Although starting 2025 relatively optimistically, SHIB is down over 27% from month highs. The latest market reports place the Shiba Inu price at $0.00001545, and analysts anticipate continued resistance at this level. Some investors question whether the hype surrounding meme coins can last long because the crypto market is moving toward more utility tokens. Some SHIB investors are now considering other top altcoins like Remittix, which has an obvious path to real-world applications. Polygon Faces Major Struggles Amid Market Downturn Polygon (POL) is attempting to bounce back from a significant dip and is at a crucial point. Polygon is now down an unbelievable 86% from its all-time peak of $2.29 and more than 55% from its post-election high of $0.70, once riding high with spectacular gains. Polygon is fighting to stay on track in the volatile cryptocurrency market, which has huge stakes. Despite market difficulties, other top altcoins, like Shiba Inu , continue to draw interest even as Polygon faces similar obstacles. In the hopes of a recovery, investors have been keeping a careful eye on the Shiba Inu price , while some are looking for more promising prospects with other top altcoins . Polygon will have to demonstrate a robust rebound to win back investor trust and prevent more. Remittix’s Presale and Growth Potential Unlike Shiba Inu and Polygon , Remittix (RTX) displayed significant momentum early in 2025. Its presale raised over $11.3 million within a few months and is among the fastest-growing presales in the cryptocurrency marketplace. This considerable funding reflects investor trust that Remittix will transform how we send and receive cash worldwide. In contrast to meme coins like Shiba Inu or infrastructure projects like Polygon , Remittix provides real utility in a quickly expanding market. The platform intends to link cryptocurrencies with conventional FIAT methods by allowing cross-border conversions between digital and fiat currencies. This makes it a game changer for the worldwide remittance sector, which, based on some projections, will be worth much more than $1 trillion in yearly transactions by 2027. Remittix supports over forty cryptocurrencies, and users can convert digital assets into FIAT and send them to bank accounts globally. This makes crypto more accessible, particularly in areas without banking infrastructure. For individuals in developing nations, Remittix can help avoid the costs and lengthy wait periods related to cross-border remittances. The presale success and the practical application make it a standout opportunity in 2025. For token performance, $RTX (Remittix’s native token) goes for $0.0567 in the presale. Early projections have $RTX gaining 800% before the platform formally launches, and some experts are also predicting a 5,000% gain post-listing. This makes Remittix among the top altcoins for crypto investors. Why Remittix Outshines Shiba Inu and Polygon What sets Remittix apart from Shiba Inu and Polygon is its apparent utility and real-world application. Meme coins like Shiba Inu draw interest for their speculative characteristics but lack a practical use case, which makes one doubt their long-term viability. Polygon , however, possesses a good technical infrastructure but is unlikely to give investors the price surge they need. Remittix’s focus on real-world problems in the remittance industry, remarkable presale performance, and growth projections make it a wiser investment for 2025. With access to the $1 trillion worldwide remittance market, its clear pricing structure, and its decentralized platform, Remittix provides investors with a clear path toward future growth and stability.

The post included a clip from a Bloomberg interview featuring Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who highlighted XRP’s regulatory-friendly approach and its role in solving large-scale financial problems. JackTheRippler emphasized that at the time of Garlinghouse’s statement, Bitcoin was priced at $9,000, implying that XRP could follow a similar growth trajectory. Bitcoin is now over $100,000, and the community expects a massive rally for XRP soon so it can catch up. #Bitcoin was at $9,000 When Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that #XRP has the potential to become the next Bitcoin! pic.twitter.com/Xw8huA4jl1 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 9, 2025 This post quickly gained attention within the cryptocurrency community, sparking debates on whether XRP has the potential to become “the next Bitcoin,” as Garlinghouse suggested in the interview. Notably, experts have previously referred to XRP as the next Bitcoin . While both assets serve different purposes, Garlinghouse’s comments reinforced Ripple’s long-standing strategy of working within the financial system rather than outside. Ripple’s Commitment to Regulatory Compliance Ripple has consistently positioned itself as a company that works within regulatory frameworks. Despite the war on crypto by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under former Chair Gary Gensler, Ripple has remained focused on compliance. This approach has allowed Ripple to partner with established financial institutions across the globe to facilitate cross-border payments and other financial services. Garlinghouse emphasized this strategy in the interview, stating that Ripple has “worked with regulators” and “regulated institutions like banks, where there isn’t regulatory uncertainty.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Institutional Use Case Despite legal troubles and price suppression , XRP has maintained a significant presence in the cryptocurrency industry. Garlinghouse attributes part of its success to its clear use case in solving financial inefficiencies at scale. He noted that a major reason why XRP has performed well is because people can see its potential to work within the financial system. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily viewed as a store of value, XRP is designed for high-speed, low-cost transactions. This makes it particularly attractive for financial institutions looking to move money quickly at low costs. Ripple’s partnerships with banks and payment providers further reinforce XRP’s role in institutional finance. Will XRP Match Bitcoin’s Growth? In late 2024, a well-respected analyst showed that 1 BTC bought the same amount of XRP in 2024 as in 2014, showing that the digital asset had kept up with Bitcoin. The question on the minds of many investors now is if XRP can surpass Bitcoin. While Bitcoin dominates as the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, XRP’s supporters argue that its practical use case could drive widespread adoption, and help the digital asset take the top spot in the market.

Crypto adoption is outpacing mobile phones and the internet, growing at record speed. Meme coins and ETFs are driving mass adoption, attracting both retail and institutions. The cryptocurrency market is growing at a rapid pace, with adoption rates beating major technological leaps like mobile phones and the internet. New data from BlackRock shows crypto adoption has reached 300 million users in just 12 years. This growth rate is 43% faster than mobile phone adoption and 20% faster than the internet. Several factors, including younger populations, inflation worries, and political support, are speeding up this trend. Analysts think a big change is coming in global finance, with billions of users expected to jump into digital assets by 2030. It really depends what you count as the official start year – for Bitcoin, Internet, and mobile phones – to make this comparison. But regardless, this is directionally correct. Bitcoin adoption should get to several billion people by 2030 at current rates. https://t.co/JEU8P7YmLP — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 10, 2025 Wh… The post Crypto’s Going Mainstream Faster Than the Internet Did appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Top Crypto News|Bitcoin News|Blockchain News|Cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-02-11 07:34:00

The Ethereum price has not met many investors’ expectations in the last months, with a price formation that looks like it is going on a free fall. However, while the Ethereum price continues to struggle, the Bitcoin price has continued to set a new high, reaching $108k in December and climbing higher to $109k in January. In contrast, Ethereum has continued to fall lower since December 2024, reaching a low of $2,755 by the last week of January 2025. However, while investors continue to ask questions about the possible direction of the Ethereum price in the coming months, a new altcoin is already showing a bigger threat. Let’s dive deeper into the price action and future projection of the Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices, and this new altcoin could be the new ETH replacement. Bitcoin Set New High in 2025 Amidst the Bull Run With the current market turmoil, it will be tempting to ask, “Is the bull run over?” This also follows the Bitcoin price performance in the last weeks, which saw it cross old ATH to set not just one but two different ATH in the last 2 months. In December 2024, the Bitcoin rally saw it climb to a new ATH above 100k to set the $108k all-time high. However, with the new year’s opening comes a new movement that saw the Bitcoin price return from its correction to another new high of $109k, the latest BTC ATH. However, given the crypto market’s current state BTC falling below $100k and currently trading at $97k it might be tricky to assume a bullish continuation. However, according to the latest tweet from a top financial analyst, Robert Kiyosaki, he believes “this is the best time to get rich.” This is as he speculates the bull run could continue. Is Ethereum Under Threat From New Altcoins? The recent decline in Ethereum’s price could be primarily motivated by the rising number of competitors shifting their attention away from Ethereum. One factor is how many new altcoins and lower-ranking altcoins to Ethereum have shown better scalability and lower fees. This has continued to see the Ethereum price take a hit in the last few months, with the current price barely halfway above its all-time high. According to the ETH price action, the current bearish setup could see the price fall to a low, which might cause USDT to take over its position soon. As the price continues to sell below the 7 and 50 SMA on the weekly chart, a fall below the 100 SMA at $2,567 could be seen on a free fall more than imagined. Could This New 4x Presale Altcoin Be The ETH Final Blow? With the Ethereum price falling deeply lately and experts speculating about new innovative altcoins as the main factor, the Remittix token’s entrance to the market could deal a big blow to Ethereum. The Remittix token is a new presale token from the Remittix exchange that is already showing big potential in its presale. This token is a high utility token with over 4x already in its presale phase, and it has raised over $11.5M in the funding round. One major factor putting this new presale token on the global crypto map is the Remittix solution in crypto payment, which is set to set a new direction in crypto usage. The Remittix exchange gives users the new decentralized power to send money for payment and other uses, which is delivered as FIAT to the receiver’s bank account. This final blow says bye to crypto’s low utility for crypto users because now, your crypto can give you the freedom to do more through the Remittix platform.

The latest on-chain data indicated that roughly $18.5 million tokens were accumulated amid the crypto’s turbulent intraday movement. As a result, traders and investors reflect a bullish sentiment orbiting SOL price’s future, with a top market expert further highlighting the coin’s potential to hit $296 ahead. Solana Smart Whales On Accumulation Spree Spark Market Optimism According to data offered by Spotonchain on X as of February 11, Solana smart whales have bought massive amounts of the token. According to the data, two ‘smart money addresses’ collectively accumulated roughly $18.5 million worth of tokens from crypto exchange behemoths over the past day. The address “GJwCU” was revived after nearly a year of dormancy to accumulate 30,901 tokens worth $6.24 million from Binance. This accumulation has promptly gained significant traction as the trader boasts a profit of $8.15 million with his previous SOL trade. Also, the address “5qDx”, after 2 months of dormancy, bagged 61,319 tokens, worth $12.4 million, from Binance and OKX at an average price of $202.53. Overall, these accumulations by traders with remarkable profit-booking portfolios (aka smart whales) signaled that the coin could pump significantly ahead. Recent ETF Developments Weigh Additional Optimism Simultaneously, the rising SOL ETF approval odds have fueled additional optimism about the asset’s future performance. CoinGape recently reported that Bloomberg analysts forecasted a 70% chance of an ETF approval in 2025. This development, if happens, could boost the appeal of the token to institutions, which in turn is likely to push the prices higher. Notably, the massive accumulation by Solana smart whales amid this broader development has solidified investors’ optimism about future SOL price action. SOL Price Rally To $296 Ahead? At the time of reporting, SOL price witnessed a 1% uptick in value, reaching $204 after showcasing a roller coaster ride intraday. The coin’s 24-hour bottom and peak were $199.59 and $208.83, respectively. Market participants continue to eye the coin extensively, awaiting bullish shifts amid rising Solana whale accumulations and recent ETF-related developments. However, the broader crypto market volatility currently presents the asset with severe price volatility. Nevertheless, crypto market analyst ‘VipRoseTr’ recently posted on X, projecting optimism over future price movements. The analyst states that SOL is “maintaining strong support and bouncing from key levels, signaling the potential for further upside action.” This bullish movement paves the way for a $296.38 price target ahead. A sustained pump above this level could see the coin breakout and push above $300, per the analyst.

Both parties have agreed to pause the case for 60 days, marking a potential shift in how the SEC handles crypto lawsuits. Does it mean that the SEC is easing its stance over crypto cases? Why the Pause? According to a joint motion filed on February 10 , 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Binance and the SEC believe the newly formed task force’s findings could impact the lawsuit’s outcome. Instead of continuing court proceedings, both sides have decided to reassess the situation after 60 days. At the end of this period, they will submit a report determining whether an extension is needed or if the case can be resolved through alternative means. This pause could be a strategic advantage for Binance, allowing time for potential negotiations and clarity on crypto regulations. On the other hand, it suggests the SEC may be reconsidering its aggressive approach toward crypto firms, signaling a possible shift in its regulatory stance. Binance’s Argument Against the SEC Meanwhile last month, Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the SEC lacks clear guidelines for distinguishing between securities and commodities in the crypto industry. This regulatory uncertainty has long been a challenge for multiple crypto firms facing legal action from the SEC. Is SEC Softening Its Stance? However, in a recent tweet post , Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett suggests that this pause could influence other ongoing crypto lawsuits. Companies like Ripple, Coinbase, and Kraken are also battling SEC cases, and they may see similar developments in the coming months. Meanwhile, the SEC’s crypto task force recently launched an official website, aiming to clarify the application of securities laws to digital assets. The initiative focuses on balancing innovation with investor protection, potentially paving the way for a more structured regulatory approach.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-11 07:43:58

Liberland is in talks with KuCoin and other platforms in a bid to widen its centralized exchange reach. The country disclosed that it is expecting a TRON bridge and a BNB bridge this month. Liberland’s official cryptocurrency, the Liberland Dollar (LLD), has surged in price to an all-time high of $26.82 in the last 2 hours. The rise in the country’s official digital asset reflects growing investor confidence in Liberland’s new governance model powered by blockchain technology. The self-proclaimed microstate between Croatia and Serbia is also gaining global attention as the world’s first Decentralized Autonomous Government (DAG). The exponential growth of LLD prices on exchanges has made many consider the token as a serious investment opportunity in the evolving landscape of digital nations and decentralized governance. Liberland gains traction as the world’s first DAG Liberland is located on the banks of the Danube river in Europe and is the newest sovereign country in the world. It's the only country founded on hardcore principles of libertarianism and onchain governance.

Jedlicka also aimed to create a country without bureaucracy and taxation. Liberland operates on blockchain-based smart contracts, making it the first globally decentralized autonomous government (DAG). Liberland revealed its alternative governance model is also gaining appeal due to traditional economies facing debt crises, bank failures, and inflation. The country’s presence at high-profile global forums such as Davos has also amplified its message of self-sovereign governance and economic liberty. The country also revealed new features coming this month, including the TRON bridge and BNB bridge. The TRON bridge will use BTTC, the BitTorrent Chain Technology. Other expected features are cross-chain swaps via Maya, the friendly Thorchain fork, and a stock market for Liberland companies. The nation also said that it was in talks with KuCoin, Gate, and BitMart to broaden its central exchange (CEX) front. Liberland’s DAG system allows its residents and businesses to use LLD to actively participate in governance. Decision-making in the system is conducted through decentralized voting mechanisms and financial transactions powered by LLD. The country acknowledges that LLD ensures transparency, efficiency, and elimination of corruption. Investors continue betting on LLD Interest in LLD has skyrocketed in the last 24 hours by over 478% and its price is currently trading at $6.85. The token gained increased liquidity and exposure after recently being listed on major exchanges such as Uniswap, MEXC, Coinstore, and Raydium. “I live in Liberland; we all have some holdings of $LLD. Some citizens are taking profit, which is good as GDP is not so strong, but guess what this is not the end, Justin Sun got a big vision to tackle GDP to billions which is only possible by $LLD.” – Notdumpdotfun . Liberland highlighted that its blockchain is the first chain to be used in the real world, with over 100 companies legally operating on the Liberland blockchain. The country’s LLD powers the sovereign Liberland blockchain, which is bridged to Ethereum via SORA and Solana via deBridge. The country believes that its official national currency contributed to its rising demand. LLD serves as a functional currency of a real-world nation, unlike most speculative-based cryptocurrencies. The country also uses the digital asset for governance, trade, and legal transactions within its borders. Liberland also highlights LLD’s supply and deflationary model with controlled issuance, which makes the token resistant to inflation. The country has also attracted businesses and individuals seeking financial sovereignty, with LLD enabling transactions in an emerging digital economy. Many believe that Liberland could become a model for future digital nation-states with increasing support from libertarians, crypto investors, and entrepreneurs. LLD could emerge as a leading cryptocurrency in the era of decentralized nations if blockchain-based governance proves to be a viable alternative to traditional government structures.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-11 07:45:00

Meanwhile, the pattern seems to have changed slightly since the beginning of 2025, as the ETH price remains stuck within a range but the other altcoins have gained huge momentum while the BTC price formed a new ATH. Does this suggest whether the probability of an AltSeason is not influenced by the Ethereum price rally? If yes, then why are the whales constantly accumulating ETH? Do they know something we must know? When Will AltSeason Begin? The AltSeason mainly has 3 criteria: the Bitcoin dominance should drop, the Ethereum price needs to trigger a strong rally and the altcoin market cap should rebound and initiate a strong upswing. Apart from this, whale accumulation also has a deep impact, as it may change the trajectory of the markets. Firstly, Bitcoin’s dominance is constantly rising and is trying to breach the final resistance zone As seen in the above chart, the BTC dominance rebounded after losing support and is testing the crucial resistance zone between 60.31% and 61.62% The levels appear to be primed for a bullish continuation, as testing the higher range around 70% may mark the beginning of Altseason as it happened during the 2017 and 2021 bull run. The BTC dominance dropped massively from 70% to levels below 40%. With this, it can be analysed that the BTC price still has some room to swell and hence a new BTC ATH could be imminent and AltSeason may begin only after that. Altcoin Market Capitalisation at a Crucial Juncture Total market capitalization excluding Bitcoin sheds light on the performance of altcoins, which has reached a crucial juncture. The rally has been following a pattern and has flashed a signal at the beginning of an altseason. The levels usually surpassed the previous highs, which further offers a strong base during a bearish fall. Currently, the levels have failed to breach the previous highs, displaying a diverse price action. As seen in the above chart, the altcoin market cap breaches the support and rises finely, which further becomes the base during the pullback. Meanwhile, the levels have failed to surpass the previous highs, this time with the volume almost equal to the 2021 bull run. This could suggest the altcoins may undertake a diverse path this time, but the whale accumulation shows signs of an Altseason. Whales Accumulate ETH & BTC Whale accumulation is considered one of the important indicators that have a significant impact on the upcoming price action. In a recent update, the data shared by a well-known crypto proponent, anonymously known as Altcoin Scholar , shows that whales have accumulated ETH at a very large scale This suggests whales might be expecting a major price shift, which is a massive bullish indicator. On the other hand, whales are also accumulating Bitcoin, which has raised significantly in February. The above data from Santiment shows there has been a 0.8% increase in the BTC wallets that hold more than 100 BTC while a 0.3% drop in wallets holding BTC below 100. This raises skepticism about where the markets are heading too. Whether a Bitcoin bull run is on the horizon or a strong Altseason? The altcoin season index is a metric used to measure the performance of altcoins and also to gauge whether the markets are heading towards a BTC bull run or altseason, which is currently not in favour of either of them. The levels between 0 and 33 suggest Bitcoin has held a huge dominance, while levels between 67 and 100 are an indicator of an AltSeason. Meanwhile, the current level is around 45, which is between 34 and 66, signaling a ‘Neutral Phase’. This is a phase where Bitcoin and altcoins perform similarly. Hence, we need to wait and watch to see where the market trend will shift in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|ETH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-11 07:51:31

PI Coin Price To Hit $1000 If Donald Trump Creates PI Reserve The discussion around a U.S. Bitcoin reserve has taken center stage following Donald Trump’s resurgence in the political landscape. However, recent speculation has sparked an alternative hypothesis: What if Trump designates PI Coin as the United States’ strategic crypto reserve? Crypto bettors on Polymarket are currently pricing in a 42% chance that Trump will establish a Bitcoin reserve in 2025, according to market prediction platforms. But in a hypothetical scenario where PI Coin becomes the reserve choice, analysts predict an astronomical rise in its valuation. By leveraging its decentralized framework and rapidly growing adoption, PI Coin could experience a meteoric rally to $1000, fundamentally altering the global financial structure. Crypto Bettors price-in 42% Chance of Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Adoption in 2025, Feb 11, | Source: PolyMarket The reasoning behind this projection stems from PI Coin’s unique positioning as a mobile-mined digital asset with a vast community backing. If governmental endorsement materializes, institutional capital would flood into PI Coin, triggering exponential growth similar to Bitcoin’s early adoption phases. In such a case, PI could surpass the $1000 milestone in record time, establishing itself as a dominant crypto asset alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Short-Term Projection (2025-2026) In the event of a PI Coin reserve announcement, the short-term effects would be seismic. A surge in mainstream media coverage and heightened investor enthusiasm could push PI Coin’s price up by 100-200% within the first few months, setting new all-time highs between $100 and $200. In a more aggressive scenario, where institutional adoption accelerates, PI Coin could reach an unprecedented $500 valuation by 2026. This growth would be supported by increasing liquidity, improved exchange listings, and widespread acceptance as a transactional asset. The initial wave of institutional and retail FOMO (fear of missing out) would likely be the primary catalyst, driving an exponential rise in demand. Mid-Term PI Coin Price Projections (2027-2029) By 2027, assuming continued government backing and global integration, PI Coin could become a critical player in the digital economy. A conservative estimate suggests a 500-1000% increase from 2026 levels, placing PI Coin in the $500-$1000 range. A moderate scenario sees PI Coin solidifying itself as a leading cryptocurrency, possibly replacing stablecoins in mainstream transactions. Under such circumstances, PI Coin could challenge Bitcoin’s dominance, attracting capital inflows that drive its price to $2000 or more. However, this would require substantial regulatory clarity, infrastructure development, and institutional adoption. Long-Term Price Projections (2030-2035) In the long run, PI Coin could see unparalleled growth if it achieves full integration into global financial systems. A conservative estimate would see PI Coin priced at $1000-$2500, representing a significant 5000% increase from current levels. In a more bullish scenario, where PI Coin’s adoption rivals Bitcoin’s, a valuation of $5000-$10,000 is conceivable. This would be driven by widespread institutional trust, global remittance applications, and the digital asset being recognized as a store of value. Such a price surge would see PI Coin’s market capitalization reaching trillions, securing its place as one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies of all time. What Next For Pi Coin Price After 26% Gains in 6 Days? PI Coin has been on a remarkable rally, gaining 26% in the last six days and currently consolidating around $48. The recent bullish momentum indicates strong buying interest, with key indicators pointing towards further potential gains. Analyzing the daily chart, PI Coin’s price is currently testing a key resistance level near $50. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed to 56.82, signaling increasing bullish momentum, yet still below the overbought threshold. If buying pressure persists, a breakout above $50 could trigger another leg up towards the $60-$65 range. Pi Coin Price Forecast | PIUSDT However, a potential bearish scenario would emerge if PI Coin fails to hold the $45 support level. The Chande Kroll Stop indicator suggests strong support around $40.975, which could act as a reversal zone in case of a downturn. Additionally, trading volume remains elevated at 13.79K, indicating continued interest from market participants. If PI Coin manages to stay above $48 in the coming days, the next bullish target remains $55-$60. Conversely, failure to sustain current levels could lead to a retest of $45 or even a drop toward $40. The overall outlook remains bullish as long as PI Coin maintains its upward trajectory, with strong chances of further appreciation in the coming weeks.

He predicted that by May or June, several companies could go public, thanks to a new SEC environment. Galaxy Digital itself has been waiting 4.5 years to list, highlighting the potential wave of crypto-related companies hitting the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq soon. This year is different, under Trump’s leadership, the US economy and low borrowing rates are creating a bullish path for public listings. Last month, NYSE’s VP of listings, Chris Taylor, predicted a boom in IPOs, citing increased interest from cryptocurrency enterprises. Taylor expressed hope for regulatory improvements under new SEC leadership could further streamline the IPO process for innovative blockchain businesses. High-Profile Crypto Gatherings Signal Bullish Sentiment Moving on, Novogratz also predicted that Bitcoin could appear on the U.S. government’s balance sheet within six months, cementing its role as a store of value. He even mentioned having lunch with the head of one of the largest sovereign wealth funds, who was ready to invest $500 million into Bitcoin post-election, signaling growing institutional interest. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Grayscale’s Cardano ETF Filing Sparks New Bullish Sentiment, Boosting ADA Price , Addressing the Crypto Bubble Debate Pantera Capital founder dan morehead dan morehead Dan Morehead established Pantera Capital in 2003 as a worldwide full-scale hedge investment after 10 years, in 2013, the firm went through an absolute rebranding as it started putting resources into blockchain and digital currency. Today, Pantera Capital is one of the most conspicuous blockchain trading companies in the United States and one of the biggest institutional proprietors of advanced resources. As well as offering a few crypto-centered reserves, Pantera's Venture Investments division has put resources into more than 50 blockchain organizations, including Bitstamp, Ripple, Bakkt, Xapo, BitGo, and ShapeShift.He has over 25 years of involvement as a mutual funds supervisor and monetary counselor.

He argued that it’s premature to call it a bubble when institutional holdings in blockchain remain minimal. Morehead pointed out that if even a small portion of the $500 trillion in global assets moves into crypto, the market could see substantial growth. He expects this shift to begin this year, based on recent discussions with institutions warming up to crypto investments. Novogratz acknowledged the possibility of Bitcoin dipping to $80,000 but sees this as a buying opportunity rather than a sign of weakness. According to him, such fluctuations do not undermine the long-term potential of crypto space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Is It Carry Trade or Outright Bearish Bets?,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/11/hedge-funds-are-short-ether-cme-futures-like-never-before-is-it-carry-trade-or-outright-bearish-bets,"Hedge funds hold record short positions in ether (ETH) futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), raising questions about the motivations behind these positions. At first glance, the data could suggest that sophisticated market players anticipate price slides, as discussed on social media. However, this isn’t entirely accurate; carry trades or arbitrage plays primarily drive the record short interest, but some of these short futures trades represent outright bearish bets on the cryptocurrency, per observers. As of the week ended Feb. 4, hedge funds held a net short position of 11,341 contracts in the CME futures, according to data tracked by ZeroHedge and the Kobeissi Letter. The number has increased 40% in one week and 500% since November, according to The Kobeissi Letter. ""There is evidence suggesting that a notable portion of the short interest in Ether futures is tied to the carry trade. Despite macro headwinds and Ether's relative underperformance, U.S. ETH ETF inflows have remained steady over the past three months, coinciding with an increase in futures short interest—potentially signaling an uptick in basis trades,"" Thomas Erdösi, head of product at CF Benchmarks, told CoinDesk. CF Benchmarks provides reference rates that underpin CME's bitcoin (BTC) and ether derivatives. Carry trades, also known as basis trades, seek to profit from price discrepancies between the two markets. In ETH's case, it involves hedge funds shorting the CME futures while simultaneously buying the spot ether ETFs listed in the U.S. ""Hedge funds, in particular, appear to be active in this trade through regulated venues, in this case selling CME Ether Futures while buying ETHA [BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust ETF]. Additionally, Ethereum’s basis has occasionally exceeded Bitcoin’s, making Ether carry trades more attractive,"" Erdosi said. Erdosi explained that the short interest has increased by roughly $470 million recently, which corresponds with the inflow of around $480 million in spot ETFs, which validates the argument. That said, the overall short interest in the CME futures could involve some outright bearish bets to hedge against downside risks in ether. Traders could be shorting ether futures as a hedge against long bets in the altcoin complex. ""However, not all hedge fund short interest is necessarily driven by basis trades—some may be outright shorts given ETH’s lagging performance, particularly against other programmable settlement chains like SOL and a broader rally in altcoins,"" Erdosi added. ETH options on both the CME and offshore giant Deribit show a bias for put options expiring in the near-term. It's a sign of lingering downside fears in ether. A put option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, looking to hedge against or profit from an expected price drop in the underlying asset. A call buy is implicitly bullish. Long-end ETH options show pricier calls, a sign of bullish long-term expectations.",Markets|Hedge Fund|Ether|CME,EN,0,0,TRADING|ETH|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 07:58:58

After steady accumulation, buyers are beginning to take control, pushing the price higher and reinforcing optimism in the market. This growing confidence suggests that ADA could be on the verge of a significant breakout, provided it can overcome key resistance zones. With technical indicators turning positive and market sentiment improving, all eyes are on whether ADA can sustain its upward momentum. A decisive move past $0.8119 may pave the way for further gains, while failure to break through might invite renewed selling pressure. As the battle between bulls and bears intensifies, the coming sessions will be crucial in determining Cardano’s next move. Technical Analysis: Can ADA Sustain Its Upside Trajectory? Presently, Cardano is exhibiting strong bullish momentum as it steadily climbs toward the $0.8119 resistance level, a barrier crucial for its next major move. After facing a strong rebound at the $0.6822 support mark, buying pressure has increased, pushing ADA higher as market sentiment turns optimistic. but the sustainability of this uptrend depends on key technical factors. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) In The Red: Struggles Persist Under $1.00 It is worth noting that ADA’s price steadily rises toward the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a critical level that often acts as a dynamic resistance. A successful break above this indicator could reinforce positive sentiment and pave the way for extended gains. Supporting this momentum, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently crossed above the 50% threshold, indicating a shift from bearish to bullish market conditions. This is a significant development, as an RSI above 50% typically suggests that buying pressure outweighs selling pressure, triggering further upside potential. Additionally, ADA’s trading volume has surged by over 10% in the last 24 hours, indicating growing market activity and increased investor interest. This uptick in volume suggests that traders are becoming more engaged, possibly fueling price movements. As long as the RSI remains on an upward trajectory and buying pressure continues to rise alongside volume, it might strengthen ADA’s bullish outlook, increasing the likelihood of a breakout above key resistance levels. What’s Next For Cardano? Predictions Beyond $0.8119 As Cardano continues its upward trajectory, breaking through the $0.8119 resistance level has become a focal point. But what lies beyond this key milestone? Related Reading: ADA Faces Retest Of $0.8119 As Technical Indicators Turn Bearish If buyers maintain control and push the price above this key barrier, ADA is likely to see an extended rally toward $0.8306 and $0.9077 in the near term. A decisive move above these levels can strengthen upward performances, opening the door for a test of $1.2630, a psychological milestone. However, if Cardano struggles to surpass $0.8119, it may enter a consolidation phase or experience a pullback, with $0.6822 as the next closest support level. The bulls must hold this zone to prevent further bearish pressure. Furthermore, a break below this level could signal an extended correction, exposing ADA to deeper losses.

Will It Affect the Ripple (XRP) Case?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/new-development-in-binance-sec-case-they-filed-a-joint-petition-will-it-affect-the-ripple-xrp-case/,"While SEC Chairman Paul Atkins is expected to take office, there has been a new development in the Binance and SEC case. US media outlet Fox Business reported that Binance and the SEC have requested a 60-day stay in their ongoing lawsuit. Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett reported in a post on her X account that Binance and the SEC have requested that their lawsuit in court be suspended for 60 days, considering that the SEC’s new cryptocurrency working group could have an impact on the case. This is the first major development in the Binance case since SEC interim Chairman Mark Uyeda took over as SEC helm last month. “Binance and the SEC have filed a joint motion to stay the lawsuit against Binance for 60 days, suggesting that the SEC’s new crypto task force could have a potential impact on the case. “The work of this task force could influence and facilitate the potential resolution of this case,” they said. In the joint petition submitted to the court, reference was made to the possible effects of the crypto task force created under the leadership of SEC member Hester Peirce, known as the crypto mother. Both parties agreed that the work of the newly formed crypto task force could impact litigation resolution and said they would submit a status report at the end of the 60-day period on whether an extension was needed. Eleanor Terrett predicted that following the developments in the Binance case, a similar path could be followed in crypto lawsuits filed against platforms such as Ripple, Coinbase and Kraken.

Through text messages sent from a prison facility in Kuje, Nigeria , Gambaryan described his condition to journalist Andy Greenberg. He said that he was “essentially crippled” after his health took a turn for the worse. The Binance exec had grown weaker due to the horrible circumstances he faced in prison, as he suffered from a 104-degree fever and an old spine injury that had resurfaced. Gambaryan said he felt so frail and weak that at one point he “became convinced he was going to die.” According to the article , Gambaryan remained bed-ridden for weeks and had resorted to taking blood thinners to prevent clots in his legs from lack of movement. “Every night, he wrote, he would lie awake until 5 or 6 in the morning, too distracted by pain to even read a book. Sometimes he would call his family and talk to his daughter as she played a Japanese role-playing game,” wrote Greenberg. Tigran Gambaryan was able to contact the outside world through a secret phone he acquired during his time in a Kuje prison cell. The Nigerian authorities had him under almost-constant surveillance and became weary he would escape after his Binance colleague, Nadeem Anjarwalla managed to run from a government guesthouse and flew out of the country.

I’ve been detained by the Nigerian government for a month. I don’t know what’s going to happen to me after today,” he said in a video shot on March 23rd, 2024. “They will take my phone away. The only thing I ask is, guys, I’ve done nothing wrong. I’ve been a cop my whole life, I just ask the Nigerian government to let me go and I ask the United States government to assist me,” he continued. During his time in detainment, Tigran Gambaryan had to go through a series of court hearings leading up to his release. Overtime, he had become so weak from his illnesses that he had limped into court on crutches. However, the court staff were not allowed to help him in any way. “This is f*cked up! Why can’t I use a goddamn wheelchair? I’m an innocent person. I’m a fucking human,” he screamed in outrage in a viral video. On Oct. 23, 2024, the Nigerian court finally ruled in favor of Tigran Gambaryan’s release after the government dropped all charges against him to allow him to get medical treatment abroad. He was given back his passport and belongings as well as permission to fly back to the United States, but not before he was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine for overstaying his visa. The report also revealed that Gambaryan has considered rejoining government service and pursuing a human rights lawsuit against the Nigerian government for detaining him for 8 months under inhumane conditions. “I wanted justice. And I still do,” said Gambaryan.

In a strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 67,800 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin appears to be in the midst of a corrective wave two within a five-wave rally. Credible practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to see a five-wave surge where waves two and four are corrective periods and waves one, three and five are upside moves. According to the crypto strategist, it is within the realm of possibility for Bitcoin to retrace to below $80,000 before sparking a violent burst to the upside. “The important takeaway from this chart is that this sub-wave two that we have depicted here can technically go lower into the $70,000s or even $80,000s without it affecting this higher time frame structure. As long as you don’t go below the origin of this impulse which is down here at $58,000, we can technically retrace deeper into this region without it harming the higher time frame structure… The other key takeaway here is that the moves to the upside as we go up here should get even more aggressive than the move from $58,000 to $90,000 because this is essentially the parabolic blow-off top. The final fifth wave of the fifth wave of the cycle that started back when Bitcoin was trading at $3,000 in 2018… This move should be the most aggressive move we’ve seen in this cycle.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin will rally to at least $150,000 as the “minimum end of cycle target” but BTC could go as high as $230,000. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $97,987.

Having decreased by 22% in a week, it trades at support and looks prime for a down surge. After the first retracement phase that brought the price to a month low, XLM bounced back but failed to push the price above the $0.51 level. It marked resistance there and initiated a drop. That drop led to another retracement and the price tested a low of $0.26 after three weeks of steady drops. While this caused a major breakdown at the crucial $0.32 support level, the price didn’t stay much at that low due to bullish interception and the crypto traded back above this support. Facing resistance at $0.37, the crypto lost grip again and resumed drops, although the pressure appears low. If the bulls take advantage of this weakness, we may see a fresh increase anytime soon. As of now, it is yet to show signs of recovery. Meantime, the last three days have been boring for many traders as they saw little to no movement. The mentioned support level is still holding amid bearish market speculations. A clear breakdown from this support could bring us back to the weekly low before breaking lower. A recovery there should bring buying pressure back into the market. If that happens, XLM may reclaim the lost support before exploding massively. Currently, it is attempting to close the week in gain. XLM’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Aside from the mentioned losing support, the current weekly low is another level to watch. If they fail to contain selling pressure, the next level to consider for support is $0.189 and mainly $0.1. An increase could allow a recovery to $0.39 and $0.51. A cross over these levels could bring a full recovery to $0.637. The level to watch for a breakup is $0.8. Key Resistance Levels: $0.39, $0.51, $0.637 Key Support Levels: $0.32, $0.26, $0.189 Spot Price: $0.332 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This block contained 3,071 transactions and was mined by an individual identified as “unknown.” Bitcoin miner Marshall Long noted that the miner utilized an implementation of the CKPOOL but appeared not to be directly associated with it. He speculated that the miner might have employed a Bitaxe device, which can be used for solo mining or in mining pools where computational power is combined to enhance the likelihood of solving a block. The current Bitcoin network hashrate stands at approximately 788.86 million terahashes per second (TH/s), reflecting a slight decrease from the previous day’s 795.29 million TH/s but marking a significant 53% increase compared to the same period last year. A higher hashrate necessitates greater computing power, leading to increased energy costs and longer verification times, which pose challenges for solo miners attempting to validate blocks independently. Solo miners solving blocks is a rare occurrence due to the substantial hashrate requirements. Typically, large mining firms such as Bit Digital, Riot Blockchain, and Marathon Digital dominate block validation, given their extensive hash power. As of now, over 19 million of the 21 million total Bitcoin supply have been awarded to miners through block rewards. This event coincides with a recovery in the cryptocurrency markets, following a temporary decline after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on aluminum and steel, escalating trade tensions. Bitcoin’s price has rebounded, currently trading above $98,000, though it remains below its all-time high of over $109,000 reached on January 20. This instance underscores the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin mining, where even individual miners with limited resources can occasionally achieve significant rewards.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|MINING|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-11 09:29:49

Key highlights : 2024 was ‘a year of onboarding’ for crypto exchanges: crypto platforms experienced a 20% rise in traffic during major market events such as the re-election of President Donald Trump and Bitcoin rallies in November 2024. Fraud in the crypto industry has soared by 48% , with document forgery constituting 31% of all detected fraud cases. 60% of crypto companies foresee stricter regulations, while only 29% fully comply with the Travel Rule. As the industry navigates a pivotal period of growth and regulation, the report identifies three critical challenges that crypto providers faced in 2024 and should address in 2025 in order to succeed: security threats, technology capabilities, and regulation. Security challenge: Fraud rising in the crypto sector Sumsub’s data reveals that fraud in the crypto industry has gone up by 48% , now making up 2.2% of all verification attempts across global crypto platforms. This surge highlights the need for companies to adopt AI-powered detection, biometrics, and continuous monitoring to enhance security. Nigeria recorded the highest rate of fraud across the crypto sector, with 8.3% of verification attempts flagged as fraudulent. The most popular fraud types are document forgery (affecting 31% of surveyed companies), phishing ( 20% ) and money mulling ( 15% ), followed by account takeover ( 14% ) and forced verification ( 12% ). Tech challenge: traffic spikes to crypto platforms Innovations like biometric checks, AI-backed automation and document-free verification have boosted crypto platform users’ onboarding success rates to 93.39% and reduced verification time by 46% , overall improving customer onboarding while reducing drop-off cases. The report highlights notable innovations like document-free verification , which has enhanced verification times in every country where it was implemented, with an average improvement of 3.6% . The top-three countries with the fastest non-document user onboarding speed of 2 seconds are Brazil, the UK and Bangladesh . Document-free identity verification has already gained adoption by 19% of surveyed companies worldwide, with Africa leading the way at 27%, showcasing the region’s openness to innovative solutions. The key user onboarding issues that crypto providers aim to mitigate include: slow verification times, which impact 36% of surveyed companies, as well as false positives/negatives (48%). Furthermore, over half (55%) of companies reported dissatisfaction with overall user experience. Regulatory challenge: understanding Travel Rule compliance requirements According to Sumsub’s Crypto Industry Research Survey 2024, three-in-five (60%) companies foresee stricter regulations, emphasizing the need for proactive compliance upgrades. A key focus is the Travel Rule (FATF Recommendation 16), which urges VASPs to exchange sender-recipient information during crypto transfers. However, only 29% of companies fully comply, with unclear guidance cited as a key barrier. The gap between legal requirements rendering global crypto transactions transparent and their disproportional adoption leaves many firms at risk of sanctions and fines. The study also highlights Sumsub’s analysis of the leading crypto-friendly hubs in 2024 with well-defined regulations, strong infrastructure, and innovation-driven environments. “The regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly, and crypto businesses cannot afford to fall behind. Europe once appeared to be leading the world with its comprehensive MiCA regulation. However, with the Trump administration promoting crypto and advocating for a digital asset framework, the playing field is shifting. MiCA’s stringent requirements may be challenging for companies to meet, opening the door for the U.S. to reassert itself as the hub of crypto innovation,” comments Ilya Brovin, Chief Growth Officer at Sumsub. “Once deemed the ‘Wild West,’ crypto is now at an inflection point. Companies must adopt robust onboarding technology, strengthen security to protect users from fraud, and ensure compliance to avoid penalties and reputational damage.” To explore the State of the Crypto Industry 2025 report, please visit https://sumsub.com/crypto-industry-report/ * Note on Sumsub’s research methodology The study compares internal identity verification and user activity data from 2023 and 2024, covering pass rates, verification time, and fraud attempts across various regions.

40187540,https://nulltx.com/?p=144466,1739266211,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,A Stark Contrast: Futures Volume Trends Between Blue Chips and Memecoins,https://nulltx.com/a-stark-contrast-futures-volume-trends-between-blue-chips-and-memecoins/,"Several striking trends have emerged in the world of futures trading for cryptocurrency over the last few months, especially when one looks at the stark contrast between the almost steady volume of futures contracts tied to some of the major cryptocurrencies (i.e., blue chips like Bitcoin [$BTC] and Ethereum [$ETH]) and the now-there-one-second, gone-the-next explosion in futures tied to that new breed of cryptocurrencies (i.e., memecoins). Blue-Chip Cryptos: A More Stable Decline The overall trading volume of futures across the major cryptocurrencies has seen a marked decrease of late, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, unlike the situation with their memecoin counterparts, these blue-chip assets have not seen a corresponding dip in demand. On the contrary, they have been in high demand for an extended period, which is a testament to their strong market presence and solid investor base. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Bitcoin, has seen its futures volume drop from a peak of $98.4 billion to $54.4 billion, marking a 45% decrease. Despite this pullback, Bitcoin remains a major market force, with trading volumes still staying strong months after reaching their November highs. While the volume drop is certainly noticeable and may even appear a bit alarming at first, it looks more like a step toward some kind of market consolidation with price levels that developers and investors can live with, rather than any kind of pronounced sell-off or exit by investors. In the same way, Ethereum, the cryptocurrency that ranks second, has suffered a decline in futures volume—17% from $43.4 billion to $36.2 billion. Ethereum has also seen its volume recede from a peak; however, it too displays a pretty steady demand from traders and investors. Its value proposition mostly comes from its use as a platform for decentralized applications (dApps), and from its commanding position in the smart contract arena, which keeps it on the radar of both retail and institutional investors. Attention has recently turned to Solana ($SOL) because of its growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the NFT space, but the futures volume tied to the altcoin fell drastically. It was down 47%, coming in at $7.9 billion after previously hitting $14.7 billion. Now, while that is a steep decline, you have to remember that Solana has a pretty big cloud hanging over it due to network outages and other technical problems that have dogged the project and that may have temporarily reduced trading activity. Still, Solana remains a top-10 (by market cap) player in the crypto space, and our dedicated team of analysts sees potential for it to move higher. Memecoins: Explosive Growth Followed by Quick Declines In striking contrast, coins that are based on memes, such as Dogecoin ($DOGE) and Shiba Inu ($SHIB), have seen explosive growth in futures volume that, just as quickly, they’ve seen those gains evaporate. The speculation that drives memecoins is well-known and well-documented. Traders jump in and out of memecoins at the latest fad—they’re basically trend-based trades— and once the trend fades, so do the gains. With its meme status and endorsements from high-profile folks like Elon Musk, Dogecoin has a sort of following that’s almost cult-like. But that didn’t help it when, over just 24 hours, futures volume plummeted from $20.0 billion to $3.0 billion—an 85% drop that’s more reminiscent of a market correction than of trading activity associated with the kind of coin that a certain someone on Instagram tends to promote. In short, don’t put your life savings into Dogecoin, and if you put anything in it, treat it like you would any other adventure you might go on, with the potential for fun to the max but also for loss. In much the same way, other well-liked memecoins, such as WIF and SHIB, encountered considerable falls in their futures volume. WIF (likely a reference to a now-defunct futures trading platform) had a 69% drop, from $2.87 billion to $0.90 billion, while SHIB had an almost unbelievable 90% crash, down to $0.28 billion from $2.72 billion. This appears to be yet another example of the short-lived nature of excitement surrounding memecoins. Other memecoins, such as PEPE and BONK, also saw steep declines, with futures volume for PEPE plunging 78% from $7.37 billion to $1.59 billion and futures volume for BONK cratering 92% from $1.99 billion to $0.16 billion. These figures highlight a principal feature of the memecoin market: large-volume speculative surges, followed by equally sharp downturns once the excitement fades. Comparing futures volume across blue chips and memecoins shows a stark contrast in how interest is sustained. $BTC : $98.4B → $54.4B (-45%) $ETH : $43.4B → $36.2B (-17%) $SOL : $14.7B → $7.9B (-47%) #BTC & #ETH saw moderate pullbacks but remained in high demand for months after… pic.twitter.com/lWMXcwT7dE — glassnode (@glassnode) February 10, 2025 The Nature of Speculation The trend with memecoins indicates a wider theme in the cryptocurrency world: the dominance of speculation and the drama of some assets going up and down, really fast. Memecoins don’t move on any sort of fundamental developments or long-term technological progress (if they did, they’re too young to have fans like Dogecoin does). Instead, price movements are entirely about us, the community of traders, influencers, and would-be influencers. We pump them up and then, when our allotment of fun is over, we dump them. A post about the overall trend of memecoins on Cointelegraph puts it bluntly: “Price surges often have little to no actual basis and are, rather, a product of the power of the meme.” When compared to them, blue-chip cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have a number of advantages that contribute to their greater resilience in the futures markets. The advantages these digital coins possess are use cases that are substantial and far-reaching, communities that are both well-established and robust, and networks—sustaining their coins—that are under continuous, well-directed, and substantial development. Indeed, even when volume numbers take a big hit, Bitcoin and Ethereum look to be holding up very well at the moment. Why? Because institutional investors and big traders have made a decision to stand pat. Conclusion: A Tale of Two Markets To sum up, the futures market for cryptocurrencies shows two distinct trends. The first and more interesting trend is the relatively stable, if not entirely sustained, interest in blue-chip assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. Even if the volumes pulled back a bit recently, these blue-chip assets appear to have long-term demand from both individual and institutional investors. The second trend that the futures market shows is in the direction of memecoins. Interest in these tokens is unavoidably speculative, and so the volumes attached to them drive sharp but temporary surges in overall market volume. These contrasting trends emphasize the contrasting kinds of investor behaviors within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Although blue-chip assets are often seen as safer, more reliable investments, memecoins represent the high-risk, high-reward side of the market. They embody a kind of investment that, in a mature financial system, is usually relegated to the domain of in-your-face, high-payoff poker. Like something out of the Wild West, the memecoin market thrives on the kind of sensation that raises your blood pressure one minute and makes you feel good about your decision the next. And compared to other markets around the world and even in our own backyards, the crypto market has the potential to offer the kind of payoffs that might make a caper film seem pedestrian.

Although many altcoins have gone through boom‐and‐bust cycles in their histories, the attached chart reveals that DOGE has largely respected this upward‐sloping range for more than a decade. “DOGE is holding strong above the upper boundary of this channel, keeping the path open for a potential rally toward $4!” Martinez claims. Dogecoin Poised For $4? The channel itself is composed of two primary bold lines—defining the lower and upper ranges of price action—as well as a series of dashed mid‐channel lines. In 2014, Dogecoin lingered below $0.00017. Year later, in March 2020, Dogecoin fell to $0.00134, a level that corresponds to the 0% Fibonacci reference point on the chart. From there, price action began forming a gentle uptrend that has become clearer over time, punctuated by spikes in 2017–2018, a run in mid‐2019, and most notably the massive rally in 2021 when DOGE surged to a historical high of approximately $0.73905. Following a sharp retracement, price briefly consolidated near $0.06654, a zone marked by the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. DOGE then built enough strength to climb above the 0.786 Fibonacci level around $0.19183, which coincided with the midpoint of the lower ascending channel.

In April 2024 as well as in December 2024, DOGE was rejected at this trendline near $0.23 and $0.48 respectively. With the current correction, DOGE may have successfully completed a retest of the previous local high near $0.23 and is now ready for the next rise. Notably, periods when DOGE has gravitated around these dashed lines have often preceded large directional moves, both on the way up and on the way down. A break above the lower dashed line which currently sits near $0.50 could potentially trigger Dogecoin’s next major upside move. Overall, the overarching takeaway from Ali’s perspective is that Dogecoin remains structurally intact within this multi‐year trend, reinforcing the idea that future price expansions are possible. Fibonacci analysis featured on the chart shows multiple levels spaced throughout Dogecoin’s history. The 0.618 retracement at around $0.06654 stands out for having captured the lows of the 2022 bear market, while the 0.786 Fibonacci mark near $0.19183 served as a consolidation pivot before the current move higher. Related Reading: Is Dogecoin Massively Undervalued? Analyst Says ‘Now Is The Time’ Above the 1.0 extension (the 2021 all‐time high around $0.73905) lie key Fibonacci extension targets, namely 1.272 near $4.10, 1.414 around $10.04, and 1.618 near $36.32. These levels provide a technical roadmap for the most optimistic scenarios, though each one becomes progressively more speculative as price would need to shatter multiple psychological and technical barriers to reach them. By reclaiming and holding above the upper boundary of the channel, Dogecoin appears to be staging another potential expansion phase. Chart interpretations suggest that as long as DOGE remains above this threshold, it retains a bullish structure that has reliably channeled rising prices over the past decade. If, however, price were to fall back below $0.0.19, it could slip towards the lower boundary of the channel or possibly even break below it, thus destroying the bullish case for DOGE. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.26791.

Yet amid this optimism, some watchers say another altcoin might follow Toncoin’s upward trajectory over the next few years: Remittix (RTX). This PayFi newcomer has just topped $10.8 million in funding, sold over 440 million tokens and sits at $0.0539. Below is a closer look at why investors compare Toncoin’s established network to Remittix (RTX)’s real-world remittance approach and how each could reach new heights by 2025. Toncoin: Riding the Layer-1 Boom Initially developed for Telegram, Toncoin aims to deliver high-speed transactions, low fees and strong security, hoping to stand out in a market filled with competing layer-1 blockchains. With a price hovering around $3.85, Toncoin has drawn the attention of those seeking next-generation solutions that can handle smart contracts, DeFi and more. Bulls believe if Toncoin’s developer ecosystem keeps expanding, the coin’s valuation could jump even further. Critics note that Toncoin must compete with other well-known blockchains like Solana or Ethereum for developer loyalty. Nevertheless, the project’s unique messaging lineage and advanced tech capabilities might prove appealing. Many analysts cite Toncoin’s steady growth since becoming an independent chain, suggesting it has the infrastructure to climb higher if major dApps and partnerships land on its platform. If that happens, Toncoin’s price could see another significant run, inspiring fresh wave predictions through 2025. Remittix (RTX): A Different Path to Breakthrough So why do some investors say Remittix (RTX) could “mirror” Toncoin’s price action? Instead of focusing on top-tier tech speed, Remittix (RTX) solves a universal problem: high wire fees and convoluted bank requirements. Imagine a web designer in Southeast Asia working for American clients. Traditional overseas payments might involve punishing exchange rates and hidden fees. Remittix(RTX) aims to reduce costs by bridging fiat and crypto. This real-life utility resonates with freelancers, migrant workers and families who frequently send money home. Remittix (RTX) has already raised $10.8 million, a figure that dwarfs many comedic meme tokens or purely speed-centric altcoins in their early stages. Having sold more than 440 million tokens at $0.0539, Remittix (RTX) is gaining credibility as a PayFi candidate that might sustain steady growth. Observers note how Toncoin’s valuation soared once it established a reliable user base and real-world use cases. If Remittix (RTX) locks in global remittance partnerships or local kiosk integrations, the altcoin might similarly surge, especially by 2025. Which Coin Could Dominate 2025? Toncoin’s path to $3.85 underscores how a solid technology base and active dev community can bolster long-term gains. Remittix (RTX) offers an entirely different angle: everyday finance, focusing on bridging fiat and crypto for near-instant, low-fee transfers. Both coins could thrive if the market values real-world adoption though each caters to distinct user bases. Investors curious about advanced layer-1 ecosystems might lean toward Toncoin, while those wanting to see cost savings for unbanked populations might favor Remittix (RTX). The biggest question is whether the PayFi approach can replicate Toncoin’s traction, driving RTX to a price that mirrors more prominent names. For scouting opportunities, tracking the expansion of Remittix (RTX) partnerships and dev progress on Toncoin may be wise. If Toncoin remains developer-friendly and signs big dApp deals, it might break higher. Meanwhile, if families and freelancers keep flocking to Remittix (RTX) for simpler remittances, the altcoin could see substantial volume and climb toward the coveted $1 mark. Only time will tell which angle high-performance networks or day-to-day finance delivers the most explosive returns. Conclusion: Two Unique Journeys Toward 2025 With Toncoin proving that strong fundamentals can drive prices above $3, eyes are on Remittix (RTX) to see if bridging real-world finances can produce a similar or even greater surge. Whether Toncoin’s next wave or Remittix (RTX)’s PayFi revolution arrives first, both represent the crypto market’s shift toward adoption. Toncoin banks on advanced layer-1 capabilities, while Remittix (RTX) meets an immediate human need: cheaper cross-border payments. If either project signs major partnerships or gains mainstream momentum, 2025 could be a landmark year for them both. Ready to Explore Remittix (RTX)?

The tweet claims that Garlinghouse may step down from his role to join the White House Crypto Advisory Council this year. This speculation has led to further debate within the cryptocurrency community about his possible influence on the digital asset industry in the United States. RUMORS: Brad Garlinghouse will step down as a Ripple CEO to join the White House Crypto Advisory Council this year! #XRP pic.twitter.com/VxyCImzkws — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 9, 2025 Speculation and Community Reactions JackTheRippler’s tweet quickly attracted attention from other X users. One user, Alison, questioned why Garlinghouse would need to step down, arguing that his advisory role would not involve direct governance. In response, JackTheRippler suggested that Garlinghouse could become a key figure in shaping the U.S. digital asset industry. Another user, Indy, theorized that Garlinghouse might retain his shares in Ripple while taking on a role where he could influence policy, ultimately benefiting himself and the company. This discussion follows previous speculation by former Ripple director Sean McBride , who indicated a “real and growing possibility” of Garlinghouse being appointed as a “Crypto Czar” in the U.S. government. McBride also claimed that Ripple had succession plans in place should Garlinghouse leave the company. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for Ripple and the Crypto Industry If Garlinghouse were to assume a government role, it could signal a shift in the U.S. approach to cryptocurrency regulation. His experience leading Ripple through its legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and advocating for clearer regulatory frameworks could position him as a strong candidate for influencing national crypto policy. At the same time, Ripple is undergoing major developments, including discussions of a potential initial public offering (IPO) and new product launches. McBride has suggested that Garlinghouse’s transition could be beneficial for both him and Ripple , allowing the company to move forward under new leadership while he focuses on regulatory advancements. The Future of U.S. Crypto Regulation As of now, there is no official confirmation regarding Garlinghouse’s potential appointment or resignation from Ripple. While the speculation gains traction, stakeholders in the crypto industry are awaiting official announcements. If the U.S. government does appoint a key figure to oversee digital asset policy, it could mark a significant turning point for the regulation and adoption of cryptocurrency in the country.

Meanwhile, ETF analysts gave a 90% chance of approval for a spot Litecoin ETF, ahead of other proposed crypto ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin. Additionally, North Carolina introduced a bill to invest public funds in Bitcoin, joining a growing number of states exploring digital asset adoption. Grayscale Bitcoin Fund Lawsuit Takes a New Turn Osprey Funds asked a Connecticut state court judge to revisit his recent ruling in favor of Grayscale Investments in a $2 million unfair trade lawsuit about the asset manager’s Bitcoin fund. In a motion for reargument that was filed on Feb. 10, Osprey argued that Judge Mark Gould’s Feb. 7 decision was premature, as it was issued before the close of discovery and improperly broadened the scope of an exemption under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). Osprey originally sued Grayscale and Delaware Trust Company in January of 2023 after alleging that they engaged in deceptive advertising regarding the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which allowed the fund to dominate the market. The lawsuit claimed that Grayscale falsely presented the conversion of GBTC into a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) as inevitable, despite knowing that regulatory approval was unlikely at the time. However, Judge Gould dismissed Osprey’s claims, and ruled that they involved securities transactions, which are exempt from CUTPA. He also pointed out that at the time of the lawsuit, both Osprey and Grayscale were the only asset managers providing trust-based products that offered ticker-based exposure to Bitcoin. The legal landscape shifted a year later when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the long-awaited conversion of GBTC into an ETF in January 2024. Despite this, Osprey tried to settle its claims against Grayscale for just under $2 million in July of 2024, but Grayscale declined the offer. In its Feb. 10 filing, Osprey argued that Judge Gould’s decision misinterpreted the relationship between deceptive advertising and securities transactions under both Connecticut and federal law. The firm also believes that the ruling incorrectly applied a narrow exemption from CUTPA, effectively extending it to all claims involving firms operating in the securities, asset management, or cryptocurrency industries. Osprey clarified that it was not involved in any securities transaction with Grayscale and that its claims were not focused on any transaction being fraudulent or deceptive between parties but rather on how Grayscale’s advertising practices gave it an unfair competitive advantage. (Source: Osprey Funds ) For now, Osprey is not letting its legal battles slow it down. Last month, the firm filed plans with the SEC to convert its Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF after an acquisition deal with rival Bitwise collapsed. Litecoin ETF Has Highest Approval Odds The crypto ETF industry as a whole is also moving on despite the tensions between Grayscale and Osprey. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas placed a 90% probability on the approval of a spot Litecoin ETF by the SEC before the end of the year. They believe its chances of approval in 2025 are higher than other proposed crypto ETFs, including those for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, which they estimate at 65%, 70%, and 75%, respectively. Litecoin was created in 2011 as a faster alternative to Bitcoin, and it operates on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism similar to Bitcoin. The analysts believe that the SEC is more likely to see Litecoin as a commodity, and with the necessary S-1 and 19b-4 forms already filed and acknowledged, its path to approval seems a lot more straightforward. The push for more crypto ETFs follows the strong demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs , which accumulated net inflows of $40.7 billion and $3.18 billion, respectively, since their launches in January and July 2024. While Seyffart does not expect a Litecoin ETF to attract as much demand, he pointed out that it could still be viable for fund issuers with as little as $50 million in assets. He explained that ETFs do not necessarily need to generate large inflows to be worthwhile for their issuers. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) The SEC’s final deadlines to decide on the Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs fall between Oct. 2 and Oct. 18. Seyffart suggested that a Litecoin ETF could launch before then. Meanwhile, ETFs for Hedera and Polkadot have also been filed by Canary Capital and 21Shares, though the analysts have not assigned approval odds to them just yet. Seyffart expects more crypto ETF filings, and predicted that issuers will follow a ”spaghetti cannon approach” by launching multiple products to see which gain traction. He expects a long list of ETFs holding digital assets to emerge, with those failing to attract investor interest eventually liquidating. Balchunas mentioned that the probability of approval for all these crypto ETFs, except for Litecoin, was below 5% before Donald Trump won the US presidential election in November 2024. Despite the optimism surrounding certain ETF approvals, there are still some regulatory concerns over Solana and XRP’s classification as securities. Because of this, Seyffart predicts that an XRP ETF will not be approved until the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple is fully resolved. (Source: X ) In August of 2023, Ripple secured a partial legal victory when a court ruled that XRP was not a security when it was sold on secondary markets. However, the SEC appealed this decision and held firm that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP to retail investors. These legal actions took place under the leadership of Gary Gensler, but Ripple is now hoping that acting SEC chair Mark Uyeda will reconsider and withdraw the case. Solana’s regulatory status is also still uncertain. Seyffart stated that before the SEC can evaluate Solana for a commodities ETF structure, its classification must be resolved . North Carolina Proposes Bill to Invest Public Funds in Bitcoin North Carolina also recently introduced legislation that will allow the state treasurer to invest public funds in digital assets. The ”NC Digital Assets Investments Act” ( HB 92 ) was proposed by House Speaker Destin Hall on Feb. 10, and it aims to diversify state investments by permitting digital asset holdings, provided they meet specific criteria. To qualify, digital assets have to be an exchange-traded product and have maintained an average market cap of at least $750 billion over the past 12 months. Currently, only Bitcoin exchange-traded products meet this threshold. Additionally, the bill limits digital asset investments to 10% of any state fund’s balance at the time of investment. Hall believes that investing in Bitcoin could generate positive yields for the state’s investment fund, and may position North Carolina as a leader in technological adoption. He also compared the proposal to former President Donald Trump’s vision of a national Bitcoin stockpile, and stated that North Carolina should take the lead at the state level. States considering Bitcoin (Source: Bitcoin Reserve Monitor ) Currently, 19 states introduced similar proposals, and Arizona and Utah have advanced bills beyond the House committee level.

Ripple (XRP) crossed $2.50, with some market observers predicting a further surge to $3. Bitcoin (BTC) saw a modest 1% gain, but the upcoming US CPI data (Feb 12) is likely to drive volatility. LTC Continues the Uptrend The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a notable revival in the past 24 hours, but this time, the altcoins made the big moves. Litecoin (LTC), which was among the top performers yesterday (February 10), is once again in the spotlight. Its price has risen by 15% on a daily scale , currently hovering around $130 (per CoinGecko’s data). LTC’s market capitalization has jumped above $9.7 billion, making the asset the 18th-biggest in the entire sector. LTC Price, Source: CoinGecko According to numerous industry participants, the rally might still be at its starting point. The X user KALEO told his over 600,000 followers that LTC’s high time frame (HTF) is “ insanely clean and simple,” expecting a further push to the upside based on the increased chances of a spot Litecoin ETF approval. Not long ago, Canary Capital submitted an application to file such a product, whereas Grayscale intends to convert its existing Litecoin Trust into an exchange-traded fund. James Seyffart – an ETF research analyst at Bloomberg – recently estimated that the likelihood of those products seeing the light of day before the end of 2025 is around 90%. The X user Bluntz chipped in, too , claiming that LTC’s price “is trading like the market knows an ETF is imminent.” “Haven’t seen something that looks as clearly bullish as this in a while,” they added. XRP Forecasts Ripple’s native token is another altcoin performing quite well today (February 11). It surpassed $2.50, representing a 4.5% increase in the past 24 hours. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko The X user Cryptomist noted the resurgence, predicting a further rally to as high as $3. Those willing to explore additional price forecasts can take a look at our dedicated article here . Meanwhile, XRP has also joined the ETF race. On February 6, Cboe BZX Exchange lodged 19b-4 filings on behalf of Canary Capital, WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise. The US SEC now must approve or reject the applications within 240 days. According to Polymarket, there is an 81% chance for such an investment vehicle to go live in 2025. The potential launch of a spot XRP ETF would give American investors more options to gain exposure to the asset, which could have a positive effect on the price in the long term. How’s BTC Doing? Last but not least , we will touch upon Bitcoin (BTC), which is also in the green today but trails behind some of the leading altcoins. It currently trades at approximately $98,300, or a mere 1% increase on a 24-hour scale. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko Investors should keep in mind that the asset may experience enhanced volatility this week due to some important upcoming events. One example is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for January 2025. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is scheduled to release the figures on February 12, and as usual, this could lead to significant price movements in the crypto sector. The data is also vital for the Federal Reserve, which considers it when making interest rate decisions. Cooling inflation may prompt the central bank to reduce the benchmark, which could benefit BTC and the entire digital asset industry.

40187650,https://nulltx.com/?p=144465,1739266419,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ethereum Foundation’s Strategic Move and Growing DeFi Involvement,https://nulltx.com/ethereum-foundations-strategic-move-and-growing-defi-involvement/,"The attention of the cryptocurrency community has been captured by a major development: the Ethereum Foundation has transferred 50,000 ETH, approximately $132 million, into its multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet. This transaction, executed over the weekend, signals a potential shift in the Foundation’s financial strategy—one that may be more in line with the DeFi ecosystem. Instead of cashing out regularly to pay for its operations, the Foundation might now be using DeFi protocols in an effort to earn interest on its substantial crypto holdings. Whichever way you slice it, this is a considerable amount of ETH to be moving around, and it underscores a potential change in how the Ethereum Foundation engages with DeFi. The Ethereum Foundation moved 50,000 $ETH (~$132M) to their multi-sig wallet 4 hours ago. This likely aligns with their new strategy to engage more in the DeFi ecosystem and earn interest instead of selling weekly. The multisig has previously interacted with AAVE, so we might… pic.twitter.com/mw5eJa8Z5g — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) February 9, 2025 A New Approach to Ethereum’s Treasury Management The Ethereum Foundation has for some time been known for its regular practice of selling off a part of its ETH holdings to finance its development work. This recent move, however, to shift a big chunk of ETH into a multi-sig wallet suggests that the Foundation is possibly diversifying its approach—a two-pronged strategy of ETH selling and ETH securing. The multi-sig wallet, which requires multiple signatures for transactions, is a considered a safer method for securing funds, particularly large-scale holdings. By shifting ETH into this wallet, the Foundation is windowing its work around to presumably achieve a couple of major things: One, it will have access to a supposedly super safe jug of ETH from which to make payments, and two, it might be achieving a little participation in a DeFi product by paving the way to engage with some DApp. This move is particularly interesting because the Ethereum Foundation’s multi-sig wallet has interacted with decentralized lending protocols such as AAVE in the past. This could mean that the Foundation is now preparing to deploy its ETH into lending or liquidity pools, which would allow it to generate returns on the ETH it holds without selling any of it. If that’s what the Foundation is doing, then this shift could be a signal both to the DeFi space and to Ethereum users that ETH is suitable collateral for lending protocols—right in line with DeFi’s aspirations to upend traditional finance and bring about a more viable and sustainable economic ecosystem. Ethereum’s Price Movement and Key Support Level As Ethereum’s Foundation begins to participate in DeFi more actively, those who dwell in the Ethereum ecosystem closely watch the price of ETH. Lately, it’s been hanging around this key support level at $2,600. . . . If that can hold, there is talk about Ethereum potentially gaining some momentum and pushing back up to the $3,000 level, with some even daring to dream about $4,000. All eyes on $2,600! If this key support level holds, #Ethereum $ETH could gain momentum for a bounce toward $3,000 or even $4,000! pic.twitter.com/bKu1lYERiS — Ali (@ali_charts) February 9, 2025 For several weeks, the price of Ethereum has experienced some volatility, but the level of $2,600 has become vital. If that threshold can hold as a support level, it could mark the potential start of a new upside in terms of price, with buyers possibly coming back to the market, looking for further upward momentum. Performance by Ethereum is now closely watched by an army of investors and traders because that kind of price action can have an impact on the overall sentiment of the crypto market. And when sentiment shifts in the crypto space, it’s often those assets with the largest market caps like ETH that drive the action. Ethereum fundamentals are still strong, and its price movements are likely to reflect this. With its growing involvement in DeFi, Ethereum’s supply and demand fundamentals are, if anything, better than they’ve ever been. If the price of ETH can maintain above $2,600, it may signal something of a strength for ETH and a possibility of pushing much higher from here. Conversely, if it were to fail around here, you could argue that the path of least resistance for ETH is much lower, likely down, given what the overall market looks like right now. Ethereum’s ETF and Growing Institutional Interest A key development for Ethereum is the institutional interest that is increasingly coming its way. From February 3 to February 7, 2025, Ethereum’s spot ETF had a net inflow of $420 million. This tells us that the big money is seeking to get into Ethereum. When you look at the ETF market, it is an obvious entry point for institutional capital. From the ETF market, your traditional investor can get exposure to Ethereum without directly holding it and without having the space’s usual concerns attached to it. One of the most successful of these products in attracting institutional investment has been the Ethereum ETF. Last week (February 3 to February 7, Eastern Time), Bitcoin spot ETF had a net inflow of US$204 million. Ethereum spot ETF had a net inflow of US$420 million. https://t.co/YanotfbWiJ — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 10, 2025 This is a sign that inflows into Ethereum are moving it toward being a “mainstream” investment asset. Another sign might be the Ethereum price level holding above $2,600. Of course, Ethereum’s price is tethered to influences upon it and its product that are common to the cryptocurrency space—from bad press about security to good press about regulatory clarity. Conclusion The Ethereum Foundation’s choice to put a large number of ETH into its multi-sig wallet represents a key change. This move is not just about securing assets; it’s about engaging with the DeFi world and using its ETH holdings in a way that generates interest, or yield, that’s akin to what traditional finance might call “risk-free profit.” Earning yield on ETH could prove crucial for the Foundation if the price of ETH were to fall. On the other hand, if it were to rise, this might offer Cover commensurate gains as well. The Foundation’s real engagement, however, is with AAVE, one of the many DeFi protocols that Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, has lauded as sounding more like a bank.

The challenge by Osprey Funds, filed on Feb. 10 in a Connecticut Superior Court, came after a Feb. 7 ruling by judge Mark Gould that favored Grayscale. Osprey claims that the judge’s ruling was made “before the close of discovery,” and added that the ruling expanded the scope of an exemption under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). Court sides with Grayscale, but Osprey fights back Osprey first sued Grayscale and Delaware Trust Company, the Trustee of Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund), in January 2023. Osprey accused both parties of falsely advertising the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to the market. Osprey alleges that Grayscale misled investors in the competitive US Bitcoin ETF market when it said that its GBTC fund will be converted into an ETF even though clearance for this conversion was not given at the time. This move, according to Osprey, gave Grayscale a competitive edge in the US Bitcoin ETF market, allowing it to build a dominant position. However, Judge Gould decided in Grayscale’s favor and concluded that Osprey’s allegations came under the CUTPA’s exemption for securities transactions. He further stated that at the time of the complaint, Osprey and Grayscale were the only two asset managers providing trust-based Bitcoin products with ticker exposure. Osprey argued against the judge’s ruling in the Grayscale case, and said that its complaint is about unfair competition caused by false advertising, and not regarding securities transactions. The firm also maintains that its assertions should be considered through the perspective of false advertising statutes rather than securities rules, rendering the exemption ineffective. Grayscale declined to settle with Osprey in two-year-long lawsuit Osprey’s legal tussle with Grayscale has lasted more than two years now. Osprey, which offers investors the Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC), claimed Grayscale’s false marketing helped the asset manager build a dominant position in the market. Despite the lawsuit with Osprey at the time, Grayscale was able to win a landmark case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2023, resulting in the approval of GBTC’s ETF conversion in January last year. Osprey did offer to settle its claims against Grayscale for slightly less than $2 million in July last year. Grayscale declined the offer. As a result, Osprey is now requesting a reconsideration of the Connecticut judge’s decision, claiming that its legal arguments against Grayscale’s alleged misrepresentation of its GBTC conversion to investors were wrongly discarded. Following a failed acquisition of its Osprey Bitcoin Trust with Bitwise last month, the company revealed ambitions to convert its OBTC fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF. While challenging Grayscale in court, Osprey is also attempting to increase its footprint in the competitive cryptocurrency ETF market.

Yet memecoins often ride high only to crash when the hype fizzles. Now, many investors have turned their attention to practical, utility-based altcoins instead—especially Remittix (RTX) and XRP—hoping for more reliable growth. Remittix (RTX), in particular, has raised $11.5 million, sold over 455 million tokens, and is trading at $0.0567. As more people question whether DOGE can sustain its momentum, the spotlight shifts to altcoins that solve concrete problems and might deliver a solid 10x gain. Below is a closer look at why. Memecoin Mania vs. Real-World Utility Dogecoin soared when influencer tweets and viral posts lit up social media, briefly transforming small investments into fortunes. But while DOGE remains culturally iconic, its price performance often depends on meme-driven sentiment and big personalities. In leaner market times, that can lead to steep corrections. In contrast, altcoins like XRP and Remittix (RTX) promise tangible use cases. XRP focuses on faster, cheaper transfers for financial institutions; Remittix (RTX) aims to lower cross-border fees for everyday users, bridging crypto and fiat in a PayFi ecosystem. This shift matters because the crypto crowd is maturing, seeking tokens that withstand market swings through consistent demand. Memecoins can produce sky-high returns, but they’re vulnerable to speculation and the next viral fad. Meanwhile, utility-based coins often generate organic adoption from people who benefit from their solutions—leading to a more stable price floor and the potential for sustained, long-term uptrends. Remittix (RTX) and XRP: Poised for 10x Growth? So why might Remittix (RTX) and XRP outpace DOGE in the quest for a 10x gain? For starters, both tackle massive global problems. XRP has built relationships in the banking realm, aiming to optimize international wire transfers for big players. Remittix (RTX), on the other hand, zeroes in on day-to-day remittances, freelancers billing overseas, and families sending money abroad. If even a fraction of cross-border payments migrate to cheaper blockchain-based options, demand for tokens like Remittix (RTX) could skyrocket. Unlike DOGE, which thrives on viral mania, these altcoins harness real-world usage. Remittix (RTX) in particular stands out for bridging the gap between wallets and traditional bank accounts, with near-instant swaps that slash overhead. Imagine a travelling photographer in Southeast Asia who needs quick payments from clients in Europe. Instead of navigating slow wires and high fees, they could use Remittix (RTX) to instantly exchange crypto for local currency. That kind of direct utility resonates with a broader audience than meme fans, fueling sustained buying pressure that could drive a 10x price explosion. Moreover, Remittix (RTX) has momentum on its side. Having raised $11.5 million and sold over 452 million tokens, the altcoin community is growing quickly. If Remittix (RTX) locks down partnerships with local remittance agents or digital wallets, everyday usage could balloon overnight—paving the way for the robust price climb investors dream about. Meanwhile, DOGE often relies on a tweet or viral moment for each pump, lacking the consistent user adoption that cements long-lasting gains. Conclusion: Betting on Utility Over Memes Dogecoin proved how fast a memecoin can moon, but it also underscored the risk when the hype machine slows. As crypto evolves, investors increasingly chase altcoins like Remittix (RTX) and XRP, expecting them to thrive on consistent demand rather than online buzz. Remittix (RTX) in particular shows the most promise for meeting real needs, slashing transfer costs, and potentially delivering a 10x surge that outlasts meme mania. For anyone mapping a stable, lucrative crypto portfolio this year, the question isn’t whether to hold memecoins or utility tokens—but how soon to pivot toward solutions-focused projects like Remittix (RTX).

This influx includes more than $100 million just from Ethereum, and it once again highlights and underscores the growing confidence in Solana’s capabilities and the increasing appeal of Solana as a blockchain alternative. REPORT: Over $200 million has been bridged from other chains to @Solana in the last 7 days. (This includes over $100 million from Ethereum to @Solana alone) pic.twitter.com/XmKtAHVevp — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) February 10, 2025 The shift of funds into Solana also very much indicates what’s happening in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and the overall blockchain landscape. There, one sees Solana enjoying fast growth and rapidly increasing adoption. Efficient and cost-effective, Solana is an alternative to Ethereum, especially when it comes to speed of transactions and fees. If you were to use the term “DeFi,” you might also be able to use the term “Solana” at this point synonymously. Solana’s Dominance in Weekly DEX Volume A key sign that Solana is becoming more influential in the blockchain world is its performance in the decentralized exchange (DEX) sector. Recent reports indicate that Solana has surpassed Ethereum in terms of weekly DEX volume, achieving an astounding $34 billion compared to Ethereum’s $23 billion. This development points to a growing trend of users moving toward more scalable decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Solana’s network can handle vastly more transactions than Ethereum’s can—a claim that inevitably leads to the investigation of a few key areas where Solana outshines its rival. REPORT: @Solana continues to surpass Ethereum in weekly DEX volume. – Solana: $34 billion – Ethereum: $23 billion pic.twitter.com/txdP9vBXHA — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) February 10, 2025 The ascent of Solana is swift, but it is not solely a matter of speed. The blockchain offers throughput—a capability of processing thousands of transactions per second—that’s unmatched in the industry. Coupled with that are low transaction costs, which are high enough on other blockchains to create degradation in user and developer experiences. To be sure, Solana’s architecture is mishmash enough that some leading luminaries in the field, like Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, have raised doubts about its long-term viability. Solana’s capacity to eclipse Ethereum in DEX volume truly accentuates the DeFi ecosystem’s ongoing evolution. More liquidity is flowing into Solana’s decentralized exchanges, and with them, the whole ecosystem seems poised to ascend. As that happens, it plugs in all sorts of interesting developments through the Solana Development Community—both for earning developers and for traders seeking to realize the maximum profit they can without Ethereum’s high gas fees trimming that bottom line. Though Ethereum holds an overriding position in the blockchain world, Solana’s increasing share of the decentralized exchange (DEX) market indicates the project’s burgeoning popularity in the crypto space. With decentralized finance (DeFi) gaining traction, this seems bound to continue, as users seek out alternatives to Ethereum, which is notorious for its high fees and slow transaction speeds. Whale Activity and Strategic Withdrawals Along with the liquidity influx, on-chain data has disclosed the not-so-hushed activity of a smart whale, who has woken from a two-month slumber to rejoin the Solana ecosystem. This whale seems to have quite the sense for when to come and go, withdrawing 61,319 SOL (close to $12.4 million worth) from centralized liquidity on Binance and OKX. The approximate price of the SOL at the time of withdrawal? $202.53. Following a profitable track record, this withdrawal signals that the whale is on the way out. Earlier, he had executed two trades between November 2023 and December 2024. He had an impressive win rate of 100% with both trades. Those trades resulted in an estimated profit of $8.47 million, or a +38.9% gain. A smart whale resurfaced after 2 months and withdrew 61,319 $SOL ($12.4M) from #Binance and #OKX at ~$202.53 today! Previously, this whale had completed 2 $SOL trades between Dec 27, 2023, and Nov 30, 2024, earning an estimated total profit of $8.47M (+38.9%) with a 100% win… pic.twitter.com/2XNJok4bvA — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) February 10, 2025 The transfer of such a large sum of funds from exchanges like Binance and OKX raises crucial inquiries about the much broader market sentiment and where the whale views potential value in Solana’s growth trajectory. By pulling out such a significant amount of $SOL, the whale is presumably sending a message of confidence not only in the network’s continued strength but also in its price appreciation over the medium to long term. Moreover, the intelligent whale’s market actions amply show that there is increased institutional interest in Solana. Large, powerful market participants are beginning to see real-world value and long-term potential in this blockchain. As DeFi projects built on Solana drain liquidity from Ethereum and other chains, it is becoming hard to argue that Solana is anything other than a major player in the crypto ecosystem. Looking Ahead: Solana’s Growing Ecosystem Bridging more than $200 million from other chains and the strong showing in DEX volume, Solana’s growth seems unstoppable. Developers, traders, and investors alike have flocked to the Solana blockchain, which offers low fees, lightning-fast transaction speeds, and the ability to process a lot of transactions without getting bogged down. Solana’s “not-Ethereum” DEXs checked in with a combined volume higher than that of Uniswap and SushiSwap, two major decentralized exchanges on—guess where?—the Ethereum blockchain. Recent activity from whales further amplifies the increasing confidence in Solana’s future, with big players and institutions continuing to accumulate SOL. Meanwhile, with Solana’s ecosystem receiving more liquidity and other smart capital, it’s safe to say that Solana has a good shot at continuing its upward momentum over the next several months. Undeniably, Solana has some serious momentum, and there is no doubt that blockchains are in a heated competitive space. Although Ethereum’s transition to a more scalable, 2.0 version could change some of the dynamics of the market, for the moment, Solana is demonstrating that it is quite capable of taking Ethereum on, in particular, in the DeFi and DEX sectors. As Solana cements its status as a principal player in the domain of blockchain innovation, the immediate future will reveal whether it can sustain the furious momentum it has amassed since the onset of 2021 and, more recently, the past few months. Up until now, Solana has not only achieved great things in a short period of time, but it has also managed to outpace Ethereum on some key performance indicators—DEX volume is one of them; liquidity is another. In the weeks and months to come, we’ll see if those trends continue. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Speaking to US media outlet CNBC, Scaramucci stated that Solana would be more successful than Etheruem. He said that his company SkyBridge has some ETH but the majority of his investments are in SOL and that SOL will be more successful in the long run. “This doesn't mean we own any Ethereum. We hold a small amount of ETH. But we hold more Solana than ETH. We do not have a negative opinion about ETH. My partner in law school, my classmate John Sullos, is something of an ETH maximalist. That's why we have it in our portfolio.” Scaramucci, along with SkyBridge Chief Operating Officer Brett Messing, stated that there were two main reasons why they chose Solana over Ethereum. Stating the first reason as Solana's faster and lower gas fees compared to ETH, Scaramucci also indicated that Solana would be more successful in the field of tokenization as the second reason. Is the $200K Bitcoin Prediction Still Valid? Scaramucci lastly expressed his optimistic stance towards Bitcoin, saying that 2025 will be an extraordinarily good year for BTC. Scaramucci stated that Bitcoin's price is approaching the $100,000 mark, which is a positive signal for the BTC price in the short term. The famous CEO added that at this point, the prediction that Bitcoin could rise to $200,000 in 2025 is still valid. *This is not investment advice.

40187812,https://nulltx.com/?p=144482,1739266830,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Scam Alert: Fraudulent Links and Fake Verification Pages Target Crypto Users,https://nulltx.com/scam-alert-fraudulent-links-and-fake-verification-pages-target-crypto-users/,"An investigation by Scam Sniffer has recently uncovered a cryptocurrency user scam that is way too sophisticated for its own good. It targets the basic details of well-known tokens and uses them to lure in victims with the promise of fake trading opportunities manipulated by the scammers. One of the well-known tokens affected in this way is the $CAR token. The Cloudflare fake pages asking users to validate themselves via captcha before they can access the site are a nice touch for making the whole ruse seem more legit. The newest find has triggered warning signals in the crypto society and is underscoring how scammers are now using a more subtle and effective approach to defraud their victims. The links are set up to steal personal information; or, if a user’s computer is not already compromised, install software that will defeat whatever defenses the user has. The scammers are not only using this new method as a direct attack on individual users; they are also directly harming the platforms and services we all use. Scam Mechanics: Deceptive Links and Fake Verification Pages As reported by Scam Sniffer, the misleading links usually appear believable to users, which makes them prime targets for unwitting victims. Scammers are hard at work embedding links to fake sites that resemble well-known platforms, such as the Kick platform. They often push these links through supposedly safe channels, like Linktree, which let the bad guys mask the true destination of the link. When a user clicks on one of these fraudulent links, they are directed to a page that looks exactly like Cloudflare’s captcha verification system. These pages are intended to mislead users into thinking that they are completing a normal security procedure. In reality, the system is executing malicious code on the user’s device. Unlike most ciphers, which work by obfuscating the contents of a message so that only the intended recipient can read it, the “cipher” used here is perfectly legible. The only secret it conceals is the fact that it was written with malicious intent. These tactics are being used in conjunction with social engineering techniques to target crypto enthusiasts. By using the verifiably familiar, these scammers are gaining access to user systems without raising any suspicion. Telegram Groups Used to Distribute Malicious Links The probe uncovered that the harmful links were being disseminated by the well-known Telegram chat group caronsolanas, which revolves around conversations related to Solana projects. Within this popular group, scammers were using sophisticated, fake Safeguard phishing bots that looked and acted like the real deal and were doing the same job as real phishing bots do: instructing users to click on malicious links that lead to real scams. The Scammer Safeguard bot actually gave out pretty good advice, as far as that went. But then it would add this little doozy at the end: “as a final precaution, be sure NOT to click on any unsolicited links, especially if they appear to be coming from your friends!” For years, Telegram has been a popular meeting place for not just friends and families to come together but for cryptocurrency scammers, too. While the platform has long been a home for crypto-related scams, what makes this scam particularly insidious is the way the attackers disguised their links, making them appear as though they were sent by BotFather—a Telegram service that helps users create bots—and are legitimate resources within trusted crypto communities. On Telegram, the vetting of content almost totally relies on community members. That makes the presence of phishing bots and bad guys using security tools to find and send borderline fraudulent, but seemingly legitimate, links an appalling development for Telegram and its (not-so-)cryptic communities. In an unexpected turn of events, the official Telegram link for Coingecko was found to redirect users to the fraudulent caronsolanas group. This new development raised worries for many, as it was the first time a major, well-established platform was found working in cahoots with the fraudulent group. Fortunately, the fraudulent link was quickly detected and removed, and a fresh link for Coingecko’s Telegram channel was posted. Despite this, the major platforms the group has now infiltrated adds a significant new layer of danger to the caronsolanas group’s scheme. How Users Can Protect Themselves The con reveals how essential it is to be vigilant and cautious when dealing with links or websites one is not familiar with, even when they seem to be connected to reputable brands. Individuals must authenticate every link due to the kinds of scenarios that are part of everyday life, like filling out a form or granting access to one’s device. If any link leads to a website that is not the real deal, users might as well be filling out a form directly for the scammers who set up the site to access all their relevant personal information. To ensure maximum safety, users need to steer clear of using third-party platforms that make questionable promises about verifying transactions or securing assets. If a platform makes an offer that seems far too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Always perform due diligence on any platform you’re considering, which should include reading a lot of reviews (both positive and negative), as well as checking the platforms business with several official sources. ALERT: Scammer modifying popular token information like $CAR and embedding fake Kick platform site through Linktree links. They're using fake Cloudflare captcha verification pages to trick users into executing malicious code. https://t.co/kLSonrA8fF pic.twitter.com/VC0NKQgLiL — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) February 10, 2025 In addition, users ought to exercise caution with Telegram bots—especially those that ask or entice users to click on links that lead off the platform. A legitimate bot will not ask for personal or sensitive info and will have a clear and reasonable motive for directing you to an external site. It is also essential to keep security software current and employ hardware wallets when storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency. Trusting only software wallets or exchanges makes one susceptible to the kinds of hacks suffered in this case. A Growing Trend of Sophisticated Scams This scam is part of a larger trend involving more and more sophisticated phishing attacks in the crypto space. Attackers are using this and other similar phishing scams to mimic legitimate platforms and draw unsuspecting users into their trap. And given the crypto world’s low regulatory environment, it’s pretty easy for a scammer to set up shop. The cryptocurrency market is bringing in a slew of new investors, many of whom are too inexperienced to recognize a phishing scam when they see one. And this is making crypto phishing attacks by far the most profitable for the attackers. The crypto community is rapidly expanding, and that makes the watch against threats of this kind all the more essential for platforms, developers, and users. While Coingecko’s official channel on Telegram has had the fake link removed, the fact that the link got onto Coingecko’s channel at all is a pretty potent reminder that even platforms with widespread trust in the community can be hoodwinked by bad actors. It brings to the fore what’s all too often an afterthought: the need for every crypto user to remain aware of the kinds of threats that are out there and to be ready to counter them. To sum up, the scam that involves counterfeit Kick platform websites, harmful captcha pages, and bogus Telegram groups serves as a timely warning for people who use cryptocurrency. With these scammers busy refining their cons, it is all the more important for crypto users to be on alert and to work with a virtual currency world that pays them the respect of cons-free sophistication.

The primary reason for the sharp increase in value is that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken major steps toward approving an ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) for Litecoin. With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at what’s happening with the SEC and the price of Litecoin. BIGGEST RISE! The biggest rise in price this week comes from $LTC with a price rise of over 20%! This rise from @Litecoin comes from the #ETF approval from the #SEC which has investors coming into $LTC and causing the price rise! Source: @CoinMarketCap pic.twitter.com/cd8NyQOHyx — Sjuul | AltCryptoGems (@AltCryptoGems) February 10, 2025 The ETF Approval Spark: Institutional Confidence in LTC Litecoin’s price surge seems mainly tied to ETF anticipation, reflecting the potential approval of an ETF for Litecoin. At the very least, an SEC nod would mark a big step for the currency, offering a way for regulated, institutional investors to buy in. To ETF or not to ETF—that’s the question. And while nothing is certain in the world of cryptocurrency, events of the past few weeks make the case for Litecoin particularly compelling. Two significant cryptocurrency asset managers, Grayscale and CoinShares, have taken up the cause of pushing for an LTC ETF to be approved. Both have long histories with and deep knowledge of the crypto space, and both lend great credibility to whatever cause they take on. Yet, these two cannot or do not push the Litecoin ETF approval over the finish line, and the decision still remains in limbo. At the same time, the potential approval has already caused a stir in the market, with a seemingly endless stream of new investors coming to Litecoin in search of a bullish future. This near-term investor interest is reflected directly in the asset’s price, which has now crossed back above $90, but the real story will be whether this price rise can keep chugging along. Binance Expanding Support: A Sign of Confidence One of the key factors that is pushing Litecoin’s price up is the growing support for LTC on top-tier crypto exchanges, most notably Binance. Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, has been aggressively integrating Litecoin into its platform and is establishing a more robust ecosystem around it. The exchange’s current and planned offerings of Litecoin-related products and services are providing the cryptocurrency with a solid base of liquidity, one of the foremost requisites for any digital asset that wants to maintain a stable price and attract further investment. Binance’s support is clearly a positive sign for Litecoin, but it is evident that liquidity is still a major issue. If Litecoin is going to keep climbing, we need more exchanges and institutional players to step up and provide the sort of deep liquidity that allows for smoother price movements and a sustainable market that doesn’t collapse or surge uncontrollably. The approval of a Litecoin ETF could help a lot in this regard, but only if both retail and institutional investors keep across-the-board participating in the Litecoin market. Derivatives Markets Signal Strong Short-Term Momentum If we take an even closer look at Litecoin’s derivatives markets, we see even more promising signs for the cryptocurrency’s short-term future. Open interest in Litecoin futures has surged by 11%, while trading volume has skyrocketed by 169%. Together, these metrics suggest increasingly strong bullish sentiment in the derivatives market, which is often seen as a leading indicator of price action in the spot market. LTC ETF TALK IGNITES RALLY, BUT CAN IT SUSTAIN GAINS? Litecoin jumps 7%, fueled by growing ETF speculation and a resilient technical setup; analyst Carl Moon sees an ascending triangle breakout targeting $128—with support solid at $96. Grayscale and CoinShares pushing for LTC… pic.twitter.com/ueE5NFsQo0 — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) February 10, 2025 The increase in open interest and volume of trades shows that more traders are wagering on Litecoin’s continued ascent, which is causing the price to rise. These derivatives market bullish signals certainly aren’t dissuading traders from adding to their long positions. And with traders increasingly zeroing in on what they perceive as an ETF-driven rally, it doesn’t seem like any buying activity related to that notion will be slowing down anytime soon. Still, and this is important to point out, when the ETF news hits and these waves of new money come into the market, that’s when we see these often very sharp price increases. But what history shows us is, in the absence of follow-through buying and just in the presence of profit-taking, those waves of new money can crest pretty quickly. And so the question becomes: Is Litecoin going to be able to keep on keeping on with this rally even if ETF approval gets pushed into the future, or even if the buzz dies down? The Road Ahead for Litecoin: Sustained Growth or a Temporary Rally? Even with the strong short-term momentum, many wonder if Litecoin can sustain its growth for the long haul. ETF approval could serve as a major catalyst for the cryptocurrency’s future. But in order for Litecoin to achieve a level of success that isn’t just temporary, the conversation around it must stop being one of short-term speculation and start being one of long-term fundamental support. An area of focus will be the ongoing evolution of Litecoin’s network and its use cases. As the cryptocurrency market grows up, projects like Litecoin need to stay relevant and keep investor interest by bringing forth developments that show the maturity of the cryptocurrency. This might mean working on the scalability of the network, continuing to push adoption among a wider base of merchants, and doing that same pushing with a wider base of users. Moreover, investors ought to be wary of possible regulatory obstacles, since the green light for an ETF does not ensure that all will go well from that point on. The world of cryptocurrency is still waiting for regulators to establish a clear set of rules, and any sudden, surprise changes could have consequences for the value of Litecoin and all its virtual coin siblings in the time to come. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Litecoin? To sum up, Litecoin’s substantial 20% increase in price this week has mostly come from the elevating enthusiasm over what seems to be the nearing approval of an ETF by the SEC. The price surge and the interest from some deep-pocket players are definitely nice to see. The question now, though, is whether Litecoin can sustain this momentum and develop it into something more than just a temporary spike that ends when the ETF does not get approved after all. Increasing derivatives market activity and burgeoning support from exchanges such as Binance are bullish developments for Litecoin. Nevertheless, liquidity is still a concern. And let’s not kid ourselves: A rally driven in any part by an ETF can sometimes be a rally in search of substance. The next few weeks will tell whether Litecoin can make its way through this quite hazardous volatility and onto something resembling an upward path again, or whether it will be Trump-stocked vaulting until it returns to being quite the uncertain market.

Ethereum’s ( ETH ) price has dropped to levels that usually signal it might be ready for a rebound, blockchain firm Matrixport says. In a Feb. 11 research note , the analysts pointed out that the Relative Strength Index is now showing signs of oversold conditions, which often point to a potential price recovery. Despite the positive technical signals, the mood around Ethereum remains cautious, to say the least. Short interest in Ethereum has surged by 500% since November 2024. On top of that, just in the past week, it’s jumped another 40%. The increase in short positions seems to show that investors are feeling bearish and betting against ETH. However, this could also set the stage for a short squeeze, which might push the price higher.

While it’s uncertain if Ethereum will recover soon, Matrixport suggests that several testnet deployments of Pectra in March could act as potential “bullish catalysts.” As of press time, Ethereum is trading at $2,715, with its market capitalization staying at $327.5 billion.

For the past week, however, smart money has been doing something else—actively accumulating a range of tokens indicative of a shift in sentiment among certain layers of the investing class. Of the smartly accumulated tokens, $TAO, $INST, $MKR, $SOL, $BITCOIN, and $SNX have emerged as significant players, with $TAO gamely taking pole position. $TAO Leads the Pack: A Strong Rebound $TAO (Theta Token) has regained the number one spot on the smart money accumulation board over the last week. It has a net volume of $3.46 million. Accumulating investors are sending what feels like a welcome resurgence signal back to the token. This accumulation comes with renewed investor enthusiasm around Theta’s (de)centralized video streaming and content delivery network solutions. Both retail and institutional investors are paying attention to $TAO’s price movement, and the recent upswing in smart money accumulation strongly indicates that these investors are preparing for a much bigger recovery. Theta’s renewed interest underscores the demand for blockchain-based remedies in the media, entertainment, and content creation industries—where decentralized alternatives are quickly gaining traction. Which tokens have been accumulated the most by Smart Money in the past 7 days? Over the past 7 days, $TAO reclaimed the #1 spot with net volume of $3.46M. $INST , $MKR , $SOL and $BITCOIN have reappeared in the Accumulation by Smart Money board. Additionally, $SNX has also made… pic.twitter.com/Xobr6xH39o — iCrypto | Sentiment & On-chain Analysis (@iCryptoAI) February 10, 2025 Other Top Tokens Accumulated by Smart Money Along with $TAO, a number of other tokens have made a reappearance on the smart money accumulation list, notably $INST (Instadapp), $MKR (Maker), $SOL (Solana), and $BITCOIN. Once again, these cryptocurrencies have caught the attention of large investors, as they attempt to further diversify their portfolios and take advantage of what they see as viable growth opportunities. Built on Ethereum, a DeFi platform, attracts serious smart money. Its value proposition is the streamlining and optimization of various DeFi protocols. Its customer base is those who are using DeFi protocols and want a better way to manage and automate their assets. And in terms of what it actually does, you know, driving those key metrics … As I’ve said, there’s something quite substantial happening here. So, should we then consider Instadapp a potential leader of the next wave of DeFi innovation? At the same time, the MakerDAO protocol’s native token, MKR, has seen a significant increase in how much smart money is accumulating. MakerDAO is unquestionably one of the “poster children” for decentralized finance (DeFi), thanks in large part to DAI, its decentralized stablecoin. In an environment where DeFi continues to expand, the pool of individuals looking to accumulate MKR token is seemingly increasing. And with that, so seemingly is demand for DAI and decentralized financial services in general. Recently, the smart money has once again appeared in Solana ($SOL), which has gained a lot of market share due to its scalability and high throughput. Solana has been rocking and rolling, and it has been adopted by developers and projects in so many different sectors that it makes perfect sense for it to be appealing to institutional investors. And if you look at the price action, if you look at how much it has gone up since June, it has definitely become even more appealing. Finally, the trailblazer of the cryptocurrency revolution, Bitcoin ($BTC), remains a premier pick for sharp money. And although the price of Bitcoin has been in a pesky kind of flux lately, its age-old value proposition persists as the world’s most popular and time-tested crypto. And if anything, the Bitcoin “story” is stronger than ever, with a kind of irony that narratives often package: in trying to discredit Bitcoin and similar assets, major worldwide central banks only serve to make people see their worth. ai16z: The Strongest Performer in the Last 24 Hours In the last day, one outstanding mention is ai16z, which has skyrocketed to an eye-watering $466 million in value. This most recent pop is largely being attributed to Bitcoin coming back to life and bouncing back above the $97,000 mark, which is now fueling a rally in the broader market. As the market has been going up lately, it’s quite clear that ai16z, along with some of these other top tokens, has been riding that wave of positive sentiment. ai16z was the strongest in the last 24 hours! Its price surged to $466M as $BTC rebounded above $97K. Additionally, ai16z ranked among the top tokens by Smart Money inflows. Imagine what will happen to the price of #ai16z and other AI agents when BTC reaches $120K? pic.twitter.com/0EawT0MBH6 — ElonMoney (@0xelonmoney) February 10, 2025 Over the last 24 hours, ai16z has ranked among the top tokens for smart money inflows. This shows that the token is now appealing to more than just retail investors. It is also appealing to “sophisticated” ones—those who likely understand the crypto landscape much better than the average investor. Because of this recent uptick in interest and the funding that has been coming into the project, the ai16z token’s rapid rise is becoming more evident. ai16z’s robust performance underscores the cryptocurrency market’s evolution. New tokens and projects aren’t just keeping the market alive; they’re attracting a class of investors smarter than the average bear. Institutional investors are now sniffing around, and their presence can only amplify the demand for the kinds of innovative, high-growth tokens that would keep any market moving. The Changing Landscape of Smart Money in Crypto Accumulative activity with tokens like $TAO, $INST, $MKR, $SOL, and $BITCOIN is transforming the smart-money landscape in the cryptocurrency market. Investors are not just putting all their eggs in the same basket. Instead, they are diversifying their portfolios, moving their capital into various sectors of the blockchain space, including decentralized finance (DeFi), high-performance blockchain ecosystems, and decentralized content delivery. The accumulation of smart money is also signaling a growing confidence in the future of cryptocurrencies. Traditional finance continues to explore ways to integrate blockchain technology into mainstream financial systems. Several positive catalysts are developing: – The approval of cryptocurrency ETFs. – Lots of institutional investments. – A growing adoption of (mostly) decentralized technologies. These are the main ways in which the “cryptoverse” is being integrated into the systems, practices, and governance of traditional finance. Nonetheless, caution is advisable for investors because the cryptocurrency market’s volatility presents real risks. The smart money’s movement gives signals that can be useful—but by no means should they be the only guide to decision-making. Having a comprehensive research process and a diversified investment approach can keep you from being too vulnerable to the wild swings that this still-maturing asset class can deliver. Conclusion: A Strong Week for Smart Money To sum up, the past week has been an exhilarating one for investors in cryptocurrencies, with intelligent capital actively amassing a variety of tokens. $TAO, $INST, $MKR, $SOL, $BITCOIN, and ai16z have all been the lucky recipients of increased smart money inflows. These are under-the-radar projects that have nonetheless garnered an impressive and diverse range of institutional and individual investors. What might this mean for the nascent cryptocurrency market? Well, if the past is any indicator, smart money could be betting on the next Bitcoin. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It jumped to just over it earlier today but doesn’t seem capable of retaining that level as of now. Its market capitalization has risen to $1.945 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has taken a big hit. The metric is down below 58% after peaking at 58.7% yesterday. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView ADA on the Run The positive news regarding potential approvals of ETFs has impacted numerous altcoins lately. Litecoin continues to gain traction after yesterday’s surge and is now up by another 10%, which has pushed it to almost $130. Today’s star, though, is Cardano, as its native token has soared by 15% and sits at $0.8 after Grayscale’s ETF filing. SUI has also surged by double-digits since yesterday and now trades above $3.5. The other notable gainers from the larger-cap alts include BNB, DOGE, AVAX, and XLM. PEPE has added 9% of value and is above $0.00001. The total crypto market cap has increased by $60 billion overnight and is north of $3.360 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Speculation swirls around the market, with excitement building over where coins like XRP, BNB, and Dogecoin could be heading. These digital currencies are seen as having significant growth prospects, leaving many to wonder if they will achieve new milestones. Newcomers are also entering the arena. Among them is Agent A.I., a project with lofty ambitions and a playful edge. As the market buzzes with predictions and promising opportunities, anticipation grows for what lies ahead. The crypto world seems poised for unexpected twists and major movements. Agent A.I. Combines AI Features with the Allure of Meme Coins Agent A.I. is an emerging cryptocurrency project that brings together AI-powered features and the viral charm of meme coins, two leading trends in today's market. Interest in AI-centered crypto ventures has soared, with blockchain-based AI solutions capturing more investor attention. However, not all AI tokens offer substantial value; many merely leverage ""AI"" as a marketing gimmick. Agent A.I.'s Role in the Crypto-AI Explosion Agent A.I. differentiates itself by merging AI advancements with blockchain practicality, while also highlighting projects that don't deliver on their AI promises. This strategy helps Agent A.I. distinguish itself in an ever-busier market. Agent A.I. is crafted to be a smart and adaptable platform. The creators of the project claim that its AI framework can: Process large datasets in milliseconds to enhance decision-making Enhance processing capacity to rival leading cloud services Constantly improve its capabilities, learning and evolving over time. The team behind Agent A.I. is dedicated to advancing both AI functions and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology keeps pace with the evolving crypto market. A Strategic Presale for Early Backers Agent A.I. has opted for a presale model driven by the community, allowing early supporters to access the project at the most favorable prices. This presale is structured in multiple stages, offering significant discounts to early participants: In the first stage, the $AGNT token is priced at $0.003333333. It will progress through 28 stages, ultimately reaching $0.151515152 by the presale's conclusion. Initial buyers enjoy a substantial 98% discount. This pricing model means that the sooner you invest, the larger the discount you'll receive. Secure Your $AGNT Before the Next Price Increase Why $AGNT Stands Out as an Investment Agent A.I. merges two of the most enticing aspects of today's crypto market: AI-powered innovation and meme coin popularity. By focusing on genuine AI capabilities and community-led growth, the project distinguishes itself among new crypto initiatives. With a limited supply during the presale and escalating price points, $AGNT provides early investors with the possibility of substantial returns as adoption increases. The Agent A.I. Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! XRP by 2025: Overcoming Hurdles and Aiming High XRP, the currency of the Ripple network, is designed for fast and affordable international money transfers. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, it facilitates quick transactions for both fiat and digital currencies. Capable of handling up to 1,500 transactions per second, XRP seeks to transform financial services by making transactions not only rapid but also secure. XRP has a history of dramatic price changes. From being valued at less than a cent in 2013 to hitting a peak of $3.84 in January 2018, its path illustrates both volatility and promise. Despite challenges, XRP has consistently worked to improve the speed and safety of money transfers under Ripple's direction. The legal conflict with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which concluded in August 2024, significantly affected XRP. Ripple Labs was fined $125 million, much less than expected. This outcome led to a 26% rise in XRP's price, indicating renewed investor trust. Ripple's CEO called the decision a major win for both the company and the broader cryptocurrency industry. Looking forward, experts have offered a range of predictions for XRP's future. Some analysts foresee XRP reaching up to $3.99 by 2025, driven by potential partnerships with additional banks and financial entities. By 2030, optimistic forecasts suggest XRP could trade at an average of $42.34. These predictions are based on factors like market sentiment, adoption rates, and Ripple's ongoing innovations. In the current market cycle, XRP presents both opportunities and challenges. Its strong technology and established alliances position it well for future expansion. However, regulatory changes and market dynamics continue to impact its path. Investors interested in XRP should stay updated on industry trends and consider the potential risks and rewards when evaluating its appeal in the evolving crypto environment. Binance Coin (BNB): A Crypto with Enormous Growth Potential Binance Coin (BNB) is the backbone of the Binance exchange, facilitating cryptocurrency exchanges. Initially launched on Ethereum in 2017, it now runs on Binance Smart Chain, enabling users to trade tokens, benefit from reduced fees, and make payments. BNB is integral to numerous activities within the Binance network. Beyond trading, BNB is crucial to Binance's expansion. The company engages in quarterly BNB token burns, decreasing supply and potentially increasing value. This process uses profits to repurchase BNB, which can drive the price upward over time. In December 2024, BNB reached a peak of $793.35. It's only 10% below this high, demonstrating resilience. Year after year, BNB has shown strong performance despite market fluctuations. Its consistent performance underscores its strength in the unpredictable crypto market. Experts predict BNB might exceed $1,000 in 2025, with Changelly estimating a high of $1,020. By 2026, projections go up to $1,600. Looking ahead to 2030, predictions range from $1,257 to as much as $15,086. By 2050, forecasts vary widely, from $7,500 to over $146,000. With solid growth and a pivotal role in Binance's ecosystem, BNB appears to be a promising asset right now. Its utility and positive outlook suggest a potential for significant gains. Investors view BNB as a robust player in the crypto domain. Dogecoin: The Meme Coin Making Waves by 2025 Dogecoin started as a playful joke in 2013, created by software developers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer. Featuring the friendly Shiba Inu dog from a well-known meme, it was meant to be a fun alternative to more serious cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. What began as a parody swiftly turned into a vibrant community. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has an infinite supply, allowing for endless coin creation. It employs technology that enables quicker transaction times, making it ideal for small online transactions and tipping content creators. Its simplicity and approachable image have helped it stand out in the crowded crypto market. Throughout the years, Dogecoin has seen dramatic price fluctuations. In May 2021, it skyrocketed to an all-time high due to social media buzz and celebrity endorsements. Since then, it has experienced highs and lows but remains a significant player in the crypto world. By 2025, it continues to capture attention with its unpredictable nature. Looking to the horizon, predictions vary. Some foresee Dogecoin reaching new peaks by 2030, driven by its loyal community and increasing acceptance. Others remain cautious, suggesting that its unlimited supply and competition from other coins might limit its growth. Long-term predictions range from moderate increases to more ambitious highs. Dogecoin's journey demonstrates that a coin born from a meme can become a significant part of the financial landscape. Its appeal lies in its community spirit and accessibility. Whether it’s a good investment now depends on individual perspectives, but there's no denying that Dogecoin has made a lasting impact. Conclusion Although XRP, BNB, and DOGE have made notable progress, they might face constraints in the near future. Market factors could limit their potential for substantial price movements in the short term. Agent A.I. presents a fresh opportunity for investors seeking significant returns. Inspired by the success of PEPE, it aims to achieve remarkable gains with strong community support. With an appealing presale strategy offering early entry at a greatly reduced rate, a capped supply to prevent inflation, and plans for post-launch growth through partnerships and AI tools, Agent A.I. positions itself as a promising opportunity in the crypto landscape.

The most prolific scams involved social engineering, which is a technique that relies on impersonation and manipulation to gain access to someone's personal data - often in this case celebrities or well-known tech figures. One of these cases saw scammers compromise French footballer Kylian Mbappe's X account. Once they gained access, a link was posted to a nefarious memecoin which rose to a $460 million market cap before being rug pulled. There was also a case involving music artist Wiz Khalifa that targeted his 35.7 million followers on X. A fake WIZ token was promoted, rising to a $3.4 million market cap before plummeting to zero. ""These scams aren’t just opportunistic—they’re highly coordinated operations that exploit trust at scale,"" Robert Whitaker, director of law enforcement affairs at Merkle Science told CoinDesk. ""Hackers are no longer just breaching wallets or exchanges; they’re hijacking the credibility of celebrities and industry leaders to manipulate markets in real time. Our research shows that meme coin rug pulls alone accounted for hundreds of millions in losses this year, with platforms like X being the primary battleground."" Merkle Science's report reveals that 75% of all attacks took place on X and 19% on YouTube. 44% of the reported social engineering scams resulted in rug pulls, while phishing attacks was also attributed to 44% of all scams.",Finance|Hacks|Scams|Rug Pull|Memecoin,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 10:00:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Cardano and XRP regain momentum, BitLemons emerges as the next potential breakout token in GambleFi. Table of Contents BitLemons next to surge Cardano maintains steady growth XRP demonstrates market leadership Conclusion As established cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) and XRP demonstrate renewed strength, BitLemons (BLEM) looks to transform the GambleFi sector with its unique platform. Having secured $1 million in seed funding and comprehensive security audits, this project could change the $450 billion gaming industry. BitLemons next to surge While others focus on infrastructure development, BitLemons is already generating substantial revenue through its operational gaming platform. What sets it apart is its presale structure, where GGR accumulates across all 12 stages, ensuring significant funds are ready at launch for strategic buybacks and holder rewards. This methodical distribution approach helps stabilize token pricing while maximizing early investor returns. With dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, plus substantial institutional backing, BitLemons allocates 30% of GGR between strategic buybacks and community rewards, creating an ecosystem where both players and investors thrive from day one.

The platform’s research-driven approach and focus on academic rigor continue to attract developers seeking robust blockchain infrastructure. However, despite its methodical development process, questions remain about adoption rates and competitive advantages in the increasingly crowded smart contract landscape. XRP demonstrates market leadership XRP exhibits strong momentum at $2.50, with a 4.83% daily increase, an impressive market cap of $144.64 billion, and robust trading volume of $4.35 billion. The token’s focus on cross-border payments and institutional adoption continues to drive its value proposition. While XRP’s integration with traditional finance shows promise, the platform’s centralized nature presents challenges. Conclusion As established cryptocurrencies aim for a comeback, BitLemons stands out with its revenue model and utility. The platform looks to deliver tangible value through its operational gaming platform, with GGR accumulating throughout the presale to ensure a strong launch.

NEAR Protocol is currently fluctuating between $2.68 and $3.74, with a resistance level at $4.30. The closest support is at $2.18. Over the last month, NEAR has fallen by more than 36%. The RSI reads 51.49, suggesting a neutral stance. The MACD level indicates slight bearish momentum. However, with the altcoin season here, a rally could push NEAR towards the $4.30 resistance, potentially gaining about 18% from the current top range. Breaking above $4.30 might set sights on $5.36. Although past trends suggest caution, there remains a growth opportunity if the overall crypto sentiment becomes positive. Onyxcoin Targets a Breakout Despite Recent Decline Onyxcoin (XCN) presents a volatile yet promising pattern. Currently trading between $0.0173 and $0.0331, it has dropped nearly 11% over the past week. However, its impressive surge of over 762% in one month and a remarkable 1672% rise over six months highlight strong upward momentum. The RSI at 36.77 indicates it might be oversold, suggesting a potential rise. If bulls gain traction, XCN could reach the nearest resistance of $0.0413, around a 24% increase from its higher current range. The next target could be $0.0571. While the MACD shows a slight bearish trend, overall sentiment leans bullish for the upcoming altcoin season. Uniswap (UNI) Gaining Ground: Are Resistance Levels on the Horizon? Uniswap (UNI) is showing potential despite recent declines. The price is currently just above $9, slightly surpassing the 100-day simple moving average, indicating possible stability. The RSI above 60 suggests moderate buying pressure. The coin has been on an uptrend, climbing over 48% in the last six months, hinting at a recovery phase. However, the one-month price is down by more than 30%, indicating volatility. If UNI surpasses the $12 resistance, it could gain momentum, potentially reaching the second resistance above $15, suggesting about a 50% growth from its current range. However, support at $5.52 could serve as a fallback in case of declines. XRP Poised for a Breakout as Resistance Levels Test the Bulls XRP is showing potential despite recent fluctuations. Its current price ranges between $1.86 and $2.86, with the nearest resistance at $3.32, offering a potential 16% gain from the top end of the range. XRP has surged over 321% in the past six months, underscoring its bullish path. A rally towards the next resistance at $4.32 could further boost returns. Support is firm at $1.33, providing a safety net. The Relative Strength Index at 52.46 indicates balanced conditions, hinting at possible upward movement. With past performance and technical indicators aligning, XRP is in an exciting position for investors anticipating a potential breakout. Ethena (ENA) Set for Growth Amid Current Price Swings Ethena is currently trading between $0.39 and $0.63, encountering resistance at $0.79. The nearest support stands at $0.30. After a significant dip of over 46% this month, the price is stabilizing. With an RSI of 52.14 and a stochastic of 60.78, Ethena shows potential for upward movement. The MACD indicates a slight bearish trend, but the six-month growth of 45% keeps the outlook optimistic. If momentum picks up, Ethena could aim for the second resistance at $1, indicating a potential increase of over 58% from the current high range. Despite recent setbacks, optimism surrounds Ethena's long-term prospects in the ever-evolving crypto market. Conclusion While NEAR, XCN, UNI, and XRP might have less immediate potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero striving for widespread financial freedom. With a 700% ROI during presale and triple utility features, swift action could transform modest investments. Join the fight against crypto villains by getting $CATZILLA tokens.

XION revealed that Uber is set to use the collaboration for user acquisition on a global scale by using its EarnOS, a digital advertising and payments platform launched in its beta phase last year. With this partnership, Uber has now become the latest global brand to utilize XION’S EarnOS for driving global user acquisition after leading brands in various sectors such as, Baskin Robbins, Sunglass Hur, the North Face integrated it during its beta launch last year. Ditching traditonal marketing strategies, Uber is now set to leverage XION’s EarnOS to acquire users in a performance-driven way. Though in the recent quarters, Uber’s user base has demonstrated consistent growth, the rate of increase has experienced certain fluctuations. In Q1 2024, it reported 149 million Monthly Active Platform Consumers (MAPs) registering 15% YoY increase and for its most recent Q4 of 2024, it reported 171 million MAPCS with 14% YoY increase. How will XION help Uber in user acquisition After this partnership, the XION powered app, Earn OS, has been made live on mainnet with Uber. Uber will leverage XION’s chain abstraction technology that powers EarnOS to accelerate user acquisition, engagement, and rewards in the digital advertising space. EarnOS will help Uber in several ways such as: It uses immersive augmented reality experiences to engage users globally by targeted advertising. It also enables advertisers to use global USDC micro payment to reach wider audiences. Without exposing any personal data, It will allow Uber to target high-intent users by allowing new riders to connect their competitors – Lyft, Bolt, or Grab accounts – to verify and access their ride history. Allowing long-term engagement with riders, EarnOS will allow users to connect their uber accounts for future reward-based campaigns – driven active user acquisitions. Without the need for Uber to access user’s bank accounts, it can instantly reward users anywhere in the world using XION’s advanced cryptographic infrastructure for cross-border payments.

Asset manager Osprey Funds is asking a Connecticut state judge to reconsider his decision that favored Grayscale in an ongoing lawsuit over unfair trading practices. This case revolves around claims that Grayscale misled investors about converting its Bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Why is the Osprey Upset? Osprey believes the judge made his ruling too soon, even before all the evidence was fully reviewed. They argue that this premature decision also wrongly expanded legal protections for Grayscale. Osprey first sued Grayscale and Delaware Trust Company in January 2023, accusing them of falsely advertising that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) would definitely become an ETF, which gave Grayscale an unfair advantage in the market. Recently, Judge Mark Gould ruled in Grayscale’s favor, saying Osprey’s claims were about buying and selling securities, which are exempt from the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). The judge also pointed out that at the time of the lawsuit, Osprey and Grayscale were the only two companies offering Bitcoin trust products with ticker-based exposure. Osprey’s Counterarguments However, Osprey didn’t accept the ruling quietly. On Feb 10 soon after the rulling, they filed a motion asking the court to reconsider. They argue that their case isn’t about securities transactions but about misleading advertising. Osprey claims that Grayscale’s misleading promotions unfairly diverted customers away from them, affecting their business. They believe the judge’s ruling ignored key differences between how deceptive advertising is treated under different laws. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ADA Pumps 15% as Grayscale Cardano ETF Triggers Buying Frenzy , Osprey’s Next Move Interestingly, a year after the initial lawsuit, the SEC finally approved Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust to convert into an ETF after Grayscale won a separate court case. Osprey had even offered to settle its claims for nearly $2 million in July 2024, but Grayscale declined. Now, Osprey is pushing forward, arguing that this fight is about fairness in advertising and competition, not just about securities law. They are also working on converting their own Bitcoin Trust (OBTC) into an ETF after a failed acquisition deal with Bitwise. The outcome of this legal battle could have big implications for how crypto companies compete in the future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The cryptocurrency world witnessed one buzziest airdrop of recent times-Bonk(BONK), a meme coin that burst onto the scene within the Solana ecosystem. But with all the hype comes a crucial question: Is the Bonk airdrop the real deal? What is Bonk (BONK)? Launched in December 2022, Bonk (BONK) emerged as the first dog-themed meme coin on the Solana blockchain, aiming to be “for the people, by the people.” Drawing inspiration from meme tokens such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, Bonk symbolizes a cultural phenomenon rather than a cryptocurrency designed for financial or commercial purposes. Its goal was to address what its founders perceived as harmful tokenomics linked to other initiatives, particularly mentioning FTX influence on Solana’s ecosystem . Bonk rapidly acquired momentum, culminating in a major airdrop event where 50% of its overall supply was allocated to the Solana community. The Legitimacy of the Bonk Airdrop Historical Context and Distribution: Airdrop Details: The original Bonk airdrop occurred around Christmas 2022, where 50% of the token’s supply (50 trillion out of 100 trillion) was distributed. This included allocations to: Active Solana community members: Solana DeFi users, including liquidity providers and platform users, received an allocation in the ecosystem. Solana NFT holders, artists, and collectors : Bonk tokens were distributed to Solana NFT holders to support and reward the NFT community. OpenBook platform users: OpenBook is a decentralized social trading platform on Solana, Bonk DAO and developers – A portion was reserved for Solana validators and developers as goodwill for maintaining and building infrastructure. The airdrop was designed to reward the community and encourage new engagement within the Solana network. BREAKING BIG: Christmas came early for Solana enjoyers. Bonkmas Airdrop by @bonk_inu is now Live. The average airdrop is more than $1k per user Enjoy the bonkmas pic.twitter.com/6pt0wCtSTY — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) December 24, 2023 Timeline and Execution: The airdrop was rolled out over several weeks to prevent network congestion and ensure a fairer distribution. The staggered schedule allowed for a smooth execution, reducing transaction failures and delays. Eligibility: Potential candidates had to verify their wallet addresses, proving ownership of Solana NFTs and past community participation. This measure ensured that the tokens reached genuine users instead of bots or fraudulent actors. Technical and Legal Aspects: The Bonk token airdrop was executed through smart contracts on the Solana blockchain, ensuring automated, transparent, and fair distribution. These smart contracts enabled seamless token transfers while adhering to predefined criteria. However, legal compliance was also a crucial factor, as some jurisdictions require licenses for distributing free tokens. Despite these challenges, the airdrop successfully met its objectives without legal hurdles, strengthening its credibility. Transparency and Security: Official channels: Bonk maintains an active presence on social media such as its twitter handle @bonk_inu , and its official website . Regular announcements provide updates, ensuring transparency. Scam alerts: BONK team has warned against fraudulent airdrop claims, emphasizing that any legitimate distributions would be announced through official channels. Market Performance and Adoption: Exchange listings: BONK’s listing on major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Kraken, and Coinbase has solidified its credibility. These platforms typically vet projects before allowing them to be traded. Value surge: Following the airdrop, there was a dramatic increase in BONK price , with gains of nearly 7303%, creating multiple “BONK millionaires.” The Solana meme coin was named a top performer in 2023. This further strengthened its legitimacy and adoption in DeFi, gaming, and NFT projects within Solana. Community Sentiment: Social media and forums: Conversations on Reddit, X (previously Twitter), and Discord verify that users received Bonk tokens as anticipated, exchanging their experiences and tactics. Although some cautioned about potential scams, the general sentiment supported the airdrop’s authenticity. Solana network engagement: Significant spikes in network activity were observed in both December 2023 and March 2024, aligning with the rise of Bonk, highlighting its impact on the ecosystem. The Rise of Bonk Airdrop Frauds Following the success of the initial airdrop, making it one of the best meme coins to buy at that time, scammers began creating deceptive schemes that claimed to give out free BONK tokens. These frauds usually include phishing websites and fraudulent airdrop links that deceive users into surrendering their private keys or linking their wallets to harmful smart contracts. Common Scam Tactics Fake websites: Scammers create fake websites mimicking official Bonk pages, urging users to claim upcoming crypto airdrops. Wallet draining links: Some fraudulent airdrop links require users to connect their wallets, allowing scammers to drain funds from unsuspecting users. Social media impersonation: Fake Twitter and Telegram accounts post fake announcements about new BONK airdrops. Suspicious email campaigns : Scammers send emails pretending to be from Bonk developers, encouraging users to click malicious links. Example of a Scam One notable scam, known as the “ Bonk Coin Airdrop Giveaway ”, spread across multiple platforms, claiming that users could claim free BONK tokens by connecting their wallets. Victims reported that their crypto holdings disappeared after engaging with these fake websites. Bonk Coin Airdrop Giveaway (Source: How to Avoid Bonk Airdrop Scams As the cryptocurrency market witnesses increased scams, it is very important to be alert and cautious, before jumping on to the next airdrop train. Here are some key safety tips: 1. Verify official sources: Before engaging with any Bonk-related airdrop, verify the information from official sources such as: The official Bonk website. Official social media channels Reputable crypto news platforms 2. Never share private keys or seed phrases A legitimate airdrop will never ask for your private keys, seed phrase, or login credentials. If a website or platform requests these, it’s a scam. 3. Be Wary of Unrealistic Promises Respect your instincts. Should you suspect that an airdrop offer seems overrated, then there is a high chance that is it too good to be true. More often scammers promise their targets huge rewards, to lead them into their traps. 4. Check Smart Contract Approvals Use blockchain explorers like Solscan or Etherscan to check what permissions you are granting when interacting with any airdrop site. 5. Avoid Connecting Your Wallet to Unknown Platforms Only connect your crypto wallet to trusted and verified websites. If you have connected your wallet to a suspicious platform, consider revoking access via Phantom Wallet’s “Manage Apps” feature or similar tools. Conclusion The original Bonk airdrop in December 2022 was legitimate and successfully distributed tokens to the Solana community. However, any new claims of BONK airdrops should be approached with extreme caution. The Bonk airdrop seems to be legitimate, supported by a clear distribution plan, extensive community involvement, integration in the Solana ecosystem, and listings on prominent exchanges. Crypto scams are widespread, and harmful individuals constantly adapt their strategies to take advantage of users. For your safety, consistently check information from trusted sources, steer clear of dubious links, and refrain from sharing your private keys. If you’re uncertain, it’s advisable to verify or steer clear of participating in airdrops completely.

Fellow investors often follow the bigger holders for potential opportunities, which is why their decision could heavily impact a digital asset’s price performance. One such influential whale is on the brink of changing the Ethena price trajectory, as it has recently unstaked 17.875M ENA, raising concerns. Let’s discuss what will happen if this holder sells these many tokens. Crypto Whale Unstakes 17.875M ENA: Ethena Price At Risk? This prominent whale is making headlines in the crypto market as it recently unstaked 17.875 million ENA tokens, equivalent to $8.78M per current price. According to the Spotonchain X post , this move sparks concerns of a potential sell-off. The whale has deposited all these on Binance, which hints at selling sentiments. Interestingly, this selling decision would impact the ENA price in the short term, but the whale would also face heavy losses. As the data presents, the trader bought these tokens at an average price of $1.67, which is towards the high end, and the current scenario is on the low end, as the token is struggling on the chart. With that being said, the trade would face a $12.09M loss, losing almost 60% of the initial investment. Moreover, it could introduce selling sentiments, impacting the token’s worth. Will Ethena Price Crash With 17.875M ENA Sell? The addition of the 17.875M ENA to Ethena’s circulating supply seems alarming, but the reality is less dramatic. Though it is undeniable that such a sell-off has the potential to influence the Ethena price, the impact will be minor. ENA is currently trading at $0.4989 and has significantly recovered since its earlier crash due to turbulence in the altcoins market . Additionally, its 24-hour trading volume is $270.86M after an 18% surge, showcasing investor interest. As a result, the token might witness limited volatility. However, the crypto exchange where these tokens will be sold might witness higher slippage due to increased liquidity. Moreover, small-scale investors might follow the selling sentiments, but that will be short-term. On analyzing the ENA/ USDT daily charts, its price movement indicated the possibility of a dip near the $0.428 support level. However, the recovery might follow soon, with the price target being $0.502, $0.617, and eventually $0.808. Key Levels To Watch The ENA price trajectory could take any turn amid the ongoing market turbulence and whale dumping, so investors must watch out for these key levels to ensure better decision-making. Key support levels: $0.3430, $0.4280, and $0.4530. Key resistance levels: $0.6710 and $0.8082. Buying opportunity: A drop to the $0.428 support level may become ideal before the token followed recovery retails. Ethena Price Prediction: A bounce from the current support level toward the resistance could push it to $0.6710 before attaining $0.8082. However, if the key support is not held, the price may decline to as low as $0.3430. What’s Next? Ethena was among the top cryptos in the market but is also struggling with turbulence. It currently trades at $0.4989 and has declined 67% from the ATH of $1.52. However, with a shallow dip, the key support of $0.4280 could introduce a better recovery once the buying pressure increased. With that, the Ethena price may rally to as high as $8.8082. Additionally, even if the aforementioned crypto whale dumped its 17.875M ENA, the impact will be limited on the price. Investors must watch the key levels and build their strategies accordingly.

Solana-based DEXs have posted total trading volume of just over $60 million this month, nearly double the $34 million on Ethereum, the biggest smart-contract blockchain, according to data source DeFiLlama . ""Solana’s lower fees and higher throughput continue to attract developers and users, highlighting its growing role in decentralized finance,"" Tagus Capital said. Solana has held its pole position since October. Notably, in January, Solana-based DEXs achieved trading volume of $258 billion with Ethereum trailing at just $86 billion. Solana's dominance, powered by frenzied memecoin trading, is not limited to transaction volume. Despite its reputation as a low-cost blockchain, Solana has generated $25 million in revenue so far this month compared with Ethereum's $16 million . In January, Solana earned $124 million, Ethereum $109 million. The performance supports the bullish case in the SOL-ETH ratio, which peaked near 0.09 in January and has since pulled back to 0.075, data from charting platform TradingView show. Still, Tagus Capital noted that Solana’s total value locked (TVL) at $9 billion remains much lower than Ethereum's $57 billion.",Markets|Solana|Ethereum|Markets,EN,0,0,SOL|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 10:08:37

The broader crypto market has experienced a recovery, with bullish sentiment fueling expectations of further gains. SHIB has been consolidating throughout the past week, but recent movements suggest a potential breakout. A 35 trillion SHIB outflow and signs of capitulation hint at a possible price surge ahead. Shiba Inu Price Poised to Triple as 35T SHIB Outflow Hints Capitulation Shiba Inu value shows signs of a potential rally as exchange outflows and capitulation signals indicate a trend reversal. SHIB has witnessed a significant drop in exchange supply, declining from 141 trillion to 106 trillion tokens since January 4. This suggests increased investor accumulation and reduced selling pressure, which could support a price surge if demand rises. Historically, declining exchange balances have preceded strong bullish trends in SHIB’s market performance. Another key indicator, network profit/loss, has recorded a sharp negative spike, signaling capitulation among traders. NPL tracks the average profit or loss of coins moving on-chain daily. A negative NPL means a large number of SHIB holders are selling at a loss, often a precursor to a market bottom. This capitulation has historically set the stage for a bullish rebound as weaker hands exit the market. If historical trends hold, SHIB could potentially triple its value from current levels to $0.00004923. Santiment SHIB Eyes Major Breakout Amid Recovery As of Tuesday, February 11, SHIB price hovered at $0.00001641 after a strong recovery, gaining 3% in the past 24-hours. The price action indicates a potential bullish breakout, forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the weekly timeframe. This structure suggests a possible rally toward key resistance levels. The chart shows the first resistance at the neckline level of $0.00003286, which aligns with the previous price action. A successful breakout from this point could push the Shiba Inu price prediction toward its second target of $0.00006029, marking a potential 267% surge from current levels. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a classic bullish reversal structure, has taken shape over nearly two years. The head was established at the $0.000007 level, while the two shoulders formed at higher lows, indicating growing accumulation. The measured move from the pattern suggests that a significant upside could follow once SHIB clears the neckline. However, price rejection at the neckline could lead to a temporary retracement. The key support zone is around $0.00001266, which could act as a cushion if selling pressure emerges. Shiba Inu Price In conclusion, a 35 trillion SHIB outflow and capitulation suggest a bullish reversal. If momentum builds, the SHIB price could triple, reaching $0.00004923 in the coming weeks.

Unlike Bittensor (TOA) and Hyperliquid (HYPE), that’s very hard to keep up their appeal, FX Guys ($FXG) is gaining popularity with outstanding features. FXGuys has become a top presale choice this February with a clear vision and practical benefits. FXGuys supports smooth trading as it provides different tools for different traders.

Even with this benefit, momentum for Bittensor is fading away with new promising projects coming in the crypto space. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Decentralized Trading Power Struggles to Sustain Momentum Hyperliquid is a fully decentralized crypto trading platform that is directly integrated with a high-performance L1 blockchain. The aim is to bring more practical trading to the real world since there are no such big centralized cryptocurrency exchanges to compare with.

HYPE genesis airdrop is the most popular reason investors are interested in the platform. To reward the early investors, it went live and distributed over 310 million. Despite a high increase in activities, Hyperliquid is gradually losing its appeal to new projects. FXGuys ($FXG): Hottest Presale with DeFi Staking and Trader Funding Despite being a new crypto trading platform, the FXGuys presale has gathered buzz and is shining as February’s top presale choice. $FXG is in its third stage of the public presale, valued at $0.05 and has raised over $3.8 million.

Its momentum has been impressive, with the asset making substantial gains in the first days of Feb, mirroring the 2.2% gains it achieved in the previous week. As of now, gold is trading above $2,900 per ounce, according to Goldprice.org . If it holds this level, it will mark its seventh consecutive week of price appreciation.

However, Bitcoin has remained relatively stable recently, entering an accumulation phase, while gold has been steadily trending upward. Analyst Daink recently pointed out this trend, noting that, although gold has been pushing new highs, Bitcoin has yet to follow in its footsteps. However, Daink suggests that Bitcoin has historically tended to catch up with gold after such decouplings, meaning BTC may be poised to play catch-up soon. So, van de Poppe’s prediction may come true in the end.

In a February 11 post on X , Story confirmed the imminent launch, marking a significant step toward decentralized IP ownership. The IP token will support transactions, governance voting, and creator payouts, beginning with an initial staking phase called “Singularity.” Story’s IP Token Launches with 1 Billion Supply Story’s native token has a total supply of 1 billion, and staking rewards will commence on March 2, following the staking phase. Several leading exchanges, including Bitget, Bithumb, Bybit, KuCoin, Coinbase, and OKX, have already announced plans to list the IP token. According to a post on the project’s forum, the mainnet launch represents a milestone in decentralized digital ownership, allowing creators to register, license, and monetize their content on-chain. Story aims to make intellectual property programmable by offering an open market where rights holders can define licensing terms and payments. While fees are paid in cryptocurrency, creators can cash out in their local currency. Story’s blockchain-based approach allows creators to directly register their work, automate licensing, ensure revenue-sharing, and prevent unauthorized use—eliminating intermediaries. The project was founded in 2022 by former Google DeepMind product manager Jason Zhao, who identified challenges with AI-generated content. He previously noted that AI remixing tools lack sustainable business models for content creators and IP holders. “In the age of AI, IP will play a critical role in tokenizing the $61 trillion IP asset class,” Story stated in a February 7 post.

It is worth noting that Story has attracted major venture capital backing from firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, Hashed, and Samsung Next. The project secured $29 million in seed funding in May 2023, $25 million in a Series A round in September 2023, and an additional $80 million in Series B in August 2024. Growing Need for Digital Property Protection The protection of digital property within the cryptocurrency space has become increasingly vital as the industry evolves. Several initiatives and frameworks have been developed to address the challenges associated with safeguarding digital assets and intellectual property. For one, TokenPatronus is a decentralized anti-theft mechanism specifically designed for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It offers pre-event protection, in-event interruption, and post-event recovery enhancements for NFT transactions. The system includes modules such as decentralized access control, risk management, and arbitration to provide comprehensive protection for digital assets. CopyrightLY is another decentralized application aimed at authorship and copyright management. It allows creators to claim content authorship, store content and metadata in decentralized storage, and register this information on the blockchain.

Amid this downturn, emerging tokens like XYZVerse and Ondo, along with established names like Solana, are capturing attention. This article explores five intriguing cryptocurrencies that stand out during this period, offering insights into their potential impact on the market. XYZ’s Rise to Glory: The Meme Coin Fighter Punching Through the Crypto Arena XYZVerse is the next heavyweight champion of meme coins. Crowned Best NEW Meme Project, it blends the electric energy of sports with meme culture, drawing in millions of fans who want to be part of something bigger. Every great story needs a hero. Not the biggest, not the strongest—just the one crazy enough to keep pushing forward. That’s XYZepe, the masked fighter, the die-hard believer, and the relentless holder of $XYZ. His mission is to bring XYZVerse to the top of CoinMarketCap and carve XYZ into crypto history. In response, the CMC community is totally behind this future champ: 95% are super bullish on $XYZ. But greatness isn’t handed out—it’s earned in the ring. $XYZ has already passed through 9 out of 15 presale stages, and the thriving community helps it build momentum for a mindblowing take off. Undervalued at $0.002, $XYZ is a bet worth making. By the end of presale, it’s set to soar to $0.1. The fight isn’t over, but the path to glory is clear. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who know this isn’t just another meme coin—it’s the start of something legendary. XYZepe is fighting for glory. Are you ready to join the ring? Cardano’s ADA: The Eco-Friendly Crypto Shaping the Future Cardano is turning heads in the cryptocurrency world. It’s a flexible and sustainable blockchain platform built for smart contracts. This means it helps create decentralized finance apps, new crypto tokens, and games. Its native coin, ADA, stands as a strong competitor to Ethereum’s ETH. Users can store value, make payments, and even stake their ADA on the network. What makes Cardano special is its green approach. It uses Ouroboros, a proof-of-stake system that’s much more energy-efficient than the traditional proof-of-work models used by others. The technology behind Cardano is innovative. It’s split into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This separation boosts its speed, potentially handling up to a million transactions per second. In March 2021, Cardano introduced native tokens, allowing for secure and low-fee interactions with smart contracts. This positions Cardano as a leader in efficiency and scalability. In the current market cycle, ADA looks attractive, especially for those interested in sustainable options. While coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are well-established, Cardano’s focus on sustainability and scalability might give it an edge in the evolving crypto landscape. Solana’s SOL: The Fast Lane of the Crypto World Solana is turning heads in the blockchain arena with its focus on speed and scalability. Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana offers a foundation for decentralized applications that stands out. Its unique architecture delivers faster transactions and flexible development options across multiple programming languages. At the core of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL isn’t just a token; it powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of SOL is tied to the impressive capabilities of the Solana platform. Unlike some networks, Solana doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions to scale. This design choice attracts developers and investors seeking a high-capacity network that can handle bustling products and services. In the current market cycle, where scalability and transaction speed are crucial, SOL looks increasingly attractive. While the crypto market is crowded, SOL’s strong technology and ambitious approach make it a standout option among digital currencies. Avalanche Unleashed: How AVAX Is Changing the Crypto Game Avalanche is a new kind of blockchain that’s eco-friendly and fast. It can handle up to 4,500 transactions per second, and these transactions are finalized in less than two seconds. This means sending and receiving money happens almost instantly. Avalanche also lets users create their own customizable networks called Subnets. It uses a special way to agree on transactions, mixing old and new methods, for better security and speed. The platform has three main parts—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that work together to manage transactions and smart contracts. AVAX is the token that powers Avalanche. It’s used to pay for transactions, keep the network safe through staking, and help run Subnets. In today’s market, speed and low fees are important, and Avalanche meets these needs. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, AVAX offers fast, cheap, and eco-friendly transactions, which is a big deal as more people care about the environment. The ability to create custom tokens and blockchains on Avalanche could attract developers and businesses looking for flexible solutions. As the crypto market evolves, platforms like Avalanche that focus on speed, scalability, and sustainability may become more important. Ondo Finance: Unlocking High-Grade Assets on the Blockchain Ondo Finance is making waves by blending the reliability of traditional finance with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It does this by tokenizing stable, income-generating assets like US Treasuries. This means more people can access high-quality financial products that were once out of reach. Ondo has two main parts: an asset management arm that creates these tokenized products, and a technology arm that builds DeFi protocols to make them work better and reach more people. In a market where trust and security are big concerns, Ondo stands out by partnering with well-known firms like BlackRock and using Coinbase for custody. It sets high standards for transparency and follows legal rules closely.

Many had high expectations for Solana (SOL) to reach new all-time highs in 2025, but with the recent dip, the future of Solana remains uncertain. While major altcoins like Solana continue to dip, Doge Uprising ($DUP) offers a different kind of opportunity. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that are heavily influenced by institutional movements, Doge Uprising thrives on community-driven momentum and strategic marketing. This is why analysts are predicting a 50,000% surge for the altcoin, and investors who get in early could see life changing returns. The Solana Price Struggles As Investors Look for Better opportunities The Solana price is down to $198.70 after reaching almost $300 earlier in the year. However, major cryptocurrencies have followed suit, and analysts blame President Trump’s tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico for the dip. Earlier in the year, projections were made for the Solana price to potentially hit $1000 in 2025. However, the recent drop in price has increased scepticism amongst investors, and short-term holders have sold, further driving down the price. This shows the role market sentiments play in determining the price of major altcoins. This is where Doge Uprising presents a compelling alternative. Unlike major cryptocurrencies that are highly sensitive to macroeconomic events and institutional sell-offs, Doge Uprising thrives on community-driven momentum. While Solana and other altcoins battle external economic pressures, Doge Uprising remains in control of its own narrative, leveraging strategic marketing and expanding its ecosystem to maintain investor engagement. Why Solana Whales Are Focusing on Doge Uprising’s Presale Memecoins have become a dominant force in crypto, but many fizzle out once the hype dies. Doge Uprising is different. It’s not just another token riding the meme wave. It’s backed by a strategic marketing push and real utility that gives it to stay power. The project is tapping into viral trends while ensuring that investors aren’t left holding a token without worth once the initial buzz fades. For individual investors, this distinction is critical. Most memecoins rely purely on speculation, making them risky short-term bets. But Doge Uprising is building an actual ecosystem with NFT collectables and planned gaming integrations, giving holders more ways to engage with and benefit from the project. This real-world use case strengthens its long-term value, making it more than just a passing trend. More importantly, $DUP isn’t just about hype—it’s about access. Holding the token unlocks exclusive experiences, content, and potential earning opportunities within the Doge Uprising network. For investors looking for more than a pump-and-dump play, this added layer of utility provides a reason to stick around. In a market flooded with short-lived meme projects, Doge Uprising is positioning itself as a sustainable, community-driven investment with real upside potential. Doge Uprising is also forming alliances with gaming ecosystems and NFT bazaars, propelling itself beyond blockchain. Investors can also earn passive incomes through staking for long-term investment while contributing the stability of the platform Doge Uprising has also undergone a comprehensive audit by SolidProof , reinforcing its commitment to security and transparency. This audit ensures that the project’s smart contract is free from vulnerabilities, providing investors with confidence in the token’s legitimacy. In a space where security concerns are rampant, Doge Uprising’s proactive approach to compliance sets it apart from many other meme projects. This is why Doge Uprising is the future of meme coins and the revolution against established meme coins like Solana. Join Doge Uprising’s Crypto Presale Today Rumours have it that Doge Uprising is on the verge of being listed on Binance. If this pans out, $DUG could skyrocket 1000% folds, a move that most meme coins could only dream about. Doge Uprising is currently in stage 5 of the token presale, with one token going for $0.00002397, marking the lowest price it will ever be. Prices will jump to 0.00002445 in about 6 days. With a $2,000 investment today, investors can potentially yield $80,000 or more at the end of the presale. Investors can also earn massive rewards by inviting others to the platform. When somebody uses your code to sign up and purchases $DUP tokens, you instantly get a 5% bonus in $DUP tokens. Analysts are already comparing this coin to Solana’s 2021 rally, and with the right investment in $DUP tokens, you can finally hit your millionaire status in 2025. You don’t want to miss this once in a lifetime opportunity. To purchase tokens, you can head to the Doge Uprising website , connect your wallet, and follow the on-screen instructions.

Notably, they see the chances of a Litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) going live in the coming months as higher than those of other ETFs currently proposed. XRP, DOGE, SOL, ADA To Lag Behind LTC In ETF Approval Odds Bloomberg analysts expect Litecoin, the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, to lead the next wave of crypto ETFs amid a shifting regulatory climate under President Donald Trump. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have tipped a 90% chance that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a spot LTC ETF before the end of this year. LTC is the eighteenth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, CoinGecko data shows. Litecoin was created in 2011 as a much faster alternative to Bitcoin and shares a similar proof-of-work consensus mechanism to the OG cryptocurrency. In a series of posts on the X platform, Seyffart and Balchunas noted that Litecoin’s path toward an SEC greenlight might be straightforward as S-1 and 19b-4 forms have already been filed and acknowledged while the regulator also likely considers LTC as a commodity. The applications come amid a ton of digital asset regulation and policy changes in the United States, such as the nomination of a new, pro-crypto SEC chair. The SEC has also established a crypto task force led by crypto-friendly Commissioner Hester Peirce. The tone shift — coupled with the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in early 2024 — has sparked issuers’ hopes that the SEC could give the nod to a handful of crypto-based investment products in the foreseeable future. Spot BTC and ETH have attracted roughly $40.7 billion and $3.18 billion in net inflows, respectively, since going live. Although the Bloomberg analysts don’t think an LTC ETF would pull in that much demand, they stated that it could still be worthwhile for asset firms with as little as $50 million in some cases. More Regulatory Work Crucial For Ripple’s XRP And SOL After Litecoin, Dogecoin ETFs were given a 75% chance of approval, followed by Solana and XRP products, which Seyffart and Balchunas gave a 70% and 65% likelihood of approval, respectively. Questions linger over Solana and XRP’s security status, with Seyffart forecasting that a spot XRP investment vehicle would not see the light of day until the SEC’s lawsuit against related company Ripple is fully resolved. Ripple notched a major legal win in July 2023 when a federal judge found that XRP isn’t a security when sold on secondary markets. However, the SEC, under Gary Gensler’s helm, has appealed this court’s decision, arguing that Ripple violated securities laws when it sold the XRP cryptocurrency to retail investors. Nonetheless, Ripple executives are hopeful that the new SEC leadership, currently led by pro-crypto Mark Uyeda, will ultimately drop the enforcement case.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|Dogecoin|Litecoin|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,LTC|REGULATION|XRP|SOL|DOGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-11 11:41:22

In a Feb. 11 research report , analysts at blockchain forensic firm Merkle Science revealed that in 2024, scammers targeted high-profile figures by hacking their accounts. After gaining access, they quickly promoted fake token launches created on Pump.fun, a platform for minting tokens on Solana . One such incident was the Aug. 29 hack of soccer star Kylian Mbappé’s X account. The attacker promoted a fake MBAPPE meme coin on Solana, which quickly hit a $460 million market cap before collapsing and leaving investors with over $1 million in losses. “By compromising influential figures and trusted platforms, hackers exploit credibility to manipulate investors at scale.” Merkle Science You might also like: Scammers deployed 6,800 fake tokens amid TRUMP meme coin craze: Blockaid In total, the New York-headquartered firm identified 36 cases of such scams last year. Celebrities were the most targeted cohort, making up 33% of cases, the report reads. Tech figures and tech companies followed, making up 30% and 19% of cases, respectively. Government agencies and consumer brands were rarely hit, each making up just 5% of incidents. On average, victims had 2.3 million followers, the firm notes. Most attacks occurred on X as the social network accounted for 75% of all cases. YouTube accounted for 19% and official website hacks for 5%, with scammers using tactics like phishing links and bypassing two-factor authentication, according to Merkle Science. The two main scam types were rug pulls and phishing, both making up 88% of all crypto-related attacks that occurred in 2024.

This sudden movement is an indicator of the growing belief in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Rising Accumulation as Whales Strengthen Positions Santiment data shows that there are currently 9.63 million ETH, worth an estimated $26 billion, sitting in known exchange wallets. This is the lowest number since August 29, 2024. According to the crypto insights platform, when investors pull assets from exchanges, it usually suggests they are looking to hold rather than sell, therefore reducing the sell-side pressure and lowering the likelihood of major price drops. “When assets are moving away from exchanges, it is typically a signal of confidence by investors, who are content with holding for the long-term,” stated Santiment. However, the platform’s analysts noted that ETH’s performance this year will most likely be decided by Bitcoin’s ability to stay afloat and rebound to its all-time high. Interestingly, the outflow has come in tandem with the number of Ethereum whales rising by 2.3% since the beginning of February. According to well-regarded crypto expert Ali Martinez, this accumulation is signaling growing accumulation and reinforcing the bullish sentiment among large investors, even as ETH’s price remains under pressure. Additionally, a recent CoinShares report also indicated that Ethereum led weekly crypto inflows for the first time in 2025, beating BTC. Traders poured nearly $800 million into ETH-related products, compared to only $407 million that went into the number one cryptocurrency. Mixed Signals as Short Positions Mount However, despite the underlying bullishness, hedge funds have dramatically increased short positions on ETH, rising 40% in a week and 500% since November 2024. Historically, such extreme bearish positions can set the stage for a short squeeze , where rapid price increases force short sellers to buy back an asset, further pushing up its value. Meanwhile, Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) registered record inflows in the last week, adding more than $854 million in that period. Some market observers feel that this institutional backing, coupled with decreasing exchange reserves, could mean that investors are positioning themselves for a potential rebound. At the time of this writing, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading at $2,715, a 2.6% improvement over 24 hours. However, across two weeks and one month, the coin’s value is down 15% and 16.1%, respectively. It is also still more than 44% below its ATH of $4,878 achieved over three years ago.

In 2026, it will range between $85.57 and $104.16, with an average price of $88.59. In 2030, it will range between $403.57 and $457.21, with an average price of $414.44. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, AVAX has particularly left investors questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Its trading volume dropped by 7.29% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024 until it reached a high of $55.41 on Dec 12. It later corrected and now moves in a downward channel and registered its lowest price this year at $21.20, in the first week of February. The William Alligator trendlines are opening as AVAX volatility rises. The relative strength index is 35.50 in neutral territory with the MACD histogram showing that the negative momentum is slowing down. The candlesticks show bullish engulfing candles as AVAX traded higher over the last 4 days. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run which is now recovering from a month long bear run. Unlike the daily chart, it registers positive momentum and has risen above the William Alligator moving averages.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish and currently gearing up for a closer move to $2t. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in Avax value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2026. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach also reach $100 in 2026, with a maximum price of $104.16 for the year. Will AVAX reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is AVAX a good investment? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall momentum remaining bearish.

In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, whistleblower ‘crypto leaks’ published a report accusing Ava labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and $27 in September and October. It turned bullish in November 2024 rising from as low as $23 as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January, and by February, it had fallen below $30.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,AVAX|TRADING|MARKET|ICO|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-11 11:45:39

These applications were filed by WisdomTree, 21 Shares, Bitwise, and Canary. Despite a recent 13.33% drop in XRP price over the past week and nearing its previous all-time high of $3.39 on January 4, 2025, the applications have been submitted. However, recently investors are looking for a new meme coin to focus all their attention on, and have turned their eyes to an up and coming token, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) . XRP ETF journey On October 8, 2024, Canary Capital submitted a registration statement to the United States SEC for the proposed Canary XRP ETF. Canary expects its XRP ETF to give investors direct exposure to movements in the price of XRP without the technicalities of owning the digital asset itself, including custody and security related issues. The fund from Canary Capital will be investing in XRP directly while also benchmarking against the price action of XRP against the dollar. This approach is designed to provide a simple investing alternative for people wanting to capitalize on the dynamics surrounding the XRP token without having to directly trade the token on any cryptocurrency exchange. Cointelegraph states the growing interest in XRP ETFs have skyrocketed since XRP’s win in the historic SEC v. Ripple Labs legal battle. XRP has come under strong selling, lowering its price by 11.76% to $2.42 , despite the past week bringing general technical growth including regulatory improvements and increasing institutional interest in XRP ETFs. Still, investors were wary since the current price behavior points to continuous market volatility. XRP’s market capitalization still exceeds $139 billion, though, which reflects long-term investors’ continuous curiosity. Long term, this would also help to change the sentiment and preserve the XRP price. Yeti Ouro: Revolutionizing DeFi And GameFi Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is a cryptocurrency project focused on bridging the world between DeFi and GameFi. The Yeti Ouro Ecosystem is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game — Yeti Go, that enables players to earn its YETIO tokens while competing in higher-than-max immersive environments. Yeti Go is the new addition to the Yeti Ouro ecosystem that seeks to seamlessly combine gaming and earning in a single play-to-earn racing game. Yeti Go is still under development being built on Unreal Engine 5, but there has been a significant buzz among early adopters regarding its gameplay mechanics and reward system. The developers are working on a regular cadence, which, combined with a clear roadmap, means that Yeti Go is surely moving towards its launch and in the process, shifting the paradigm of crypto gaming for good. The developers have teamed up with the visionary talents behind Call of Duty, Spiderman, Dead Space, and The Witcher to create breathtaking character assets, while Grammy-nominated industry experts craft the audio, drawing from their work with Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. Presale: YETIO has come through its presale with a splash, selling 168 million + tokens. Already set at just $0.017, investors have received a 10% bonus for all purchases. The presale will imminently reach Stage 3 — a guaranteed price increase and an influx of investor interest. With Yeti Ouro, users benefit from a deflationary model that rewards long-term holders by limiting the total supply to 1 billion tokens and incorporating a 5% burn clause in its contract, all while still offering staking opportunities and APY rewards. In August 2024, Yeti Ouro was audited by the blockchain security firm SolidProof to enhance its credibility. The report also confirmed the project’s security and operational legitimacy, which also has added to investors’ confidence. Yeti Ouro is methodically staking its claim as a mainstay of both the DeFi and GameFi space, with its successful presale, trusted audit, and unique ecosystem.

The press release shared with Cryptonews noted that this is subject to the Malta Financial Services Authorities (MFSA)’s pre-authorization requirements. However, when granted, the license will allow Gemini to offer regulated futures and options in the countries of the EU and European Economic Area (EEA) to advanced traders and institutions. It will do so under the Markets in Financial Instrument Directive (MiFID II), a framework regulating the traditional financial markets. Getting the in-principal approval in Malta is a key step in the company’s 2025 European expansion strategy, the team said. Gemini aims to increase its offerings for institutional and retail customers. This already includes a spot exchange with more than 90 digital assets, ActiveTrader with over 80 trading pairs, the OTC desk, and eOTC trading system for institutional traders. Mark Jennings, Gemini’s Head of Europe, commented that achieving this in-principal approval is a crucial “milestone in our commitment to providing a best-in-class offering for retail and institutional investors.” Jennings added that the “interest in crypto derivatives, particularly from institutions, has increased significantly in recent years, as crypto matures into a recognised asset class.” You might also like Gemini Settles with CFTC for $5M Over Misleading Bitcoin Futures Statements European Expansion in Full Force Gemini seems to be hard at work expanding its operations throughout the Old Continent. In November 2024, the exchange launched in France as part of its European expansion strategy. Users in that country can open a Gemini account to deposit, trade, and store crypto. Gemini’s CEO of the UK and Europe, Gillian Lynch, commented that the exchange’s research into the French market discovered a growing interest in digital assets. Additionally, the latest in-principal approval comes after Gemini selected Malta as the company’s EU hub and jurisdiction for the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) application. “Receiving MiCA approval will allow us to continue offering our secure and reliable services to customers throughout the region,” the newest press release said. Also in January 2025, Gemini announced several key senior hires as part of the European expansion. NEW: We’ve chosen Malta as our hub for the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. This decision underscores our dedication to enhancing regulatory compliance and European growth.… pic.twitter.com/0TAAW88KKU — Gemini (@Gemini) January 21, 2025 Moreover, Gemini is not the only company aiming for licenses to spread their businesses in the EU, moving into Malta first. For example, in June last year, major crypto exchange OKX selected Malta as its hub for MiCA compliance within the European Union. The company chose Malta due to its high regulatory standards and its progressive approach to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Approved by the European Parliament in April 2023, MiCA is a comprehensive regulatory framework that the EU established to create consistency in crypto regulation among its member states. Malta was quick to embrace MiCA . Also, in early January 2025, Chiliz Group’s fan engagement platform Socios.com secured a Virtual Financial Assets Act (VFAA) license from the Malta Financial Services Authority after meeting key requirements in late 2024. Meanwhile, reports came out in February that Gemini is exploring plans to go public this year.

Can the Best Wallet Presale Soar to 100x?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/test-coin-listed-on-binance-100x-growth-for-best-wallet-soon/,"Less than a week ago, Test ($TST) was listed on Binance and it went on to make astounding gains. Binance founder and ex-CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao has distanced himself from Test ($TST) after it was listed on the exchange. The coin was a test coin created based on a BNB Chain tutorial, and has no purpose or utility. But the buzz around it grew, leading $TST’s value to rise by 688% over the past week and reach a $200M market cap. In other news, that landfill reported to hold a $768M Bitcoin hard drive could shut its doors this year . Coincidence or not, this shows just how important crypto custody is, when you could lose entire fortunes from simple mistakes. One crypto presale that can solve that is Best Wallet Token , which builds an ecosystem for one of the best crypto wallets, Best Wallet . With much better utility than a mere Test coin, $BEST is set to take the market by storm as the only crypto wallet to offer direct access to presales. Let’s dig deeper into these news below. Valueless Coin Explodes & Bitcoin Fortune Still Missing Test’s development fanned speculations that CZ has gotten into meme coins and is shifting away from fundamentals. He denied this and reiterated his stance in a statement on X (formerly Twitter) – ‘No. I am a builder. I always focus on fundamentals.’ He also revealed he hasn’t bought a single meme coin so far, though he isn’t against meme coins. ‘I am not into sports cars; I don’t collect art; I haven’t bought any NFTs; I also haven’t bought most altcoins (I hold BTC and BNB). But I am not against any of the above.’ The former Binance executive said he understands why the market prefers meme coins over utility coins. For one, utility coins get more scrutiny from the government, which considers them securities. Utility coins are also harder to speculate on, leading to less volatility that speculators love. Then there’s the element of fun. ‘It’s a cultural thing. There are plenty of die-hard defenders of memes. Don’t go against the community.’ However, the surprising rise of random valueless coins like $TST could spell good news for coins that have purpose or utility. Meme coins like Solaxy and Best Wallet Token that offer real-world utility could easily double or quadruple their price if these projects fulfill their goals. These coins are also in the unique position of being both meme coins and utility coins. This means that speculators will keep on actively trading them as long they generate a lot of buzz. On the other hand, investors seeking stability will also find them attractive since they serve a purpose and are more stable than the average meme coin. Finding the $BEST Way to Keep Your Bitcoins Away From the Landfill A city council in the UK has recently ruled that while it has over 99 problems, a $768M Bitcoin wallet isn’t one of them. This comes after the council of Newport, Wales, announced its plans to close one of its landfills in the 2025-2026 financial year. The Docks Way landfill has been at the center of a legal battle between local resident James Howells and the city council. He reportedly lost his hard drive containing 8K Bitcoins (currently worth around $768M) there after his partner mistakenly threw it in the trash can in 2013. He went to court to get permission to find the drive in the landfill. But the judge eventually dismissed the case. The incident once again highlighted the advantage of keeping cryptocurrencies in non-custodial wallets like Best Wallet . It’s the only one to offer direct access to crypto presales. This makes it extra attractive to investors looking for the next big meme coins . Best Wallet Token Presale to Transform the Crypto Presale Space Currently one of the best and biggest wallets in the market today, Best Wallet is also running a presale of its Best Wallet Token . This provides investors the opportunity to have their say on the Best Wallet ecosystem. Other perks include lower transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and early access to new crypto projects . The roadmap shows ample developments coming up next, including an NFT gallery, Best Card, rewards hub, and market intel analytics to help you identify hidden gems for those juicy profits. Best Wallet is set to capture 40% of the $11B non-custodial wallet market by 2026, and the $BEST presale will be instrumental to that goal. The presale has raised over $9.5M and has a token price of $0.02395. Traders have also staked over 151M tokens with a 175% APY. So, long-term gains are definitely possible and encouraged by the community. If you do choose to invest in crypto, please remember to do your own research.

While this growth isn’t massive, it comes alongside some major announcements from Ripple that could drive further momentum. Ripple’s president, Monica Long, recently shared exciting updates on X, revealing two key expansions that aim to boost Ripple’s global payments network. Very excited to 1/ add another country (Portugal!) to the Ripple Payments network and 2/ grow the vital Brazil-Portugal corridor with Unicambio joining existing customers including Travelex Bank and Mercado Bitcoin! https://t.co/TW0kZQskPF https://t.co/DBW8HNVAMh — Monica Long (@MonicaLongSF) February 11, 2025 Ripple Expands to Portugal The first big news is Ripple’s entry into Portugal. Ripple has partnered with Unicâmbio, Portugal’s leading currency exchange provider, allowing its corporate clients to make fast, cost-effective cross-border payments using Ripple Payments, formerly known as On-Demand Liquidity (ODL). This partnership means businesses in Portugal can now move money across borders more efficiently, thanks to Ripple’s technology powered by XRP. Alongside, Monica Long also announced the strengthening of Ripple’s Brazil-Portugal payment corridor. Making things more exciting for Ripple users, Unicâmbio will now join Ripple’s existing partners in Brazil, including Travelex Bank and Mercado Bitcoin. This corridor is significant because Brazil and Portugal share strong economic and cultural ties, making cross-border transactions between the two countries highly active. However these expansions are more than just new partnerships—they highlight Ripple’s growing influence in Europe and Latin America. By adding Portugal to its network and enhancing connections with Brazil, Ripple is positioning itself as a key player in global finance. This also means XRP’s role in facilitating these payments is expanding, increasing its real-world utility. On the other side, Ripple’s presence in US is also getting better with rumors of Ripple vs SEC getting resolved in March to Ripple’s IPO launch the market is waiting for more such announcements in US as well. XRP need a solid push to gain investor faith back in the asset. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP ETF Faces Steeper Hurdles Than Solana and Litecoin ETF ? , XRP Reaction Despite these positive developments, XRP’s price hasn’t seen a major surge, showing only a slight increase. XRP is trading around $2.49, holding steady despite market uncertainty. Analyst Ali Martinez highlights $2.27 as a crucial support level; staying above it could spark bullish momentum toward the $3 mark. XRP has been in an uptrend since December 2024, but it’s now testing key support amid mild market reactions to global trade tensions. If it dips below $2.27, XRP risks falling under $2. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price movement will likely influence XRP’s next direction, as the broader crypto market often follows BTC’s lead. While the XRP prices are still not impressive, the long-term impact of these partnerships could be significant. As more businesses adopt Ripple’s payment solutions, the demand for XRP might rise, potentially driving its price higher in the future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The New Coin Breaks 1st round of presale in a few days,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/is-bitcoin-lithium-btcl-headed-for-x100/,"The post Is Bitcoin Lithium (BTCL) headed For X100%? The New Coin Breaks 1st round of presale in a few days appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin Lithium (BTCL) is emerging as one of the hottest crypto gems of 2025. This is after posting an astounding 1 st round presale performance. Within just a few days into the first round presale, the coin had raised $500,000.00 dollars making it one of the most prescribed new crypto projects this year. But why the sensation over this coin? Well, there are a lot of exciting things about this project that are attracting even the biggest whales in the crypto market. What is Bitcoin Lithium? Bitcoin Lithium is a crypto project designed to address a major issue that affects humanity – global warming- while at the same time making its investors huge returns from solving this problem. With global warming increasingly becoming a threat to humanity, transitioning from fossil fuel to green energy is one of the main solutions. However, going green has been a puzzle for decades now. However, Bitcoin Lithium is solving this by taking the consumption of green energy to a mass level using lithium technology. This is the technology that has made the likes of Elon Musk dollar billionaires hence the attention. As the name suggests, this product mainly focuses on the mass production and adoption of lithium batteries, for use even in the most remote parts of the world. This is why it is attracting massive attention from both novice and experienced crypto investors. In addition, the transparency about this project, especially on tokens’ distribution has also attracted crypto investors’ attention. Bitcoin Lithium Tokenomics According to the projectthe team will be releasing 500,000,000 tokens as the total supply. 40% of the total supply is what has been released for the presale. This is how the $BTCL tokens have been distributed: 10% (50,000,000) –Airdropped 15% (75,000,000) – Marketing 15% (75,000,000) – Liquidity 20% (100,000,000) – Staking 40% (200,000,000) – Presale Why The Explosive Presale Bitcoin Lithium is a crypto project that is bringing together finance, technology, and sustainability, hence making it a highly potent project in 2025. Looking at the whitepaper and more so, the core objectives of the project, it has everything to make it the next million-dollar crypto project. Financing renewable projects and lithium exploration and development are some of the core objectives of this project. The team will be financing lithium battery production and advancements that make lithium extraction environmentally friendly. The sustainability and innovation features of this project also fueled the explosive presale. With an emphasis on investing in scalable and replicable ways of lithium product production, this project is definitely designed for the future. Bitcoin Lithium Price projects With a solid foundation and attractive tokenomics that attract global attention, this project is already promising adoption. With multi-billion mainstream organizations looking to green and looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprints, this project is already tapping into an already existing market. In fact, the presale is just an indication of how explosive this project will be. Crypto experts predict that it will be a coin to watch this year and might grow multiple folds in the next few months. Will $BTCL do 10X this year? Well, the project has so much potential to even surpass this. With the concept easily understood by even novice crypto investors, tokenomics, and promising features, crypto experts believe that Bitcoin Lithium will easily attract thousands of small and big investors within a very short time. So $BTCL price projections remain super bullish. Conclusion With green energy becoming the next big thing, Bitcoin Lithium ($BTCL) has positioned itself at the center of this revolution. By funding sustainable extraction and processing of lithium, and the manufacturing of lithium products such as batteries, this project is destined for greatness. Get yourself some $BTCL now before whales sweep in.

Powell takes the stage on Capitol Hill later Tuesday for his semi-annual update on monetary policy. He'll start with the Senate and repeat his performance in the House of Representatives on Wednesday. The testimony is likely to do little to revive BTC's upswing. The consensus is that Powell will uphold his data-dependent approach, reiterating that the central bank isn't in a rush to cut interest rates anytime soon and is keen on observing more progress with inflation. Data shared by Bloomberg's Lisa Abramowicz shows that market-implied inflation rates for the next two to five years have soared to their highest levels since early 2023. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's tariffs could underpin inflation. The CME's FedWatch tool currently shows traders anticipate just 50 basis points in cuts by the end of next year, significantly less than the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) outlined in its December forecasts. However, there's a glimmer of hope: If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) release on Wednesday comes in weaker than expected, it could create some upside volatility. In other news, Japanese mobile-game studio Gumi said it is planning to purchase bitcoin worth 1 billion yen ($6.6 million), following Tokyo-listed Metaplanet's lead. Metaplanet began buying BTC last year and its shares soared a staggering 4,800% in 12 months. Social media continues to buzz with debate over the imbalance in Ethereum's ecosystem, where layer-2 scaling products retain most of the generated revenue while contributing only a small percentage back to the foundational layer. Solana, meanwhile, continues to outshine Ethereum and other smart-contract blockchains in decentralized exchange trading volumes and revenue. In traditional markets, gold is taking bull breather while copper, often seen as proxy for global economic health, is trading lower, snapping a six-day winning streak. Stay alert!

While Bitcoin remains the biggest name, some alternative coins have delivered returns far beyond expectations. In 2023, certain lesser-known projects outperformed Bitcoin by over 500%, showing that picking the right altcoin at the right moment can lead to massive gains. With thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, filtering real opportunities from the hype requires more than luck. It demands attention to adoption, use cases, and market trends. Below, we break down 4 next altcoins to explode that are shaping today’s crypto market: BlockDAG, Injective, Aptos, and Ripple. Let’s look at their real-world applications, price action, and potential gains. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Presale Gem with Unmatched Growth Potential Most blockchains process transactions one at a time, but BlockDAG (BDAG) uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model, allowing many transactions to be processed at once. This setup boosts speed, scalability, and efficiency while avoiding the congestion issues seen in older blockchain networks. BlockDAG’s presale success proves its potential. With $193.7 million raised, 18.3 billion BDAG sold, and 170,000 holders, its expansion is happening fast. But what makes it one of the next altcoins to explode is its approach to rewarding participation. BlockDAG’s 5% USDT referral cashback gives benefits to both buyers and referrers, strengthening its network. Then there’s FINALCALL700—the biggest bonus in crypto—offering a 350% increase on BDAG purchases. At $0.0248 per BDAG in batch 27 and an expected rise to $1 in 2025, those purchasing BDAG now could see a 3,930% return. To put it simply, a $500 BDAG buy today, with the bonus, immediately becomes $2,250. And when BDAG reaches $1? That same amount turns into $90,700 by the end of 2025. 2. Injective (INJ): Improving DeFi with Low Fees Decentralized finance (DeFi) has great potential, but slow transactions and high costs limit its adoption. Injective is solving this by creating a fast and affordable trading environment that keeps DeFi accessible. As a layer-2 decentralized exchange (DEX), Injective allows secure trading without the bottlenecks found in larger blockchains. Its key advantage is cross-chain compatibility, enabling smooth asset transfers between networks. Currently priced at $40.85, INJ has climbed 4.3% in the past 24 hours, reflecting steady growth as more platforms integrate its features. 3. Aptos (APT): Smart Contracts with Real Scalability Smart contracts have changed digital transactions, but they often struggle with slow speeds and high fees. Aptos addresses this by offering a blockchain that processes transactions quickly and cost-effectively. Built using the Move programming language, Aptos is designed to support high transaction volumes without delays. This makes it suitable for DeFi, gaming, and other blockchain applications. Trading at $11.32, APT has dropped 2.1% in the past day, but its rising adoption makes it one of the next altcoins to explode. 4. Ripple (XRP): Transforming Cross-Border Transactions Ripple has been a key player in global payments, providing a faster and cheaper alternative to traditional banking. While international money transfers often take days and involve high fees, Ripple enables near-instant transactions at a much lower cost.

Most cryptos are down by over 50% from their highest levels this year, making them bargains compared to where they were a few weeks or months ago. So, let us explore some of the top altcoins that could help turn a portfolio of $100k to $1M before February ends. Four Altcoins to Turn Portfolio of $100K to $1M Before February Meme coins offer the best opportunity to turn $100k to $1M in February. Some of the best crypto to buy for big gains are Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Official Trump (TRUMP), Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), and Pepe (PEPE). Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Fartcoin is a popular Solana meme coin with a market cap of over $650 million. The most important reason to be bullish on the Fartcoin price is that it has formed a falling wedge chart pattern on the daily chart. This pattern compromises two falling and converging trendlines. The coin has also dropped to the key support, which connects the lowest swings since last year. Therefore, the Fartcoin price may rebound and retest its all-time high of $2.7320, up by 320% from the current level. This makes it one of the most ideal altcoins to buy in February. Fartcoin Price Official Trump (TRUMP) The recently launched Official Trump meme coin is another top altcoin to buy and convert $100k to $1 million this month. It has already crashed by over 66% from its highest level since its inception. The main catalyst for the Official Trump price is that it could bounce back later this year. Also, there are some chances that the SEC will approve a spot TRUMP ETF, which will lead to more gains in the near term. A rebound to its all-time high of $50 means the token will surge by 203% from the current level. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) The Virtuals Protocol token peaked at $5.25 earlier this year and has crashed to $1.1470. Like TRUMP and Official Trump, the VIRTUAL token has formed a falling wedge chart pattern, with the two lines nearing the confluence. It has also moved to the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement point. Virtuals protocol price will also rebound as demand for AI agent tokens remain strong. Therefore, the token will likely rebound and retest the all-time high at $5.25, up by 282% from the current level. Virtual Price Pepe (PEPE) Pepe coin price has crashed from its all-time high. The main bullish catalyst for the token is that it has become a bargain and is still one of the most popular meme coins in crypto, with over $1 million in daily volume. Its open interest rate remains high, a sign that it has adequate demand. Technically, Pepe has dropped to key support, which connects the lowest point since April last year. A rebound from the current level will point to more gains, potentially to $0.00002832, making it one of the top altcoins to buy. Pepe Price Chart Other Best Crypto to Buy for Big Gains in February There are other top altcoins to buy for big gains in February. Some of the top cryptocurrencies to consider are meme coins like Popcat, Cat in a dogs world, Melania Meme Coin, Dogwifhat, and Bonk.

The market has seen renewed optimism, with Bitcoin (BTC) approaching $100,000. Meanwhile, PEPE is holding above a crucial support level despite 1.8 trillion tokens transacting at a loss, fueling discussions about its next price direction. Will PEPE Hit $0.000017 as 1.8T Tokens Move at a Loss? The Pepe Coin price has shown increased volatility as its daily on-chain transaction volume in loss reaches 1.38 trillion PEPE. This figure reflects the total amount of PEPE transacted at a loss within a single day, indicating heightened selling pressure. When large token volumes are moved at a loss, it often signals panic selling or investor capitulation. This trend can contribute to downward price momentum as more holders exit their positions to cut losses. If selling pressure eases and demand strengthens, the meme coin could regain momentum toward the $0.000017 mark. However, sustained losses without renewed buyer interest could prolong the downturn, keeping PEPE at lower price levels. Investors will closely watch market sentiment and exchange supply dynamics to assess whether a reversal is happening. Santiment Pepe Coin Eyes Major Breakout: Key Levels to Watch The price of Pepe coin is at $0.00001044, reflecting a 9.43% increase within the current trading session. The memecoin has entered a crucial phase, with a significant resistance level at $0.0000117 . If PEPE successfully flips this barrier into support , this projects a potential rally of 50% , driving prices toward $0.00001785 . The chart highlights a key price range Pepe has historically consolidated, creating a strong zone of interest for traders. A decisive breakout above $0.0000117 could trigger bullish momentum, potentially setting the stage for further gains. Conversely, if the price fails to sustain current levels and breaks below $0.00000925, downside pressure could intensify. Such a move could result in a 26% drop, dragging Pepe’s value down to $0.00000688. The composite volume profile suggests heavy accumulation within the marked range, further emphasizing the importance of these price levels. A breakout above resistance could fuel a strong uptrend, while a failure to hold support may lead to a steep correction. With the bullish seeming to be gaining trend, the crypto market has seen a slight rebound, with BTC nearing $100k. The global crypto market cap is $3.23T, a 1% surge over the past 24-hours. If the bullish trend in BTC continues, the PEPE price could surge by 50%, fueling other crypto markets. The Pepe Coin price action movement hinges on overcoming key resistance at $0.0000117. A breakout could trigger a rally to $0.000017, while failure to hold support risks a deeper correction.

However, both are also a long way from their respective all-time highs. Can they regain these highs, or will they continue to trend downwards? $ADA breakthrough or rejection? Source: TradingView $ADA is having a great Tuesday. Up 12% on the day so far, it might appear that all is rosy for one of the most passionate and vociferous communities across the whole of the cryptocurrency space. Looking at the price on the weekly chart, it can be seen that $ADA (ADA/USDT) is up against the major horizontal resistance, plus a coinciding 0.5 Fibonacci level. Should the bulls push the price through here, and the price manages to confirm above, the local high at $1.32 is a real possibility. That said, this is very strong resistance, and the price has a good probability of being rejected from here. Also, could it be that this was just a retest and confirmation of this resistance? One element in favour of the $ADA bulls is that the weekly Stochastic RSI is dropping. It should bottom in the next couple of weeks and then there is the possibility of strong upside price momentum returning. $ADA about to get rejected against $BTC? Source: TradingView The $ADA chart against $BTC (ADA/BTC) is however not one of the best. A total 92% correction from the top in 2021 has only so far reduced to 86% today. The weekly chart shows the major horizontal resistance levels. The price is up against one now, and it will be crucial that the bulls flip this level back into support. Down below is the bottom support level. The price must not fall below this. The Stochastic RSI is coming down. However, this is more likely to lend itself to a rejection of the current horizontal resistance before it is able to bottom and potentially send the price up again. The series of lower highs and lows must be broken, and soon. $KAS drops out of 15-month range Source: TradingView $KAS (KAS/USDT) followed a really nice uptrend through 2023 and into the middle of 2024, before making an all-time high of $0.20. In fact, the price sidetracked within a range from November 2023 until earlier this month, when the price dropped out. This is why the current struggle at the $0.10 horizontal level is so important. If the bulls can force the price back into the range, this will have been just a fake-out, and the price can head back to the top of the range. However, if the price is rejected from here, this could be seen as a confirmation of the breakdown, and the price could drop a lot lower quite quickly, given that there is very little support until around $0.05. The weekly Stochastic RSI is heading up, and has passed the 20.00 level, which should spell upside price momentum. Therefore, as long as these indicator lines continue upwards, the bulls should have the advantage. All is not lost. Last chance for $KAS against $BTC Source: TradingView Looking at $KAS against its $BTC pair on the daily chart (KAS/BTC), things do not bode well. A strong downward trend since the end of 2023 has yet to be broken. The Stochastic RSI is rising, but if the overhead resistance is not broken and confirmed above, a rejection from this level could spell disaster. Why hold $ADA or $KAS and not $BTC? In summary, for short-term trades, there is possibly value to be had in backing either of these two cryptocurrencies. However, looking at their long-term performance against $BTC you would have to ask the question: Why hold either and not Bitcoin? Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Despite this upward movement, they remain distant from their all-time high prices. Will they manage to reach these heights again, or will their prices continue to fall? Will $ADA Break Through or Face Rejection? Source: TradingView $ADA is having an excellent Tuesday, with a 12% increase so far, giving an optimistic outlook for one of the most enthusiastic communities in the entire cryptocurrency realm. On the weekly chart, $ADA (ADA/USDT) is facing a significant horizontal resistance, which aligns with a 0.5 Fibonacci level. If the bulls succeed in pushing the price above this point and it holds, reaching the local high of $1.32 could be within reach. However, this resistance is notably strong, and there's a good chance the price could be turned back here. Could this simply be a test to confirm this resistance level? An advantage for the $ADA bulls is that the weekly Stochastic RSI is decreasing, potentially bottoming out in the coming weeks, which could signal a return of strong upward price momentum. Is $ADA Facing Rejection Against $BTC? Source: TradingView The $ADA chart against $BTC (ADA/BTC) isn't looking particularly strong. After a steep 92% drop from its peak in 2021, the decline has only lessened to 86% today. The weekly chart highlights the major horizontal resistance levels, and the price is currently facing one. It is vital for the bulls to turn this resistance back into support. The lower level is a crucial support, and falling below it must be avoided. The Stochastic RSI is on a downward trend. This situation might lead to a rejection at the current horizontal resistance before it bottoms out and potentially drives the price upward again. Breaking the pattern of lower highs and lows is essential, and it needs to happen soon. $KAS Exits a 15-Month Range Source: TradingView $KAS (KAS/USDT) followed a strong upward trend throughout 2023 into mid-2024, culminating in a $0.20 all-time high. The price was stable within a range from November 2023 until it recently dropped out. This makes the current battle at the $0.10 horizontal level crucial. If the bulls succeed in pushing the price back into the range, this drop will be seen as a mere false breakout, allowing the price to climb back to the range's upper limit. Conversely, if the price is turned away here, it could confirm the breakdown, leading to a rapid decline with little support available until around $0.05. The weekly Stochastic RSI is on the rise and has crossed the 20.00 mark, indicating potential upward momentum. As long as these indicator lines continue to ascend, the bulls might hold the upper hand. All hope is not lost. Final Opportunity for $KAS Against $BTC Source: TradingView Examining $KAS against its $BTC pair on the daily chart (KAS/BTC), the outlook is not promising. A persistent downtrend since the end of 2023 remains unbroken. Even though the Stochastic RSI is climbing, failure to break and confirm above the overhead resistance could lead to a significant setback. Why Choose $ADA or $KAS Over $BTC? In conclusion, there might be short-term trading opportunities with these two cryptocurrencies. However, considering their long-term performance compared to $BTC, one might question: Why hold either of these instead of Bitcoin?

At this point, while Ethereum experienced one of the biggest declines in the last decline, Citi stated in its latest report that the fundamentals of Etheruem have strengthened despite the price decline, and that the picture for ETH has started to become positive. Wall Street bank Citi reported that despite Ethereum falling more than 20% this year, its fundamentals are strengthening as the total value locked (TVL) of ETH has increased sharply, Coindesk reported. Analysts, who stated that user activity has been fluctuating recently, emphasized that despite this fluctuation, US spot ETH ETFs continue to see inflows and ETH search interest has increased. Citi analysts led by Alex Saunders said: “While user activity has been volatile in recent weeks, the underlying underlying conditions are not that uncertain. Because ETF inflows and searches have increased.” Citi also noted that US President Donald Trump and his family’s DeFi project World Liberty Financial (WLFI) holds more than $200 million in ETH, which could support the US’s pro-ETH and pro-crypto policy. “The ETH holding could be seen as additional motivation to ensure that the US strengthens its support for the crypto space,” the analysts said. Citi analysts recently noted that the decline and weakness in ETH coincided with and was driven by the increase in Bitcoin (BTC) dominance, which has reached multi-year highs currently above 60%. *This is not investment advice.

With over 10,000 cryptocurrencies available, many investors are left wondering which coins are worth investing in. Therefore, popular crypto YouTuber Aaron Arnold from Altcoin Daily has shared his strategy on how he would invest $1,000 across different types of cryptocurrencies in 2025. Coin 1: $400 Investment Into Bitcoin According to Altcoin daily host Arnold, $400 of the $1,000 should go into Bitcoin (BTC). He sees Bitcoin as digital real estate and a strong hedge against inflation. With BTC trading under $100,000 at the time of his analysis, he considers this a great opportunity to accumulate before its price potentially rises further. He also points out the possibility of the U.S. government establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), which could add more demand and value to BTC in the long run. Coin 2: $100 Investment Into Ethereum For Ethereum (ETH), Arnold recommends investing $100 due to its strong position in the stablecoin and DeFi markets. Ethereum continues to dominate the crypto space as a preferred blockchain for smart contracts, making it a solid long-term hold. With most stablecoins running on Ethereum, it remains a key player in the industry, supporting its continued growth and adoption. Coin 3: $200 Solana Network Coins Arnold allocates $200 to Solana (SOL), which he calls the top blockchain of this cycle. He highlights the strong activity on the Solana network, especially with meme coins gaining popularity. However, he also mentions that investors can explore alternatives that fit the “next Solana narrative”, such as Sui (SUI) and Supra (SUPRA), which are newer but show potential. Coin 4: $100 In Artificial Intelligence As AI continues to grow, Arnold suggests investing $100 in AI tokens. His top pick is Bittensor (TAO), but he also mentions Heart.ai (HEART) as a more speculative option with high upside potential. Coin 5: $100 In Real-World Asset Token For real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Arnold recommends $100 in Ondo (ONDO), a project integrated into BlackRock’s tokenization fund, BUIDL. As an alternative, he suggests Propy (PRO) due to its focus on real estate tokenization. Coin 6: $100 In Gaming Tokens The final $100 goes to gaming tokens, an industry that continues to expand in the crypto space. Arnold picks SuperVerse (SUPER) for community gaming projects but also mentions XBorg (XBG) as a riskier bet focused on digital identity for gamers. This diversified approach aims to balance stability with potentially high returns, making it a strategy worth considering for those looking to invest in 2025.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|SOL|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-11 12:12:06

The FTX repayment plan, scheduled to start on Feb. 18, will repay creditors’ claims in full, including interests, through BitGo. However, customers will not be able to gain additional profit from current market prices for their FTX holdings, as the repayment plan will refund crypto holdings in accordance with November 2022 prices. This means that traders who held Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the now-fallen crypto exchange will only receive repayment capped at $20,000 per Bitcoin for 98% of its users, as one crypto trader highlighted in a recent post . Today, Bitcoin has bounded to at nearly five times its market price in 2022. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading hands at $97,988, rising slightly by 0.28% in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Ethereum ( ETH ) holders can breathe a sigh of relief as they stand to gain $2,500 from their holdings in FTX. Even though the price of Ethereum today stands at $2,698, a significant gap of nearly $200 from its 2022 price, the loss is not nearly as scalding as it is for Bitcoin holders. Price chart for Ethereum as of February 11, 2025 | Source: crypto.news You might also like: FTX Bahamas repayments to start on Feb. 18 Many traders on X had mixed reactions about the creditor repayments. Most of them were commenting on how the price of Ethereum has remained relatively stable throughout the past two years, while Bitcoin has skyrocketed. “They should have to pay market value at time of payout!!” said one user. “Mixed news: BTC recovery, ETH value remains stable,” said another user. As previously reported by crypto.news, reorganization plans became effective starting from Jan. 3, which required creditor repayments to proceed within 60 days after that. Court filings showed that the defunct crypto exchange has around $13 billion in payout reserves. Although that may be the case, the estate has filed to withhold half of the total amount for disputed claims. Therefore, the exact sum allocated for Bahamas creditor repayments remains unknown. The crypto giant FTX collapsed in 2022 led by founder Sam Bankman-Fried . Investigations into the platform revealed corporate mismanagement and fraud, allegedly orchestrated by Bankman-Fried. He was eventually convicted of multiple charges that led to the firm’s downfall and sentenced to 25 years behind bars.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With 2025 off to a dynamic start, Solana, Ripple, and a rising newcomer, Remittix, are shaping the future of crypto payments; here’s how they compare. Table of Contents Solana prepares for token-22 update Ripple ledger glitch concerns holders Simplifying global payments, the Remittix way Conclusion As 2025 kicks off with a bang, Solana (SOL) has seen some big price swings despite its blazing-fast transactions and technical prowess. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) has been holding its ground in the payments space despite legal battles and network hiccups. Though while these blockchain giants battle it out, a new contender in town has been stealing the spotlight: Remittix (RTX) . Dubbed by experts as the “next XRP, Remittix is rapidly gaining traction as a powerhouse in the global payments sector. With real-world utility, a strong PayFi focus and impressive growth, Remittix is shaping up to be the next big thing for savvy investors. Solana prepares for token-22 update Solana is gearing up for some big changes in 2025 with a focus on scalability and performance enhancements. The development team plans to implement sharding, allowing data to be split across multiple chains, in a bid to reduce congestion and enable parallel transaction processing. Additionally, the introduction of Token-22 aims to offer more functionality for secure payments, royalties and ownership transfers, particularly within the NFT and gaming sectors. Technical improvements aside, Solana continues to face big price changes, having lost 4% of its value in the last week despite a 5.7% net gain over the last month with several ups and downs in between. However, there has been some volatility in the broader crypto space which has likely contributed to Solana’s peaks and troughs. Ripple ledger glitch concerns holders Ripple has hit some bumps lately, with a recent 64-minute ledger outage causing a stir. While no funds were lost, it exposed some network vulnerabilities. Add that to Ripple’s legal conundrum with the SEC which has now been dragging on since 2020 and it’s no wonder investors are feeling jittery. Despite these issues, Ripple is holding its ground, trading around $2.44 with solid market activity and a $141 billion market cap. Ripple has seen a 2% gain in the last 24 hours, suggesting confidence may be coming back. The SEC case and tech glitches create uncertainty, but Ripple’s active community, strong partnerships and real-world utility keep it in the game. Investors are watching closely to see how it all plays out, with hopes of a major rebound. You might also like: Litecoin may see ETFs before Solana; Remittix tipped to disrupt payments market Simplifying global payments, the Remittix way When cryptocurrency first emerged, it promised to revolutionize how we move money. Faster transactions, lower fees and true financial freedom without the need for traditional banks. But fast forward to today and using crypto is still more complicated than it should be. Converting digital assets into cash means navigating exchanges, dealing with hidden fees and waiting days for the funds to clear. Sending money internationally? It often feels just as slow and expensive as using old-school banks. For businesses, the risks of price volatility and the complexity of managing crypto payments have been major roadblocks to adoption. That’s where Remittix comes in, offering a concrete real-world solution. Remittix allows users to instantly convert over 40 different cryptocurrencies into FIAT currencies and send funds directly to any bank account worldwide. No unnecessary delays. No surprise fees. Just a flat, transparent fee structure that ensures what users send is exactly what the recipient receives. This is crypto the way it was meant to be fast, simple and practical. Imagine Leila, a freelance web designer in Turkey earning in Bitcoin from clients across the globe. Instead of jumping through hoops with exchanges and losing money to conversion fees, she uses Remittix to convert her Bitcoin directly into Turkish Lira and has it deposited into her bank account within minutes. Or think of Samir, living in the UK, sending money to his family in India. Traditional remittance services charge high fees and take days to process. But with Remittix, he sends USDT, it’s converted instantly to Indian Rupees and his family receives the money the same day. No delays. No extra costs. No stress. In today’s financial world, privacy feels like it’s fading fast. Banks track every transaction, payment apps analyze user spending habits, and even many crypto exchanges demand intrusive personal information just to process simple transactions. Remittix is different. When you send money through Remittix, the recipient receives it as a standard bank transfer with no indication that the payment started as crypto. Non-invasive questions. No unnecessary data collection. Just users’ money, moving securely, with privacy intact. Many businesses are curious about accepting crypto, but the challenges of price volatility, complex conversions and technical hurdles hold them back. That’s exactly what the Remittix Pay API solves. Remittix makes it simple for businesses to accept crypto payments from customers while automatically converting those payments into FIAT. No more worrying about crypto price swings. No complicated systems to set up. Whether users are running an online store in Indonesia, a consulting agency in the US, or offering freelance services anywhere in the world, Remittix lets them tap into the crypto economy without headaches. Users get paid in their local currency. The customers pay in crypto. It’s that easy. Remittix’s native token, RTX, has been engineered to grow in value over time. With an intentionally capped supply of 1.5 billion tokens, scarcity is built into the ecosystem’s design. Conclusion The Remittix presale is booming, with tokens on offer for $0.0567 in the current stage. The native token has yielded more than $11.4 million in investments, having only been on the market for just a few weeks. With the project situated in a high-value market that continues to grow, analysts are expecting a steep 800% price surge before the presale concludes, with further growth expected post-launch. For anyone looking to get in on a market disruptor in its early stages, Remittix presents an unmissable opportunity. To learn more about Remittix, visit the website and its socials.

AIC’s Meteoric Rise: Could This Be the Next Big Crypto Surge? AI Companions (AIC) is on a tear. Its price shot up 24.21% in just a week and an astounding 216.77% in a month. Over the last 6 months, it skyrocketed by over 20790%. Currently priced between $0.24-$0.53, AIC is approaching a resistance level at $0.69. With a Relative Strength Index of 61.79, it’s moving towards overbought territory but still has room to grow. The Simple Moving Average over 10 days is higher than that over 100 days, indicating upward momentum. If AIC breaks its $0.69 resistance, it could aim for the $0.98 mark, offering potential gains of about 85%. Market excitement suggests AIC might continue its upward journey. FET Poised for a Rebound After Recent Dip FET is showing signs of a potential rebound. Its price currently sits within the $0.62 to $0.90 range. It recently dipped 40.77% this past month, raising anticipation among traders for a recovery as the coin moves closer to its $0.74-$0.78 average levels. The Relative Strength Index is at 55.24, suggesting room for an upward trajectory if momentum shifts. Should the price break past the $1.04 resistance, the next target could be $1.32, marking a significant boost. However, traders have to keep an eye on the $0.46 support to confirm stability. As the altcoin season possibly nears, FET holds potential for a 45% rally from its current range. Uniswap (UNI) Eyeing Strong Upside Potential as Momentum Builds Uniswap’s current price sits in a tight range, with signs of growing bullish momentum. The recent price is between $7.33 and $10.58, suggesting a steady consolidation. There’s a robust support at $5.52, with strong resistance around $12. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are nearly aligned, indicating potential volatility. The RSI near 60 is borderline bullish, and a stochastic level above 80 hints at possible overbought conditions but with growing interest. Uniswap has gained over 48% in the last 6 months despite a dip of about 33% this past month. Key resistance at $12. If surpassed, it could move towards $15, a potential rise of over 40% from current lows. Injective (INJ) Could Be Poised for a Rebound Injective’s current price hovers between $11.57 and $16.13. It recently faced a 5.996% drop over the last week. This dip positions it below both its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. The RSI of 56.61 indicates a neutral position but hints at potential growth. There’s a key resistance level at $18.52, while support sits at $9.39. If momentum builds, it could test the $18.52 mark, needing roughly a 37% increase to break this resistance. A broader market rally might even push it towards the second resistance at $23.08. As indicators balance out, the potential for a comeback strengthens amidst the turmoil. Immutable (IMX) Set For a Potential Breakout Immutable (IMX) currently trades between $0.67 and $0.92. It’s been on a downward trend over the past month, down over 34%. Yet, IMX is showing signs of balance with its RSI just below 55 and a MACD close to zero. A rise above its nearest resistance at $1.03 could open doors to $1.29, presenting an impressive upside of over 40% from current levels. If bullish momentum builds, IMX might break through these levels, riding the anticipated altcoin season wave. However, if it falls below $0.54, the momentum could weaken. Keep watch as IMX dances on the edge of a potential breakout. Conclusion Although coins like AIC, FET, UNI, and INJ may have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as a unique meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. With significant growth prospects during its presale and triple utility features, it unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers to join the battle against crypto villains.

This milestone signals a new era in Web3, where users fortify digital environments while earning rewards, and govtech and enterprises ensure data sovereignty with true post-quantum security.As cyber threats rise and quantum computing evolves, traditional cybersecurity falls short. Naoris Protocol’s Decentralized Proof of Security (dPoSec) blockchain, powered by Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and Decentralized SWARM AI, delivers a trustless, sovereign security framework. Aligned with NIST PQC , NATO NCIA , and ETSI standards , dPoSec fortifies Web3 with exponential resilience for Web2, making it fit for critical environments and decentralizing centralized spaces.Explosive Growth Within days of launching, the DePIN Testnet has rapidly scaled: 524,000 Naoris Wallets installed 210,000 Naoris Light Nodes deployed 17 Million+ Cyber-Threats neutralized 2.6 Million+ Post-Quantum ZK Transactions processed As the network stress-tests post-quantum security, dPoSec proves its ability to handle transactions at scale for any Web3 workloads — offering security in orders of magnitude beyond traditional AES/RSA-based cryptography.“Our vision is a cybersecurity framework that strengthens as it expands,” said David Carvalho, CEO & Founder of Naoris Protocol. “The overwhelming response to our DePIN Testnet confirms the demand for decentralized security solutions that eliminate single points of failure and enable collective resilience across Web2 and Web3.” Participants in the Testnet not only protect their digital environment but also actively contribute to the creation of a Decentralized Cybersecurity Mesh network, designed to secure devices, applications, APIs, and critical systems across industries including finance, defense, healthcare, enterprises, and Web3 infrastructure.Transforming Web3 Security Naoris Protocol introduces the Sub-Zero Layer, which any blockchain can integrate to validate both physical infrastructure and on-chain transactions. Two game-changing use cases: Post-Quantum Transaction Resilience: Quantum-safe upgrades for any L1/ L2 blockchain without requiring hard forks. Decentralized Trusted AI Infrastructure: ZK-enabled post-quantum verification ensures AI trustworthiness, removes single points of failure, and maintains data integrity. Real-World Use Cases Driving Adoption Naoris Protocol has developed over 30 institutional and enterprise use case applications across multiple industries on top of its Post-Quantum Cryptography and dPoSec consensus: Intellichat: A sovereign AI-powered system for private/govtech infrastructures. Decentralized Smart Surveillance: AI-driven facial recognition & behavior analysis. Post-Quantum Communications: A secure, private alternative to Slack with built-in data sovereignty. AI-Enhanced Healthcare: Real-time patient monitoring and diagnostics. Post-Quantum Banking Security: A decentralized security layer for financial institutions. IoT-Driven Asset Tracking: AI-enabled predictive maintenance for industrial systems. Smart Logistics & Fleet Management: AI-driven scheduling, route optimization, and real-time tracking. Eliminating Single Points of Failure The July 2024 CrowdStrike outage underscored the vulnerabilities of centralized cybersecurity, crippling enterprises worldwide. Naoris Protocol’s DePIN model eliminates such risks by decentralizing security and trust validation, achieving exponentially greater resilience through post-quantum security by design. “Centralized security is obsolete,” said David Holtzman, Chief Strategy Officer at Naoris Protocol. “By enabling continuous, decentralized security validation, we significantly reduce risk and restore trust in the digital world.” With the DePIN sector expected to reach $3.5 trillion by 2028, Naoris Protocol is positioning itself as the foundational security layer for Web2 and Web3 infrastructure, securing cloud computing, data storage, and IoT networks.

It has steadily traded around $0.35, up 5% this month. Factors like Elon Musk’s Department of Government Agency (D.O.G.E.), potential ETF approval, uncontrolled total supply, and general market mood have greatly influenced its price recently. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance (RXS) , a fast-growing DeFi and RWA tokenization project is selling at $0.20 in its last presale. Many expect RXS to outperform Dogecoin in the next years due to its excellent fundamentals, increasing ecosystem, and real-world utility. Here's why 2025–2030 Dogecoin Price Prediction Social media buzz and celebrity sponsorships have propelled Dogecoin's price swings from its introduction. DOGE reached its all-time high in 2021 at $0.7376 after many highs and lows. While trading 54% below that historic high, leading analysts are debating its price potential over the next five years. CoinCodex predicts DOGE will climb 318.71% to $1.364 by April 2025. Changelly recommends a cautious price range of $0.1897 to $0.2348. The 2026 forecasts differ greatly. CoinGape puts Dogecoin at $0.245, while CoinCodex predicts speculative trading between $0.2818 and $0.4688. By 2027, Dogecoin is anticipated to rise 46.94% to $0.360. Changelly anticipates DOGE increasing 42.78% to $0.514 by 2028. Changelly forecasts Dogecoin may reach $0.732 by 2029 , a 42.41% year-over-year gain. The major question is: Will Dogecoin flip the $1.00 resistance to support by 2030? DOGE may hold at $0.8944, according to CoinCodex, while CoinPedia predicts a record $3.035. With its unbounded supply and inflationary nature, Dogecoin struggles to maintain value appreciation. Analysts expect Dogecoin to develop slowly, but its lack of real-world utility and strong reliance on community excitement may restrict its potential. Alternative projects like Rexas Finance (RXS) attract investors seeking diverse investments in the RWA niche and sustained growth. Rexas Finance Set to Outrun Dogecoin Sooner Than Expected Rexas Finance's (RXS) real-world asset (RWA) tokenization strategy is more realistic than Dogecoin's meme-driven speculation, making it a crypto contender. Unlike DOGE, which has a limitless supply, Rexas Finance uses a deflationary token strategy to maintain value. Essentially, Rexas Finance lets users tokenize real-world assets like real estate, commodities, and artworks into blockchain-based digital assets. This makes fractional ownership easy for investors to buy and sell high-value assets. For example, a $10 million property can be divided into smaller tokenized shares, allowing worldwide investors to participate more readily. Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale One of Rexas Finance's primary strengths is its fair token distribution approach. Unlike Dogecoin, which has highly concentrated institutional holdings, Rexas Finance avoided VC funding in favor of a public presale strategy. This strategy prevents the big token dumps that frequently cause price drops in VC-backed enterprises. What is the result? Rexas Finance's presale success has been nothing short of exceptional. In its 12th and final presale round, each RXS token is valued at $0.20, a 600% increase over its initial price of $0.03. The initiative raised an astonishing $44.5 million by selling 442 million RXS tokens. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance is more than just tokenization; it has created a full ecosystem of blockchain-powered financial solutions. It distinguishes itself with several significant features: Token Builder: Allows users to generate custom tokens without coding knowledge. QuickMint Bot: Create tokens instantly over Telegram and Discord. Gen AI: Creates NFTs and other artworks within seconds. Rexas AI Shield: Monitors smart contracts on the platform and protects against breaches. Rexas Launchpad: Assisted new projects in raising cash and launching coins. DeFi Services: Introduces yield farming, staking, and liquidity pools for passive income. These features establish Rexas Finance as a true DeFi powerhouse, appealing to both individual and institutional investors. Aside from its technology, Rexas Finance is making waves for its $1 million giveaway. The top 20 entrants will each receive $50,000 in RXS. This campaign has resulted in significant community engagement, attracting new investors to the project. RXS's impending exchange listings are also a major driver of its growth. After the presale, RXS will be listed on at least three of the top ten worldwide exchanges, with a starting price of $0.25. Analysts anticipate that RXS will rise parabolically to $10 once it receives mainstream exchange exposure within the first year. The coin is expected to rise steadily throughout the year, with a potential 100x growth by 2030, outperforming Dogecoin. This makes Rexas Finance a must-have crypto ahead of its official debut. Conclusion Dogecoin is a speculative investment due to its inflationary nature and lack of real-world utility, notwithstanding its meme popularity. Although price predictions imply moderate growth, hype remains a risk. In contrast, Rexas Finance relies on real-world asset tokenization, DeFi services, and deflationary economics. Due to strong presale momentum, a burgeoning community, and anticipated exchange listings, RXS could beat Dogecoin sooner than expected. Investors seeking sustainable gains can join Rexas Finance before its June 19, 2025 launch.

40195243,https://nulltx.com/?p=144498,1739281199,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,XRP News Today: SEC Shakeup Could Propel XRP To $10 As Ripple Case Takes A Turn,https://nulltx.com/xrp-news-today-sec-shakeup-could-propel-xrp-to-10-as-ripple-case-takes-a-turn-2/,"The SEC’s legal battle with Ripple is heating up, and a major shakeup could change everything for XRP – a topic we’ll analyze further below. At the same time, Bitcoin still struggles as a practical payment method, but PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might be able to fix that with a hybrid L2 solution. Let’s look at the deets for both projects. XRP Price Prediction: Could a Major SEC Shakeup Push XRP Toward the $10 Mark? XRP is currently trading at around $2.41, down 0.21% in the last 24 hours. During this time, its trading volume has reached approximately $3.33 billion. A nonprofit watchdog, Empower Oversight, has filed a lawsuit demanding the release of an internal SEC report related to potential conflicts of interest. The focus is on former SEC official William Hinman, who had ties to Simpson Thacher, a firm connected to the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. Critics argue that Hinman’s association may have influenced the SEC’s approach to crypto regulation, which raises concerns about bias in the case against Ripple. If this lawsuit uncovers damaging information, it could put the SEC in a difficult position and potentially force it to reconsider its appeal against Ripple. Hugo , a crypto analyst on X, believes XRP has confirmed a breakout and expects it to surge significantly once the bull run resumes, with a minimum target of $10. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Is a Hybrid Layer-2 Upgrade That Could Finally Make Bitcoin a Fast, Affordable, and Everyday Payment Solution Bitcoin is one of the most valuable digital assets, but using it for everyday transactions isn’t easy. Many businesses don’t accept it, and since transactions can’t be reversed, handling refunds and disputes is a hassle. These challenges have kept Bitcoin from becoming a practical payment option. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) has a strong potential to change that. As a Layer-2 solution, it could speed up transactions and lower costs. Instead of Bitcoin’s standard 10 minute block time, PlutoChain offers a block time of just two seconds on its Layer-2 network. By working alongside it, this could make Bitcoin much more convenient for everyday purchases. Lower fees are another major plus. By cutting costs, PlutoChain could help Bitcoin function as a real payment system, which might make it easier for businesses and individuals to use BTC without worrying about high transaction fees. But PlutoChain does more than just improve speed and affordability. With Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, it could connect Bitcoin to DeFi apps, NFT marketplaces, and AI-powered blockchain projects. This could create new ways to use BTC beyond simply holding it as a store of value. Security is also a top priority. PlutoChain has been audited by SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . The network undergoes regular code reviews and stress tests to make sure its system is safe and reliable. During its testnet phase, PlutoChain successfully processed over 43,200 transactions in a single day, which demonstrates it can scale efficiently. Unlike Bitcoin, where miners and developers control upgrades, PlutoChain puts decision-making in the hands of users. It allows the community to propose and vote on network changes and could make Bitcoin more decentralized, transparent, and adaptable. The Takeaway With the SEC facing legal pressure, XRP’s case could take a major turn and even lead to greater adoption. Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might be an interesting project to watch in the coming weeks. Its Layer-2 solution could finally make Bitcoin practical for everyday use by offering faster transactions, lower fees, and DeFi integration. ——– Remember, this article is not financial or trading advice.

Nevertheless, many are also exploring newer altcoins that may offer higher growth potential. One standout project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing that’s carving out a niche in the DeFi arena. With a presale price of just $0.01 and forecasts indicating a potential 50x rally after launch, some analysts believe Mutuum Finance could emerge as a top-performing altcoin by 2025. As ETH holds the line at $2,500, eyes are shifting to MUTM as a prime opportunity for robust returns. Ethereum (ETH) Maintains Momentum Ethereum (ETH) remains anchored around $2,500, showing resilience amid market fluctuations. Buyers have consistently intervened to prevent larger drops, leading analysts to compare ETH’s current price patterns to past market troughs—a sign that a recovery might be on the horizon. Institutional demand has largely held steady, as inflows into Ethereum-based investment tools continue despite recent market unease. Still, short-term volatility concerns persist. Some speculate ETH could briefly slip below $2,500 before rebounding. Activity in the options market points to a mix of caution and bullish anticipation over the coming months. While Ethereum’s fundamental outlook remains upbeat, its near-term price movements will likely mirror broader market sentiment and overall risk appetite among investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Emerges as a DeFi Contender Standing out in the search for undervalued yet high-potential altcoins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a decentralized lending and borrowing platform designed for real-world utility. Through both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) markets, users can earn by supplying assets or borrow against their crypto collateral, offering a wide range of flexibility and efficiency. Now in its first presale phase, MUTM is priced at $0.01—its most accessible tier before incremental price hikes lead to a $0.06 launch value. Over 7 million tokens have already sold, reflecting surging demand from investors eager to secure tokens ahead of later stages. Analysts are forecasting a possible 50x jump in MUTM’s price, meaning an early $500 stake could theoretically evolve into $25,000 once the token goes live. DeFi Innovations and Tokenomics Mutuum Finance is underpinned by a strong tokenomics structure designed to drive sustained growth. Of the total token supply, 1.82 billion are reserved for the presale, granting early backers an opportunity to come in before demand lifts the price. A built-in buy-and-distribute approach further underpins price stability; fees gathered from the lending and borrowing platform are allocated to buy MUTM in the open market, with those tokens subsequently sent to mtToken stakers. This mechanism steadily reduces supply, creating continual buy pressure and bolstering the token’s market value. Users can deposit crypto assets to liquidity pools and receive mtTokens that earn interest over time, while borrowers put up collateral rather than liquidating their holdings. For example, a holder with 6 BNB could borrow up to $2,500 worth of other digital assets at a 75% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, thereby preserving exposure to BNB’s price potential while accessing funds. Mutuum Finance also plans to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum network, aiming to raise both liquidity and confidence in the project’s DeFi ecosystem. Ultimately, Mutuum Finance’s roadmap and utility-focused design could pave the way for listings on reputable exchanges after the official launch. Greater visibility on leading trading platforms, paired with the ongoing buy-and-distribute mechanism, would likely fuel additional demand and sustain upward momentum for MUTM’s price. With its presale underway at $0.01, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already caught the attention of investors seeking substantial upside. Analysts project a 50x rally, supported by a reliable DeFi platform, transparent tokenomics, and a structured approach to scaling. While Ethereum (ETH) maintains a strong foothold near $2,500, those searching for more dramatic gains are increasingly turning to MUTM. For individuals looking to invest in innovative projects with the potential for exponential growth, Mutuum Finance is fast becoming a focal point in the altcoin market.

In a recent report, Santiment revealed that discussions surrounding top layer-1 blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, Toncoin, and Cardano, now account for 44.2% of social media conversations about specific cryptocurrencies. In contrast, the six leading memecoins combined garner a mere 4% of the chatter. Layer-1 Altcoins Dominate Memecoins The shift suggests a renewed focus on foundational blockchain technologies, which are critical for long-term growth and real-world adoption. “Increased attention on these assets usually indicates a more mature and informed approach by the community,” Santiment noted, highlighting that these networks support smart contracts, decentralized applications, and scalable solutions essential to the crypto ecosystem. Memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe have experienced a sharp decline in social media buzz. The report speculated that recent market volatility may have dampened enthusiasm for these assets, which historically represent phases where traders chase quick profits before inevitable corrections. Long-Term Confidence Meanwhile, Santiment reported that 224,410 Ether, valued at approximately $600 million, was withdrawn from major exchanges between February 8 and February 9. This marked the largest single-day outflow in nearly two years. Such withdrawals typically indicate a shift toward long-term holding, as investors remove assets from exchanges to safeguard them in private wallets. Santiment characterized this development as a “strong sign” for Ethereum’s price resilience, despite recent struggles. “It signals long-term confidence by investors,” the platform emphasized. Meanwhile, on February 10, an inactive wallet holding 14,000 Bitcoin, untouched for seven to 10 years, suddenly became active, moving funds without transferring them to any exchanges. Crypto Dan, a contributor to analytics platform CryptoQuant, noted that while such movements may trigger concern, they do not necessarily signal impending sell-offs. “In the past, similar events didn’t always result in price declines,” he said. Memecoin activity surged following the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin , with Pump.fun reaching a record $3.3 billion in weekly trading volume.

This exposure may help PEPE build momentum and challenge established meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is developing an innovative Layer-2 solution that could unlock new possibilities for Bitcoin. By introducing smart contracts and enhancing transaction speeds, PlutoChain might expand Bitcoin’s utility beyond just being a store of value. Let’s check out the details. Pepe Coin Price Prediction: Could PEPE Outperform DOGE and SHIB as It’s Getting Listed on Big Japanese Crypto Exchange Pepe Coin (PEPE) has taken a big step forward with its recent listing on Bitflyer, one of Japan’s leading crypto exchanges. This move places PEPE in front of a broader audience of Japanese traders, which could boost its visibility and adoption. The exchange confirmed the listing in an announcement on X , highlighting PEPE’s status as the fourth-largest meme coin by market cap. This listing follows Binance Japan’s decision to add PEPE to its platform, which shows the token’s rising popularity in the region. More exchange listings often lead to increased trading volume and investor interest, which could push PEPE’s price higher. Given the growing demand in Japan and expanding global exposure, PEPE might be in a position to outperform its rivals. Analyst @CryptoELlTES , predicts that the momentum of PEPE is building and that it could go up as much as 8x. Can PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Technology Bring a New Era for Bitcoin in 2025? PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is working on a Layer-2 solution that could enhance Bitcoin’s capabilities, potentially addressing areas where it lags behind networks like Ethereum and Solana. With the introduction of features such as smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), PlutoChain may help Bitcoin evolve beyond its role as a store of value. Designed for speed, PlutoChain could process transactions in just two seconds, significantly faster than Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time. Another advantage is its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility , which could enable PlutoChain to integrate seamlessly with Ethereum’s ecosystem. This might open up opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and AI-driven applications. Early testnet results indicate it could handle over 43,200 transactions per day, a strong indicator of potential scalability. One aspect that sets PlutoChain apart is its governance model. Rather than relying on a single authority, decision-making is decentralized, potentially allowing the community to play a role in shaping the network’s future. Security remains a priority, with PlutoChain undergoing audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi to ensure reliability. If PlutoChain successfully implements its platform, it could help Bitcoin expand beyond simple transactions and become a powerful platform for decentralized applications. Bottom Line Pepe Coin’s listing on major Japanese exchanges shows increasing demand for the meme project, potentially positioning it for gains against Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.

While other countries besides the USA started to investigate the BTC reserve, one country made the opposite statement. Accordingly, the President of the National Bank of Poland (NBP), Adam Glapiński, announced that the bank does not intend to keep Bitcoin reserves under any circumstances and will not purchase Bitcoin under any circumstances. Glapiński said at a conference that for an asset to be considered for the NBP to add it to its reserves, it must be “absolutely safe”. When asked whether the NBP was considering holding reserves in Bitcoin, Glapiński replied: “The head of the Czech National Bank told me that he had an idea about Bitcoin, that is, an original idea. At first, I said no. Because the Polish Central Bank is definitely not considering Bitcoin reserves. Because we believe that reserves should be absolutely safe. There are many good things to say about Bitcoin, but not all of them are good things that provide a permanent, secure reserve. I don't need to tell you how much Bitcoin has increased, how much it is worth, but this is not a certainty. Everyone takes the risk of buying it. You can buy Bitcoin and make a lot of money, or lose a lot. But we prefer something more certain and secure. “We accumulate gold, dollars and euros, and also marginally other elements. In our opinion, these are very safe.” *This is not investment advice.

But the reality? Using crypto for everyday transactions is way too hard. Changing crypto to cash involves exchanges, hidden fees and long wait times. Sending money internationally? Often just as slow and expensive as using a traditional remittance service. And for businesses, the volatility of crypto prices and complex settlement processes have kept many from fully embracing digital payments. That’s exactly where Remittix (RTX) comes in. It’s not just another crypto project promising the moon it’s a real solution designed to make crypto practical and easy to use. With Remittix, you can instantly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT currencies and send funds directly to any bank account around the world. No delays. There are no hidden fees. Just a flat, transparent rate that ensures what you send is exactly what the recipient receives. Picture Liam, a remote worker in Kenya who earns in Bitcoin from international clients. Instead of wasting time on exchanges and losing money to conversion fees, he uses Remittix to convert his Bitcoin directly into Kenyan Shillings, deposited into his bank account within minutes. Why Remittix Is Perfect for Businesses Crypto adoption is growing, but businesses often hesitate because of the complexities of crypto payment volatility, conversions, and compliance issues. That’s where the Remittix Pay API comes in. Remittix allows businesses to accept crypto payments from customers while automatically converting those payments into FIAT. This means companies can tap into the crypto economy without worrying about price swings or dealing with complicated systems. Whether you’re an online store in Thailand, a freelancer in Italy, or a digital agency in Canada, Remittix makes it simple to accept crypto and get paid directly in your local currency. No complicated setups. No crypto expertise is needed. Setting a New Standard for Privacy Another core focus of Remittix (RTX) is privacy. In today’s world, this can be hard to come by. Banks track every transaction. Payment apps collect your data. Even many crypto exchanges require detailed personal information just to move your own money. With Remittix, privacy comes without any compromises. When you send money, the recipient receives it as a regular bank transfer with no indication that the transaction originated from crypto. No invasive forms. No unnecessary data collection. Just your money, moving securely and privately, without leaving a digital footprint for others to analyze. It’s not about hiding dodgy dealings – it is about maintaining control over your own finances. Remittix gives you that control. The Remittix (RTX) Presale Booms The Remittix (RTX) presale has surpassed $11.5 million in its first few weeks and continues to gain traction among investors, businesses, and individuals, casting a wide net due to its broad utility. Tokens are available to early investors for just $0.0567 in the current stage, and analysts expect a steep 800% price rise during the presale, with further growth post-launch. For anyone who wants to be a part of the future of PayFi, Remittix (RTX) is simply impossible to ignore.

You Should Not Miss This Presale!,https://nulltx.com/crypto-news-could-panshibi-shibi-rise-to-top-100-status-you-should-not-miss-this-presale/,"The meme coin market surged by over 500% in 2024, pushing to a total value of $115 billion and meme coins now make up 10% of the entire crypto market. Entering the market recently makes Panshibi ($SHIBI) a serious contender for the title of the next big crypto. Some are calling it the next 100x token, and with its presale momentum, they are seemingly correct. In crypto, timing is everything and Panshibi seems to be hitting the market at just the right moment. Hype alone isn’t enough to sustain a project but $SHIBI’s growing community and strong early demand suggest it has real staying power. With the market primed for another wave of explosive growth, this presale could be a rare opportunity. Why Panshibi’s Presale Could Be Your Opportunity to be a Part of the Next 100x Token Panshibi ($SHIBI) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about presales in the crypto space, with experts calling it the biggest Asian-inspired meme coin to date. With a clear roadmap and $720,000 raised out of its $10 million target, SHIBI is already gaining serious momentum. Investors are eager to secure their share before the price jumps higher than its current price of $0.004 which represents a 100% rise from its initial presale price. If there’s ever been a chance to own a part of the next 100x token, this could be it. A major reason behind the hype is Panshibi’s solid tokenomics. Sixty percent of the total supply—1.2 billion tokens—is allocated to the presale, giving early investors a prime opportunity to maximize gains. The smart contract has been fully audited by blockchain security firm Coinsult, reinforcing trust in the project. With each presale stage, the token price climbs higher, making early entry even more valuable. Once the presale ends, Panshibi will launch on Uniswap DEX and multiple CEXs, setting the stage for massive exposure. Analysts predict a post-launch price surge of 145,000%, which could cement $SHIBI’s position as the next 100x token. With demand skyrocketing and limited time to buy in, those who act fast could secure a game-changing opportunity before SHIBI takes off. What Sets Panshibi Apart? A Closer Look at Its Potential Panshibi isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. By merging three massive communities—Asia, pandas and meme coin enthusiasts—this project has created a unique identity in the crypto space. Inspired by the beloved panda, Panshibi integrates Social and AI-driven competitions, allowing token holders to participate in quests, earn rewards and unlock exclusive prizes. This dynamic ecosystem is why many believe $SHIBI has what it takes to become the next 100x token. Beyond the hype, Panshibi offers real utility. Its native token, $SHIBI, isn’t just for trading—it powers governance, high-yield staking (up to 1,200% APY) and VIP membership perks. Early presale investors gain instant access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Members Club, positioning them at the forefront of this rapidly growing ecosystem. With full ownership of the token being transferred to the community post-presale, decentralization remains a core principle. To further boost investor confidence, Panshibi has locked its liquidity pool for 10 years, while team tokens remain locked for two. These measures add an extra layer of security and trust, making $SHIBI one of the most well-structured meme coin projects to date. If you’re looking for the next 100x token with both hype and substance, Panshibi is your stop! Get In Early Before Panshibi Takes Off! Opportunities like this don’t come around often. Panshibi is gaining serious traction and with every presale stage, the price climbs higher. Early investors stand to benefit the most before $SHIBI makes its big debut on major exchanges. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement with real potential. Strong tokenomics, a dedicated community and a presale designed for massive growth make $SHIBI a contender for the next 100x token. Time is running out. Join the presale now before the window closes!

40195380,https://nulltx.com/?p=144511,1739281428,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Racing To The Top 1Fuel Sets Off On Journey To Toncoin & Tron But Could This Be The Best Horse In The Pack?,https://nulltx.com/racing-to-the-top-1fuel-sets-off-on-journey-to-toncoin-tron-but-could-this-be-the-best-horse-in-the-pack/,"Some crypto investors believe a project should prioritize a particular offering to succeed, while others believe a project should be versatile. Toncoin and Tron are two prominent crypto projects that can do a lot, but both have a specific use case they are more known for. Let’s compare them to the more specialized 1FUEL and learn why this exchange could surpass their price gains. Toncoin (TON): An enduring transaction privacy defender Toncoin is a multipurpose blockchain that is primarily known for its privacy features. These include confidential transactions, ring signatures, stealth addresses and CoinJoin. However, governments worldwide soon made it clear that they don’t like privacy-oriented coins. Accordingly, the Toncoin team tried to be known for more than privacy. Toncoin has since delivered a decentralized file storage system and integrated with Telegram, Donate, and other platforms as a payment medium. Toncoin has also ventured into the memecoin world with a project tied to Notcoin. The Toncoin team has also advanced in sharding, which makes every dApp atop this blockchain much faster. TRON (TRX): A party starter in the blockchain world TRON is another multi-use blockchain that has slowly become more known for a specific use case – entertainment. TRON has been working on ways for content creators to monetize their work without losing money to intermediaries. However, the TRON ecosystem has tried to maintain a foothold in other use cases with innovations like WinkLink, an oracle for safely feeding dApps with real-world data. TRON also offers exchange services via SunSwap, lending services through JustStable and JustLend DAO and a wallet to harmonize everything. These two projects show that it’s not about “single use case” being better than “multiple use cases” or vice versa. Instead, it’s about being clear about which path you’re taking. If you focus on a specific use case, users might expect that same quality of user experience elsewhere, yet you aren’t able to deliver. This could lead to a scenario where your less prioritized use cases stagnate and resources spent on those dApps end up wasted or with a very poor return on investment. 1FUEL (OFT): An emerging DEX reimagination 1FUEL has made it clear from the start that the focus will be on exchange services, with all other offerings geared towards enhancing that experience. This project will offer a wallet just like the projects above have done to converge token holdings and streamline dApp access. 1FUEL will also offer AI-powered features so traders can leave strategizing and emergency responses to intelligent bots while earning more profits. Remember, they’ll be able to trade across chains, which broadens the data pool, enabling the AI to learn more about various markets and apply it in optimizing portfolio allocations. 1FUEL will back this up with built-in mixing capabilities, enabling users to conceal their transaction paths. This will be complemented by military-grade cold storage to keep inactive coins in secure offline locations. Lastly, 1FUEL will offer a crypto debit card for spending your crypto wherever ordinary bank cards work. Why you should join the 1FUEL presale The 1FUEL presale is in stage four with the price at $0.018 per token. Judging from the pace at which stage three was completed, the current sale might not last long. With the price already increasing, you should be locking in a low entry point to maximize unrealized profits. Conclusion: Will 1FUEL outcompete Toncoin and TRON? Toncoin and TRON ecosystem dApps will gain more users from their primary offers around privacy and entertainment, respectively. However, they might face stiff competition from other smart contract platforms for use cases like DeFi and NFTs. This is why you should consider 1FUEL, which already has a focused path.

While PEPE thrives in the meme coin space, XRP remains a major player in cross-border payments, and Cardano continues to innovate with its smart contract capabilities. However, Lightchain AI is gaining the most traction with its blockchain and AI integration. The Lightchain AI Presale has already raised over $15.4 million at a presale price of $0.006, positioning it as one of the most promising cryptos of 2025. Pepe Coin, XRP, Cardano, and Lightchain AI- Top Picks for February In February 2025, investors are gravitating towards cryptocurrencies with robust fundamentals and innovative applications, viewing them as more prudent investments compared to Dogecoin. Pepe Coin (PEPE) has garnered attention for its community-driven approach and unique tokenomics, aiming to establish a sustainable ecosystem beyond its meme origins. Ripple's XRP continues to attract interest due to its established role in facilitating efficient cross-border payments, with recent developments enhancing its utility in the financial sector. Cardano (ADA) is recognized for its research-driven methodology, focusing on scalability and security through a layered architecture, making it a strong contender in the smart contract platform arena. Lightchain AI is emerging as a promising project by integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, aiming to optimize decentralized applications and offering potential for significant growth. These tokens present compelling alternatives for investors seeking assets with tangible use cases and growth potential. Why Lightchain AI is Stronger Investment Than Dogecoin Lightchain AI presents a more sustainable and scalable investment opportunity compared to Dogecoin, which lacks long-term utility. By implementing sharding and Layer 2 solutions, Lightchain AI ensures high-speed, low-cost transactions, making it efficient for large-scale adoption. Additionally, Lightchain AI fosters a growing ecosystem of decentralized AI applications (dApps), providing real-world utility beyond simple transactions. This ecosystem supports AI-driven smart contracts, data processing, and decentralized governance, giving it long-term value. Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives on speculation, Lightchain AI’s scalability and sustainability-focused innovations position it as a high-potential investment in the evolving AI-blockchain space. Jump In Now for Big Gains with Lightchain AI Presale Lightchain AI is already making waves, raking in over $15.4 million in presale with tokens priced at just $0.006. Translation? This could be your ticket to significant growth when it launches. Why wait on the sidelines? Snag your spot in the Lightchain AI presale and get in early—you know what they say, early birds get the fattest crypto worms. Don’t leave February to chance. Do your homework, crunch the numbers, and consider adding Lightchain AI to your portfolio for a smarter, sharper crypto game plan.

40196093,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=672445,1739281524,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40196093.jpeg,"Binance liquidated its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves in February, locking gains in USDC",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-liquidate-btc-reserve-lock-gain-usdc/,"On-chain data shows that Binance liquidated some of the Bitcoin (BTC) reserves it accrued through fees and activities. The exchange retains all user balances in hot wallets and cold storage, though the exchange’s reserves have also diminished. Binance is taking profits from its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves, accrued through fees and trading activities. It started January with a balance of 46,896 BTC, and liquidated more than 94% of the holdings to end up with 2,747 BTC. The exchange also converted a large part of its ETH and SOL holdings into USDC, though it has retained most of its BNB, only selling 16% of the holdings. Binance’s corporate reserves are not reported as a separate category. Instead, they make up a part of the excess reserves and are tied to customer funds. The corporate reserves and excess crypto do not take into account any cash, cash-like assets or small-scale holdings outside the scope of the proof of reserves. Binance now holds the smallest amount of excess corporate reserves in two years. The exact allocation of the assets remains unknown, as the funds may be held in other wallets, reinvested, or reallocated in another way. Binance has not commented on the allocation, or on using the funds to pay outstanding fines or other claims. Binance reveals new proof of reserves The recent liquidations and wallet reorganization followed the latest data for Binance’s proof of reserves. Most notably, the exchange is now 100.45% liquid for BTC reserves, while at one point the reserves reached a much larger excess margin of 108%. Some of the additional BTC earned through activity has moved. In early 2025, Binance held a total of 622,192 BTC across custodial services and hot wallets. In February, the reserves declined to 618,653 BTC, of which customer net balances made up 615,816 BTC. The mix of sales and increased user liabilities led to the current lower reserve ratio. Most of the assets held by Binance have almost no excess reserves. The only outlier is USDC, where the exchange holds reserves in excess of 141% compared to user claims. USDC is becoming more widely adopted as a transparent and regulated token, allowing seamless usage in the Euro area. The stablecoin may see a bigger demand as European brokerages are becoming more restrictive of USDT usage . The data on Binance’s reported personal or excess holdings are based on subtracting user balances from the total available balances. Technically, the exchange only has liabilities for 100% of the user balances, though the exchange holds crypto in excess. The most recent data shows an outflow for almost all assets, though in some cases Binance moves funds to new wallets and does not immediately reveal its new holdings. The exchange started to share its proof of reserves as a way to reassure customers after the FTX collapse led to revelations that user funds were mixed and used without oversight. Binance’s moves may shift market sentiment The latest data from the proof of reserves shows that Binance was probably selling some of the excess assets at the peak of the market. In total, the exchange sold an estimated $8B out of its $14B in excess assets. The significant selling in January led to suggestions that Binance itself was partially responsible for the market weakness, especially for Ethereum. While the exchange has promised to publish its reserves data every month, it has no fixed duty to sustain a certain level of excess. The recent shift from BTC and blue chip holdings into stablecoins has led to suggestions that the world’s largest crypto exchange is selling at the top, with the intention of re-buying at a lower price. The selling arrives at a time when the market is unwinding the enthusiasm from the late 2024 bull market, showing a mix of reallocation and buying BTC at lower prices. Binance’s holdings also reflect the shift of users and traders in terms of tokens on several top chains. It increased its token holdings on BNB Smart Chain while retaining a high level of Ethereum-based assets. Binance’s token balances shifted, reflecting investor sentiment, as traders moved away from Polygon, Arbitrum and other smaller chains. | Source: Dune Analytics Some chains saw significant outflows, as in the case of Arbitrum. Binance now holds negligible amounts of Arbitrum-based tokens. Not all funds on Binance are part of the proof of reserves. The exchange only covers on-chain data for 34 assets with major holdings.

Experts often consider meme coins to be one of the primary market sectors that are demonstrating explosive crypto market price increases. However, as Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE struggle with declining interest and price drops, experts think a new contender, DTX Exchange, could be the next big thing. Experts believe that with its innovative hybrid trading platform, DTX Exchange will offer a unique opportunity for retail and institutional traders alike. With the presale already raising over $13.6 million, insiders consider DTX a top crypto to invest in for 2025, especially as the broader growth of the AI sector aligns with its platform's capabilities. Dogecoin Faces Declining Interest Among Traders DOGE failed to sustain its popularity after becoming a meme coin favorite. Market data reveals the current Dogecoin value stays at approximately $0.25 but has experienced a 24% decrease during the previous month. Whale activity related to DOGE, a key driver of price rallies, has plummeted, with $100K+ transactions dropping from 20,200 to 6,200 per week. This sharp reduction in whale transactions has left DOGE struggling to regain bullish momentum, with analysts noting that such decreased activity often correlates with prolonged price stagnation in meme-driven assets. Crypto enthusiasts believe this signals reduced confidence among large holders, as the Dogecoin (DOGE) trading volume fell 10% in the same period. While some predict a potential rebound to $4 if historical patterns repeat, skepticism grows due to its reliance on social media trends rather than utility. This decline in its appeal has traders exploring alternatives with stronger fundamentals. PEPE Experiences a Downtrend While Utility Altcoins Rise PEPE, another popular meme coin, faces similar challenges. Its price has dropped 46% in 30 days to $0.000009, with a market cap under $4 billion. Technical indicators like the looming Death Cross—a bearish signal where the 200-day EMA crosses above the 50-day EMA—suggest further declines. The coin’s MVRV ratio, now at -29%, hints at possible accumulation phases, but many investors remain wary of its speculative nature. While this is happening, projects offering real-world applications, such as decentralized trading platforms and AI-driven tools, are gaining traction. Industry experts note that tokens with clear use cases, like hybrid exchanges, are attracting capital once tied to meme coins like PEPE. DTX Exchange Gains Momentum as Memecoin Investors Shift Focus As interest in DOGE and PEPE wanes, DTX Exchange emerges as a standout utility altcoin. Currently, in its public presale phase, it has raised over $13.5 million, with tokens priced at $0.16—a 700% surge from its initial offering. The platform combines decentralized security with centralized efficiency, allowing users to trade over 120,000 assets, including stocks, forex, and cryptocurrencies, without KYC requirements. Analysts highlight features like 1,000x leverage and institutional-grade liquidity as key advantages over meme coins. While Dogecoin (DOGE) faces regulatory uncertainty and PEPE’s unpredictability deters risk-averse traders, DTX’s hybrid model positions it as a top crypto to invest in for 2025. Experts think its upcoming exchange launch in Q2 could drive further growth, especially with limited token supply and staking rewards up to 33% APY. With projections of 20x gains post-listing, many consider DTX the best new crypto for those seeking stability amid meme coin turbulence. As markets evolve, the shift from Dogecoin (DOGE) and PEPE to utility-driven projects like DTX Exchange underscores a broader trend: investors increasingly prioritize platforms offering tangible solutions over speculative hype. Conclusion As traders seek alternatives to Dogecoin’s volatility and PEPE’s uncertain outlook, utility-focused projects are drawing fresh attention. Analysts believe early opportunities in hybrid trading platforms could redefine market dynamics, offering tools like high leverage and diverse asset access. With presale momentum building and features designed for both retail and institutional users, this shift suggests a new chapter for crypto investments. Interested in learning more?

However, the crypto market is notoriously unstable, and competition is intensifying. Following a 3.10% decline in the last day, ETH is currently valued at $2,699.75. Traders are pondering how long Ethereum can continue to dominate XRP. Market trends suggest that ETH might recover past $2,700 and soar to $3,500 before the conclusion of 2025. Nonetheless, new entrants such as Rexas Finance (RXS) are emerging in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, posing an even greater challenge to both ETH and XRP.

Analysts predict that ETH's value could climb to $3,500 by 2025, driven by increasing acceptance and a focus on cross-border transactions by institutions. Despite facing legal hurdles, XRP continues to have strong institutional support, and its adoption in the financial sector is on the rise. However, more significant shifts are on the horizon as Ethereum-based real-world asset (RWA) cryptocurrencies gain traction. A notable project, Rexas Finance (RXS), has surged 580% over the past 90 days, indicating a potential market shift that might surpass both ETH and XRP by 2025.

The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation — simply known as MiCA — is a set of rules designed to regulate the crypto market across E.U. member states. For example, it requires crypto businesses to get licenses to operate throughout the E.U., sets up rules to protect consumers, and lays out how stablecoins should be issued. MiCA also brings in requirements for capital, anti-money laundering, and transparency. In short: crypto firms now have to meet standards similar to those of traditional financial institutions. The idea is to bring more legal clarity and consumer protection while promoting innovation in the crypto space. However, some worry that the regulation brings more trouble than good. For context, Tether chief executive Paolo Ardoino earlier alarmed that MiCA’s regulatory move puts banking systems and the use of stablecoins in the European bloc at a “systemic risk” as the law now requires stablecoin issuers in Europe to keep at least 60% of their reserves in Europe-based bank accounts. Crypto.news sat down with Bitstamp US CEO Bobby Zagotta to discuss the implications of the regulations for the crypto industry, how it will affect exchanges like Bitstamp, and whether the regulation could push more retail investors toward decentralized finance platforms. CN: Some stablecoin giants worry that MiCA brings more trouble than good. Tether’s ( USDT ) and PayPal’s ( PYUSD ) will no longer be available for Bitstamp’s European clients. Don’t you think these limitations might push retail investors toward DeFi, where regulatory scrutiny isn’t as tight? BZ: No, we welcome MiCA and the clarity it will bring to the market. Bitstamp offers stablecoins in Europe that retail investors can transact with, which allows customers to move funds quickly and at a low cost. We also have USD Coin ( USDC ), Euro Coin ( EURC ) and EUR CoinVertible ( EUR CV) , to name a few MiCA-compliant stablecoins. Bitstamp provides retail investors with assets from the longest-running, most trusted, and regulated exchange in the world. MiCA provides clarity for the exchanges and investors themselves, making the market run more efficiently and we will continue to work proactively with Europe’s regulators. CN: Do you expect the U.S. to follow Europe with a MiCA-like framework, or do you see the American market taking a different approach? BZ: My hope is that the current U.S. administration prioritizes this topic in order to provide the American crypto market with the same, much needed, regulatory clarity as is taking hold in the E.U. MiCA can serve as an example of how and why cryptocurrency businesses need regulatory frameworks in order to operate effectively and efficiently. There are signs and recent executive orders that signal that the current administration will indeed provide that clarity. I’m optimistic for the future. You might also like: Robinhood to acquire Bitstamp for $200m: ‘major step in growing our crypto business’ CN: Some argue that MiCA gives an advantage to banks and traditional financial institutions over crypto-native firms. Do you think these regulations level the playing field or make it harder for exchanges like Bitstamp? BZ: While rising tides raise all boats, Bitstamp has taken a proactive stance on compliance for years and has invested heavily, with almost 30% of our team performing compliance, regulation, legal, risk management, security, and internal audit functions — ensuring that all our operations and decisions align with regulatory standards. Many companies similar to Bitstamp in the crypto space could have and can still invest in a compliance-forward approach. We view the introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations as a positive step for the cryptocurrency market. These regulations provide much-needed clarity and establish a level playing field for all participants in the crypto space. By ensuring that all entities adhere to the same rules, MiCA fosters a more transparent and secure environment. This increased transparency and security are expected to promote trust and confidence among both institutions and individual users, which is crucial for the adoption and long-term growth of the cryptocurrency market.

According to Messari, several coins, including Mother Iggy (MOTHER), Daddy Tate (DADDY), Official Trump (TRUMP), Melania Meme (MELANIA), and the recently launched Stool Prisondente (JAILSTOOL), have all gone down after peaking. MOTHER, DADDY, Lead the Decline MOTHER, fronted by pop star Iggy Azalea, reached an all-time high of $0.2306 soon after its launch in June 2024. However, it soon started a steady decline, dropping to a low of $0.0298 in July before its fortunes changed two months later when it rose to $0.1312. Per Messari, it now trades at $0.0089, down 96% from its ATH. In the last 24 hours, some market activity, translating to about $4.2 million in trading volume, pushed MOTHER’s price to $0.009067, about 11% higher than yesterday. Another meme coin hard hit by market vagaries is DADDY, linked to controversial British-American social media personality Andrew Tate. It has fallen 88%, dropping from an all-time high of $0.2886 in June 2024 to $0.0342 today. At one point, early buyers were reported to be sitting on at least $45 million in unrealized profits as the token’s value soared. However, while it has enjoyed brief surges since its peak, DADDY has struggled to regain momentum, with its best post-ATH performance being a brief run past $0.16 last October. Data from CoinGecko shows that the token is down 37.5% in the past month and more than 41% in the last two weeks. Its 18.6% decline across seven days means the coin is massively underperforming the broader crypto market, which is up by 1.4%. TRUMP, MELANIA Drop Sharply The story is the same as the Trump family-affiliated meme coins TRUMP and MELANIA. The two were launched only days before Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th U.S. President. TRUMP quickly flew to $73 and momentarily surpassed several meme coin stalwarts, including Pepe (PEPE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). However, when MELANIA was launched soon after, the first coin lost more than half its value. Both are now worth much less than they did three weeks ago, with TRUMP down 77.5% from its peak and MELANIA tumbling 88.7% from its $13.05 ATH . The former has lost 44.7% in the previous 14 days, while the latter has seen 42.1% of its value shaved off in the same period. Dave Portnoy’s Prisondente, a play on the Barstool Sports founder’s social media handle, suffered the steepest short-term drop. It plummeted 83.3% from its ATH of $0.2179 on February 9 and hit an all-time low of $0.025 a day later. Despite Portnoy heavily promoting JAILSTOOL on X, the token is down nearly 60% from yesterday. These sharp losses highlight the volatility of celebrity-endorsed cryptocurrencies. While they may gain traction due to their pop culture appeal, their rapid declines show the risk of investing in hype-driven tokens.

Rollblock’s Web3 gaming ecosystem is shaking up the entire gaming sector, with a bullish 600% surge in new users leading many experts to predict it could go on to 100x in 2025. Here’s why this gaming gem is likely to outperform Mantra this year. Rollblock ($RBLK) Set To Dominate The Gaming World This Year The Rollblock ($ RBLK ) presale is currently racing through stage 10, raising an impressive $10.3 million in only a few short months as an army of investors have rushed to secure their stake in the next big crypto gaming platform. Rollblock offers over 7,000 classic AI-powered games and a popular sports prediction league, all backed by the immutable Ethereum blockchain to ensure fair play. Fiat deposits were recently enabled in a partnership with Apple Pay, Google Pay and MasterCard. The gaming industry is currently worth over $500 billion, and Rollblock is well positioned to command a massive part of this market. Its players can have complete trust in Rollblock’s payouts as everything can be instantly verified on-chain. Rollblock’s unique deflationary revenue-sharing model greatly adds to its appeal. 30% of the platform’s profits are used to buy back $RBLK, with 60% of these buybacks permanently burned to reduce the supply. The remaining 40% funds staking rewards of up to 30% for loyal holders, creating a strong incentive to hold long term. With stage 10 tokens selling fast, the price is expected to rise from $0.053 in the next few days. Mantra ($OM) DeFI Giant Rides High On DAMAC RWA Collab Mantra ($OM) is another promising token, focusing on providing decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions in the Real World Assets niche. Mantra is currently showing impressive price action, gaining 7% in the past week to reach $6.11. Mantra also looks extremely strong on the monthly time frame, as in the last 30 days Mantra has added an incredible 56% to its market cap. Mantra is now in 25th place in the crypto rankings with a total market cap of $5.93 billion. Much of Mantra’s recent surge has been attributed to its recent partnership with the upmarket Dubai real estate firm DAMAC. This collaboration will result in DAMAC tokenizing its massive portfolio on-chain, using Mantra to offer huge security and transparency to its customers. With support for Mantra coiling up at $4.60, there is every chance that the Mantra price retests this level before blasting off for new highs. Many predict that Mantra could even reach a $10 price point in the coming quarter. The Future Of Gaming Belongs To Rollblock Rollblock ($RBLK) and Mantra ($OM) both offer significant upside from here, although Rollblock’s revolutionary approach to blockchain-backed gaming makes it the clear winner for investors seeking exponential 100x returns in 2025. With a recent surge in users and a presale launch that’s selling out fast, $RBLK could be trading above a dollar in the months to come.

Toncoin ( TON ) token was trading at $3.8515 on Tuesday, 55% below its all-time high. This decline has brought its market cap to $9.5 billion, making it the 16th largest cryptocurrency in the industry. TON faced a significant setback after Tapswap, a leading player in its tap-to-earn ecosystem, selected BSC Chain for its airdrop . In a note, the developers justified the decision by pointing to BNB’s larger ecosystem, lower transaction costs, and greater user base. DeFi Llama data shows that BNB has over 1.17 million active addresses and more than 840 dApps, including well-known platforms like Venus, PancakeSwap, and Lista. In comparison, TON is a smaller network with a total value locked of $217 million.

Popular tokens like Hamster Kombat, Catizen, and DOGS have all plummeted by over 80% from their all-time highs. Given this trend, Tapswap likely aims to avoid a similar price drop by leveraging one of the largest ecosystems in the crypto industry. On the positive side, on-chain data indicates that the TON network is steadily strengthening. The number of Toncoins burned daily has increased to 7,558 from this month’s low of 4,100. Token burns can support price appreciation by reducing the number of tokens in circulation. Transaction activity on the TON network is also growing. On Monday, its fees rose to 15,117 TON tokens, the highest level since Jan. 24, while the number of daily transactions jumped to nearly 4 million. Toncoin price analysis TON chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the TON price peaked at $8.30 in June and has since fallen 53% to $3.7. It has dropped below the key support level of $4.5380, which was its lowest point in July and September last year. Toncoin has also formed a death cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages crossed each other. A death cross is a widely recognized bearish reversal signal, indicating that bears have taken control. Currently, TON is hovering around the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. A break below this threshold could signal further downside, potentially pushing the price toward this month’s low of $2.9875—about 23% below its current level.

Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) recently reached a $56.3 billion market capitalization, reflecting a strong recovery from the bear market as the company expands to new blockchain networks. Meanwhile, lawmakers in the US continue to debate stablecoin regulations, with Representative Maxine Waters advocating for a bipartisan bill while Republican lawmakers push their own proposals. As regulatory clarity remains a key focus, the stablecoin market is growing, with USDC and Tether’s USDT competing for dominance in a rapidly evolving sector. Maxine Waters Advocates for Bipartisan Stablecoin Bill Amid Republican Proposals California Representative Maxine Waters has urged lawmakers in the US House of Representatives to support a stablecoin bill drafted in the previous session of Congress, emphasizing the need for a bipartisan approach to digital asset regulation. In a notice issued on Feb. 10, Rep. Waters stated that a 2024 stablecoin bill, originally drafted by then-House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry alongside her staff, should be the legislative framework moving forward. The California lawmaker underscored that this bill represented the culmination of three years of bipartisan work aimed at establishing comprehensive stablecoin regulations in the US financial system. Among its provisions, the bill seeks to close loopholes that allow stablecoin issuers to operate abroad while circumventing US financial regulations. Additionally, it introduces stricter measures to prevent convicted fraudsters from holding senior positions in stablecoin firms, reinforcing safeguards against potential misconduct in the rapidly growing sector. “At the start of this Congress, Chair Hill extended a hand of bipartisanship to work on stablecoins legislation,” Waters stated. “I firmly believe that the legislation that I’ve unveiled today provides the best foundation for moving forward and getting urgently needed stablecoins legislation signed into law.” Waters’ announcement followed the introduction of a competing payment stablecoin bill discussion draft by House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill and Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence Chair Bryan Steil. The Republican-sponsored bill aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, but it has not been developed in collaboration with Democratic lawmakers, prompting concerns about its viability as a bipartisan measure. The GOP-backed proposal, named the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, was included in the agenda for an upcoming congressional hearing on digital assets. Notably, Waters and McHenry’s previously drafted legislation was absent from the hearing’s official memo, raising concerns about whether bipartisan efforts will gain traction amid the ongoing political divide. A key distinction between the STABLE Act and its 2023 counterpart, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoin Act, is the expanded authority it grants to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Under the new proposal, the OCC would have the power to approve and supervise federally qualified nonbank payment stablecoin issuers. This provision has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers, with one staffer stating that Waters is “not supportive” of the Republican-led bill. Meanwhile, in the Senate, Republican legislators have introduced another stablecoin-focused proposal: the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. Unveiled on Feb. 4, this bill aims to bring certain stablecoin issuers under the regulatory oversight of the Federal Reserve, a move intended to enhance stability and accountability in the sector. The GENIUS Act has been referred to the Senate Banking Committee, where it will undergo further deliberation. The Political Landscape for Crypto Regulation Republican lawmakers currently hold only a slim majority in the House, making it challenging to pass cryptocurrency-related legislation without bipartisan support. While stablecoin regulations have been a pressing issue for both parties, disagreements over the appropriate regulatory framework continue to stall progress. Complicating matters further, US President Donald Trump has signaled his administration’s intention to prioritize digital asset regulation. In a Jan. 23 executive order, Trump announced the establishment of a crypto working group, indicating that stablecoin oversight could become a legislative priority in 2025. However, his administration's approach to digital assets has faced legal challenges, raising questions about the feasibility of its proposed regulatory actions. David Sacks, the White House's designated crypto and artificial intelligence czar, has echoed the president’s position, emphasizing the need to “bring that innovation [from the stablecoin market] onshore.” His comments come as major stablecoin issuers make strategic moves to position themselves within favorable regulatory environments. Circle, the company behind USDC , remains headquartered in the United States, while Tether—the issuer of the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, USDT—recently announced plans to relocate from the British Virgin Islands to El Salvador. As the debate over stablecoin regulation intensifies, the competing bills in Congress show the growing divide between Democratic and Republican approaches to digital asset oversight. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether lawmakers can bridge their differences and push forward comprehensive stablecoin legislation. With digital assets playing an increasingly significant role in the global financial system, the outcome of these legislative efforts will have lasting implications for the future of stablecoins in the United States. USDC Market Cap Soars to $56.3 Billion as Circle Expands Blockchain Presence In other news, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) has surged to a $56.3 billion market capitalization as of Feb. 10, according to CoinGecko data, marking a full recovery from its bear market slump and signaling renewed investor confidence in the stablecoin sector. The latest figures reflect a significant 23.4% increase from the $45.6 billion recorded on Jan. 8. At its lowest point during the most recent bear market, USDC’s market cap had dropped to $24.1 billion in November 2023. The stablecoin’s resurgence can be attributed to Circle’s strategic expansion efforts, which have seen USDC integrated into additional blockchain ecosystems. Circle has been aggressively expanding its stablecoin infrastructure, recently deploying USDC on emerging blockchain networks such as Sui and Aptos. Moreover, in January 2025, the company minted $6 billion worth of USDC on the Solana blockchain, reinforcing its position as a key player in the rapidly evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Despite USDC’s rapid growth, Tether’s USDT remains the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, with $141.6 billion worth of tokens in circulation as of Feb. 10. Data from CoinGecko indicates that USDT’s market cap has increased by over $4 billion in the past 30 days alone. According to DefiLlama , USDT still holds a commanding 63% share of the stablecoin market. However, USDC has made substantial gains, increasing its market share from 19.4% a year ago to 25% today. Stablecoin regulation has become a focal point for US policymakers, particularly following the transition of power under President Donald Trump’s administration. With digital assets playing an increasingly prominent role in global finance, lawmakers have begun pushing for clearer regulatory frameworks to govern the issuance and oversight of stablecoins. Stablecoins and Their Role in Global Finance Stablecoins, which are digital assets pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, play a crucial role in digital payments and financial inclusion. In many developing economies, they serve as a hedge against inflation, offering a more stable store of value than local fiat currencies. Additionally, stablecoin holders can generate yields on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, functioning similarly to interest-bearing bank accounts. The overall stablecoin market has seen remarkable growth, with its total market capitalization rising from $121 billion in August 2023 to $224 billion as of Feb. 10. This rapid expansion shows the increasing demand for stable digital assets, as investors and financial institutions recognize their utility in cross-border payments, remittances, and decentralized finance applications. As Circle continues to expand USDC’s reach across multiple blockchain networks and regulatory discussions gain momentum, the stablecoin sector is poised for further evolution. The battle for stablecoin dominance between USDC and USDT will likely intensify, with regulatory clarity playing a decisive role in shaping the future landscape of digital payments. With stablecoins now a key component of the global financial system, market participants will be closely watching developments in Washington and beyond. Whether through legislative action or organic market growth, the stablecoin sector is on track to redefine the future of money in the digital age.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|USDC|USDT|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-11 14:00:00

Powered by Optimism's OP stack, Unichain—like other layer-2s on Ethereum—offers faster and cheaper transactions compared to Ethereum's mainnet. Developers can deploy apps onto the network, which has been optimized specifically for decentralized finance (DeFi) and aims to serve as ""the home for liquidity across chains,"" according to Uniswap Labs. For Uniswap Labs, the benefit of launching a layer-2 is twofold: it will provide a better experience for users of Uniswap and similar platforms, and it will create a new revenue opportunity in the form of network fees. A representative for Uniswap Labs told CoinDesk that ""around 20%"" of the chain's revenue will go directly to the company. Unichain has been in testing since October 2024 and is classified by Uniswap Labs as a ""stage-1"" rollup, meaning it has elements of decentralization but retains some centrally-controlled safeguards at this early phase. The network is built on the OP Stack, a modular framework that lets developers build interoperable layer-2 chains based on Optimism’s optimistic rollup technology . Several well-known teams have come out with their own OP Stack-based layer-2’s, including Coinbase's ‘ Base ’, Kraken’s ‘ Ink ,’ World’s ‘ World chain ,’ and Sony’s ‘ Soneium .’ What makes Unichain different? Dozens of layer-2 chains have popped up over the last few years, and Uniswap co-founder Hayden Adams believes that most of them will ultimately be used for specific use cases rather than serve as general-purpose blockchains. “We are anticipating a world of many, many different use cases, of which trading is a small subset,” Adams told CoinDesk in an interview. In collaboration with Ethereum research and development firm Flashbots, the Uniswap team said it has created a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Unichain. The TEE is a secure area for more sensitive transactions and is meant to optimize the chain for DeFi by allowing for more advanced trades and faster transaction finality. “Essentially, we want Unichain to be a chain that is good for liquidity creation, good for trading, good for applications that need to be co-located with them, and then good for applications that essentially want access to liquidity but should not be co-located,” Adams said. Building on Optimism As part of its integration with Optimism’s ""Superchain"" ecosystem, Uniswap Labs has agreed to give 2.5% of Unichain’s gross revenue—or 15% of Unichain’s net revenue, whichever is greater—to the Optimism Collective, a consortium of people and companies that steward Optimism's rollup tech. Many of the chains in the Optimism Superchain ecosystem have agreed to similar setups, including Coinbase and Kraken. In exchange for building on Optimism, both Coinbase and Kraken received grants of Optimism's OP governance tokens from the Optimism Foundation, which controls a treasury of tokens earmarked to help grow the ecosystem. Coinbase agreed to receive up to 118 million OP tokens, while Kraken agreed to 25 million . Uniswap Labs declined to comment on whether it had its own deal with the Optimism Foundation. Ahead of Unichain’s mainnet launch, Uniswap Labs announced that 65% of the chain’s net revenue will go to the Unichain Validation Network —a group of validators and stakers securing the blockchain. UVN will act as “another layer of transparency and validation of the network,” Adams said. “Part of the uniqueness about us as a project that has always been decentralized first, is that we are actually reducing the role and the power of sequencer relative to other things that are running more centralized sequencers,” Adams added.

TON will initially be connected to 12 blockchains including Ethereum, Tron and Solana. Users will be able to transfer stablecoins to TON using Stargate, the largest crypto bridge. Stargate handled $1.6 billion in volume over the past month, according to DefiLlama . Users will also benefit from LayerZero's multichain liquidity, which allows funds locked in different blockchains to be pooled to reduce the chance of slippage — a change in price between initiating and ending a transaction — or outright failure. Liquidity is key decentralized finance (DeFi). There is some $117 billion in total value locked (TVL) across all blockchains. But with more than 4,400 blockchains and layer-2 networks, according to DefiLlama , liquidity per chain is fragmented. If a trading firm wanted to lend or borrow hundreds of millions on a specific chain the relatively large transaction value is likely to lead to slippage or failure. The chance of that happening is reduced when liquidity is pooled. Crypto firms Tether and Ethena will also use the integration, with the latter's flagship $5 billion asset, USDe, set to go live on TON. Tether's new USDT0 stablecoin, which was launched to tackle liquidity issues, becomes transferrable between TON, Tron, Ethereum, Celo and Arbitrum through its new product, the Legacy Mesh. Developers will also benefit from the integration as tokens can be deployed on TON from any of LayerZero's chains using a single contract. TON was created in 2018 as an internal project at messaging app Telegram, which abandoned development two years later. In Sept 2023, Telegram endorsed the now independent TON and said it would integrate the blockchain into the app's user interface . Last month, it became the exclusive blockchain for Telegram’s mini apps ecosystem. ""TON is undoubtedly one of the most exciting ecosystems today,” said Bryan Pellegrino, CEO of LayerZero. “After its exclusive partnership with Telegram, it now has access to nearly a billion users.”",Finance|TON|TON Foundation|LayerZero|Interoperability,EN,0,0,TON|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 14:00:00

Unlike traditional zkVMs, Pico allows developers to customize all layers, from prime fields and proving systems to workflows, coprocessor integrations, and access to historical on-chain data. Pico v1.0 zKVM Approaching zkVMs modularly, Pico delivers 84% to 155% faster computation on central processing units (CPUs), with graphics processing unit ( GPU ) acceleration announced with future updates. Central to this approach is the so-called “glue-and-coprocessor” architecture, which blends a general-purpose zkVM with high-performance specialized circuits. Instead of relying on precompiled functions, Pico offers app-specific circuits to help developers integrate custom coprocessors or precompiles tailored specifically to their needs. So far, the result has been a 35X speed boost for historical blockchain data processing. Customizable proving system Pico also introduces a customizable proving system that allows for domain-specific proof structures to accommodate specialized languages and custom proof systems without core code alterations. Michael Dong, Co-founder of Brevis, commented on the customization potential of the new model, stating: “Pico represents a shift in how zkVMs are designed and deployed. Bringing a modular, app-aware zkVM with built-in zkCoprocessors, we’re optimizing performance and creating a never before seen level of customization in verifiable computation for Web3.” In addition to the customizable proving system, Pico’s ProverChain introduces a customizable proving workflow, which optimizes scalability by allowing developers to adjust proving steps or bypass unnecessary proof compression steps when verifying off-chain. Moreover, Pico supports RISC-V, an open-source instruction set architecture, and the Rust programming language. Brevis adoption A number of Web3 projects, such as Kwenta, Usual, Algebra Labs, JoJo Exchange, and Trusta, have already embraced Brevis solutions on their mainnets. Others, such as PancakeSwap, Celer, Frax, Gamma, Quickswap, Mask Network, and Kernel, have also announced they would be leveraging Brevis technology for their upcoming projects. As the demand for verifiable computing in Web3 grows, Pico’s modular approach may see even more widespread adoption in the industry.

The fund is the result of a partnership between Fundbox, a Portuguese fund management company, and Kvarn X, aEuropean cryptocurrency investment platform. The fund's subscription period ends in Feb. 2027, according to its website, and features a 0.05% management fee, along with a one-off 2.5% subscription fee. On top of these, investors also have to cover a €1,250 ($1289) know-your-customer (KYC) fee. The fund has an 80/20 profit share. For investors that aren’t after Portuguese residency, the minimum investment is €100,000. The fund is set to allocate 80% of its portfolio to bitcoin (BTC), and the remaining 20% to the CoinDesk 20 Index , which offers exposure to a broad range of large-cap cryptocurrencies. KvarnPortugal aligns “financial opportunity with real-world utility” by integrating the index into a fund facilitating residency-by-investment, said Alan Campbell, president of CoinDesk Indices. The CoinDesk 20 Index, he added, was “designed to serve as the industry’s most liquid benchmark."" To use the fund to gain residency in Portugal through the country’s Golden Visa program, investors would have to commit a minimum of €500,000 and spend at least 35 days in the country over five years.

This prolonged period of consolidation highlights the current indecisive nature of the market. Bulls have been unable to reclaim control and push Bitcoin above the critical $100K mark, while bears are also struggling to drive the price lower toward key demand levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Multi-Year Bullish Pattern – Expert Suggests The Next Move Will Be ‘The Real Deal’ The lack of direction has left investors and analysts watching closely for signals of the next major move. The broader market sentiment remains cautious, with many questioning whether Bitcoin can regain bullish momentum or if a deeper correction is on the horizon. Key metrics shared by crypto expert Axel Adler on X provide some insight into the current dynamics. According to Adler, the $97K level serves as a strong support zone, representing the average purchase price for Bitcoin short-term holders. This suggests that a significant portion of market participants are still confident in Bitcoin’s ability to hold above this level despite the lack of upward momentum. Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong As Indecision Drives The market Bitcoin has been navigating through weeks, even months, of uncertainty and speculation, leaving investors divided about its short-term direction. Bulls have struggled to push the price back above the critical $100K mark, while bears have been unable to break below key support levels. This stalemate has created a market characterized by indecision, with volatility continuing to dominate price action. The absence of a clear trend has caused frustration among investors, many of whom had anticipated a stronger rally earlier this year. Instead, Bitcoin has been consolidating within a range, bouncing between its $109K all-time high and support levels around $90K. For now, the market seems stuck in this phase, with no immediate catalyst to break out. Top analyst Axel Adler has provided crucial insights into the current dynamics. According to Adler, the $97K level is acting as strong support, as it represents the average purchase price for short-term holders who have held their Bitcoin for one to three months. This data suggests that many market participants are still confident in Bitcoin’s ability to hold this level, even as broader uncertainty looms. If Bitcoin can sustain this support in the coming days, analysts anticipate a potential rally back toward range highs around $109K. However, failure to maintain this level could pave the way for further downside, testing lower demand zones. For now, the market remains on edge, waiting for Bitcoin’s next decisive move.

This range-bound price action highlights indecision in the market, as bulls and bears struggle to gain control. For Bitcoin to confirm a short-term reversal and regain bullish momentum, bulls need to reclaim the $98K mark as support and push decisively above the $100K level. Breaking and holding above this critical resistance could set the stage for a move toward higher price levels, potentially targeting all-time highs around $109K. A successful reclaim of the $100K level would signal renewed strength and confidence in the market, sparking optimism among investors. On the flip side, failure to hold above the $95K support level could open the door for further downside. A drop below $95K might send Bitcoin into lower demand zones, with the $90K level acting as the next key support. Such a move could further fuel bearish sentiment and extend the current consolidation phase.

While one of those saw only a slight price reaction, another surged by double digits after the disclosure. The Latest Amendments The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange will expand the list of trading choices offered on Binance Spot by adding the pairs QTUM/TRY, TRUMP/EUR, and VTHO/TRY. The offerings will be available to users from February 12. Binance will also enable trading bot services for the aforementioned pairs on the same date . This is not the first time the company has shown support for TRUMP, a Solana-based meme coin introduced by US President Donald Trump. Binance was among the behemoths listing the asset shortly after its launch last month. The move and the massive hype surrounding the asset were some of the main factors fueling TRUMP’s impressive rally during its first days of existence. As CryptoPotato reported , the meme coin’s market cap briefly surged past $14.5 billion, thus surpassing Shiba Inu (SHIB). The bull run, though, was short-lived, and TRUMP’s price and capitalization gradually decreased in the last several weeks. As seen on its chart, the valuation pumped to $16.70 shortly after Binance’s latest announcement before dipping again to its current $16 (per CoinGecko’s data). This represents a massive 75% decline compared to the peak of over $72 witnessed on January 19 . While Binance’s disclosure had only a slight effect on TRUMP’s price, this was not the case with the other affected asset, Qtum (QTUM). It soared by double digits, reaching as high as $3.67 before settling at around $3.45. QTUM Price, Source: CoinGecko The Delisting Effort Besides adding new trading pairs to users, Binance also plans to remove some existing ones. According to a separate announcement , the cross margin pairs HMSTR/FDUSD, SAGA/BTC and the isolated margin pairs HMSTR/FDUSD, ILV/BTC, LTO/BTC, MDT/BTC, SAGA/BTC will become unavailable from February 17 . “Please note that users will not be able to update their positions during the delisting process, and they are strongly advised to close their positions and/or transfer their assets from Margin Accounts to Spot Accounts prior to the cessation of Margin trading at 2025-02-17 06:00 (UTC). Binance will not be responsible for any potential losses,” the company warned. When Binance withdraws support for a cryptocurrency, it often leads to a sharp price decline due to reduced liquidity, negative sentiment, and investor uncertainty. However, the digital assets involved seem unaffected, and most of them are in the green today (February 11), which aligns with the crypto market’s revival. It is important to note that severe plunges are typically observed when Binance conducts a complete delisting process rather than removing just a few trading pairs. Such was the case in February last year when the exchange terminated all services with Monero (XMR), Aragon (ANT), Multichain (MULTI), and Vai (VAI) . The price of the popular privacy coin plunged by 35% after the disclosure.

The AI agents market cap has enjoyed a 12% increase in the past 24 hours, bringing the total market cap to $7.79 billion, according to cookie.fun . Solana-based agents dominate the market with a $3.86 billion valuation, reflecting a 13.66% rise in the last day. Following closely, Base and other chains recorded gains of 9.27% and 8.75%, respectively. This uptick in AI agents’ market cap is hopeful, especially considering the decline in the AI agent narrative marked by the AI agents’ market cap crashing from its previous $10 billion highs. Read more: AI Agent market cap down to $6.6B as top tokens market caps bleed in double digits This rebound may, in part, be driven by major technological advancements and strategic moves in the AI sector. Specifically, OpenAI is reportedly taking a major step toward reducing its reliance on NVIDIA by designing its own in-house AI chips. The chips will be manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, with the design expected to be finalized in the coming months. This development might fuel the resurgence of crypto projects that depend on AI-based infrastructure. That being said, it might be too early to tell if older AI agent projects will even return to their previous highs. As crypto researcher Crypto Stream pointed out in a recent post on X , trying to time the bottom of these tokens is too risky — though it could also be highly profitable. He also explained that the decline in the AI narrative wasn’t due to a lack of innovation or utility in the space. Instead, market liquidity shifted from AI projects into large-cap altcoins, which caused a crash in the demand for AI tokens.

According to experts these 5 tokens could be top performers in 2025: Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX), Rollblock and Hedera (HBAR). Here’s why investors are bullish. Rollblock Is About To Change The Game As the $450 billion global gambling industry is increasingly migrating online, Rollblock is set to capture a large portion of this revenue with its unique framework that bridges the gap between DeFi and online gambling. Rollblock’s cutting-edge GambleFi platform has captured the interest of players and investors alike, and the casino sets itself apart with robust security features that make it impossible to alter bets once placed. With over 45,000 early bidders, Rollblock has already raised a record-breaking $10 million in presale and demand is going through the roof as investors are rushing to secure their allocation. Over 7,000 games await newcomers where they will always find something to their taste. From casino classics such as poker and roulette to live games and brand-new AI-powered exclusives. Rollblock has it all. Moreover, Rollblock offers one of the most intriguing revenue-sharing models on the market, powered by the RBLK token. Weekly, the platform will reinvest up to 30% of its profits to perform open market buybacks of RBLK, of which 60% of these tokens will be burned forever, while the remainder will be distributed to users as recurring staking rewards. Dogecoin Enters Consolidation Phase As Whales Step In Dogecoin has faced intense volatility due to U.S. trade war concerns and macroeconomic uncertainty, listing over 21% in valuation over the last month alone. Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.25, up 1% in the past 24 hours, struggling to recover from a sharp drop after hitting a 30-day high of $0.43. Rising open interest could push Dogecoin to decouple from Bitcoin before recovering to key resistance levels if momentum builds and buying pressure ramps up. Despite bearish market trends, investor sentiment remains positive, signaling confidence in Dogecoin’s long-term potential. With over $2.2 billion committed to futures, traders anticipate a breakout as Dogecoin gains renewed market interest. Despite the recent sell-off, on-chain data from analyst Ali Martinez reveals that whales accumulated 750 million Dogecoin over the last week, signaling Dogecoin is now hovering above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), a crucial support level for maintaining a bullish trajectory. If the price holds above this level, a push toward $0.29 could follow. If such a move is sustained, Dogecoin could soon enter escape velocity and rally above its 2021 all-time high of $0.73, possibly targeting the prophesied $1 milestone. Cardano Threatens Further Short-Term Decline Cardano (ADA) has risen 1.20% in the past day but remains in a downtrend after losing support at $0.69. If buyers fail to regain control, the Cardano price could decline further to the $0.66-$0.68 range or even lower as support appears to be giving in. Midterm analysis suggests a lack of dominance from either buyers or sellers, with declining trading volume pointing to potential sideways movement for Cardano.Despite the current state of uncertainty, analysts remain bullish on Cardano’s 2025 performance. Trader Peter Brandt and analyst Dan Gambardello foresee a strong bull run, with Gambardello projecting a $500 billion market cap for Cardano, which would put its price in the double-digit ballpark. Key resistance levels at $0.90 and $1.02-$1.13 could confirm an uptrend, while support at $0.65 and $0.50 may act as a launchpad for recovery. Tron Projected To Surge Massively As Justin Sun Enters Trump’s Crypto Circle Tron (TRX) founder, Justin Sun has deepened his ties with the Trump family by joining World Liberty Financial (WLFI) as an advisor after investing $75 million, making him its largest backer. His influence in the crypto space now extends to politics and regulation, aligning with Trump's pro-crypto policies, including a new SEC ""Crypto Task Force."" Meanwhile, WLFI has significantly increased its TRX holdings, which now stand at over $5 million, reflecting confidence in Tron's potential. In terms of price action, Tron (TRX) remains in a bearish phase, trading at $0.23, down over 40% from its 2024 peak at $0.44. However, key metrics and growing adoption point toward a potential rebound. Tron has become the second-largest fee-generating blockchain after Tether, earning $330 million this year, vastly surpassing Ethereum and Solana. A falling wedge pattern and support at the 200-day EMA suggest a bullish breakout could push TRX toward its all-time high and potentially even higher. Hedera Cools-Off After Memorable Rally Hedera (HBAR) recorded a triple-digit rally in late 2024, with its price skyrocketing from $0.04 to $0.37 in the span of a couple of weeks. Predictably around the local top, selling pressure intensified and Hedera entered a descending channel, bottoming out at $0.23. Meanwhile, Coinbase has submitted filings to the CFTC to introduce Hedera (HBAR) futures, expanding its range of crypto derivatives. This will enable investors to trade without owning the token, and if approved, this launch could enhance institutional interest in Hedera, which could propel its price higher. Long-term forecasts suggest a significant appreciation for Hedera, with prices potentially exceeding $2 once the euphoric phase of the cycle kicks off, While market volatility remains a significant factor, Hedera’s strong fundamentals make it a promising investment, especially at its current price point. The RBLK Presale Could Be The Hottest Play Of 2025 Stage 10 of the presale is now underway and RBLK is selling for just $0.053. This is the perfect entry point for investors who want to capitalize on the Rollblock gaming revolution, as an 800% rally is expected by the end of the presale alone. Once listings on major exchanges are finalized and Rollblock enters the mainstream, a 100x moonshot could be on the cards when the bull market is in full swing. Don’t miss out on this up-and-coming gem. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

As of today, Lido’s total value locked (TVL) is approximately $25 billion, according to DeFiLlama . With its latest update, Lido introduces stVaults, a new staking framework aimed at providing institutions, node operators, and DeFi users greater flexibility and control over their ETH staking strategies. ""Lido V3 is a major leap forward for Ethereum staking,"" said Konstantin Lomashuk, Lido protocol founding contributor, in a press release. ""With stVaults, the protocol expands into Ethereum Staking Infrastructure, offering a flexible foundation for the next phase of staking while upholding the security and decentralization the Lido protocol is known for.""

Attorney Predicts Lawsuit Will End Before ETF Approval,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-set-to-explode-to-10-attorney-predicts-lawsuit-will-end-before-etf-approval/,"The XRP price has risen by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, rising to $2.48 as prominent crypto-focused lawyer Jeremy Hogan predicts that Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC will end before any XRP ETFs gain approval. This move comes with the cryptocurrency market as a whole barely moving today, while XRP itself remains down by 3% in a week and by 20% in the past fortnight. Yet with the altcoin retaining a very healthy 366% increase in the past year, it has the medium- and long-term momentum to continue rising as and when the wider market reenters a more bullish phase. XRP Price Set to Explode to $10? Attorney Predicts Lawsuit Will End Before ETF Approval Responding to a question on X, attorney Jeremy Hogan predicted that it’s “more likely” that the Ripple-SEC case reaches a full conclusion “sooner than the ETF approvals.” Hogan clarified that this is more because ETF approval requires more admin work, whereas a settlement between Ripple and the SEC could potentially arrive after only one or two hearings or meetings. Not because it has to happen in that order, but because the ETFs will just take longer to dot the i's and cross the t's. — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) February 10, 2025 Yet while Hogan believes that XRP ETFs are further away, it’s worth noting that the momentum behind such ETFs has been increasing in recent days and weeks. For instance, Nasdaq filed yesterday to list the CoinShares XRP ETF, adding its name to nine other comparable filings that have hit the SEC’s desk this year. Given the sheer number of filings, it’s likely that we may even see the SEC fast track approval of some of these applications, as it has done with other ETFs for other tokens . JUST IN: Nasdaq has officially submitted a proposed rule change to the SEC to list and trade shares of the CoinShares #XRP ETF Trust! pic.twitter.com/pWb8cwvarR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 10, 2025 As such, while Hogan suggests that a full and final settlement is closer than the launch of an XRP ETF, the latter isn’t that far away either. This puts the XRP price in a good position to continue rising in the near and more distant future, with its chart today showing a promising recovery in momentum. After falling as low as 20 on February 3, the coin’s relative strength index (purple) has now climbed back up to 55, indicating a return in buying pressure. Source: TradingView At the same time, XRP’s 30-period average (orange) has seemingly started on a path towards overtaking its 200-period average (blue). This would suggest that now is very much a good time to buy the coin before it returns to substantial growth in the not-too-distant future. Based on such factors, the XRP price could hit $2.75 again by Q2 and then reach $3.40 by Q4. Alternative High-Potential Altcoins to Consider XRP could be in line for some big gains this year, yet its existing size could also mean that its growth remains more piecemeal and gradual. If so, traders may be better off diversifying into newer, smaller cap alts, which under the right circumstances can greatly outpace the market average. One new coin looking very good right now is Best Wallet Token (BEST) , which has raised $9.5 million since opening its presale towards the end of last year. Stacking $BEST has never been easier. Complete your daily quests, check for manual tasks, and refer friends for even bigger rewards. More quests = more $BEST in your wallet. Don’t leave rewards on the table. Start earning today! https://t.co/he5kzra7TY pic.twitter.com/LT4UxEh9kU — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) February 11, 2025 The native token of the popular Best Wallet app, BEST will provide a wide range of benefits to the app’s 250,000 monthly active users. Such perks cover discounts on transaction fees, greater staking yields, governance rights, and early access to new tokens. This is bullish because both BEST and the Best Wallet app itself will mutually reinforce each other, helping to boost the other’s growth. Best Wallet has already become one of the most popular software wallets in crypto since launching in 2023, with the app’s several market-leading features, including compatibility with other 200 networks and an invaluable Project Tracker tool. Because of this, BEST could witness very high demand once it launches in the next few weeks, with investors able to buy it now at the Best Wallet Token site . BEST is now selling at $0.02395, with this price set to continue rising intermittently until its sale ends. The post XRP Price Set to Explode to $10?

Experts predict that these five tokens might lead the pack in 2025: Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX), Rollblock, and Hedera (HBAR). Here’s why there is a wave of optimism among investors. Rollblock Poised for Major Disruption With the $450 billion global gambling industry steadily shifting to digital platforms, Rollblock aims to seize a significant share of this market with its innovative system that links DeFi with online gambling. Rollblock’s state-of-the-art GambleFi platform has caught the eye of both players and investors, thanks to its advanced security measures ensuring that once bets are placed, they remain unchanged. Having already attracted over 45,000 early investors, Rollblock has set a record by raising $10 million in its presale, with demand surging as investors rush to secure their stakes. The platform offers over 7,000 games, catering to all preferences, from traditional casino games like poker and roulette to live games and new AI-driven exclusives. Rollblock truly offers it all. Additionally, Rollblock features one of the most compelling revenue-sharing models, driven by the RBLK token. Each week, the platform plans to reinvest up to 30% of its earnings into buying back RBLK tokens on the open market, burning 60% of these tokens permanently and distributing the rest as ongoing staking rewards to users. Dogecoin Finds Stability as Major Investors Step In Dogecoin has experienced significant price swings due to concerns over U.S. trade wars and broader economic uncertainties, dropping more than 21% in the past month. Currently, Dogecoin (DOGE) is priced at $0.25, marking a 1% rise in the last 24 hours, as it attempts to bounce back from a steep fall after reaching a 30-day peak of $0.43. Increasing open interest might help Dogecoin separate from Bitcoin and regain key resistance levels if momentum and buying pressure grow. Despite prevailing bearish trends, investor sentiment remains optimistic, indicating strong belief in Dogecoin’s future potential. With over $2.2 billion invested in futures, traders are anticipating a breakout as Dogecoin captures renewed attention in the market. Even with the recent downturn, on-chain data from analyst Ali Martinez shows that large investors have accumulated 750 million Dogecoin in the past week, suggesting Dogecoin is now positioned above its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), an essential support level for continuing a bullish path. If the price stays above this level, it might reach $0.29. Sustaining this upward move could propel Dogecoin past its 2021 peak of $0.73, potentially aiming for the anticipated $1 mark. Cardano Faces Potential Short-Term Decline Cardano (ADA) has increased by 1.20% in the last day but remains on a downward trend after losing its footing at $0.69. Should buyers not regain control, Cardano's price might fall further to the $0.66-$0.68 range or even lower, as support appears weak. Medium-term analysis indicates no clear advantage for buyers or sellers, with decreasing trading volume suggesting possible sideways movement for Cardano.Despite the current uncertainty, analysts are optimistic about Cardano’s prospects in 2025. Trader Peter Brandt and analyst Dan Gambardello predict a robust bull market, with Gambardello estimating a $500 billion market cap for Cardano, potentially pushing its price into double digits. Resistance at $0.90 and $1.02-$1.13 could confirm an upward trend, while support at $0.65 and $0.50 might serve as a base for recovery. Tron Expected to Soar as Justin Sun Joins Trump’s Crypto Network Tron (TRX) founder, Justin Sun, has strengthened his association with the Trump family by becoming an advisor to World Liberty Financial (WLFI) after a $75 million investment, making him its largest contributor. His influence in the crypto world now extends to political and regulatory spheres, aligning with Trump's pro-crypto stance, including a new SEC ""Crypto Task Force."" Meanwhile, WLFI has significantly boosted its TRX holdings, now exceeding $5 million, demonstrating confidence in Tron's future. In terms of market performance, Tron (TRX) remains in a bearish phase, priced at $0.23, down over 40% from its 2024 high of $0.44. However, crucial metrics and increasing adoption point to a potential rebound. Tron has emerged as the second-largest fee-generating blockchain after Tether, earning $330 million this year, far surpassing Ethereum and Solana. A falling wedge pattern and support at the 200-day EMA suggest a bullish breakout might push TRX toward its all-time high and potentially beyond. Hedera Eases After Impressive Rally Hedera (HBAR) experienced a remarkable rally in late 2024, with its price soaring from $0.04 to $0.37 in just a few weeks. As expected, near the peak, selling pressure increased, leading Hedera into a descending channel, reaching a low of $0.23. At the same time, Coinbase has filed with the CFTC to offer Hedera (HBAR) futures, broadening its crypto derivatives offerings. This move will allow investors to trade without owning the token, and if approved, it could boost institutional interest in Hedera, potentially driving its price upward. Long-term predictions indicate substantial appreciation for Hedera, with prices possibly exceeding $2 once the market's euphoric phase begins. While market volatility remains a concern, Hedera’s strong fundamentals make it an appealing investment, especially at its current price level. RBLK Presale Could Be the Leading Opportunity of 2025 The presale has reached Stage 10, with RBLK priced at just $0.053. This presents a prime opportunity for investors eager to benefit from the Rollblock gaming revolution, as an 800% surge is anticipated by the presale's end. Once major exchange listings are completed and Rollblock gains mainstream attention, a 100x growth could be possible during a bull market. Don’t miss out on this emerging opportunity.

Expert Predicts Future Belongs to This Utility Token,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/will-ethereum-foundation-cause-eth-collapse-expert-predicts-future-belongs-to-this-utility-token,"The Ethereum Foundation has made some ETH transactions that could potentially spark volatility. The ETH price has struggled to gain momentum this month, and there have been several bearish catalysts. Amid a trade war and other macroeconomic issues, the Ethereum Foundation’s actions might hinder bullish advances for the ETH price. While headwinds from the US-China trade war exacerbate the crypto market’s downturn, investors are attracted by the stability of the DTX Exchange . The multi-asset trading platform is in the last phase of its exciting presale, which has already received $13.6M in funding. It is ready to launch, and its native token will soon be listed on top-tier exchanges. Ethereum Foundation Transfers 50,000 ETH The market has been abuzz since the Ethereum FOundation transferred 50,000 ETH yesterday. The ETH price has been mostly stagnant for three days, and this 50,000 ETH transaction has sparked market speculation, but the ETH price has yet to see a meaningful recovery. Historically, such actions from the Ethereum Foundation have increased volatility in the ETH price. The ETH price saw a sharp decline last week, but now selling pressures seem to have eased, and there is a chance for an ETH price recovery. While BNB and SOL have posted gains, the ETH price has remained stagnant, which signals investor indecision and lack of confidence. The Ethereum Foundation has internal challenges, controversial network updates, and an increasing circulating supply. These could spell doom for the ETH price. Recent changes in leadership at the Ethereum Foundation have also raised criticism, and the Foundation has also been slow to act on issues like the network’s slow speed and financial transparency. The crypto community has raised concerns over the Ethereum Foundation’s periodic sales of ETH. The foundation opts to liquidate assets instead of leveraging staking opportunities. The network also has scalability issues, with the closest competition, Solana, gaining traction for offering faster and cheaper transactions. All this is bearing down on the ETH price. DTX Exchange to Surpass Top Altcoins DTX Exchange is changing the trading industry with its hybrid trading platform. DTX has identified a gap in the trading ecosystem and has created a platform that bridges that gap between the traditional and decentralized trade of assets. It is stealing the spotlight from legacy altcoins, with its presale already crossing $13.6 million and analysts predicting a massive price rise once the DTX token is listed. DTX Exchange is an ambitious project, and the unified DTX hub will offer users access to over 120,000 fiat and crypto assets, including forex, stocks, bonds, gold, ETFs, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies. The hybrid trading platform will remove barriers between markets and make crypto derivatives more accessible. Traders will not have to hop between multiple platforms anymore and will easily be able to manage their entire portfolio on one reliable, fast, and user-friendly platform. DTX is based on the VulcanX layer-1 blockchain, and it has achieved a testnet speed of over 200,000 tps, much quicker than top altcoins. This means traders can achieve faster transactions and trades in real time. Key Takeaways DTX Exchange might be the best new DeFi project to watch. It is currently priced at $0.16, but it won’t be at this affordable buy-in for long. The price is predicted to rocket soon after listing, and top crypto analysts advise investors to invest in the presale before it ends. The token has surged by 700% since the presale started, and the growth trajectory is unprecedented.

Historically, such actions by the Ethereum Foundation have heightened volatility in ETH's price.

A team led by BCA Research Global Asset Allocation analyst Juan Correa noted that the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market is showing all the typical signals that it is approaching its peak. Analysts stated that they do not believe that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are a scam and that prices will not fall to zero, and although they have a long-term positive opinion about BTC, they warned that the price may be approaching its peak. Analysts stated that Bitcoin is an asset that should be included in every portfolio and said: “We are structurally positive on Bitcoin and believe it should be a must-have in a multi-asset portfolio. However, market sentiment is important. We believe that the crazy optimism in the market is a sign that the crypto market is nearing its peak. “We are also currently seeing over 90% of the Bitcoin supply in the money. Historically, this is usually when the Bitcoin price is at its peak.” Analysts said that macroeconomic developments also have an impact on Bitcoin prices, adding that “if the US economy turns out colder than expected and the government acts fiscally irresponsibly, it will be negative for Bitcoin to continue its explosive rise.” Analysts added that there is a risk of Bitcoin falling to $75,000, and stated that they will buy more aggressively if the price falls to this level. Analysts also noted that some data suggest that the Bitcoin price may have peaked, but this could be invalidated by Donald Trump’s plan to set up a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Finally, analysts who evaluated Donald Trump and his wife's issuance of their own tokens stated that they believe Trump's token issuance behavior indicates a desire for personal wealth growth rather than sharing profits with new buyers. *This is not investment advice.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA), which once imposed a steep 55% tax on crypto income, is now considering lowering it to a more manageable 20%. Additionally, Japan is exploring the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, potentially reversing its previous ban on the asset. This move likely comes as a result of SoftBank’s foray into crypto. Nevertheless, the country now looks keen to align itself with the rest of the world as far as the crypto consensus is concerned. With yet another major economy changing its stance on crypto and wanting to become a participant in the digital asset market, crypto’s power, influence, and potential are on full display. If you’d like to join the crypto bandwagon and make some handsome returns yourself, here are the best new crypto to buy now. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best New Crypto to Buy Now Solana ($SOL) remains one of the top cryptocurrencies , consistently demonstrating strong market performance. Known for its high-speed, low-cost transactions, Solana has gained traction among developers, investors, and institutions. Its expanding ecosystem, spanning DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications, further cements its position as a key player in the crypto space. For instance, it has reported increasing market share in DEX volumes, revenues, and active users, plus the technical side looks solid too, with support being held above key levels. However, Solaxy ($SOLX) is what can really act as a catalyst to Solana’s growth and send it soaring past all-time highs. As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, Solaxy aims to improve the network massively by solving pertinent issues like congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability. The project’s presale numbers are further proof of Solaxy’s future potential . Over $19M has been raised so far, and each token is currently being offered at just $0.001632. Interested? Here’s how to buy $SOLX . 2. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) – Benefit from Bitcoin’s Success and Multiply Your Investment BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) embodies the spirit of a true Bitcoin supporter. As one of the most promising new presale tokens , $BTCBULL offers a unique incentive for its holders, rewarding them with Bitcoin ($BTC) airdrops whenever the original cryptocurrency hits key price milestones of $150K, $200K, and $250K. This innovative model not only aligns with Bitcoin’s long-term growth but also provides investors with direct exposure to its success, making $BTCBULL an exciting opportunity for those bullish on BTC’s future. Furthermore, BTC Bull has a clear plan to boost its value by burning a portion of its total supply when Bitcoin ($BTC) reaches $125K, $175K, and $225K. By reducing the number of tokens in circulation, demand is expected to rise, helping to push the price higher – a real incentive for investors. The market is well and truly impressed with BTC Bull and its unique way of rallying behind the crypto economy. The $BTCBULL presale, which launched just over a day ago, has already amassed a mind-boggling $569K. You can join the $BTCBULL-ish madness by shelling out just $0.002355 per token. Check out their X account and Telegram channel for more details on what they’re trying to do. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Cutting-Edge AI Tech Offering Crypto Investment Advice If you’re tired of being beaten by the deceptive crypto market time and time again, MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is here to be your ultimate crypto investment buddy. It’s a self-evolving and autonomous AI agent that will provide real-time actionable market insights to its token holders by scanning chit-chat on X and elsewhere on the web.

Check out our How to buy $MIND guide for more info. 4. Litecoin ($LTC) – Digital Silver Delivering Consistent Returns Litecoin has been one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies in the last year or so, generating around 80% returns for long-term investors. However, it finds a place in this list because of a recent development that has turned it very bullish. A couple of weeks ago, $LTC became the only altcoin after $ETH whose exchange-traded fund has been greenlit by the higher authorities. It’s also worth noting that $LTC is considered more legitimate and, therefore, a better investment than other top altcoins because it’s a hard fork of Bitcoin. Basically, if $BTC is digital gold, $LTC is digital silver, which is why it’s highly likely to follow Bitcoin to the moon. As a result, the token has seen some absolutely fantastic jumps recently. Up almost 25% this week – and over 11% in just the last 24 hours – $LTC is currently trading at $127. 5. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Pro-crypto Trump’s Meme Coins Poised for Massive Growth Donald Trump’s rise to fame among crypto enthusiasts saw his own meme coin, $TRUMP, shoot up by over 12,000% in a single day almost immediately after its launch in January. Almost one month after the initial frenzy, $TRUMP has settled down and is currently trading at around $16, making it among the best cheap cryptos to buy now . Although the price has fallen, the fundamentals remain as solid as they were on day one. After all, Trump’s still seen as a crypto lover and seems to be rolling out one crypto-friendly change after another. Note the changes in the SEC leadership group, for example. All in all, the token carries unquestionable potential thanks to Trump’s seemingly pro-crypto mindset, which has been a major contributor to Bitcoin’s extremely bullish outlook for 2025 and beyond. Conclusion So these are the top crypto to buy now and potentially become a millionaire in the coming months. No promises, though, as the crypto market is quite infamous for its volatility. As always, we recommend that you only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing and do your own research before tipping your toes in crypto. Also, none of the above is financial advice.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|LTC|ASIA,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-02-11 15:53:25
40199682,https://coingape.com/?p=238450,1739289211,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Will UNI Price Soar to New ATH as Unichain Launches on Mainnet?,https://coingape.com/will-uni-price-soar-to-new-ath-as-unichain-launches-on-mainnet/,"Uniswap Labs has launched Unichain , its new Layer 2 blockchain, aiming to enhance the Ethereum ecosystem. The launch comes shortly after the introduction of Uniswap V4 , marking another major development for the decentralized exchange. Following the announcement, UNI price saw increased volatility, with traders speculating on its potential impact. Unichain Goes Live on Mainnet Unichain, which was previously available in testnet, is now live on the Ethereum mainnet. Uniswap Labs developed the new network to address fragmentation issues and improve user experience. The company aims to create a smoother and more efficient decentralized trading environment for users across multiple chains. Founder Hayden Adams stated that Uniswap has gained valuable experience from building a widely used decentralized exchange. He emphasized the importance of making cross-chain interactions more seamless. “We’re entering a cross-chain world. How do we make that feel cohesive to users?” Adams said. The Uniswap team has designed Unichain to provide faster transactions, reduce MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), and improve security. The network introduces new technologies, including Rollup-Boost, which is expected to bring sub-second block times in the coming months. How Unichain Could Influence UNI Price Following the Unichain launch, UNI price experienced fluctuations, reflecting traders’ expectations for its future performance. The Uniswap price is currently around $9.77, with a 5.79% increase over the last 24 hours. Market participants are watching whether the launch will drive UNI to reclaim previous all time highs. Technical analysis shows that UNI price faces resistance at $10.00 and $12.00. A breakout above these levels could trigger further gains toward $14.00. However, if selling pressure increases, Uniswap price could retest $8.50 or lower. The MACD indicator shows bullish signals, while the RSI hovers around 57.74, indicating a slight upward trend. However, if UNI price falls below $8.50, it could retest $7.50 as the next support zone. UNI/USD 4-hr price chart (source: TradingView) The launch of Unichain has also reignited discussions about the role of the UNI token. Although it will be used for network validation, Uniswap Labs has not confirmed whether the long-debated fee switch will be implemented. Some community members believe that enabling the fee switch could positively influence UNI price by increasing its utility. Advancements in Transaction Processing Unichain introduces a new block-building system in collaboration with Flashbots. This system is designed to improve transaction sequencing and reduce MEV risks. The network will initially feature 1-2 second block times, but the Rollup-Boost tool will later enable faster processing. Adams explained that a key challenge in Ethereum scaling is the centralization of sequencers, which handle transaction ordering. Unichain aims to address this by introducing a Validation Network, where users can stake UNI to verify transactions. “If someone doesn’t want to trust a sequencer, they can also wait for the validation network to sign off on it,” Adams said. By reducing reliance on centralized sequencers, Uniswap aims to improve security and fairness for liquidity providers and traders. These changes could further enhance confidence in Unichain, potentially supporting UNI price growth over time. Will UNI Price Reach a New ATH? The launch of Unichain has positioned Uniswap as a major player in Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem. However, its effect on UNI price will depend on user adoption, network efficiency, and market conditions. Historically, major upgrades have led to price surges in Uniswap. If Unichain successfully enhances liquidity and transaction speeds, traders may see increased demand for UNI. The token previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $19.00, and some investors speculate that further adoption could push it toward that level again. For now, Uniswap price today remains in a consolidation phase, with $10.00 acting as a key resistance. A breakout above this level could set the stage for a retest of $12.00 and potentially higher targets. Conversely, failure to hold support at $8.50 could lead to further declines.

The altcoin has been trading near the $205 but has been struggling to find footing. The altcoin has dropped by a slight 2% in the past week, staying mainly in the red. Market participants have been closely monitoring the altcoin for signs of recovery. The SOL price is now at a critical juncture, either rallying to $300 or sliding to $150. Solana's next big move will rely on market sentiment and critical resistance levels. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) has been making waves due to its presale momentum and unique PayFi solution. It bridges the speed of blockchain technology with the everyday reliability of traditional finance to enable users to send crypto as real money quickly, making it a smart choice for the future. With these strong fundamentals and growth, Remittix might eclipse SOL's recent price rally. Let's find the possibilities! Will Solana (SOL) Surge To $250 or Sink To Sink $150 Solana's price action has been under pressure, constantly declining below key support levels while decreasing trading activity. The altcoin has been confined in a narrow range and its 50-day moving average acts as a resistance, while the 200-day resistance serves as support. These levels have formed a pivotal range for SOL. A bearish RSI could indicate a possible downside momentum. If the crypto asset fails to hold the parallel channels support at $186, a further decline to $150 is likely. However, a successful close above this level might reignite buying activity, pushing the price of SOL toward $250 and even $300. Despite the recent downturn, Solana's blockchain has remained steady. In January 2025, the network recorded its highest decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, surpassing $258 billion, reflecting continued adoption and usage. The platform led in blockchain activity, bolstering 6.3 million daily active users. Moreover, the Solana ecosystem has remained alive with higher engagement, particularly in meme coins that continue to thrive. These highlight its resilience, but whether they translate to higher prices remains uncertain. Per Coincodex 's Solana price prediction, the token may not record an explosive rally but could move an inch upward. The maximum price of $210 represents a modest 10% return from its current price levels. Notably, market trends and investor sentiment will determine the next significant move. A strong breakout above the 50-day MA could set the stage for rallies toward $250 and beyond. However, a continued downturn might invite deeper corrections, dragging the altcoin to $150. Remittix Price Rally By 278% To Hit $0.0567 Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming a more reliable and consistent option by tackling genuine financial issues, including the ineffectiveness of cross-border payments. Remittix allows for quick and affordable crypto-to-fiat transactions with minimal fees, making it a compelling choice for individuals and businesses looking to transfer money across borders efficiently. In contrast to Solana, which faces greater susceptibility to market fluctuations and rivalry, Remittix's pragmatic approach provides reliable solutions for the global remittance sector. With a current price offering of $0.0567, Remittix holds a massive growth potential as its adoption grows. Remittix seeks to simplify transactions and reduce reliance on centralized financial services by bridging the gap between crypto and traditional banking systems. While Solana's future remains uncertain, Remittix's stable, real-world use case could offer investors a more reliable and safer option. This has seen Remittix's price hit impressive milestones with over $11.5 million raised in presale funding. Remittix security is also another reason why investors trust the platform. The team has run multiple safety tests and even locked funds for three years, proving their commitment. This makes Remittix different from other hyped projects focusing only on quick profits. As more businesses and individuals search for faster, low-cost cross-border payment solutions, Remittix is already leading the way. Its strong early growth and long-lasting potential have also caught the attention of savvy investors, with many viewing the project as the future of finance. Top Crypto Investment In Q1: Solana or Remittix Solana is hovering at a crossroads. While Solana blockchain fundamentals remain strong, its price actions tell the opposite story. Its technical structure aligns with the currency's bearish outlook. Meanwhile, Remittix is emerging as a rising star thanks to its impressive presale and innovative payFi solution, which has attracted investors. With solid security and excellent cross-border payment capabilities, Remittix has positioned itself as the best crypto to watch in Q1.

The altcoin has been hovering around the $205 mark but is having difficulty establishing a solid base. It has seen a slight 2% decrease over the past week, remaining mostly in the red. Traders are watching the altcoin closely for any signs of a rebound. SOL's price is at a crucial point, poised to either climb to $300 or fall to $150. The next significant move for Solana will depend on market sentiment and key resistance thresholds. On the other hand, Remittix (RTX) is gaining attention due to its presale buzz and innovative PayFi solution. By combining the swift nature of blockchain with the reliability of traditional finance, it allows users to send crypto as real money efficiently, positioning itself as a savvy choice for the future. With its strong fundamentals and growth prospects, Remittix could potentially outshine SOL's recent price surge. Let's explore the possibilities! Will Solana (SOL) Climb to $250 or Drop To $150? Solana's price has been under pressure, consistently slipping below crucial support points while experiencing reduced trading volumes. The altcoin is stuck in a tight range, with its 50-day moving average acting as resistance and the 200-day providing support. These levels have created a critical range for SOL. A bearish RSI may suggest potential downward momentum. If the crypto asset fails to maintain support at the parallel channels at $186, further decline to $150 is probable. Conversely, a successful close above this threshold could trigger renewed buying interest, propelling SOL's price toward $250 or even $300. Despite recent setbacks, Solana's blockchain remains robust. In January 2025, the network achieved its highest decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, exceeding $258 billion, indicating ongoing adoption and use. The platform leads in blockchain activity, supporting 6.3 million daily active users. Furthermore, the Solana ecosystem remains vibrant, with increased engagement, especially in thriving meme coins. These factors demonstrate resilience, but whether they will lead to higher prices is still uncertain. According to Coincodex 's Solana price prediction, the token might not experience a dramatic rally but could see a slight increase. A maximum price of $210 suggests a modest 10% gain from current levels. Ultimately, market trends and investor sentiment will dictate the next major move. A decisive breakout above the 50-day MA could pave the way for rallies to $250 and beyond. On the other hand, ongoing declines might prompt deeper corrections, pulling the altcoin to $150. Remittix Price Soars By 278% To Reach $0.0567 Remittix (RTX) is swiftly establishing itself as a more dependable and steady choice by addressing genuine financial challenges, such as inefficient cross-border payments. Remittix facilitates quick and low-cost crypto-to-fiat transactions with minimal fees, making it an attractive option for individuals and businesses aiming to transfer money across borders efficiently. In contrast to Solana, which faces more vulnerability to market fluctuations and competition, Remittix's practical approach offers reliable solutions for the global remittance industry. With a current price point of $0.0567, Remittix holds significant growth potential as its adoption increases. Remittix aims to simplify transactions and reduce dependence on centralized financial services by bridging the gap between crypto and traditional banking systems. While Solana's future remains uncertain, Remittix's stable, real-world use case could provide investors with a more reliable and safer option.

DEX,https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-hong-kong-2025-coverage/2025/02/11/what-s-better-than-cex-dex,"When it comes to trading memecoins, time is money — and waiting on a centralized exchange (CEX) could cost you both. Take $TRUMP, for example. On Jan. 17, 2025, just before his inauguration, Donald Trump launched his memecoin on Solana, which surged past a $14.5 billion peak market cap on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Raydium and Orca within little more than 24 hours, making it the second largest memecoin behind Dogecoin at one point. By the time the major CEXs listed $TRUMP a day or two later — having cleared the usual bureaucratic rigmarole — the action was over. As such, for speculators, DEXs aren’t just faster; they’re more liquid, more volatile and frankly, more fun. In a market where fortunes are made in minutes if not milliseconds, waiting for a CEX to catch up is a missed opportunity. On the Monday morning following $TRUMP memecoin mania, I spoke with Bobby Ong, co-founder of CoinGecko , the independent crypto data aggregator that has long been my personal go-to for checking token prices — along with roughly 40 million other monthly visitors, according to HypeStat.com. Founded in 2014, CoinGecko has grown into one the most trusted sources for crypto market data. Ong and I had actually scheduled the call before Christmas, so it was pure coincidence that Trump just happened to launch his memecoin a few days earlier. When we spoke, we both had the same reaction: What the hell just happened? This series is brought to you by Consensus Hong Kong. Come and experience the most influential event in Web3 and Digital Assets, Feb.18-20. Register today and save 15% with the code CoinDesk15. I’ve known Bobby for years—he’s a true OG, having first bought bitcoin in 2013 , and is one of the sharpest observers of how trading habits evolve at the grassroots level. When he started CoinGecko, it was to solve his own problem — back then, crypto price tracking was rudimentary, and there wasn’t a way to analyze market depth, liquidity, developer activity or community engagement. He wanted better insights, so he and his co-founder built the tool themselves. Ong is based in Malaysia, while I’m in the Philippines, so we’ve both spent years in Asia’s crypto scene, watching firsthand how the region has shaped — and been shaped by — crypto. With Consensus Hong Kong coming up and both of us slated to be speakers, we planned to discuss crypto adoption trends in Asia. But we ended up talking about the problems with CEX. DEX appeal For CEX users, waking up on Monday was a brutal realization: they’d already missed out on nearly 41,000% in potential gains. This was particularly gut wrenching since it wasn’t just another obscure memecoin popping off in some niche corner of the internet; it was a headline-dominating asset tied to the newly re-elected U.S. president, and still, CEXs couldn’t move fast enough. Meanwhile, in just 72 hours, Solana's DEX users recorded an unprecedented $28 billion in trading volume, largely driven by $TRUMP and the fast-following $MELANIA token. This level of DeFi engagement was unimaginable barely a few years ago, when DEXs were considered too complex for the average trader to use. But that’s no longer the case, which suggests that DeFi isn’t just an alternative to CEXs; it might just overtake them. “The experience with decentralized exchanges is superior compared to centralized exchanges, and people gravitate to that — that’s what I’m seeing in the market right now,” Ong told me. How times have changed Back in 2020, CoinGecko’s Yearly Crypto Report showed that while combined CEX and DEX trading volumes surged by $403 billion to $534 billion , CEXs accounted for 93% of that growth. Fast-forward to 2024 and that same annual report revealed that the top 10 spot DEXs had done $1.76 trillion in volume all on their own. Additionally, in Q4 of 2024, Solana overtook Ethereum for the first time as the dominant chain, reaching $219.2 billion in DEX trading volume, or over 30% of all DEX trades, compared to Ethereum’s $184.3 billion. Particularly with Solana, the ecosystem has been built with a strong emphasis on mobile applications. Wallets like Phantom and Jupiter are designed to be user-friendly for mobile trading, which is critical since most people today trade primarily through mobile apps. Ong noted that the user experience for mobile wallets has improved significantly, which in turn has enhanced the overall on-chain experience. ""Previously, we only had MetaMask on desktop, and while there was a MetaMask mobile wallet, it wasn’t very user-friendly,” he said. “But if you look at Ethereum now, you’re seeing a shift — Uniswap has its own mobile app, [non-custodial] Coinbase Wallet has improved and there are many others like Rainbow. The overall wallet experience has gotten much better compared to before, when MetaMask was one of the only options."" Ong also noted the friction involved in getting new users on-chain, but pointed out that once onboarded, they learn the ropes, enabling them to navigate the ecosystem independently. This means that future projects don’t have to spend as much time and effort onboarding. I recalled writing about Axie Infinity back in 2020 and how difficult it was for players to earn Axie’s in-game token, then sync and swap it to Ethereum and then trade it on Uniswap — it was an incredibly complicated, multi-step process . But once people overcame those initial hurdles, the next wave of projects could build on that foundation, benefiting from an already-educated user base. Over time, the challenge shifted from onboarding noobs to refining the experience and expanding what’s possible on-chain. Caught between regulators and a hard place As DeFi becomes more user friendly, and users get friendlier with DeFi, Ong told me he sees these developments as an existential threat to the CEX business. He likened the CEXs to a big supermarket with spot and futures, staking and all the things you could ever need all in one convenient place. But with all that being unbundled by DeFi, which can now be accessed via the main interface of a DEX in a user’s mobile wallet, the CEXs must figure out where they’re going to sit. That’s especially the case for CEXs that operate in jurisdictions where they lack full regulatory approval, like Binance, OKX and ByBit, since they can neither onboard shitcoins instantly like a smart contract-based non-custodial DEX — where tokens become tradable as soon as liquidity is added — nor offer fiat on/off ramps like a licensed CEX. This leaves them grasping at straws, desperate to maintain relevance. Ong gave an example: Binance has always allowed the trading of high-risk assets but its recent listing of speculative AI tokens such as ChainGPT (CGPT) and Cookie DAO (COOKIE), as well as emerging AI-driven projects such as aixbt by Virtuals (AIXBT), suggests a shift to cater to hype-driven, short-term trading. Some critics have called this out as a departure from Binance’s traditionally selective standards and a move to chase trading volume amid rising DEX competition. “They sort of have no choice because if people are trading those tokens on their own wallets on Metamask, or Aerodrome on Base, then they are not trading on Binance,” said Ong. Meanwhile, Binance’s regulatory troubles have been mounting. In mine and Bobby’s home region, countries including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia all have clear licensing requirements for crypto exchanges, with Vietnam expected to join them this year. Obviously, the level of regulation varies between these countries, with some being more relaxed and some more strict, but the point is, it's no longer a gray area. This leaves a jurisdictionally fluid CEX like Binance in the precarious position of operating in regulatory limbo, constantly facing restrictions, bans or forced exits from key markets. By contrast, DEXs have no central entity to regulate them. Without a company or headquarters to license or restrict, they exist purely as smart contracts on a blockchain, allowing them to facilitate trading without the same compliance burdens that weigh down CEXs. “Do you know of any country that’s getting anywhere close to regulating DeFi?” I asked. “No,” said Bobby, mentally chalking up another win for DEXs. Why DEXs are dominating in Asia now Southeast Asia is home to a huge population of tech-savvy youngsters eager to explore new financial opportunities but (with the exception of Singapore) the region offers limited options for high-yield investments. Unlike in the U.S., where retail investors enjoyed 23%-plus returns in the S&P 500 in both 2023 and 2024, people in the East face significant barriers to accessing such markets — for context, we don’t have any local equivalent where retail investors can cheaply and easily trade stocks via platforms like Robinhood. Most equity trading platforms in Southeast Asian markets have high barriers to entry —steep fees, lack of fractional shares, strict regulations and limited access to global equities. Instead, crypto has filled the gap. Where else can you see a token like $TRUMP explode from $7 to $75 in not much more than the space of a weekend? And while the crypto industry tries to shake its reputation for speculation, that speculative allure is exactly what keeps people coming in. These markets matter to exchanges — CEXs, DEXs and everything in between — because countries with large populations like India, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines are prime hunting grounds for user acquisition. These regions offer immense scale, but the challenge lies in the spending power of these users. GDP per capita is relatively low, and many individuals lack significant disposable income so they engage with crypto in mostly transactional ways, hunting airdrops for survival. Earning $50 to $100 from an airdrop isn’t a bonus for many people living in these countries — it can be rent, food or a full month’s wages. However, while this drives engagement, the participation is often temporary and driven by immediate financial needs rather than long-term investment or platform affinity. “A lot of them are just there to make money. They’re not even interested in decentralization or the technology. It's really just about the financial returns for many of them,” said Ong. And while CEXs serve this audience well for on/off ramps, for those seeking the highest rewards, DEXs are where the stakes — and the upside — are highest. As such, today’s degens aren’t necessarily ideologically-driven like the early Bitcoiners who championed “don’t tread on me” ideals or the ethos of “be your own bank.” They are decentralized for one reason: the money. And while poor financial literacy and FOMO often lead to losses, I personally don’t believe in shielding people from risk by making these markets inaccessible. High barriers essentially say “You’re poor and uneducated, so you can’t participate,” robbing people of the chance to learn—even if that means making mistakes. Traditional finance does the same thing by restricting startup investments to accredited investors, supposedly for protection, but in reality, just keeping the best opportunities for the wealthy. That, in my view — and in Ong’s too — is fundamentally unfair. DEXs have the upper hand right now. They offer true, open, unrestricted access to financial opportunity at lightning speed, allowing anyone, anywhere to get in on the game. How long regulators will take to catch up is anyone’s guess, but for now, we make hay while the Crypto Spring sun shines. And when the next mega memecoin kicks off, all you really need is a wallet, a DEX and the stamina to satisfy a never-ending cycle of checking, hoping and coping on CoinGecko.",Consensus Hong Kong 2025 Coverage|chk2025|CoinGecko|DEX|DeFi|CEX|Asia|Memecoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ASIA|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-11 15:55:27

Despite the prevailing bearish trend, market experts foresee a significant bullish reversal, with potential gains of up to 35%. Simultaneously, the decline in Bitcoin’s dominance has fueled expectations of a possible “altcoin season.” As the market navigates this critical juncture, two possible scenarios are unfolding: Bitcoin’s recovery or an altcoin-driven rally. Bitcoin Price Eyes $130K: Is a 35% Surge Imminent? The Bitcoin price has been hovering below the $100k mark over the past few days, trading in the red zone. Although Bitcoin has yet to breach the $100,000 threshold, analysts remain optimistic about its potential to shatter this level and surge to a staggering $130,000. In an X post , VanEck’s Head of Digital Assets Research, Matthew Sigel, predicted that the Bitcoin price would see a 35% surge, citing historical trends. Notably, Bitcoin has experienced a relatively quiet six-day period, reminiscent of the brief trading range in November 2023. The calm period was followed by a significant 35% surge within a month. Thus, the historical data suggests that the current tranquility may precede a possible price movement for Bitcoin. Corroborating Sigel’s analysis, analyst Mister Crypto projected the Bitcoin price’s trajectory to a high of $130k. Mister Crypto believes Bitcoin is on the cusp of a parabolic surge, marking the beginning of its next major upward move. It is noteworthy that the VanEck Chief’s Bitcoin analysis comes following his significant remarks on the Bitcoin reserve. In a recent post, Sigel stated that a Bitcoin reserve is key to maintaining the United States’ dominance in the global financial landscape. Will Bitcoin Bounce or Collapse? Analysts Explain As the Bitcoin price continues to fluctuate, investors wonder if the cryptocurrency could regain momentum. However, TraderPA’s optimistic forecast suggests that Bitcoin may soon experience an upward swing, potentially hitting $120,000. Meanwhile, CryptoGoos, a prominent crypto analyst, identified a crucial support area for Bitcoin around $90k. Historical patterns suggest that the breakout above the level could push the BTC price to nearly $150k. However, if Bitcoin slips below the pivotal point, the price could witness another bearish market. Investors keenly observe market movements to see whether Bitcoin will stage a recovery or succumb to further decline. Is Bitcoin Dominance Dropping? According to CryptoRank, Bitcoin dominance is marked at 57.29%, down by 1.18%. Importantly, this drop in BTC dominance signals the beginning of an altcoin rally where altcoins will outperform the pioneer cryptocurrency. Analyst Ash Crypto highlighted the current trends in the Bitcoin market and the significant dip in its dominance. The analyst stated, “Get ready for Altseason finally.” Bitcoin Price Hovers Around $95K: Will It Surge? Currently, Bitcoin is priced at $96,991, with a marginal decline of 0.19% in a day. Despite a 1.88% uptick over the last month, the Bitcoin price has experienced a notable dip of 2.9% in a week. With a market cap of $1.92 trillion, Bitcoin stands firm at the topmost position in the crypto market. Nevertheless, a notable 22.67% decline in its 24-hour trading volume suggests shifting investor attitudes. The current market trend and analysts’ insights signal a possible increase in Bitcoin’s price. However, investors must remain cautious and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.

To read full editions, subscribe . So Binance and the SEC jointly filed for a stay on their ongoing court battle, which would — if approved — give the two parties two months to pause and figure out this new era. Shocked? You shouldn’t be. Last month, Haynes Boone partner Matthew Frankle told Empire that he wouldn’t be surprised to see a bunch of the crypto-focused cases filed by a former SEC focused on regulation by enforcement dropped. So it also wouldn’t be surprising to see this type of stay filed in a case like Coinbase’s. After all, both Binance and Coinbase have been fighting the SEC for a few years now, and while there are distinct differences in the cases, there are also some similarities. Back to the filing: both sides argue that the 60-day pause would allow the SEC’s shiny new crypto task force to focus on a potential “resolution” to the case. Importantly, it sounds like the SEC was the first one to knock on Binance’s door asking for the stay. Oh, how times have changed. If I’m reading the tea leaves — or legalese if you’d prefer — then it sounds like one of the Task Force’s first orders of business is going to be sorting through the Binance case if they think a 60-day pause is enough time for both sides to figure out how to proceed. “Many cases remain in litigation, many rules remain in the proposal stage, and many market participants remain in limbo,” SEC Commissioner and task force head Hester Peirce wrote earlier this month. ”Please be patient.” If the SEC is already starting to make moves, then times really have changed and a brighter future is on the horizon.

While established cryptocurrencies continue to fluctuate, presales offer the potential for massive returns. Leading this year’s best opportunities is Web3Bay (3BAY)—a decentralized e-commerce project set to revolutionize online shopping by cutting out middlemen and reducing transaction fees. Beyond Web3Bay, four other promising crypto presales are making waves, offering unique utilities and strong growth potential. These projects, carefully selected for their innovation and scalability, could deliver significant returns in the coming months. In this article, we dive into the best crypto presales that investors should watch closely. Web3Bay (3BAY): The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is taking e-commerce to the blockchain era, eliminating the need for centralized platforms like Amazon and eBay. Traditional marketplaces charge high fees and control user transactions, but Web3Bay operates as a decentralized, user-governed marketplace, allowing buyers and sellers to transact directly using smart contracts. At the heart of Web3Bay’s ecosystem is the 3BAY token, which powers transactions, staking rewards, and governance through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This model ensures that users—not corporations—decide the platform’s future. Web3Bay Presale Highlights: Over $1.1 million raised so far, proving strong investor demand. More than 290 million tokens sold, indicating rapid adoption. Currently priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, with a projected launch price of $0.1959, offering a potential 4,200% ROI for early investors. Web3Bay isn’t just another presale token—it’s a real-world use case with the potential to disrupt a trillion-dollar industry. With blockchain adoption accelerating, Web3Bay stands out as one of the best crypto presales in 2025. The Last Dwarfs (TLD): GameFi’s Next Big Play GameFi continues to dominate the blockchain sector, and The Last Dwarfs (TLD) is at the forefront. Unlike traditional gaming projects, TLD combines staking, governance, and NFT-based ownership, creating a fully decentralized gaming economy. With an active community of 300,000+ users and partnerships with major blockchain gaming studios, TLD is attracting significant interest. The presale price of $0.085 in Stage 1 is nearing its cap, with a price increase expected soon. Investors looking for exposure to the GameFi sector should consider TLD as one of the best crypto presales for 2025. Solaxy (SOLX): The Next Big Layer-2 for Solana Solaxy is making waves as the first Layer-2 scaling solution for Solana, aiming to reduce network congestion and cut transaction fees. Solana has long been criticized for its network slowdowns, and Solaxy offers a much-needed fix. The platform features Ethereum-Solana bridging, allowing seamless cross-chain transactions. This innovation positions Solaxy as a top contender in the Layer-2 space, similar to how Arbitrum and Optimism have revolutionized Ethereum scalability. Meme Index (MEMEX): The ETF for Meme Coins Meme Index is changing how investors approach meme coins by introducing structured portfolios that reduce risk and maximize returns. With curated indexes like the Moonshot Index, Titan Index, and Frenzy Index, MEMEX provides diversified exposure to meme assets. Instead of betting on a single meme coin, investors can gain exposure to multiple high-performing tokens through a single transaction. The presale has already raised $3.3 million, and early investors can buy MEMEX tokens for $0.0158443, securing a position before major price surges. Best Wallet (BEST): The Ultimate Web3 Trading Hub Best Wallet is reinventing Web3 trading, offering an all-in-one platform for buying, staking, and launching new crypto projects. Supporting over 60 blockchains, it provides seamless integration between fiat and crypto, making it one of the most versatile wallets available. Holding $BEST tokens unlocks trading fee discounts, early access to presales, and enhanced staking rewards. Unlike standard wallets, Best Wallet functions as a launchpad for emerging crypto projects, making it one of the best crypto presales for traders looking to capitalize on early-stage investments. Invest in the Best Crypto Presales of 2025 With crypto markets expected to enter another bull cycle, early-stage investments in presales present some of the best profit opportunities. Among the projects highlighted, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as the most promising due to its real-world use case and explosive growth potential. Unlike speculative meme coins or short-term hype projects, Web3Bay is addressing a trillion-dollar e-commerce problem by decentralizing online shopping. With over $1.1 million raised, 290 million tokens sold, and a projected 4,200% ROI, Web3Bay is the best crypto presale to buy before the next rally. Other promising projects like Solaxy, The Last Dwarfs, and Best Wallet also offer high-reward potential, but Web3Bay leads the pack with real-world application, investor demand, and strong fundamentals.

33767162,[object Object],1739289620,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Gains Ground: North Carolina Moves To Establish State Reserve,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-north-carolina-to-establish-state-reserve/,"North Carolina is making a significant stride toward the integration of Bitcoin into its financial strategy. A recently introduced bill aims to enable the state treasurer to allocate a portion of public funds to digital assets, with a particular emphasis on BTC exchange-traded products (ETPs). North Carolina has become the 20th state in the United States to investigate legislation that pertains to Bitcoin reserves as a result of this action. 10% Of Budget To Bitcoin Investments The intent of House Bill 92 (HB 92), also known as the “NC Digital Assets Investments Act,” is to empower the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of state-managed funds into crypto-backed ETPs. BREAKING: NORTH CAROLINA INTRODUCES STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE BILL. IT AIMS TO BECOME FIRST U.S STATE TO BUY BITCOIN. pic.twitter.com/5uWD1xw0tx — CryptoJack (@cryptojack) February 11, 2025 House Speaker Destin Hall, Representatives Mark Brody, and Steve Ross, introduced the measure, which proposes to diversify the state’s investments by incorporating cryptocurrency exposure. According to Dan Spuller, Blockchain Association chief of Industry Affairs, Hall is “one of NC’s most powerful leaders.” To provide context, the potential for billions of dollars to enter the digital currency markets if North Carolina were to invest the entire 10% of its eligible funds is significant. This allocation could result in the procurement of tens of thousands of BTC, given that the flagship coin’s current price is approximately $98,000+. As promised, North Carolina’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve legislation was introduced today. This is a big deal.

It will directly… pic.twitter.com/QtS6Kj8CKu — Dan Spuller (@DanSpuller) February 10, 2025 The Growing Influence Of Crypto In State Investments North Carolina’s action is indicative of a more general trend in the United States, wherein states are increasingly supportive of Bitcoin as an investment-grade asset. Other states, such as Florida, Utah, and Texas, have either introduced comparable legislation or are currently conducting assessments of crypto investment strategies. Some of the main reasons for the growing interest are Bitcoin’s potential to operate as an inflation hedge and its expanding institutional acceptance. Bitcoin is presently being considered a more viable option for institutional portfolios due to its market capitalization nearing $2 trillion . The passage of HB 92 in North Carolina could further legitimize state-level Bitcoin investments and expedite similar initiatives across the country. Potential Advantages And Obstacles Supporters of the measure contend that the allocation of funds to Bitcoin-backed ETPs could generate substantial returns and establish North Carolina as a leader in financial innovation. Proponents also emphasize crypto’s historical performance, which has experienced an average annual growth rate of over 50% over the past decade. Nevertheless, not all individuals are in agreement. Critics reference the volatility of Bitcoin, the regulatory uncertainties, and the dangers associated with linking public funds to digital assets. In recent years, BTC has experienced a significant increase, but it has also experienced significant declines, which has raised concerns about financial stability.

IntelMarkets, a presale-stage project raising $8.5 million, will combine AI trading bots with dual-chain functionality on Ethereum and Solana. Analysts believe this could signal a new phase where meme coins like DOGE intersect with AI infrastructure to boost utility. As crypto giants like Ethereum face pressure to innovate, projects like IntelMarkets could become top crypto picks for traders seeking automated, high-leverage strategies. Experts think the INTL token’s $0.082 presale price offers early access to next-gen tools. Dogecoin (DOGE) Whales Back AI Crypto Platforms With Major Investments Current blockchain traffic data reveals Dogecoin (DOGE) whales are steering their assets toward artificial intelligence cryptocurrency projects which indicates changing market tendencies. DOGE has experienced a 24.65% price decline worth $0.25 since the last month while maintaining a $37.1 billion market value. Despite this, large investors have purchased over 750 million DOGE during dips, suggesting confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts believe these moves highlight a growing interest in platforms that combine blockchain with artificial intelligence, which could redefine how traders interact with digital assets. Experts think Dogecoin’s connection to major AI projects like IntelMarkets (INTL) could drive future demand for DOGE. While DOGE remains a popular meme coin, its integration into ecosystems powered by advanced technologies may help stabilize its value.

Ethereum (ETH) Faces Rising Competition in Blockchain AI Integration Newer blockchain projects that focus on AI capability have started to compete with Ethereum for control of smart contracts operations. Analysts at JPMorgan have observed Ethereum’s decentralized application market share decrease below 60% because of growing success among Solana and IntelMarkets projects. While Ethereum still leads in areas like decentralized finance, its high transaction costs and slower speeds have pushed developers toward alternatives. IntelMarkets, for example, operates on both Ethereum and Solana blockchains, offering users flexibility and lower fees. This dual-chain approach could attract ETH investors seeking exposure to AI-driven trading tools without fully exiting the Ethereum ecosystem. Industry analysts believe Ethereum must accelerate upgrades to retain its position, especially as AI becomes central to blockchain innovation. Meanwhile, platforms like IntelMarkets are positioning themselves as top crypto coins to watch, blending Ethereum’s security with cutting-edge AI capabilities. IntelMarkets (INTL) Unveils Proprietary AI Trading Infrastructure for Growth IntelMarkets (INTL) is emerging as a standout among new DeFi projects, with its presale raising $8.5 million ahead of its official launch. The platform will use a proprietary AI blockchain to power self-learning trading bots trained on over 100,000 data points. These bots will automatically adjust strategies based on real-time market conditions, offering users institutional-grade tools typically reserved for professional traders. Experts think this could make INTL a good crypto to buy for those seeking exposure to AI’s transformative potential. The project’s dual compatibility with Ethereum and Solana allows traders to choose between ecosystems, balancing cost and functionality. With features like 1000x leverage and quantum-proof security, IntelMarkets aims to address common pain points in crypto trading. Analysts believe the INTL token, priced at $0.082 during its ninth presale stage, has significant upside potential once listed on major exchanges. Insiders consider it one of the best new cryptos to invest in, with predictions of a 65x surge post-launch. As Dogecoin whales and Ethereum investors explore AI-driven opportunities, IntelMarkets’ unique infrastructure positions it as a top crypto to watch in 2025. Conclusion: As Dogecoin whales bet on AI-powered platforms, projects like IntelMarkets could redefine how traders approach crypto markets. With presale participation nearing $8.5 million, experts think the INTL token’s current $0.082 price offers a rare entry point before its exchange debut. Early adopters might gain access to tools like 1000x leverage and self-learning bots designed to simplify trading. For those looking to diversify beyond DOGE or ETH, IntelMarkets’ blend of AI and blockchain innovation could be worth exploring.

However, he hinted at plans to further decentralize the chain in the coming months. “It only gets better from here,” Adams tweeted. The Uniswap Labs co-founder also teased upcoming improvements, including Flashblocks, which will enable sub-second block times and improve transaction transparency. Adams also mentioned working closely with Optimism to build collaboration with other L2s, making it easier to execute swaps, move liquidity, and experience DeFi. Unichain will leverage the Unichain Validation network for staking and blockchain security. The new L2 will channel 65% of its net revenue to UVN as an “additional layer of economic security and validation.” According to Adams, Unichain launched with over 80 projects and processed more than 100 million transactions during its four-month testnet phase, which began in October 2024. Uniswap’s new L2 will also integrate with Transak, a crypto on- and off-ramp service provider. The partnership will enable users to buy and sell digital assets via Transak’s payment infrastructure. We believe that innovation lies at the intersection of accessibility and technology. Unichain’s vision to be a high performance rollup that scales Ethereum and powers DeFi complements our mission at Transak to make decentralized finance accessible to everyone.

Today, SEDA announced the first-of-its-kind Interoperability Verification Module framework. SEDA IVMs are a plug-and-play verification solution for interoperability protocols, adding significantly upgraded security, near-instant horizontal scaling, and increased decentralization out of the box. Interoperability providers integrating the SEDA IVM can access a hyper-specialized framework for independent, permissionless verification of any cross-chain transaction across all routes. The SEDA IVM framework is built to serve the modularization of Interoperability architecture necessary to scale from the current landscape of 347 active networks to an estimated 2,000+ chains by 2026. The IVM framework leverages a multi-layer verification process consisting of an independent overlay network, decentralized solvers, and a combination of private and public RPC data providers. With nearly $2 billion lost in bridge hacks since 2020 , the SEDA IVM presents a critical piece of industry-needed security infrastructure. Built to offer a robust, scalable, and customizable module, the IVM provides independent decentralized verification for millions of transactions across thousands of networks. Key features and benefits of the SEDA IVM include: Industry-wide data parity with a singular security zone. Built-in liveness guarantees. Programmable design to suit specific needs of bridge, solver, and abstraction layers. Permissionless access and deployments. ""The demand for robust interoperability infrastructure has surged as users and developers engage with hundreds of specialized networks,"" said Peter Mitchell, CEO and Co-founder of SEDA. ""Over the last two years, the interoperability sector has expanded dramatically, achieving a transaction volume of over $123 billion in 2024. Projections indicate this sector could reach over $250 billion in 2025. Our IVMs represent a significant advancement for Interop 3.0, allowing any interoperability provider to customize parameters within the SEDA IVM framework, ensuring independent verification across all routes through a single deployment."" Parallel to a message relayed between chains, the IVM automatically initiates a secure verification sequence, in which a dedicated secret committee of independent overlay nodes is formed to query RPC data on the source chain. Results are returned via a commit-reveal scheme for data integrity and preventing manipulation, after which protocol-defined instructions filter and order results before being batched on SEDA's main chain. Data results are secured with tamper-proof cryptographic guarantees before being relayed by solvers to the destination chain. The SEDA IVM directly addresses recent industry challenges, such as the Stargate bridge downtime caused by an offline multi-sig verifier. By plugging into SEDA’s distributed verification architecture, interoperability providers inherit security and liveness guarantees associated with SEDA’s Network design, consisting of a performant layer one, a highly decentralized overlay network, and a censorship-resistant solver network. This design mitigates collusion risk and downtime commonly associated with default multi-sig relay setups, which secure over $10 billion in monthly volume. By decoupling verification, interoperability providers can focus on scaling services to thousands of new chains, allowing SEDA to provide specialized verification for all routes.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Toncoin investors shift focus to Solana and 1Fuel, with analysts predicting higher growth for 1Fuel post-listing. Table of Contents Toncoin loses investors as value declines Solana attracts traders with 2025 price predictions 1Fuel stands as a solid investment in 2025 Exciting presale offers many investment opportunities Toncoin (TON) investors are doing a U-turn right now as the coin’s value drops drastically over the past month. Meanwhile, most of these whales are leaning towards cryptocurrencies with high growth potential, like Solana (SOL) and 1Fuel (OFT) . Solana has attracted millions of investors with its positive price predictions for 2025. As for 1Fuel, it has become a strong choice this year, as analysts predict it might actually grow by 100x after the public listing. You might also like: 1Fuel gains momentum as XRP whales continue sell-offs Toncoin loses investors as value declines Toncoin long-term holders seem to be leaving their investment behind, especially since the coin has struggled to meet the $5 support level. Its current price is $3.70, but it might be disappointing to find out that this is 30.20% less than it was a month ago. Even worse, TON has dropped by a massive 24.60% in the last week, causing investors to lose their profit and consider other alternatives that might be top crypto investments. However, there is still some value in TON, as it is expected to surpass the $5 level later this year. So, investors are now holding it on platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Solana attracts traders with 2025 price predictions Solana is known as one of the leading cryptocurrency investments out there, especially with its blockchain system. As TON loses investors, some of them have gone towards SOL instead. SOL is currently valued at $190.95, but analysts are optimistic that it will actually hit the $500 mark by the end of the year. The general market sentiment for Solana price remains optimistic that the bulls will defend the price from going below the $170 support level. This could give it room to create a new all-time high at $500 later in 2025 as an altcoin to watch out for. SOL is still popular among investors, as well as Trust Wallet and MetaMask holders. 1Fuel stands as a solid investment in 2025 1Fuel has emerged as a solid investment for 2025, especially over coins like Toncoin and Solana. Because of this, it’s attracting a lot of interest from investors and has already raised a whopping $2 million in the presale stage. So far, 1Fuel has sold 191 million tokens and is fast approaching the stage 4 presale. The value of 1Fuel is mainly because of its robust DEX wallet, which helps users manage altcoins from a single wallet. The wallet comes with cross-chain swaps, which allow users to send tokens from one blockchain to another in a single click. This makes it better than other wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Even better, 1Fuel is now a top altcoin to watch out for, especially since it has impressive financial tools like a debit and credit card for cryptocurrency. The early investors from the presale stage can get priority access to the crypto card. Other tools that investors can enjoy are AI features and peer-to-peer exchange. 1Fuel is also offering advanced privacy tools, unlike platforms like Trust Wallet and MetaMask, which have limited security features. These tools include the built-in privacy mixer and cold storage, keeping user information away from the public eye. All of these features make 1Fuel stand out as one of the top crypto investments. Exciting presale offers many investment opportunities The 1Fuel presale is offering an exciting opportunity that early investors cannot miss out on. Now approaching stage 4, 1Fuel is expected to skyrocket by 100x by the end of the year. Join other experienced investors to take part in the exciting presale.

It was alleged that a total of almost $8 billion worth of crypto assets were sold since Binance’s last Proof of Reserves (PoS) report. The allegations included that the exchange’s extra Bitcoin holdings dropped from 46,896 BTC to 2,747 BTC between January 2025 and February 2025, its Ethereum holdings dropped from 216,313 ETH to 175 ETH, and the majority of its assets were converted to USDC.

According to Binance officials, the situation was explained as follows: “Binance is not selling assets. This is simply an adjustment to the accounting process of the Binance treasury. User funds are SAFU as always.” When historical data is examined, we see that similar asset sales occurred in June 2023 and February 2024, when Binance had to pay a large fine.

Lido, the leading liquid staking protocol, has launched Lido v3, an update to provide increased flexibility and composability for institutional Ethereum stakers. According to analysts, this upgrade is major step toward Ethereum staking as US awaits staked ETH ETF approval. Lido V3 Introduces stVaults Lido, an Ethereum staking solution, revealed that its latest version, Lido v3, is set to launch this summer, according to an announcement today. The upcoming Lido v3 will feature “stVaults,” modular smart contracts that enhance the flexibility of its liquid staking framework. These vaults will allow users to implement sophisticated staking strategies using Lido’s stETH token. A primary function of the stVaults includes tailored staking configurations for institutional users, which support compliance requirements and offer operational control. This includes customized validator options and precise deposit and withdrawal procedures. Introducing Lido V3: Ethereum Staking Infrastructure https://t.co/SYNSBW6S6R Advancing Ethereum staking with stVaults. pic.twitter.com/nMFhGlLDL3 — Lido (@LidoFinance) February 11, 2025 This initiative shows the increasing interest from institutions in Ethereum staking as financial firms plan for incorporating yield-generating crypto products into their portfolios. The stVaults aim to meet this demand by offering modular components that address various staking requirements. The team indicated that such customization could enhance validator diversity, which would, in turn, improve network security and trigger competition among validators to deliver superior performance. Lido dominates the liquid staking market as the largest protocol, securing over $25.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), which represents more than 50% of Ethereum’s liquid staking sector, according to DefiLlama data. Since Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election, there’s been an increase in interest from institutions in Ethereum staking products. This is partly because they expect his administration to be more supportive of cryptocurrency over the next four years. Trump Could Accelerate Staked ETH ETF Approval A Trump administration is expected to be more supportive of cryptocurrency industry innovations, including the launch of the first staked Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). Bernstein Research anticipates that under a “new Trump 2.0 crypto-friendly” Securities and Exchange Commission, Ether ETFs will soon include staking yields.

Though sentiment for Ethereum’s ether (ETH) has been low recently, a move by a Trump-related crypto platform might signal a potential turnaround. In January, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi platform associated with the Trump family, deposited 10,000 ether (worth $33 million) into Lido Finance (LDO) for staking. This action raised hopes that regulators might soon approve staking for spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Last month, SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce, now head of the agency’s crypto task force, expressed openness to this idea. The potential regulatory approval could also boost ETH’s price and the value of related ecosystem tokens such as Lido’s LDO. However, Ethereum has faced criticism due to its declining prices compared to competitors, leadership conflicts, and concerns about its development roadmap. ETH’s value recently fell to a four-year low against Bitcoin and lost trading activity market share to fast-expanding blockchains like Solana.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin ETF|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|LDO|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-11 17:22:35

BERA token price has plunged by about 70% from its all-time high as investors remain on the sidelines. So, will the coin rebound and retest its all-time high of $15.45? Arthur Hayes Explains The BERA Token Price Crash In an X post, Arthur Hayes, a popular crypto investor and founder of BitMex, blasted Berachain founders for the crash . He noted that the coin would have done better if the developers had worked with market makers and exchange partners to set the ideal BERA token price. He said : “ Work with your market makers and exchange partners to open the market at lower prices. This chart is ugly not cause the project is dogshit but bc the price is too damn high. Bring your users on a wealth generation journey with you.” BERA token price has mirrored that of other recently launched airdrops. Hamster Kombat price has crashed by over 80% from its all-time high. Other Telegram tokens like Catizen, DOGS, and Notcoin have also plunged after their airdrops. Similarly, other utility tokens like Grass, Wormhole, and ZkSync tokens have all crashed since their airdrops. Most of these tokens also lagged behind other tokens even as most altcoins rebounded in November. A likely reason for the BERA token price is the future dilution since only 107.48 million tokens are in circulation against a total supply of 500 million. Further, and most importantly, is the fact that the Berachain airdrop happened when most altcoins were in a bear market. Will the Berachain Price Rebound to ATH? Historical data from some of the most recent airdrops show that BERA token price faces a major challenge going back to a record high. All the tokens mentioned above are yet to rebound and remain over 50% below their all-time high. It is also unclear whether Berachain’s strong ecosystem will help to support its growth. DeFi Llama shows that Berachain has a total value locked of over $1.92 billion, making it the 9th biggest chain in crypto. It is bigger than popular chains like Sui, Avalanche, Aptos, and Polygon. BERA Price Technical Analysis Berachain token is a fairly new coin, meaning that its chart is not ideal for long-term technical analysis. On the 30-minute chart, however, we see that the BERA token price has formed a rising broadening wedge pattern, which is usually a bearish one. BERA Token Price The token has now moved to the seventh wave of this wedge pattern. In most cases, an asset will typically rebound and move above the wedge and then crash.

The network has been in testing since October and now moves to full deployment. Unichain mainnet is live ✸ Fast with low fees ✸ Built for cross-chain liquidity ✸ Prioritizes decentralization from day one You can now deploy DeFi apps, launch tokens, swap, provide liquidity, and more pic.twitter.com/MqJQwum4Bf — Unichain (@unichain) February 11, 2025 Nearly 100 crypto protocols, including Uniswap, Circle, Coinbase, Lido, and Morpho, have committed to building on Unichain, signaling strong early adoption. With its launch, Uniswap introduces a new infrastructure designed to support developers and users in DeFi applications. Unichain: A Layer 2 Network According to Uniswap , Unichain is built to provide its users with near-instant transaction finality and lower fees compared to Ethereum Layer 1. During its testnet phase, the network processed 95 million transactions and supported the deployment of over 14.7 million smart contracts, showing strong early adoption from the developer community. Unichain users can swap assets, provide liquidity, launch tokens, and access DeFi applications with minimal friction. Uniswap explains that developers can use its network to deploy Uniswap v4 hooks, integrate stablecoins like USDC, and build new financial tools that benefit from Unichain’s speed and cost efficiency. In January, Uniswap announced that its highly anticipated version 4 (v4) will be “coming soon” in 2025, after missing its initial Q3 2024 launch target. ┏━━┓┏━━┓┏━━┓┏━━┓ ┗━┓┃┃┏┓┃┗━┓┃┃┏━┛ ┏━┛┃┃┃┃┃┏━┛┃┃┗━┓ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ v4 is coming soon ┃┏━┛┃┃┃┃┃┏━┛┗━┓┃ ┃┗━┓┃┗┛┃┃┗━┓┏━┛┃ ┗━━┛┗━━┛┗━━┛┗━━┛ — Uniswap Labs (@Uniswap) January 1, 2025 The update was teased on January 2 in a post by Uniswap Labs on X , featuring a Unicode graphic of “2025” and the caption, “v4 is coming soon.” Decentralization and Cross-Chain Innovation Uniswap Labs said it is committed to decentralization from the outset, launching Unichain as a Stage 1 rollup. This means it includes a permissionless fault-proof system, ensuring transparent and verifiable transactions. Over time, the Unichain Validation Network (UVN) will allow anyone to run a node and verify blocks, further decentralizing the network. Interoperability is also a key focus. Unichain will support ERC-7683 , a new standard designed to enable fast, secure cross-chain transactions. Additionally, Unichain is built on the Superchain, a framework that will allow single-block message passing across multiple chains later this year. Unichain delivers 1-second block times and 95% lower gas fees compared to Ethereum Layer 1 . Future upgrades, including TEE-based block building and 250-millisecond effective block times, will further enhance performance while minimizing MEV-related inefficiencies. Looking ahead, Uniswap Labs’ official launch of Unichain mainnet may broaden DeFi participation and spark fresh activity across the sector. By prioritizing low fees, swift block times, and community-driven governance, it sets the stage for further expansion in decentralized finance.

The news comes as Bitcoin demand hits new highs, while physical gold is also being scooped up at record rates. Analysts say the shrinking supply could trigger a “supply shock” scenario, where strong demand drives prices up rapidly. Bitcoin Exchange Reserve – Source: CryptoQuant Global trade tensions have flared up after new import tariffs were announced by both the US and China. As a result, investors appear cautious, pulling money from ETFs. Data from Farside shows US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $186 million on February 10, reversing the previous day’s inflows of $171 million. A slip in Bitcoin’s price below $95,000 will liquidate over $1.52 billion worth of leveraged long positions across all exchanges, per data from Coinglass. Bitcoin network activity collapses to a one-year low Bitcoin’s price might be holding for now, but network activity tells a different story. CryptoQuant’s Network Activity Index shows a dramatic drop to its lowest level in a year, down 15% from November 2024’s record high. The current index reading is 3,760, a number not seen since February last year. The daily number of Bitcoin transactions has fallen by 53% since September 2024, with just 346,000 transactions recorded today compared to an all-time high of 734,000. The decline is closely tied to the crumbling of the RUNES protocol, which once drove token minting and transfers on the network. CryptoQuant data shows that the daily use of OP RETURN codes—critical for the RUNES protocol—has nosedived. In April 2024, when RUNES launched, OP RETURN code usage spiked to 802,000 per day. Today, that figure has plummeted to just 10,000, and in the mempool, the space where pending transactions wait to be processed, transactions waiting for confirmation have dropped from 287,000 in December to just 3,000 today—a 99% decline. It’s a level of inactivity not seen since March 2022. There’s also growing concern that Bitcoin is overvalued based on network activity. CryptoQuant’s Metcalfe valuation model, which calculates fair value using network data, shows that Bitcoin should be priced somewhere between $48,000 and $95,000. This is based on its trading behavior within the red and blue Metcalfe bands over the past year. If the price doesn’t find stronger fundamentals soon, market corrections to at least $70k levels seem unavoidable, as was already predicted by BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes. Gold demand also surges As aforementioned, physical gold buying is going wild. In just two months, inventories in the top three COMEX gold vaults have surged by 15 million ounces, which is a 115% increase. COMEX, a subsidiary of CME Group, reports that this surge has pushed total gold holdings above levels seen during the peak of the 2020 pandemic. Metal Depository Statistics | Source: CME Group The gold rush is centered in the US, where demand for secure storage has spiked. January alone saw more than 19,000 contracts delivered, setting an all-time record. COMEX vaults, located under and around Manhattan, New York, are bursting at the seams, with a total of 35.5 million troy ounces stored right now. Gold prices are up 40% year-over-year, defying expectations. And normally, a price surge of this magnitude would trigger a massive correction, but that hasn’t happened yet. Instead, data from the CFTC shows that net long positions are on track to break their 2024 highs, while short positions are at their lowest levels since the start of the 2020 pandemic. Net Futures Positioning | Source: CFTC China has also joined the buying spree, as its central bank purchased five tonnes of gold in January, its third consecutive month of doing that. Also, Chinese gold ETFs have tripled in value over the past 18 months, with $9.5 billion now locked in these funds, according to data from the CFTC. Interestingly, gold has actually outperformed the US stock market over the past 12 months, as the precious metal delivered double the returns of the S&P 500’s 22% rally.

Speaking at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business in London, Bailey addressed the evolving landscape of financial markets and the role of digital assets. Bank of England Chief Urges Tougher Stablecoin Rules Andrew Bailey, Bank of England Governor, stated that stablecoins require strict regulatory measures due to their role in payments. He described them as financial instruments that perform some functions of money but also share characteristics with mutual funds. Bailey emphasized that stablecoins need a clear framework to meet high regulatory standards. Moreover, Bailey highlighted the difference between stablecoins and Bitcoin, noting that Bitcoin operates outside the banking system and remains a speculative asset. He clarified that Bitcoin is not a form of money but a high-risk investment option. However, he acknowledged that investors might hold it as part of a diversified portfolio, provided they understand the risks. However, Andrew expressed uncertainty about the incoming Trump administration crypto regulations . Comparing the development to the previous Biden administration, the BoE Governor commented, “I think that the Biden administration, my impression is particularly the SEC, had got into a situation where it couldn’t get a regulatory framework and was using action through the courts. And that was becoming more challenging, frankly. So there is a gap there in terms of having a consistent regulatory framework, but we don’t know what that’s going to be.” Digital Pound In Sight? Additionally, the Bank of England is still evaluating the introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in collaboration with the UK government. Bailey stated that discussions are ongoing regarding the potential benefits of a digital pound in the financial system. The governor compared the situation to early skepticism around smartphones, emphasizing the need to explore the advantages of digital payment innovations. The Bank of England is examining whether a digital pound would be necessary or if existing commercial bank payment systems could provide similar benefits. These developments come as the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently reaffirmed the central bank’s commitment to ending debanking practices . Powell indicated that the Federal Reserve plans to revise its Internal Implementation Handbook, removing a section that considers bank leaders’ “controversial” activities in performance evaluations. Bitcoin and Stablecoins Regulatory Approach Concurrently. Bailey explained that Bitcoin and stablecoins require distinct regulatory approaches. Bitcoin, according to him, is a speculative asset that does not function as money, whereas stablecoins have a direct connection to payment systems and require closer oversight. He also pointed out that stablecoins, despite being backed by assets, lack full transparency. Due to their potential use in financial transactions, the Bank of England intends to impose strict regulatory measures to ensure consumer protection. More so, the Bank of England is preparing to launch a “Digital Pound Lab” as part of its ongoing research into a CBDC. This initiative will contribute to the design and evaluation phase of a digital pound. Meanwhile, the Hester Peirce-led US SEC Crypto Task Force has outlined its key objectives on a newly launched webpage, aiming to provide clearer regulatory guidance. The task force will distinguish securities from non-securities, establish practical disclosure frameworks, and create viable registration pathways for crypto firms.

With a 25.62% gain over the past week, Litecoin stands out as the biggest beneficiary among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. These moves are largely bolstered by recent Bloomberg reports citing Litecoin as the most likely altcoin to receive a U.S. Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) approval this year. NEW: @EricBalchunas and I took a look at the filings for spot crypto ETFs. We're putting out relatively high odds of approval across the board. Mainly focused on Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin for now. Here's the table with the odds and some other details: pic.twitter.com/xaXaNXLb0M — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) February 10, 2025 The altcoin has been assigned 90% odds, the highest of any other ETFs in consideration. LTC Price Analysis: How Much Further Could the Rally Go? This week’s growth affirms the breakout potential of a massive symmetrical triangle pattern that’s been forming since early 2022. LTC / USDT 1W chart, symmetrical triangle breakout. Source: TradingView. After a breakout in late November, Litecoin has suffered notable volatility amidst wider market fluctuations. While much of the post-breakout momentum has materialized, the pattern still sets a $180 target, signaling a potential 40% advance from current prices. However, technical indicators reveal mixed signals. The MACD line narrowly avoided a death cross, maintaining its position above the signal line— a sign that the bulls remain firmly in control. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 62, edging closer to the oversold threshold at 75. At this pace, a minor correction is required to prevent buyer exhaustion and keep selling pressure in check, potentially to the next significant support at $121.80. Without confirming a stable uptrend, the next few days will be crucial in determining if Litecoin can sustain its rally toward the $180 mark. However, with the introduction of a potential Litecoin ETF this ceiling could be raised much higher, with some forecasts targeting $250. Litecoin Might Not See the Best of this Bull Cycle While the LTC price stands to see further tailwinds in 2025, 2024 proved meme coins as the foremost sector driving gains this cycle. Post-inauguration “meme coin mania” has solidified this trend and made the Solana network a goldmine for 10-100x meme coin opportunities , but the trading volume it brings has taken a toll. As any user would know, failed transactions are the platform’s biggest gripe. Well, Solaxy ($SOLX) , the first-ever Layer-2 solution built on Solana, heeds the answer to this call—all the while riding its tailwinds. Unlike Ethereum, which boasts several Layer-2 options, Solana has long lacked this capability—until now. And Investors are flocking, with almost $20 million raised in its presale already . By processing transactions off-chain and finalizing them on Solana, Solaxy significantly reduces congestion and lowers transaction costs, while offering seamless interoperability across both blockchains. To reward early adopters, Solaxy currently offers staking yields of 224%, though these rates will decrease as more users stake $SOLX .

Why Meme Coins Are Still a Smart Investment Once dismissed as nothing more than joke tokens, meme coins have proven they can deliver serious returns. Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin, and other meme coins have turned early adopters into millionaires. But why do these coins continue to thrive?

I think we have to have it.” The US president added that it’ll happen only after he speaks with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. “One of the things I’ll be doing with President Xi and with Putin and everybody else is saying, let’s ease up on all this, you know, building all of this, you know, the bombs,” Trump said, calling current spending on unused weapons “crazy.” D.O.G.E. digs into defense spending Military spending made up nearly half of the $1.8 trillion discretionary budget in 2024, with the US shelling out more on defense than the next nine countries combined, according to data from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency, or D.O.G.E., was set up to tear through the federal budget and cut $2 trillion in expenses—more than all discretionary spending in a single year. D.O.G.E. has already ripped into agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and USAID, freezing operations and triggering legal battles. Now it’s digging through the Pentagon’s financial books, reviewing payment systems, employee communications, and the Defense Department’s audit trail. Elon, who described many weapons programs as needing to be “completely redone” or shut down, is determined to cut defense expenses. Congress, defense contractors, and legal obstacles stall budget cuts The US deficit hit 6.4% of GDP last year, more than double Europe’s 3% target. Economists say that reducing the shortfall could lower bond yields and spark investment. But so far, D.O.G.E.’s aggressive approach has thrown Wall Street into confusion. Analysts are struggling to model realistic scenarios for Elon’s cuts, with many admitting they can’t predict how D.O.G.E. will affect markets. One major roadblock is, of course, the Congress. The US Constitution gives Congress authority over federal spending, which means Elon and Trump can’t just cut defense budgets without approval. The Republican-majority House and Senate are divided. Some Republicans want deep spending cuts, even in defense. But others, like Trump and his VP J.D. Vance, want to pump more money into the military. Now, military funding is spread across many states, with bases, contracts, and factories providing jobs that lawmakers want to protect. Any mention of defense cuts is gonna bring a ton of backlash and resistance. Even politicians who back spending cuts overall balk when it comes to their own districts. Meanwhile, the Democrats are understandably quite unhappy with Elon and Trump’s D.O.G.E. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to defend D.O.G.E.’s actions during a Bloomberg interview, saying, “This is not some rogue band going around doing things; this is methodical.” But the courts tell a different story. Judges have already blocked many of D.O.G.E.’s actions, including the freezing of federal loans and grants and the closure of USAID. Interestingly, Federal Judge John McConnell, who ordered Trump’s administration to unfreeze federal grants and stop Elon from accessing federal data, has a daughter, Catherine McConnell, who works as a senior policy advisor at the Department of Education. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier this month, this is yet another agency Trump and Elon are eyeing for budget cuts .

Amongst the top affected altcoins were PEPE and Ripple, as their tokens saw double-digit drops. While the XRP price has shown some resilience and is rebounding, PEPE is completely under bear pressure for now. Based on its speed, utility, and affordability, XRP price growth has been phenomenal, and the platform has shown why it is the top crypto option for cross-border transactions. However, Ripple’s strong market earnings haven’t stopped investors from identifying a more promising new crypto. This is the hybrid trading platform DTX Exchange . In just a few months of its presale, DTX Exchange has shown significant growth, raising over $13.6 million already. According to some predictions, the DTX token has a good chance to rise by 100% this year. The DTX platform provides a secure and fast experience for crypto traders. Ripple’s XRP Price Maintains $2.4 Range For the past month, the XRP price has been over $3, only dropping below $3 in February. Since then, the XRP price has dropped deeply, and it is currently struggling to maintain the $2.4 price. In the past two weeks, XRP price has moved between a high of $3.07 and a low of $2.1. The future XRP price trend seems to be bullish, as the market volume is up by 47%. However the XRP price is still down slightly, pushing many Ripple holders to move their holdings to DTX Exchange with its strong upside potential. PEPE Drops 47% In Volatile Month PEPE is down by 47% in the monthly charts and is trading around $0.0000095. PEPE is a popular meme coin that has experienced high price fluctuations with the markets as most meme coins. Sunday charts show that PEPE’s market volume is rising by 40% as experts expect some recovery. However, investors are still moving their holdings to the DTX Exchange with its strong gain potential. DTX Exchange: Outperforming PEPE and XRP Prices DTX Exchange is emerging as a strong competitor, with crypto experts predicting it could outperform established tokens like Ripple and PEPE. This is because of DTX’s innovative features which smoothly integrate with both decentralized finance and traditional finance. DTX Exchange (DTX) offers traders access to 120,000 financial assets so that they can trade easily. Built on the high-performance VulcanX blockchain, DTX also offers traders rapid transaction processing. The VulcanX blockchain is capable of handling more than 200,000 transactions per second. Security is also a main focus for DTX , which is why the platform uses non-custodial asset management, which allows users to retain full control of their private keys and assets. This way, the risk of fund loss becomes virtually zero. DTX has already raised over $13.6 million within eight stages of its presale. Over 75% of stage 8 is already sold out, being the last stage before the official listing. Currently, DTX tokens are available for $0.16, and this price will increase to $0.20 upon listing, with experts anticipating a huge price surge of up to 100% and above. Final Thoughts PEPE and XRP’s price performance remains a topic of concern in the crypto space, but new projects like DTX Exchange are attracting early investors who see potential in emerging trends. While no investment is risk-free, history suggests that projects with real-world utility and strong fundamentals tend to perform well over time. Due to this, platforms like DTX Exchange are emerging as a better alternative, with analysts predicting that it could outshine both PEPE and Ripple.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Peter Brandt forecasts a short-term ETH pump, investors are turning to WallitIQ for its profit potential. Table of Contents Peter Brandt’s ETH price projection WallitIQ’s profit potential Conclusion A recent Ethereum (ETH) price projection has sparked a flurry of speculation as expert trader and analyst, Peter Brandt foresees a short pump for ETH. While some ETH holders are waiting to capitalize on the anticipated pump, other investors are scouting for alternative opportunities that promise exponential profit. One name gaining traction is WallitIQ (WLTQ), a rising star in the AI-powered DeFi space. With a presale that’s quickly selling out at $0.0420, this project is predicted to deliver massive profits with its next price bump. Peter Brandt’s ETH price projection Analyst Peter Brandt has highlighted in his Ethereum price projection that ETH could experience a short-term pump, potentially pushing it beyond crucial resistance levels. ETH’s current value stands at $2,636, reflecting a 19.87% decline over the past 30 days, 5.84% over the past 7 days, and 1.39% in the past 24 hours. Despite the optimistic price projection, Peter Brandt warns that ETH’s current volatility could lead to profit-taking, quickly reversing the gains. As such, some investors are increasingly looking for alternatives that offer more lucrative opportunities. This brings WallitIQ into the spotlight, with its presale tokens currently sold 400% below their listing price. You might also like: ETH holders in FTX stand to gain $2.5k as repayments start Feb. 18 WallitIQ’s profit potential The key to WallitIQ’s profit potential lies in its tokenomics and utility. This project is designed to provide a more advanced, AI-driven ecosystem that prioritizes user experience and value growth. WallitIQ’s tokenomics are strategically designed for long-term profit and scalability. A significant portion of the token supply is allocated for presale, referral bonuses, staking rewards (180% APY), community rewards, and airdrops to make sure both early investors and long-term holders benefit. Moreover, the limited token supply coupled with a strategic value increase from presale to official listing positions investors for substantial profits in the near future. WallitIQ’s near-zero swapping fees will offer another major advantage. This cost efficiency is crucial for traders who do not want to lose a significant portion of their profit to transaction fees. Additionally, with trading tools like predictive analytics and risk management systems, the platform will help users make smarter decisions that increase their profit potential. In terms of security, WallitIQ is fully audited by SolidProof , with advanced AES & ECC encryption, and AI-driven anomaly detection. This makes sure that users can trade with confidence. The WallitIQ MVP build has already launched, showcasing core features that offer simple solutions to everyday crypto needs. The MVP version of the platform allows users to manage multiple wallets, track real-time pricing data, and conveniently perform transactions, demonstrating the platform’s usability and future potential. The beta platform launch will soon give investors and traders access to a more comprehensive experience, offering them an opportunity to test all its features before the official launch. Conclusion While ETH continues to dominate the market, its predicted short price pump may not provide the massive returns that ambitious investors seek. WallitIQ offers a compelling alternative at a lower cost. As its presale advances, prices are set to rise gradually, delivering profits to early investors.

Both tokens have experienced substantial drops, with XRP showing signs of recovery while PEPE remains heavily impacted by bearish trends. XRP's impressive price growth can be attributed to its speed, utility, and cost-effectiveness, solidifying its position as a leading choice for cross-border transactions. Despite Ripple’s robust market performance, investors are exploring other promising crypto opportunities, such as the hybrid trading platform DTX Exchange . In a short span during its presale, DTX Exchange has demonstrated remarkable progress, raising over $13.6 million. Projections suggest the DTX token could potentially double in value this year. The platform offers a secure and efficient trading experience for crypto enthusiasts. XRP Struggles to Hold the $2.4 Mark Throughout the last month, XRP's price has stayed above $3, only dipping below that threshold in February. Since then, it has significantly decreased, currently grappling to stay steady around $2.4. Over the past two weeks, XRP's value has fluctuated between a peak of $3.07 and a low of $2.1. The outlook for XRP seems optimistic, with a 47% increase in market volume suggesting a bullish trend. However, the price remains slightly down, prompting many Ripple investors to consider reallocating their assets to DTX Exchange, which shows strong growth potential. PEPE Faces a 47% Decline Amid Market Volatility PEPE has seen a 47% decrease on monthly charts, currently trading around $0.0000095. As a popular meme coin, PEPE has experienced significant price swings typical of such tokens. Sunday’s data indicates a 40% rise in market volume, hinting at a possible recovery. Nonetheless, investors are shifting their assets to DTX Exchange, drawn by its promising returns. DTX Exchange: Surpassing PEPE and XRP in Performance DTX Exchange is gaining traction as a formidable contender, with experts in the crypto field forecasting that it may surpass well-established tokens like Ripple and PEPE. This is largely due to DTX’s cutting-edge features that seamlessly blend decentralized and traditional financial systems. DTX Exchange (DTX) provides traders with access to 120,000 financial assets for seamless trading. Powered by the high-speed VulcanX blockchain, DTX ensures rapid transaction processing, capable of handling over 200,000 transactions per second. Security is a top priority for DTX , which employs non-custodial asset management, allowing users complete control over their private keys and assets. This approach virtually eliminates the risk of fund loss. DTX has already garnered more than $13.6 million across eight presale stages, with over 75% of the final stage nearly sold out before the official listing. Currently priced at $0.16, the DTX token is expected to increase to $0.20 upon listing, with experts predicting a significant surge in value, potentially exceeding 100%. Concluding Thoughts Though the performance of PEPE and XRP remains a concern within the crypto community, emerging platforms like DTX Exchange are capturing the interest of early investors eager to capitalize on new market trends. While investments are never without risk, historical data suggests that projects with tangible utility and solid fundamentals tend to thrive. Consequently, platforms such as DTX Exchange are emerging as superior alternatives, with analysts forecasting that they could outperform both PEPE and Ripple.

This will allow the exchange to offer regulated crypto derivatives, including perpetual futures, across the European Economic Area (EEA). Gemini Secures Licence To Offer Crypto Perpetuals in EU & EEA According to a recent report , cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has secured an in-principle Investment Firm licence under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). This approval will enable Gemini to provide regulated options and futures products in the EEA. Perpetual futures contracts, which do not have an expiry date, are among the key products the crypto exchange plans to introduce in the region. The company aims to offer these derivatives to both retail and institutional investors, expanding its market presence. Mark Jennings, Gemini’s Head of Europe, stated, “Interest in crypto derivatives, particularly from institutions, has increased significantly in recent years, as crypto matures into a recognised asset class.” He further added that Gemini is committed “to providing a best-in-class offering for retail and institutional investors.” Gemini Strengthens Its European Operations The crypto exchange has been actively expanding its operations in Europe. The exchange selected Malta as its European hub and obtained a Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) Service Licence from the Maltese regulator. This licence allows it to operate under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. Additionally, the crypto exchange holds a similar licence in France. While the VFA licence enables the exchange to offer various crypto services, it does not cover crypto derivatives. The MiFID II licence, once fully granted, will bridge this gap, allowing Gemini to provide derivative products legally across the EEA. Concurrently, Gemini, according an announcement last week, is reportedly considering an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the United States. Growing Interest in Crypto Derivatives Crypto exchanges are increasingly moving into the derivatives market as demand for such products rises. Several firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, have recently obtained MiFID II licences to offer similar services in the region. Coinbase entered the derivatives market by acquiring the Cypriot unit of BUX, a company that previously offered Contracts for Difference (CFDs). Kraken also secured a MiFID II licence through the acquisition of a Cypriot firm, though the name of the company remains undisclosed. Gemini’s move aligns with this trend, as the exchange positions itself to compete in the regulated derivatives space. Crypto.com has already expanded into CFDs by acquiring a broker in Australia, suggesting that more crypto exchanges could follow a similar path.

This recognition allows applicants to use digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) to meet the HK$30 million (approximately $3.8 million) residency requirement under the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (New CIES). The first case was approved in October 2024, with a second approval following on Feb. 7, 2025. These applications were processed in Hong Kong, under the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong Investment Promotion Agency and Invest Hong Kong. Applicants provided reports signed by certified accountants, verifying their cryptocurrency holdings. For example, accountant Xiao Yaohe confirmed on RedNote that he signed a report for an applicant with HK$30 million in ETH, which was subsequently approved.

Source: Xiao Yaohe (RedNote) The New CIES Framework for Foreign Investments The New CIES is designed to draw foreign investment by requiring applicants to invest HK$30 million in eligible local assets within six months of approval. While traditional investments include stocks and bonds, it remains unclear whether direct crypto investments or crypto-related financial products like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will qualify. For the Hong Kong Investment Promotion Agency, the first crypto-based application was unprecedented, resulting in a month-long internal review before approval. Applicants are required to secure their digital assets in cold wallets or on reputable exchanges such as Binance , ensuring regulatory compliance and asset security. Currently, two additional applications using cryptocurrency as proof of assets are underway. Becoming a Global Crypto Hub Approving cryptocurrencies as proof of wealth for investment visas reflects Hong Kong’s stance on digital assets , which aims to attract foreign investment and talent while positioning itself as a global crypto hub. In December 2024, legislator Wu Jiexhuang proposed including Bitcoin in Hong Kong’s national reserves, suggesting it could strengthen financial security under the “one country, two systems” framework. He also emphasized studying the impact of US-based Bitcoin ETFs as part of this initiative.

On Jan. 27, the SFC issued operational licenses to two Hong Kong-based crypto trading platforms, PantherTrade and YAX, under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO). Despite this progress, the registration process for crypto entities has been slow . Since launching its licensing initiative in mid-2014, the regulator has issued a total of seven crypto licenses. The SFC’s rigorous evaluation process includes on-site reviews focusing on client asset protection, Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, and cybersecurity measures, ensuring high standards for market participants. Currently, only four cryptocurrencies – Bitcoin, Ether, Avalanche (AVAX), and Chainlink ( LINK ) – are legally available for trading in Hong Kong, reflecting the city’s cautious approach to digital asset integration.

Powell's comments came at a hearing today of the Senate Banking Committee. During the hearing, Committee Chairman Tim Scott asked Powell whether financial regulations create undue burdens on businesses and whether lawmakers would commit to working together to address potential overreach. “I am committed to working with you on this, trying to avoid overreach,” Powell responded. “Frankly, I think it would be fair to take a fresh look at debanking.” Powell acknowledged that regulatory measures are not intended to isolate industries, but sometimes unintended consequences occur. “We don’t do these things intentionally, but sometimes regulations cause things to happen and we have to work on that,” he added. Related News: BREAKING: FED Chairman Jerome Powell Makes Hot Remarks - LIVE Scott also pressed Powell on whether she would work with lawmakers to end debanking, and Powell reaffirmed her commitment to that. The issue of crypto-related debanking has returned to the agenda in Washington, where lawmakers have held numerous hearings and investigations into the matter. Both the House and Senate recently held hearings focused on how crypto firms are being affected by banking restrictions. Last year, Coinbase escalated the matter by filing a lawsuit against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) through its consulting firm History Associates, alleging that the agency was intentionally cutting off the crypto industry from financial services. Powell has previously stated that banks are allowed to serve crypto clients as long as they effectively manage the risks involved. *This is not investment advice.

According to a new report from the BBC, the landfill in Newport, Wales, where a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin is believed to be, is slated to close in the 2025-26 financial year. Says a Newport City Council spokesman, “The landfill has been in exploitation since the early 2000s and is coming to the end of its life, therefore the council is working on a planned closure and capping of the site over the next two years.” Welsh IT worker James Howells lost the device containing 8,000 Bitcoin during a 2013 house cleanup when he claims his partner mistakenly threw away the wrong hard drive. Howells mined the BTC on the hard drive in 2009, during cryptocurrency’s early days. He had sought to gain permission from the Newport City Council to allow him to search the landfill in hopes of recovering his BTC stash, even offering to share profits. But the Newport City Council refused. The council maintained that excavating the site would pose significant environmental hazards, including the potential release of harmful materials. Officials also questioned the likelihood of finding an intact hard drive after years of exposure to the elements. He sued, but a judge ruled against him last month, deciding that there were no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim and no likelihood of prevailing if the claim went to a full trial.

Analysts speculate Cardano could go down as low as 30% in value. Ripple is also not an exception due to the sell-offs in the market as well as uncertainty in legal issues and XRP ETF approvals. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is emerging as a new promising altcoin, with over $13.6 million already raised in presale. Mixing up both decentralized and centralized systems, DTX is set to disrupt crypto trading. But will Cardano and Ripple overcome the challenges, or would their fate go down in these trying times? Let’s find out. Cardano's Bearish Performance: Could It Go Down Another 30%? As of 10th February 2025, Cardano stands at around $0.7. This reflects a drop of 23% from the previous month. The coin has been facing significant downward pressure. It recently fell below key support levels; as the 50% Fibonacci retracement point is at $0.80. Experts now say that ADA could fall another 20% to 30% if it fails to regain support around the $0.72 mark. The fall is mainly attributed to the general market slump, which has affected the bigger cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The market’s volatility, combined with regulatory uncertainty, is putting additional pressure on ADA, with experts warning that its next support level may be around $0.55. XRP's Fight for Survival: Will Ripple Break Through the Resistance? XRP, another dion coin, is also feeling the heat. As of 10th February 2025, the XRP price stands at $2.4. It shows a low of about 2% from the previous day, and this can be traced to the sell-offs in the broader market following President Trump's tariff announcements. While Ripple experienced a few rough rides, XRP recovered over 45% from the geopolitical tensions lately. However, a long-running court battle with the U.S. SEC will bring nothing but uncertainty to the future of Ripple. The SEC's appeal to class XRP as a security can keep the investors in anticipation and will surely be reflected in market sentiment and performance. Adding to the speculation, XRP has also been linked to growing interest in XRP ETFs, which could spark further volatility. If approved, an XRP ETF could provide a massive liquidity boost, possibly driving the price up, but it also faces regulatory hurdles. XRP’s future will largely depend on overcoming these external hurdles like XRP ETF approval. DTX Exchange: The Future of Hybrid Trading DTX Exchange is a pioneering trading platform that provides the best features of centralized and decentralized finance. It has already demonstrated great presale performance, raising over $13.6 million in funds. The token is priced at $0.16 now and is likely to go higher when the platform is launched. It promises to be a one-stop crypto trading platform for users by providing access to more than 120,000 assets available for trading, including stocks, forex, commodities, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs. The hybrid model adopted by DTX entails mixing the fast and efficient trading of central exchanges with the security and control of decentralized systems. This means traders can enjoy easy access to liquidity and security features. Users will be able to trade directly from their crypto wallets, which would end the need for traditional bank accounts and reduce the risk of relying on centralized services. Looking ahead, DTX Exchange has some exciting plans. It aims to offer features like high-leverage options up to 1000x, automated portfolio management, and tokenization of real-world assets. Its next-gen blockchain, VulcanX, promises to support 200,000 transactions per second, which could ensure fast and efficient trade execution. As DTX prepares for its launch, its unique combination of decentralized security and centralized efficiency could make it a game-changer in the world of trading platforms. Conclusion As both Cardano and XRP face challenges from market volatility, legal hurdles, XRP ETF issues, and broader economic factors, their paths forward remain uncertain. While Cardano may see further declines of up to 30%, XRP could find strength if it overcomes its resistance points, XRP ETF approval, and the looming regulatory issues. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange offers an innovative solution to traders looking for flexibility and security in their transactions. With its presale success and promising features, DTX could offer a fresh perspective on trading for those looking to bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized finance.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XYZVerse, a rising meme coin, is positioning itself as a serious contender to challenge Dogecoin. Table of Contents XYZVerse: The best new meme project Dogecoin’s price analysis Conclusion A new cryptocurrency is gaining momentum and might soon challenge Dogecoin (DOGE) in the meme coin market. This emerging digital coin is capturing attention with its rapid growth and unique features. In 2025, it could become a significant player in the crypto space. XYZVerse: The best new meme project XYZVerse is an all-access pass to a sports-driven, meme-powered revolution. It’s the MVP of the meme coin arena, where crypto enthusiasts can capitalize on the high demand for high-energy, community-driven tokens. But every revolution needs a leader — a hero willing to defy the odds and drive XYZ to the top. That hero is XYZepe — the masked fighter, the fearless believer, and the relentless XYZ holder. His mission? To propel XYZVerse to the number 1 spot on CoinMarketCap, proving that underdogs can dominate and rewrite the playbook on meme coin success. With millions of sports fans primed to join the movement, the XYZVerse ecosystem is on a fast track to massive expansion — and early adopters are positioned for massive gains. XYZVerse has claimed the title of best new meme project, a distinction that solidifies its momentum in the meme coin sector. With meme coins proving themselves as the undisputed champions of high-growth in crypto, XYZVerse is gearing up to outperform the competition. Currently trading at $0.002, XYZ is an undervalued gem with a projected climb to $0.1 by the final presale stage. But legendary wins don’t happen overnight — they require vision, strategy, and fighters ready to go the distance. XYZepe is prepared for the battle ahead, and with a strong, engaged community behind him, he’s driving XYZ toward crypto superstardom.

In the past week, it decreased by 5.29%. Over the last month, it fell by 25.33%. Despite these short-term declines, DOGE is up 152.31% over six months. This suggests that while short-term trends are downward, long-term growth remains positive. Technical indicators are mixed. The Relative Strength Index is 50.27, signaling a neutral market. The Stochastic oscillator at 72.04 approaches overbought levels, hinting at a possible downturn. The MACD is slightly negative at -0.0009278, suggesting mild bearish momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are at $0.25, indicating the price aligns with recent averages. The nearest resistance level for DOGE is at $0.34. Breaking above this could target the second resistance at $0.43, a potential gain of over 47%. The nearest support level is at $0.16. Falling below this could lead to the second support at $0.0679, a significant drop of over 70%. Dogecoin’s future movement depends on whether it breaches these key resistance or support levels. Conclusion With its unique blend of sports and meme culture, XYZVerse aims for 20,000% growth, positioning itself to potentially challenge Dogecoin in the 2025 bull run.

Wall Street Analyst Warns About ""Dino Coins"" Like XRP",https://bitzo.com/2025/02/is-another-30-drop-possible-for-cardano-wall-street-analyst-warns-about-dino-coins-like-xrp,"Cardano and XRP, two prominent ""dino coins"" in the cryptocurrency market, are facing uncertain futures. Analysts suggest that Cardano could potentially decrease by as much as 30% in value. Ripple also faces challenges due to market sell-offs and uncertainties surrounding legal issues and XRP ETF approvals. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is gaining attention as a new altcoin contender, having raised over $13.6 million in its presale. By integrating both decentralized and centralized systems, DTX aims to revolutionize crypto trading. Will Cardano and Ripple be able to navigate these obstacles, or will they struggle in these challenging times? Let's explore further. Cardano's Struggles: Is a 30% Decline on the Horizon? On February 10, 2025, Cardano is valued at approximately $0.7, reflecting a 23% decrease from the previous month. The coin has been under significant downward pressure, recently dropping below crucial support levels, with the 50% Fibonacci retracement point at $0.80. Experts now predict ADA might dip another 20% to 30% if it fails to reclaim support near the $0.72 level. This decline is largely due to the overall market downturn, impacting major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The market’s volatility, alongside regulatory uncertainties, is further pressuring ADA, with experts cautioning that its next support level could be around $0.55. XRP's Struggle for Momentum: Can Ripple Overcome Resistance? XRP, another ""dino coin,"" is also under pressure. As of February 10, 2025, XRP is priced at $2.4, showing a decrease of roughly 2% from the previous day, largely due to market sell-offs following President Trump's tariff announcements. Despite some turbulent periods, XRP has rebounded over 45% from recent geopolitical tensions. However, its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. SEC continues to cast uncertainty over Ripple's future. The SEC's efforts to classify XRP as a security create anticipation among investors, influencing market sentiment and performance. Further speculation surrounds XRP due to growing interest in XRP ETFs, which could increase volatility. If approved, an XRP ETF might significantly boost liquidity, potentially raising the price, though it still faces regulatory challenges. XRP's future largely hinges on overcoming these external obstacles, such as XRP ETF approval. DTX Exchange: Pioneering the Future of Hybrid Trading DTX Exchange is an innovative trading platform that merges the best aspects of centralized and decentralized finance. It has already shown strong presale results, securing over $13.6 million in funding. The token is currently priced at $0.16 and is expected to rise upon the platform's launch. DTX plans to serve as a comprehensive crypto trading platform for users, offering access to over 120,000 tradable assets, including stocks, forex, commodities, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs. The hybrid model adopted by DTX combines the fast and efficient trading of centralized exchanges with the security and control offered by decentralized systems. This allows traders to enjoy easy access to liquidity and enhanced security features. Users can trade directly from their crypto wallets, eliminating the need for traditional bank accounts and reducing reliance on centralized services. Looking ahead, DTX Exchange has ambitious plans, such as high-leverage options up to 1000x, automated portfolio management, and tokenization of real-world assets. Its next-gen blockchain, VulcanX, aims to support 200,000 transactions per second, ensuring swift and efficient trade execution. As DTX gears up for its launch, its unique blend of decentralized security and centralized efficiency could revolutionize the trading platform landscape. Conclusion Both Cardano and XRP are facing challenges from market volatility, legal hurdles, XRP ETF issues, and broader economic factors, leaving their future paths uncertain. While Cardano might experience further declines of up to 30%, XRP could gain strength if it overcomes resistance points, XRP ETF approval, and lingering regulatory issues. In contrast, DTX Exchange presents an innovative solution for traders seeking flexibility and security in their transactions. With its presale success and promising features, DTX could provide a fresh perspective on trading for those looking to bridge the gap between centralized and decentralized finance.

With Layer-1 tokens surging, BitLemons attracts institutional interest and eyes explosive growth in the GambleFi sector. Table of Contents BitLemons: The next crypto phenomenon? Binance Coin leads market rally Solana shows renewed strength BitLemons emerges as a promising investment opportunity As major Layer-1 tokens demonstrate explosive momentum, BitLemons (BLEM) continues to attract institutional interest following its successful $1 million seed round, with analysts predicting potential parabolic gains in the GambleFi sector. BitLemons: The next crypto phenomenon? While Layer-1 platforms focus on infrastructure, BitLemons is already generating substantial revenue through its operational gaming platform. What sets it apart is its presale structure, where GGR accumulates across all 12 stages, ensuring significant funds are ready at launch for strategic buybacks and holder rewards. This methodical distribution approach helps stabilize token pricing while maximizing early investor returns. With dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, plus substantial institutional backing, BitLemons allocates 30% of GGR between strategic buybacks and community rewards, creating an ecosystem where both players and investors thrive from day one. Binance Coin leads market rally BNB demonstrates extraordinary strength with a 10.51% surge to $640.88, as Binance’s initiatives to bridge traditional banking with crypto services gain traction. The token’s expanding utility beyond exchange fee discounts continues to drive institutional interest and adoption. As Binance engages with U.S. regulators to clarify crypto banking services, BNB’s role in the broader financial ecosystem positions it for potential further growth, though regulatory outcomes remain uncertain. Solana shows renewed strength Solana posts impressive gains with a 4.00% increase to $202.08, as VanEck’s bullish $520 price target for 2025 captures market attention. The platform’s high-performance infrastructure and growing DeFi ecosystem continue to attract developers and users alike. However, while SOL’s technical capabilities impress, questions remain about network stability and centralization concerns as the platform scales to meet increasing demand. BitLemons emerges as a promising investment opportunity While Layer-1 tokens experience strong momentum, BitLemons offers something more valuable: consistent revenue generation and proven utility. Unlike infrastructure plays, BitLemons delivers immediate value through its operational gaming platform, with GGR accumulating throughout the presale to ensure a strong launch. With institutional investors securing positions at just $0.01 per token and significant launch capital being accumulated during the presale, BitLemons presents a rare opportunity to join a profitable venture before mainstream discovery.

40204184,https://blockworks.co/news/lido-v3-staking-developments,1739296800,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Lido V3 brings modular staking and opt-in restaking,https://blockworks.co/news/lido-v3-staking-developments,"This is a segment from the 0xResearch newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Lido, which holds about 27% of staked ether, is out with its v3 plans today. At the heart of this upgrade is stVaults — modular smart contracts designed to provide greater flexibility, boost institutional adoption and engender deeper DeFi integration. Konstantin Lomashuk, a founding contributor to the protocol, calls stVaults “a flexible foundation for the next phase of staking [that] upholds the security and decentralization the Lido protocol is known for.” Modular staking and restaking stVaults introduce a modular staking framework with components that operate alongside the Lido Core Protocol. This allows for customized validator setups, adjustable fee structures and optimized risk-reward profiles — including restaking. V3 is anticipated to grow institutional interest in Ethereum staking, as stVaults should provide the customizable infrastructure needed to support regulated staking products and new financial instruments like staking-enabled ETFs . Beyond institutions, the structure enables participation from independent validators, asset managers and DeFi builders. For institutional stakers, stVaults aim to allow staking setups that align with compliance requirements, such as validator customization, controlled deposit and withdrawal processes and optimized fee structures. With BYOV (Bring Your Own Validator), node operators can presumably offer bespoke staking products, attracting high-volume stakers and diversifying revenue streams. Curators and asset managers leveraging stETH as collateral will be able to implement advanced staking strategies that integrate with the broader DeFi ecosystem. Among “advanced” strategies are those that involve restaking. Without explicitly mentioning EigenLayer or Symbiotic by name, Lido references “emerging restaking trends” and “shared security.” The key differentiator is that stVaults introduce an opt-in model for shared security strategies. This allows participants to engage with restaking protocols while mitigating exposure to restaking risks for the Lido Core Protocol. A separate vault token can have its own liquidity and DeFi integrations, a Lido spokesperson told Blockworks. “ Mellow has done something similar, but the key difference here is that this variant can be directly linked to a specific node operator, which wasn’t possible before.” Institutional growth and decentralization In parallel with Lido v3, the Lido Ecosystem BORG Foundation has been established following a proposal that passed overwhelmingly with broad support, including from Blockworks Research. The BORG Foundation enhances Lido’s ability to form institutional partnerships, ensure compliance and provide additional governance safeguards. The foundation allows Lido DAO to directly appoint and remove directors, oversee multisig management and provide indemnification for contributors. By creating a structured legal entity, the BORG framework aligns with Lido v3’s focus on institutional grade staking infrastructure. Lido maintains that stVaults will also contribute to Ethereum’s decentralization. Lido dominance has been a concern for the more strident decentralization advocates in the past. The Reserve Ratio (RR) mechanism ensures a portion of staked ETH remains bonded as collateral, enhancing security and preventing excessive rehypothecation. This model fosters a more decentralized validator network, ensuring Ethereum staking remains both robust and liquid, according to the proposal. V3 maintains liquidity through stETH fungibility and in-protocol redemptions, making it easier for stakers to enter and exit positions without disrupting the broader market. Rollout plan Pending approval from the Lido DAO , the rollout of Lido v3 will proceed in three phases: Early adopter program: Select partners will build and test staking vaults, preparing for a smooth transition to full stVault functionality upon mainnet launch. Testnet: Rigorous testing and integrations with ecosystem partners will ensure security and stability. Mainnet: Activation of institutional staking setups, advanced staking strategies and opt-in shared security mechanisms. With the combined advancements of Lido v3’s modular staking infrastructure and the Lido Ecosystem BORG Foundation, Lido is cementing its role as a foundational component of Ethereum staking.

Experts Say This AI Token Could Surpass $300 Before 2026,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-solana-experts-say-this-ai-token-could-surpass-300-before-2026/,"As the Solana price undergoes a pullback following its recent peak, industry observers are keeping a close watch on emerging contenders in the decentralized finance space. Analysts believe that IntelMarkets, a dual-chain platform leveraging AI to optimize trading strategies, is rapidly gaining traction as a standout opportunity. The project’s presale success, having secured over $8.5 million in early funding, is seen as a marker of robust investor confidence, with insiders suggesting this momentum could signal substantial upside potential. Given the accelerating growth of the AI sector—a key tailwind for IntelMarkets’ development roadmap—many in the crypto community are saying that its native token could outpace SOL’s gains over the long term. This sentiment, paired with its hybrid blockchain architecture, lends credence to the view that IntelMarkets may emerge as a compelling alternative for investors eyeing next-generation DeFi ecosystems. SOL’s Rally Ends, but Experts See INTL’s AI Hitting $300 by 2026 As the Solana price retreats from recent record levels, market watchers are increasingly pointing out challengers in the fast-evolving DeFi sector. Among them, IntelMarkets —a dual-chain platform combining AI-driven trading tools with cross-chain interoperability, is drawing notable interest as a potential disruptor. Market experts suggest its AI-integrated token may achieve substantial milestones ahead of rivals, positioning it as a high-potential contender for long-term portfolios. Its presale, which has reportedly crossed $8.5 million in early contributions, INTL is viewed by insiders as a reflection of institutional optimism. The project’s emphasis on building an AI agent marketplace alongside real-time trading algorithms lends weight to arguments that its growth trajectory could outpace traditional blockchain models. Such innovations, coupled with its hybrid infrastructure, reinforce perceptions of robust backing and adaptability within competitive markets. While the recent performance of the Solana price has set benchmarks, IntelMarkets ’ fusion of AI with decentralized finance is seen by some experts as a paradigm shift in scalability and utility. Market strategists underline that its technological differentiation, particularly in automating complex trades across chains—could redefine value propositions in crypto ecosystems. INTL’s AI Token Gains Momentum as SOL Retraces from New ATH As the Solana price cools from its latest peak, IntelMarkets’ AI-integrated token is emerging as a focal point for crypto strategists seeking sustainable momentum. The project’s INTL presale has reportedly attracted heightened demand, with investors aligning early positions to tap into its AI-driven trading ecosystem. Industry analysts are seeing potential to redefine DeFi, emphasizing its hybrid automation as a catalyst for outperforming traditional market leaders. INTL’s dual-chain design, bridging Ethereum’s security with SOL’s speed, provides a scalable foundation for cross-chain trading innovations. This architecture reinforces the narrative that its token could eclipse Solana’s long-term valuation as developers prioritize adaptable, AI-optimized frameworks. Forecasts suggesting the INTL token could breach $300 before 2026 are sharing interest among institutional and retail backers. The project’s blend of AI analytics with decentralized infrastructure is seen as a magnet for capital migrating from volatile legacy assets. With the Solana price retracement drawing attention to emerging alternatives, IntelMarkets’ technological edge increasingly appears poised to capture market share, underscoring its appeal as a forward-looking investment vehicle. Can INTL’s AI Token Outperform SOL with Its AI Blockchain and Dual Exchange? As the Solana price retraces from recent highs, market analysts are weighing whether IntelMarkets’ AI token could eclipse its performance. The project’s hybrid blockchain architecture and AI-driven exchange tools lend credence to the view that it’s positioned for outsized growth, offering traders algorithmic strategies and an AI agent marketplace. The $8.5 million presale of IntelMarkets surge underscores institutional optimism in its potential to outpace competitors like SOL. Experts argue its AI-enhanced DeFi model, blending predictive analytics with dual-chain efficiency—positions INTL as a compelling crypto investment for those prioritizing innovation. Conclusion As the Solana price corrects after hitting new highs, industry analysts are betting on IntelMarkets to be the next big thing. Experts think that IntelMarkets’ AI token could reach $300 before 2026, making it a top crypto to invest in. With its innovative approach to AI-based trading and a strong presale performance, IntelMarkets is set to revolutionize the crypto trading scene.

The cryptocurrency has dropped 10% in the past week amid broader market uncertainty. Since hitting its all-time high, SOL has been in a corrective phase. Meanwhile, Solana’s founder has responded to criticism from Aave’s creator, fueling the ongoing debate. Solana Price Hovers Below $200 as Kamino Faces Aave Founder’s Criticism Solana price remains below the $200 mark as tensions rise between the network’s supporters and DeFi critics. The latest controversy centers on Kamino, a Solana-based lending protocol that has drawn comparisons to Aave’s earlier technology. Critics, including Aave founder Stani Kulechov, have called out Kamino for borrowing old designs while restricting users from certain regions, including the UK. Despite the backlash, Solana Foundation President Lily Liu defended the project, calling it a superior product, fueling further debate within the DeFi community. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko also weighed in, refuting claims that Kamino was merely an Aave clone with a subpar interface. While Solana’s DeFi ecosystem expands, skepticism persists about the network’s approach to innovation versus replication. With its price hovering under $200, investor sentiment remains uncertain, especially as regulatory challenges and competitive tensions add pressure to the blockchain’s growth narrative. The state of Solana DeFi: – Copycat Aave’s old tech – Slap a half baked UI – Restrict also UK users from using it – Solana foundation president calls it a better product Expect people to buy the bluff. https://t.co/wbeDnwlBSu — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) February 10, 2025 Solana Price Analysis The latest SOL price hovered at $197.92, maintaining a tight consolidation range near the $190 support level. The cryptocurrency struggled to reclaim higher levels, signaling potential weakness in buying momentum. Technical analysis shows that SOL faces resistance at $232 and $250, with stronger rejection expected at $260. A break above these levels could push the Solana price prediction toward the $300 psychological mark. However, failure to sustain gains may lead to a retest of the $190 support, with further downside risks if bearish momentum intensifies. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows a weak bullish crossover. The MACD line remains close to the signal line, indicating a lack of strong directional movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 45, suggesting that SOL is in neutral territory, with no immediate overbought or oversold conditions. Solana Price Chart: TradingView Solana’s founder Anatoly Yakovenko defended Kamino against Aave’s Stani Kulechov, intensifying debates over innovation and replication.

While prices have decreased, analysts think this volatility provides unique chances for traders willing to act. Platforms like IntelMarkets, which blend AI-powered tools with dual blockchain access, are gaining attention as investors seek innovative ways to handle market swings. With its presale live and futures trading already active, experts think early adopters of INTL might position themselves ahead of significant developments, whether that’s a Dogecoin ETF approval or the next wave of AI-driven trading innovations. 750M DOGE Sell-Off Spurs Dogecoin ETF Speculation Within this week, large investors have moved 750 million DOGE tokens into the market, therefore bringing doubts over the timing of a potential Dogecoin ETF. Based on blockchain data observations, these transactions will be interpreted in light of Bitcoin's current drop below the $100,000 level. Such sudden movements create temporary panic across crypto markets. Professionals view the current slide as a combination of strategic moves by whales and not a loss of faith in DOGE. Incidentally, such moves actually lead to big announcements, and, to date, this gives great support to the rumor that institutional holdings are preparing for regulatory changes related to a Dogecoin ETF. Polymarket data shows a 54% chance of a Dogecoin ETF approval in 2025, up from 37% earlier this year. This aligns with filings by firms like Bitwise and Grayscale, which have expanded their crypto ETF portfolios. Crypto enthusiasts highlight that a regulated Dogecoin ETF could stabilize DOGE’s price by attracting conservative investors who avoid direct crypto exposure. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s recent comments about integrating DOGE into X’s payment systems have kept retail interest high, suggesting the token remains central to broader financial innovation. Dogecoin ETF Hopes Clash With DOGE Price Plunge Despite optimism around a Dogecoin ETF, DOGE has fallen this month to $0.25, testing key support levels. Technical charts indicate a bearish pattern, with CoinCodex predicting a drop to $0.19 if selling pressure continues. However, industry experts argue that ETF-related developments could override short-term volatility. For instance, JPMorgan estimates a Dogecoin ETF might draw $1.6 billion in its first year, creating upward momentum even during price swings. Its community remains divided. Some traders point to Bitcoin’s post-ETF rally as a blueprint, noting BTC gained 70% after its ETF launch. Others caution that meme coins face stricter regulatory scrutiny. Crypto strategist Ali Martinez suggests DOGE could rebound to $0.35 if ETF approval odds solidify, citing whale accumulation of 560 million tokens last week. On-chain data reveals large holders are increasing their stakes, signaling confidence in a Dogecoin ETF-driven recovery. Still, risks persist—its 30-day volatility of 9.5% underscores its sensitivity to the market point of view and news cycles. The Dogecoin Swings Challenge Solana Trading Algorithms The DOGE's recent price swings have tested automated trading systems, particularly those on Solana-based platforms like IntelMarkets (INTL). The exchange’s AI-driven algorithms, which process data across Ethereum and Solana blockchains, adjust real-time strategies to capitalize on DOGE’s volatility. INTL’s 1000x leverage feature allows traders to amplify gains during rapid price shifts, a tool gaining attention as Dogecoin ETF speculation intensifies Observers say platforms combining AI with multi-chain infrastructure, such as IntelMarkets, are better equipped to handle DOGE’s fluctuations. For example, the exchange’s Rodeum AI™ identifies arbitrage opportunities between Solana and Ethereum networks, optimizing trades during market uncertainty. This adaptability positions IntelMarkets as the top crypto to invest in for traders targeting meme coins and AI-driven DeFi projects. With presale participation rising, experts think its dual-chain model could set new standards for trading efficiency. Projects like IntelMarkets may benefit from increased demand for sophisticated trading tools as regulatory clarity improves. Insiders consider its presale phase a rare chance to join a platform bridging AI innovation with meme coin dynamics, making it a good alternative ahead of potential market shifts. Conclusion The ongoing debates regarding the Dogecoin ETF are getting hotter, and the price fluctuations are testing trader strategies. Thus, many believe that AI-based tools will soon redefine how markets react. Advisors highlight that early access to advanced systems, like those in IntelMarkets’ presale phase, might help users adapt to rapid shifts—whether from ETF news or meme coin volatility. For those watching these developments, exploring IntelMarkets’ live future features could provide a head start.

Speaking at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Feb. 11, Powell said it was time for agencies to reassess reports of crypto businesses being denied access to the U.S. banking system. Crypto industry leaders have long criticized the impact of Operation Choke Point 2.0, a term used to describe an alleged coordinated effort to debank crypto firms. After crypto CEOs raised concerns, big tech executives also came forward with similar claims of unfair treatment. “We don’t intentionally do these things,” Powell said, adding that “we need to be working on that.” the Fed chair responded to a question from Senate Banking Committee chair Tim Scott. Republican Senator Scott also asked if Powell would commit to ending unconstitutional debanking practices. “Yes” Powell declared during the hearing. “I will commit to working with you on that… Look, I think it’s fair to take a fresh look at debanking.” Powell told Sen. Scott and the Committee.

Coinbase sued the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, discovering “pause letters” issued to financial institutions and a trove of OCP 2.0 documents.
