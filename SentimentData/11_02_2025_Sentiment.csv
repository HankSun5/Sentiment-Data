According to Coinshares, institutional whales poured over $1 billion into crypto products last week despite or perhaps because of market weakness. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows totaling for the 5th consecutive week totaling US$1.3bn, bringing inflows for the year so far to US$7.3bn. Recent price declines saw total assets under management in ETPs (exchange-traded products) fall to US$163bn, down from its all-time high set in late January of US$181bn. Trading volumes for the week held steady at US$20bn.” Source: CoinShares The US led the world regionally with $1 billion in inflows. Germany, Switzerland, and Canada also provided $61 million, $54 million, and $37 million, respectively. Even though Bitcoin ( BTC ) raked in $407 million last week, there was a surprising new leader for taking the lion’s share of inflows. “Ethereum stole the show this week, with the price falling recently close to US$2,100 leading to significant buying-on-weakness with inflows of US$793m, outpacing bitcoin for the first time this year.” While multi-asset investment vehicles, or products investing in a basket of digital assets, brought in $14.4 million in inflows, XRP led all non- ETH altcoins at $21.1 million in inflows. Solana ( SOL ) products brought in $11.2 million in inflows last week while Sui ( SUI ) investment vehicles enjoyed $4.3 million in inflows.

Musk’s Past with OpenAI and His Concerns Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 and left in 2019 over internal disagreements, has frequently criticized its transformation into a for-profit entity. He argues that OpenAI’s shift prioritizes revenue generation over its original mission of benefiting humanity, an issue that has fueled legal conflicts between the parties. Elon Musk’s AI firm, xAI, is leading the bid with financial support from Valor Equity Partners, 8VC, and Hollywood executive Ari Emanuel. Under Altman’s leadership, OpenAI has moved toward a for-profit structure, aggressively seeking funding to expand its AI research. Altman has defended the shift, arguing that substantial funding is essential for large-scale AI innovation. As part of this effort, he announced a $500 billion investment in AI infrastructure through a joint venture, Stargate.

Grayscale, which last year broke through U.S. regulators' blockade against the bitcoin ETF, has never previously offered a standalone ADA investment vehicle despite making past moves to do so. But the Trump 2.0 SEC's pivot from policing the crypto industry to seemingly embracing it has emboldened issuers to think big about what they can get through. In recent weeks Grayscale filed for a Solana and XRP ETF as well. Those products would convert Grayscale's preexisting crypto trust products into more widely tradeable ETFs whereas the ADA ETF would be entirely new. Investor demand has always been high for the flagship asset of the Cardano blockchain. ADA ranks among the largest crypto assets by market cap, weighing in at $25 billion at press time. The token spiked 1.5% to 71 cents following the Grayscale news. Market observers increasingly believe the time is nigh for altcoin ETFs to clear the not-quite-as-skeptical SEC.

This rare feat highlights the uncertain nature of cryptocurrency mining and shows that solo miners can still achieve substantial rewards despite the dominance of large mining pools. Crypto journalist Pete Rizzo shared the news via X: BREAKING: ANOTHER SOLO MINER HAS MINED AN ENTIRE #BITCOIN BLOCK WORTH $300,000 BEATING UNBELIEVABLE ODDS pic.twitter.com/pjcivSu2PQ — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) February 10, 2025 On January 30, 2025, a solo Bitcoin miner reportedly used a “$200 BitAXE miner,” a home mining device, to successfully mine a block. However, another user speculated that the miner leveraged CKPOOL, a mining pool designed for solo miners. The miner was using an implementation of @ckpooldev but this does not seem to be from CKPOOL directly. Might have been a bitaxe. Digging in now! — Marshall Long (@OGBTC) February 10, 2025 Mining an entire Bitcoin block as a solo miner with limited computational power is statistically improbable, comparable to winning a lottery. The Bitcoin network is predominantly controlled by large mining pools that combine extensive computational power to increase their chances of mining new blocks. Understanding Solo Mining Solo mining involves a miner attempting to solve the complex mathematical problems required to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain without joining a mining pool. While this approach allows miners to keep the entire block reward, the probability of success remains low due to the extensive computational power required. As the Bitcoin network grows more competitive, solo mining becomes increasingly difficult. However, miners willing to invest in hardware and electricity, despite the slim odds, may still see occasional success. How the Crypto Market Reacted After the Block Win On Monday, the cryptocurrency market cap declined by 3% following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports , intensifying concerns over economic policy shifts. Following the broader market downturn, Bitcoin (BTC) declined 0.5% to $96,871, while Ethereum (ETH) dropped 1.5% to $2,627.

SAND, APT, BERA, and ARB face declining momentum, raising concerns among analysts. Market data suggests these tokens could underperform in the long run, making them potential sell candidates for risk-averse holders. 4 Altcoins To Sell Before Token Unlocks Trigger Market Volatility Upcoming token unlocks may lead to significant selling pressure. Data from Tokenomist indicates that over $742 million worth of tokens will be released between February 10 and 17. Notable unlocks include CONX, SAND, APT, BERA, and ARB, with individual values surpassing $5 million. The largest unlock is ARB, which will release 92.65 million tokens worth $40.57 million, representing 12.13% of its circulating supply. Meanwhile, SAND will see a 205.59 million token release worth $79.34 million, making up 8.41% of its supply. BERA, APT, and CONX will also experience substantial unlocks. The Sandbox (SAND) Sandbox (SAND), a blockchain-based virtual world, surged 10% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.396. The platform allows users to create, build, and exchange digital assets in a gaming environment. Despite the recent increase, SAND has declined 10% over the past week. A scheduled unlock of 205.59 million tokens worth $79.34 million could impact the market. This event positions SAND as an altcoin to sell, with potential selling pressure ahead. By leveraging DAOs and NFTs, Sandbox continues fostering a decentralized gaming ecosystem. Berachain (BERA) Berachain (BERA) is changing Layer-1 economics with its Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) mechanism, creating an efficient marketplace for validators, users, and applications. BERA is currently trading at $5.31, gaining 5.43% in the past 24 hours. A scheduled token release will introduce 12.98 million BERA tokens, valued at approximately $62.82 million. With a market cap of $570.82 million, BERA is under watch for potential volatility. Aptos (APT) Aptos (APT), a Layer 1 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain, is experiencing a price surge, gaining 8% in the past 24 hours. The network, which utilizes the Move programming language initially developed by Meta’s former Diem engineers, has drawn attention amid a significant upcoming token unlock. The APT price is $6.19 and is set to release 11.31 million APT tokens, valued at approximately $64.35 million. This scheduled unlock could introduce selling pressure, potentially affecting the token’s price. Market analysts suggest that Aptos could be among the Altcoins to sell to mitigate long-term losses. Arbitrum (ARB) Arbitrum (ARB), an Ethereum layer-two scaling solution, utilizes optimistic rollups to improve transaction speeds and lower costs while maintaining Ethereum’s security. The network enhances scalability, making transactions more efficient. Recently, the ARB price experienced an 8% surge, reaching $0.4749 within 24 hours. This increase follows growing market activity. Meanwhile, concerns arise over potential volatility as token unlock events approach. Investors closely monitor the market’s reaction to these upcoming changes, making it altcoin to watch. Conclusion: Market trends indicate these altcoins may struggle to regain strong momentum. Investors should assess their portfolios and adjust strategies based on ongoing developments.

The presiding judge, Justice Jeong Woo-yong, said that the prosecution’s case included “no evidence of” Kim committing “a crime.” Kim Nam-guk Absolved: Court Says His Actions ‘Not Criminal’ The Coin Gate scandal galvanized South Korea , when allegations surfaced claiming that Kim had abused his position as a member of a National Assembly committee. The former South Korean lawmaker Kim Nam-guk speaking to reporters outside a branch of the Seoul Southern District Court. (Source: KBS News/YouTube/Screenshot) News reports claimed Kim sold unnamed cryptoassets after hearing news of imminent changes to crypto-related law. Prosecutors had hoped to charge Kim on insider trading-related charges. However, they later decided to charge him with “obstructing officials in the course of their duties.” They claimed that Kim had made “false declarations” about his cryptoassets to the National Assembly. Prosecutors claimed that Kim had tried to “hide the fact that he owned a large amount of cryptocurrency.” They told the court that Kim had “hidden” the fact that he had “made a large profit from crypto investments during his two National Assembly asset declarations in 2021 and 2022.” Prosecution’s Case Prosecution officials said that Kim sold some of his crypto holdings. They said he then transferred the fiat “to a bank deposit account to match his total assets.” He then allegedly “converted the remaining assets” into crypto, prosecutors said. And this, they claimed, was part of a bid to “obstruct the National Assembly Ethics Committee’s” probe into his assets. A courtroom in the Seoul Southern District Court. (Source: YTN/YouTube/Screenshot) Prosecutors Wanted to Jail Kim for 6 Months Prosecutors told the court that Kim held crypto worth “approximately 9.9 billion won (over $6.8 million)” at the time of the 2021 asset declaration process. However, Kim reportedly claimed his total assets were worth approximately 1.2 billion won (around $827,000), and that the funds “in the same way” in 2022. In December last year, prosecution officials asked the court to jail Kim for six months if he was found guilty. But the court rejected the prosecution’s case. It stated that at the time, cryptoassets “were not subject to declarations.” As such, the judge said, it was impossible to consider “that [Kim] was under obligation to declare” his holdings. The judge conceded that some declaration details had been “insufficient or inaccurate.” But Jeong added that it was “not easy to rule that the Ethics Committee” had been “obstructed.” President Yoon Suk Yeol’s impeachment trial entered its final stage this week, with just two formal hearings remaining, and legal circles expecting the verdict would be out in mid-March. https://t.co/oWkDO7MdMF #YoonSukYeol #Impeachment #southKorea #News — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) February 10, 2025 New Declarations The judge concluded that, on the basis of the evidence it had seen, there was “insufficient” reason to rule against Kim without further “evidence to support” the prosecution’s claims. Since the scandal first broke, the National Assembly has introduced new crypto declaration rules for all sitting lawmakers. Seoul has gone on to apply the same rules to scores of civil service roles. This means that a large number of public sector workers are now obliged to file annual crypto declarations. Trump's deportation crackdowns impact Koreans https://t.co/QZ4gVN5GpD — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) February 10, 2025 The lengthy court case launched in October last year, with Kim – a trained lawyer – vowing to clear his name.

The crypto space is buzzing with new meme coins, but only a handful offer true potential. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is catching the spotlight as it enters Aqua Frost, its 10th presale phase, with a jaw-dropping 13,451.72% ROI ahead of its listing. Meanwhile, Popcat (POPCAT) has climbed to $0.3058, gaining traction as demand rises, and Brett (BRETT) continues its recovery after its December 2024 peak of $0.2342. With meme coin momentum showing no signs of slowing down, investors are eyeing strategic entries. Let’s dive into the latest updates on Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Popcat (POPCAT), and Brett (BRETT) and why the APC stands tall among the top new meme coins to buy today. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Mission-Driven Crypto Revolution: Why Investors Are Diving In So, the top new meme coins to buy today aren’t just about hype; they need a unique vision. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just another dog-themed project—it’s built on an engaging mythical adventure where Arctic Pablo explores hidden realms, unveiling a financially rewarding journey. This isn’t just a storytelling gimmick. The project integrates real utility, allowing holders to earn passive income through 66% APY staking, referral rewards, and community incentives​. Arctic Pablo also operates on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for low-cost, high-speed transactions, making it a strategic alternative to meme coins facing congestion issues. With a token burn mechanism that ensures scarcity, Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model enhances value appreciation. Investors aren’t just holding a meme coin—they’re part of a project that mixes mythology, gamification, and strong economics to create something truly unique​. Aqua Frost Presale Gains Momentum: Arctic Pablo’s 10th Phase Is Heating Up As Arctic Pablo Coin advances into Aqua Frost, its 10th presale phase, the urgency to invest grows stronger. At the moment, 1 APC is priced at $0.000059, with over $1.1 million already raised​. With its final listing price set at $0.008, the potential return is staggering—an ROI of 13,451.72% for early adopters. At this rate, a $3,000 investment in Stage 10 would secure 50,847,458 APC, translating into a massive $406,779 when it hits the exchange​. Time is running out, as each stage features an automatic token burn, ensuring that unsold tokens are permanently removed from circulation. The earlier investors get in, the higher their potential gains. As price increases with each new phase, the chance to enter at the rock-bottom pricing is slipping away. Popcat Hits $0.3058 as It Rebounds From Recent Lows Popcat (POPCAT) has been making headlines after bouncing back from a recent dip, currently trading at $0.3058. The meme token, which once hit an all-time high of $1.07 in September 2024, has since experienced a pullback, but traders are closely watching its movements. With a market cap that previously crossed $1 billion, Popcat continues to be a notable player in the meme coin space. Despite its recent volatility, interest in Popcat remains strong. The token’s community engagement and widespread meme appeal keep it in the spotlight, and investors are watching closely to see if it can regain momentum. Brett Sees Market Correction After Hitting $0.0459 Brett (BRETT) has seen a minor pullback, currently priced at $0.0459. This comes after its impressive run in December 2024, when it reached an all-time high of $0.2342 with a market cap of $2 billion. While some investors anticipated further upward movement, BRETT has yet to secure a listing on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. Despite this short-term correction, Brett’s presence in the meme coin market remains significant. The project continues to garner attention, and many believe that if a major exchange listing materializes, it could reignite bullish momentum. Conclusion: Where to Put Your Money? Based on current market trends and ongoing developments, Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as the strongest opportunity among meme coins right now. With its lucrative staking program, strategic presale structure, and deflationary mechanics, APC is poised for explosive growth. Popcat and Brett remain key contenders, with their own market movements keeping investors engaged. However, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale momentum and high ROI potential make it an unmatched investment opportunity in the top new meme coins to buy today . As Aqua Frost continues to gain traction, the time to act is now. Secure your spot in the Arctic Pablo presale before prices rise again. Join the presale today and be part of this exciting adventure!

Chainlink (LINK) is experiencing a surge in whale transactions, hinting at a possible rally, while Avalanche (AVAX) faces intense selling pressure, with analysts warning of a drop below $20. But Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as the most compelling crypto of February, disrupting the trillion-dollar e-commerce sector with a fully decentralized marketplace. While Chainlink and Avalanche rely on traditional price cycles and market sentiment, Web3Bay offers real-world utility and a massive adoption potential. With over $1 million raised and 280 million tokens sold in presale, Web3Bay is not just another speculative bet—it’s a fundamental shift in how online commerce operates. With a projected 4,200% ROI at launch, it presents the strongest investment case among the three. Chainlink (LINK) Price Surges in Whale Transactions – Is a Rally Coming? Chainlink (LINK) price is drawing attention as whale transactions hit a 14-month high, with 1,659 transfers exceeding $100,000 recorded in a single day. On-chain data from Santiment reveals that active wallets have climbed to 9,531, the highest in four weeks. This surge in large transactions often signals an impending price shift, as institutional investors position themselves ahead of major market moves. Despite a 20% drop in the past week, Chainlink (LINK) price is consolidating between its 50-day moving average at $22.76 and the 200-day MA at $15.88. Historically, increased whale accumulation during a dip has led to strong rebounds. Analysts remain bullish, projecting a climb to $32 in February, $41 in March, and a potential $48 by May, marking an 88% increase from current levels. Avalanche (AVAX) Drops Below $27 – Will It Crash to $20? Avalanche (AVAX) has fallen below $27, extending its downward trend as bearish momentum intensifies. Over the past week, AVAX has dropped 18.3%, with a 3.6% decline in the last 24 hours, pushing its market cap below $11 billion. Analysts warn that if selling pressure continues, the token could slide toward the $20 support level. Technical indicators suggest further downside risk. AVAX recently broke below its 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $28.91, a key support zone. The Trend Strength Index (TSI) at -0.89 and a sharp drop in the 20-day EMA confirm strong bearish momentum. If AVAX fails to reclaim this level, the next major support sits near $19.55. Web3Bay: The Must-Buy Crypto of February 2025 Web3Bay (3BAY) is emerging as the top crypto investment for February, revolutionizing e-commerce with its decentralized marketplace. Unlike traditional platforms like Amazon and eBay, which impose high fees and centralized control, Web3Bay enables buyers and sellers to transact directly on the blockchain, eliminating middlemen and reducing costs. With blockchain security, tamper-proof transactions, and a governance model controlled by 3BAY token holders via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Web3Bay is reshaping online commerce. The Web3Bay presale is on fire, with over $1 million raised and 280 million tokens sold. Currently priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, the token is projected to launch at $0.1959, offering a staggering 4,200% ROI for early investors. Additionally, Web3Bay introduces staking rewards, allowing token holders to earn passive income while benefiting from lower transaction fees. With the global e-commerce industry surpassing $7 trillion, Web3Bay presents a real-world use case with massive upside potential. As crypto adoption accelerates, 3BAY is the one coin investors can’t afford to miss this February. Its high-growth trajectory, real utility, and strong investor demand make it the most compelling crypto presale right now. Web3Bay Leads the Charge as the Market’s Best Bet Chainlink’s whale accumulation signals potential upside, but its price remains volatile. Avalanche is battling critical resistance levels, with risks of further losses if market sentiment doesn’t improve. However, Web3Bay offers more than just speculation—it’s an ecosystem with long-term growth potential. With staking rewards, decentralized governance, and real-world adoption, Web3Bay is far more than a short-term play. Investors looking for a crypto with massive upside and tangible use cases should not overlook this presale. While LINK and AVAX have their strengths, Web3Bay stands out as February’s best crypto investment—offering early backers the chance to secure life-changing gains before its official launch.

Still priced at just $0.042 in presale, this rising crypto is flashing a strong buy signal, with analysts eyeing an 80,000% surge. Dogecoin Price Struggles As It Risks Dropping To $0.22 Support The Dogecoin price has struggled to gain traction, failing to break through key resistance levels. Currently trading at $0.2651, DOGE remains locked in a tight range, with traders showing caution as volume declines. Technical charts indicate the Dogecoin price limited buying pressure, with the weekly chart showing a 19.2% drop and the daily chart indicating a 1.3% decline. Market analysts warn that DOGE may retest a $0.22 support level with the current market situation. With volatility increasing, some DOGE holders are beginning to diversify into stronger-performing assets, looking for better returns elsewhere. This has led investors to explore new options, particularly WallitIQ (WLTQ), which has gained traction as a top-performing presale asset. Unlike DOGE, which depends heavily on speculation, this presale sensation offers a strong value proposition backed by security and automation features that appeal to long-term investors. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Signals Massive 80,000% Surge While the Dogecoin price continues to show uncertainty, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has emerged as one of the most attractive investment opportunities in the market. Analysts tracking the presale activity have noted a strong buy signal ahead of a jaw-dropping 80,000% upside as early investors rush to secure this affordable presale token at its current price of $0.042.

Unlike the Dogecoin price, which remains speculative, the altcoin is backed by tangible technological advancements that augment digital asset security and usability. With WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) SolidProof-audited smart contract and a CoinMarketCap listing already secured, investor confidence continues to grow, making WLTQ one of the most sought-after presale tokens on the market.

Investors recognize that once it completes its presale phase, the price will rise significantly, making now the best time to enter before significant price increases occur. This emerging altcoin presents a strategic advantage over the current Dogecoin price for investors seeking a high-upside opportunity with reduced risk. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Next Big Crypto Move The Dogecoin price remains volatile, with analysts forecasting a potential drop toward $0.22 support levels. The DOGE struggling to regain momentum has left many traders questioning its ability to deliver sustainable gains in the coming months. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has continued to flash a strong buy signal, attracting investors looking for a more secure and functional investment option. With its smart contract security, portfolio automation , and MVP crypto wallet management app, it has positioned itself as a leader in digital asset management poised for an 80,000% surge.

Ethereum Prices Fall & Chainlink Rally Faces Uncertainty,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-draws-attention-with-a-350-bonus-ethereum-prices-fall-chainlink-rally-faces-uncertainty/,"Ethereum’s (ETH) price has plummeted due to various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory updates, market manipulation, and global events impacting the cryptocurrency market. Not only has the Ethereum price been affected—Chainlink is also experiencing declines. However, Chainlink has formed a partnership with a notable stablecoin issuer which could potentially lead to a Chainlink rally. As participants seek out promising coins, BlockDAG (BDAG) emerges as a notable contender, offering a substantial 350% bonus on BDAG acquisitions. This offer represents a unique chance in the current market climate. Despite the downturn in Ethereum prices, BlockDAG continues to attract attention, remaining stable amidst market volatility. With $193.5 million already raised in its ongoing presale and a 2380% price increase, BDAG is positioning itself as a leading coin for 2025. Ethereum Price Suffers Amidst Market Volatility In the last 24 hours, the Ethereum price has faced significant losses, with its trading volume decreasing by 27.68% to $57.61 billion. This reduction highlights the numerous factors that influence the Ethereum price, including market dynamics, geopolitical issues, celebrity endorsements, and market manipulations. Community sentiment plays a critical role, and even events like token burning can sway the market’s direction. The current technical indicators are not favorable for the Ethereum price, showing signs of a downward trend. If these indicators persist, traders might begin shorting their positions, potentially triggering a broader sell-off. Chainlink Partners with Usual—Potential for a Chainlink Rally? Many coins employ various strategies to recover after significant losses. Chainlink has partnered with Usual, a major stablecoin issuer overseeing over $1.2 billion in assets, in hopes of sparking a Chainlink rally. This partnership allows Usual-stablecoins USD0 and USD0++ to utilize Chainlink’s infrastructure, including Price Feeds, Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), and Proof of Reserve, enhancing the security and transparency of Usual’s ecosystem. This strategic alliance could pave the way for a Chainlink rally, although it remains uncertain whether a partnership alone can initiate such a movement. BlockDAG’s Final Call Campaign Captures Global Attention BlockDAG’s “FINALCALL700” campaign is quickly becoming the buzz of the cryptocurrency world. This unprecedented 350% bonus marks the most significant promotion in BlockDAG’s history, serving as a token of gratitude towards its dedicated community and early supporters for their steadfast commitment to the project. Initially priced at $0.001, BDAG has seen a significant rise to $0.0248, with predictions pointing towards further increases as demand continues to grow. Market experts anticipate that BDAG will reach $20 by 2027 after raising over $193.5 million and distributing 18.3 billion coins. As news of BlockDAG’s extraordinary bonus offer spreads, a global rush of buyers is emerging, eager to enhance their holdings by purchasing BDAG at its current low price. BlockDAG is committed to rewarding both new and early participants fairly, creating an even playing field. With the current promotional wave, the rapid sale of batch 27 seems inevitable, suggesting a swift uptake in the presale and a continued surge in BDAG’s market value. Navigating Market Instability with Promising Opportunities Amid the ongoing turmoil in the cryptocurrency market, where uncertainty and skepticism prevail, certain coins are feeling the pressure. Ethereum is battling to regain its footing, supported by a dedicated base of long-term holders. Meanwhile, LINK is collaborating with notable stablecoin issuer Usual in an effort to stabilize its position. In contrast, BlockDAG is navigating these turbulent times with remarkable steadiness. The opportunity to claim a 350% bonus on BDAG purchases through the “FINALCALL700” code offers a unique chance for participants to secure one of the top crypto coins for 2025, even as the market faces ongoing challenges.

40171661,https://coingape.com/?p=238252,1739232157,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Grayscale Files For Cardano ETF With NYSE as Race Heats Up,https://coingape.com/grayscale-files-for-cardano-etf-with-nyse-as-race-heats-up/,"Grayscale Investments has submitted an application to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for a Cardano exchange-traded fund (ETF). This marks a step in the growing interest in cryptocurrency ETFs. The move is part of the company’s strategy to expand its crypto ETF offerings, following its recent filings for XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs. The Cardano ETF filing adds to the increasing list of institutional moves aiming to provide regulated exposure to popular cryptos. Grayscale Joins Race with Cardano ETF Application to NYSE In a recent filing , Grayscale submitted its proposal for a Cardano ETF with the NYSE, further diversifying its crypto offerings. The filing comes as part of a larger push by Grayscale to expand its presence in the growing cryptocurrency market. The firm has already filed similar ETF applications for other popular cryptos, such as XRP, Solana, and Litecoin. With the increasing institutional interest in digital assets, this move is a significant step toward regulated exposure for institutional investors seeking access to Cardano. Grayscale’s Cardano ETF application comes when institutional interest in cryptocurrency is expanding. With Cardano (ADA) becoming one of the top-performing assets, this ETF could offer a regulated route for traditional investors to gain ADA exposure. The Cardano network has gained substantial recognition for its focus on scalability, security, and sustainability, factors that appeal to investors. Moreso, these developments come when the US SEC seeks public comments on Grayscale’s Litecoin ETF proposal, allowing for a 21-day submission period. Litecoin ETFs are gaining attention as the SEC assesses Grayscale’s request to convert its Litecoin Trust into an exchange-traded product. Recently, asset managers like Grayscale and Coinshares have taken steps to expand crypto ETF offerings, signaling growing interest. Competition in the Crypto ETF Space Grayscale’s filing is part of a trend in the crypto market, where multiple asset managers are vying to offer ETFs linked to popular digital assets. Recently, other firms, including WisdomTree and Bitwise, have submitted similar applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for XRP ETFs. Additionally, Swedish asset manager Virtune AB launched a Cardano exchange-traded product (ETP) on Nasdaq Helsinki, catering to institutional investors. As the market continues to mature, more financial institutions are exploring the idea of crypto ETFs, especially for major cryptos like Cardano. The introduction of a Cardano ETF by Grayscale will provide more opportunities for investors looking to diversify their portfolios with ADA exposure. Impact on Cardano Price The introduction of a Cardano ETF could have a significant effect on ADA price and market sentiment. As more institutional investors gain exposure to Cardano, increased demand could lead to upward pressure on ADA price. Currently, the ADA remains relatively stable, but the potential for more institutional capital entering the space through an ETF could cause a rise in its price. In addition, if Cardano price holds above the $0.67–$0.81 support range, it could signal strength and set the stage for an ADA price rally . Technical indicators, including the TD Sequential buy signal, further support the possibility of a bullish reversal. However, if Cardano price fails to maintain this support, a drop below the range will lead to further declines. At the time of writing, Cardano price stands at $0.7068, reflecting a 3% increase in the past 24 hours. The market cap has risen to $24.87B, and the trading volume is up by 11.15%, reaching $752.82M.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Wall Street Pepe has officially sold out its presale, while Pepeto emerges as the next big meme coin contender. Table of Contents Pepeto’s rise: The God of Frogs set to take over Pepeto’s exchange and cross-chain bridge Pepeto landing a Binance listing Conclusion Two major players have risen in the ongoing meme coin frenzy: Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) and Pepeto (PEPETO). While both projects bring distinct value to the market, Pepeto now holds a strategic advantage as its presale remains open, presenting a prime opportunity for early investors. Wall Street Pepe, which aims to empower smaller traders with trading signals, alpha calls, and staking rewards, has successfully sold out its presale, with an official exchange listing soon to be announced. The demand for WEPE signals strong market interest, but new investors must now wait for its official debut on exchanges. Pepeto’s rise: The God of Frogs set to take over Dubbed the “God of Frogs,” Pepeto is setting itself apart with a powerful ecosystem, deep narrative appeal, and transformative utilities. Currently priced at $0.000000109 per token, PEPETO remains one of the most affordable and high-upside opportunities in the meme coin market . Key features driving its momentum include: Zero-fee trading on PepetoSwap – Eliminating transaction costs for meme coin traders. A cutting-edge cross-chain bridge – Enhancing interoperability and reducing friction between networks. Staking rewards at 387% APY – Providing lucrative incentives for long-term holders. With a thriving community of over 65,600 supporters and growing daily, PEPETO is capturing global attention. Its strong narrative, real-world use case, and bullish sentiment are fueling speculation that it could become one of the biggest meme coin success stories of 2025. You might also like: Pepeto hits $4m in presale, emerges as next big meme coin to watch Pepeto’s exchange and cross-chain bridge The anticipation surrounding PepetoSwap, a zero-fee exchange built for meme coin traders, is reaching new heights. Designed to solve key market inefficiencies such as high fees and fragmented liquidity, PepetoSwap is expected to set a new standard for seamless trading experiences. Additionally, Pepeto’s cross-chain bridge technology aims to redefine blockchain connectivity by allowing users to transfer assets effortlessly across networks. These developments not only strengthen Pepeto’s long-term potential but also reinforce its position as a leader in the evolving meme coin landscape. As the presale nears its conclusion, excitement around these utilities is at an all-time high. With the next crypto bull run on the horizon, PEPETO is emerging as one of the most promising contenders in the meme coin market. Pepeto landing a Binance listing While Wall Street Pepe eyes listings on exchanges like BingX, Gate.io, and MEXC, Pepeto’s combination of utility, price advantage, and market momentum has positioned it as a prime candidate for a Binance listing. Adding to the intrigue, rumors are swirling that an ex-founder of Pepe is involved with Pepeto, drawing further comparisons between the two projects. Given that PEPETO mirrors Pepe’s iconic 420T token supply, speculation continues to mount that a Binance listing could be in its future. Conclusion As the crypto world watches for the next breakout project, all eyes are on Pepeto as a top contender for Binance’s next meme coin listing. The countdown to the next major exchange listing has begun. To learn more about Pepeto, visit the website , Twitter , or Telegram .

Waters unveils bipartisan stablecoin bill ahead of House subcommittee hearing,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/waters-unveils-bipartisan-stablecoin-bill/,"Ranking member of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters has released proposed stablecoin legislation she and her colleague Patrick McHenry drafted during the previous session of Congress. She unveiled the bill on Feb. 10, the day before the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Asset, Financial Technology, and Artificial Intelligence is scheduled to meet. The Waters-McHenry bill does not have a name yet. The lawmakers prepared the bill as a bipartisan team and had hoped it could be considered by the 118th Congress. McHenry retired as chair of the committee at the end of the congressional session. The bill is not what the committee is waiting for A press release from the Financial Services Committee Democrats said the bill created a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. It prevents non-financial commercial companies from issuing stablecoins and imposes restrictions. In addition, it includes consumer protections. The bill also “protects the existing authorities of the Treasury, CFPB, SEC, and CFTC with respect to any entity covered by the Act.” This is problematic, as the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) is under fire from the new administration. At the time of writing, that agency’s homepage displays a 404:Page Not Found error message. Water’s goal in releasing the draft bill is not immediately evident. The agenda for the Feb. 11 Financial Services subcommittee meeting includes a discussion of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act, but not the Waters-McHenry bill. The Senate has the GENIUS Act on stablecoins The STABLE Act, authored by Republicans French Hill and Bryan Steil, was released on Feb. 7. A press release from the Financial Services Committee said it builds on McHenry’s efforts. Hill is now the chair of the committee and Steil is the chair of the digital assets subcommittee. The committee promised in its press release to work with Senate members in the Bicameral Working Group on Digital Assets to pass stablecoin legislation. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS Act) was introduced into the Senate on Feb. 4. The Senate bill was drafted by Bill Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Democratic Kirsten Gillibrand and Cynthia Lummis.

The strongest candidate for the next string of ETF approvals is, apparently, Litecoin—the experts note its favorable regulatory standing, which CFTC cleared out in its KuCoin lawsuit. The commodity status distinguishes the fork of Bitcoin (often referred to as the ”silver” to Bitcoin's “gold”) from assets that could be potentially considered unregistered securities. Meanwhile, much to the dismay of its ironclad fanbase, XRP has the lowest chance (65%) of approval, according to analysts, trailing behind Litecoin (90%), Dogecoin (75%), and Solana (70%). Balchunas noted that for their predictions, they only considered ETF filings structured similarly to BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which operates under the '33 Act framework. However, should the SEC greenlight the initial applications, the alternative ETF formats—such as those based on futures contracts or Cayman Islands subsidiaries regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940—could also have a path to approval. “Keep in mind all of this stuff (except Litecoin which was always high) was True to their name, some members of XRPArmy chimed in to defend their favorite coin against FUD, arguing against the “NO” put for XRP under the header “Does SEC currently view as commodity?”. A Twitter/X user @OnChainMayo pointed out that while the SEC appealed the decision in favor of Ripple, it didn’t contest the XRP status as a commodity. In response, Seyffart clarified that until all litigation between SEC and Ripple is settled, the prospect of XRP ETF will remain a far-off goal. Although the 19b-4 filings for DOGE and XRP will likely be acknowledged already this week, any meaningful development would have to wait until the end of 2025, when the SEC and Commissioner Heaster Peirce's Crypto task force are expected to start clearing the backlog of security vs commodity lawsuits left by previous leadership. On Monday, NASDAQ formally filed 19b-4 forms for Coinshares’ XRP and Litecoin ETFs, following the same filing from Cboe last week for spot XRP exchange-traded funds managed by WisdomTree, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary. For a crypto ETF to launch in the US, two key approvals are typically required: S-1 and 19b-4. The S-1 is a registration statement filed by the ETF issuer to register the fund with the SEC, while the 19b-4 is submitted by the exchange seeking permission to list and trade the product. Once the 19b-4 is submitted, the SEC must formally acknowledge the filing and publish it in the Federal Register. This marks the start of a public comment period, during which industry stakeholders and the public can provide feedback. After the comment period, the SEC has up to 240 days to review the application and decide whether to approve or reject it.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BTC|BTG|LTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-11 00:21:57

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Big money is shifting from DOGE and SHIB to RCO Finance, as its DeFi model attracts over $13 million in investments. Table of Contents Dogecoin: Still holding meme coin credibility Shiba Inu: From underdog to household name RCO Finance: An AI-powered alternative Conclusion Big money is flowing in unexpected directions. After years of hype around Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), a wave of traders is setting their sights on RCO Finance (RCOF). With the token priced at $0.1, a colossal breakout may be on the horizon. Market participants recall how Dogecoin turned small bets into fortunes during its heyday, while Shiba Inu shocked the crypto world with sudden, viral growth. Now, cracks in the meme-coin model are prompting a shift toward advanced tools and analytics. Against this backdrop, investors have funneled over $13 million into the new contender. Dogecoin: Still holding meme coin credibility No discussion of meme coins is complete without mentioning Dogecoin , which soared from fractions of a cent to nearly a dollar. Its spirited community and endorsement by high-profile figures drew millions of newcomers into the crypto space. However, the coin’s price has stalled well below its all-time high. Some observers argue it relies too heavily on cultural moments and viral social media bursts. While it continues to rank among the top digital assets, with a market cap of $37.89 billion, long-term investors yearn for a more reliable growth path. Shiba Inu: From underdog to household name If Dogecoin is the original meme coin juggernaut, Shiba Inu is its most famous protégé. Billed as the “Dogecoin killer,” it transformed investments into life-changing sums for those who got in at the right time. Its rapid ascent and playful branding made it a social media star, dominating headlines and amassing a loyal global following. Shiba Inu claims a multi-billion-dollar market cap, yet volumes rarely breach the billion-dollar mark. Ecosystem additions like decentralized exchanges and NFTs have helped sustain momentum, but the token hasn’t matched its previous meteoric spikes. That’s left many holders pondering whether the coin’s glory days are behind it — or if a second renaissance is still possible. You might also like: DOGE hints at ascending triangle formation, this alternative eyes a rally RCO Finance: An AI-powered alternative RCO Finance is an emerging force in decentralized finance. Priced at $0.1, its token has already attracted over $13 million in backing, spurring curiosity about whether it can deliver a massive rally. But RCO Finance is no ordinary project. A non-KYC DeFi hub, it will let users buy stocks, bonds, and even real estate directly with cryptocurrency, bypassing cumbersome fiat steps. This practical integration of traditional and digital assets sets it apart. Core to RCO Finance’s appeal is the Robo Advisor, a machine learning engine that aggregates market signals from Bloomberg and Reuters, along with on-chain analytics and social media sentiment. The Robo Advisor emphasizes data accuracy and timing. It excels in spotting breakout tokens early, advising users when to mitigate risk, and prompting them to take profits when momentum cools. A striking example would be the Newton Project (NEW), which jumped from $0.0018 to $0.0127 — a 5,470% leap. By sifting through global news feeds, RCO Finance aims to give traders a head start on similar trends. The platform’s emphasis on user control is evident in its beta platform , which lets participants test advanced features before the full release. A SolidProof audit confirms the code’s security, giving large-scale investors and retail participants a sense of reliability. Conclusion RCO Finance’s approach aligns with a maturing crypto environment where data matters more. With its token at $0.1 and upward of $13 million raised, RCO Finance has proven it can draw big money from all market corners. The current buzz suggests this might be the beginning of a longer, potentially explosive chapter in the crypto’s evolving story.

As of today, BTC’s price has steadily climbed, hovering above $97,000 at the time of writing—a 1.3% gain in the past day. Amid this Bitcoin price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Lion has identified a meaningful decline in leverage and open interest (OI) ratios since November 21, following the presidential election. What does this indicate for the Bitcoin market? Related Reading: Could Fear Fuel Bitcoin’s Comeback? Analyst Spots a Surprising Pattern Leverage Ratio Decrease And Its Implications In a recent QuickTake post titled “Leverage ratio decreased. Risk Off,” Crypto Lion explained that the leverage ratio of Bitcoin has fallen, along with the derivatives buy-sell ratio and the OI-to-market-cap ratio. This suggests a gradual unwinding of leverage as more Bitcoin leaves centralized exchanges (CEXs). The analyst also highlighted that much of this Bitcoin has shifted to Coinbase Prime or been used to back exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating a shift toward long-term holding and possibly a broader “risk-off” stance among large investors. The analyst particularly wrote: The large decrease in the leverage ratio means that OI is decreasing relative to the CEX BTC reserve. It is important to note that the CEX reserve has been declining for a long time and has been moved to the coinbase prime and bought to back ETFs. This means that risk-off may be more advanced than it appears. Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Reach 2022 Levels Adding to this narrative, another CryptoQuant analyst, Papi, reported a significant development in Bitcoin’s exchange dynamics. According to Papi, the largest net outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges since 2022 occurred last week, reducing the supply of Bitcoin on these platforms by 3%. The last time outflows reached a comparable scale was shortly after the collapse of FTX, a major exchange event that reshaped market sentiment. This latest exodus of Bitcoin from exchanges may signal growing confidence among institutional players and long-term holders. Despite recent price fluctuations, large buyers appear to be “stacking on dips,” as Papi noted. This behavior suggests that these entities anticipate future price appreciation and are accumulating while prices remain comparatively low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Indicator Signals Short-Term Holders Have Been Taking Profits – Is The Next Rally Near? The shift of funds off exchanges into private wallets or institutional custody often reflects a strategy of long-term holding rather than short-term trading, potentially providing a stable foundation for future market growth. Looking ahead, the reduced leverage ratios, coupled with significant outflows from exchanges, could point to a more cautious yet optimistic market sentiment. If these patterns continue, they may set the stage for a more sustained recovery in Bitcoin’s price and a shift toward healthier market conditions over time.

According to data insight from Santiment, Layer-1 networks have collectively seeing 44.2% of social discussions on specific coins. This shift, the analytics firm imply might mean a potential return to the bull era. Bitcoin, Toncoin and L1 Protocols Back In Limelight According to Santiment on X , memecoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and PEPE are currently being discussed less in the market. The platform attributed this shift to the recent volatility that pushed the dominance of speculative altcoin price behind. The data giant acknowledged that Bitcoin and L1s like Ethereum and Toncoin are the foundational infrastructure in the industry. It noted that the increased focus on these assets by traders often signals market maturity. It hinted that an L1 focus is a sign investors are prioritizing security, innovation and real world adoption. Per the Santiment insight, memecoin frenzies generally come before the market falls. Historically, it noted that speculative excesses often lead to sharp reversal when the hype has faded. However, it pointed out that this shift implies a more balanced market will emerge once the excessive leverage bets are wiped off. Is Bitcoin, Toncoin and L1s Ready for Rally? According to the Santiment projection, a shift away from memecoin is proof that the market might be tilting toward sustainable trends. It confirmed that the gambling mindset associated with memecoins is paving the way for better fundamentals. This forecast aligns with speculations from analysts that the altcoin selling will stop soon, paving the way for rapid rebound. As of writing, BTC price was changing hands for $97,380.20, up 1.81% in 24 hours. The sentiment has also trickled down to Ethereum, Toncoin, and Cardano. These altcoins are up 1.44%, 0.56% and 3.30% to $2,668, $3.806 and $0.7172 respectively. While it remains unclear whether the bull run is finally return, Santiment is optimistic the market is in a healthy cool-down period. Altcoins With ETF In Spotlight Altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Litecoin are in the spotlight owing to the growing push for spot ETFs to track their prices. As reported earlier by CoinGape, Grayscale has filed for Cardano ETF with the US SEC. The growing number of crypto ETF applications has signaled that a massive adoption era is on enroute.
