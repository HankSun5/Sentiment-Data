Amidst Bitcoin’s journey to the $90,000 price zone, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency emerged as one of the biggest weekly gainers with a 60.76% price increase. Following this price surge, a crypto analyst with X username BarriC has provided some interesting predictions on XRP’s future. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Booms: $44 Million In Transactions As Activity Soars XRP To Reach $10 In Bull Market, But There’s More In an X post on November 15, BarriC released several price targets for XRP tied to certain conditions. Firstly, the analyst forecasted XRP to attain a market price between $6-$10 in the crypto bull run, representing a minimum potential 500% gain on the token’s present price. These high expectations by BarriC are rather not uncommon due to several factors especially Donald Trump’s recent electoral victory which is expected to usher in a crypto-friendly US government. For XRP, the Republican President sticking to his electoral crypto manifesto holds massive importance as it may bring a decisive end to the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, and permanently halt the regulatory uncertainty over the token. In addition, Trump’s presidency also boosts the possibility of the XRP spot ETF with the SEC expected to present fewer regulatory hurdles for crypto-linked securities. Following approval, BarriC postulates a spot ETF can drive the altcoin to a market price of $15-$20 if approval comes amidst the bull market run. Furthermore, the analyst discusses a utility run during which the altcoin will undergo massive adoption in its use for cross-border transactions and as an institutional bridge cryptocurrency for banks. If the utility run occurs as predicted with global adoption levels of XRP, BarriC forecasts the altcoin to attain a minimal price of $100.

The coin rose from around $0.69 to reach a local peak of $0.92 as Gary Gensler “supposedly” hinted at a resignation as SEC chairman. While the altcoin has recorded a slight price decline of 1.2% in the past hour, the massive purchase by whales indicates a belief in the asset for long-term profitability. At the time of writing. XRP trades at 0.89, with his market cap value now above $50 billion. In tandem, the token’s trading volume is up by 24.71% and valued at $11.75 billion.

After a period of consolidation, Bitcoin’s latest price action signals a potential breakout that could set the stage for even greater gains. As it inches closer to this critical resistance level, can the crypto giant break through and unlock new heights, or will the bears reclaim control? With the market’s eyes fixed on this pivotal moment, the next move could reshape BTC’s future. This analysis aims to explore Bitcoin’s current surge toward the $93,257 resistance level and assess the likelihood of a breakout. By examining key technical indicators and market trends, it seeks to determine whether BTC can overcome this significant hurdle and reach new highs. Additionally, it will explore the possible impact of such a breakthrough on its price trajectory and the broader market sentiment. Bitcoin’s Renewed Momentum Leading To $93,257 Bitcoin is currently maintaining a bullish stance, holding firmly above the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, a strong indicator of continued upward momentum. The price now aims for its previous high of $93,257, having successfully avoided a drop below the $85,211 support. If this pressure continues, a break above $93,257 could create a path for new highs, while holding above the $85,211 support level signals strength in the ongoing rally. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a continued upside movement as the RSI climbs to 61% after dipping to 53%, signaling that the market is maintaining its bullish strength. Significantly, the sustained rise in the RSI suggests that the uptrend is gaining traction with the potential for more price increases as the buying pressure builds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Gains 10%: Is The $100K Dream Closer Than Ever? Additionally, the daily chart reveals that BTC is experiencing strong upbeat momentum, highlighted by the formation of bullish candlesticks. The asset’s position well above the key 100-day SMA further reinforces this positive trend. As BTC maintains its current trajectory, it bolsters market optimism, setting the stage for additional gains as it aims for the $93,257 target. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is at 92%, indicating strong positive movement after recovering from a dip to 77% suggesting a shift in market sentiment with increased buying pressure. While the high RSI points to continued growth, prolonged overbought conditions may lead to a correction if buying activity begins to wane. Key Resistance: Can Bitcoin Push Through? Bitcoin is approaching a critical resistance level at $93,257, a price point that could determine the next phase of its bullish trajectory.

Crypto Analyst Reveals Why The Dogecoin Price Is Primed For A Surge To $20,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/3-by-january-dogecoin-price/,"Crypto analyst John Burr on TradingView has discussed the potential for the Dogecoin price to reach $3 this market cycle. Driven by the positive sentiments from recent political events spearheaded by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Burr has revealed that Dogecoin can not only reach $3 but could skyrocket to $20. US Politics Could Drive DOGE To $3 According to the TradingView analyst, the Dogecoin price could be preparing for a strong bull run to the $3 target. In his report, Burrs discussed the effects of political changes on the crypto market, underscoring the changes the recent US Presidential elections have had on the Dogecoin price. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Entered The ‘Thrill’ Phase, Here’s What To Expect Next Based on its price chart, Burr claims that Dogecoin is repeating historical trends which signal an impending bull rally. The analyst also mentioned a correlation to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), hinting at future government actions or pro-crypto regulations indirectly impacting cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration ceremony as the 47th US President could also trigger the next bullish movement in the crypto market. As a result, Burr predicts that the Dogecoin price could surge to $3 on Inauguration Day. Considering that Dogecoin is trading below the $1 mark, the analyst has acknowledged that his bullish predictions for the meme coin could be wrong. He is focusing instead on the broader crypto bull market. He revealed that the market is currently at the beginning of the bull run, which gives Dogecoin more wiggle room for growth. Burrs has revealed that to some analysts, a $3 price target for Dogecoin may be conservative as they have projected extreme targets around the $40 level by next year. The analyst noted that skeptical crypto experts are unlikely to forecast an ATH beyond $3 for the DOGE price, primarily citing market cap concerns. This suggests that the DOGE market cap will have to exceed that of significant cryptocurrencies, possibly surpassing Bitcoin before it can reach $40. This substantial price and market cap increase appears unattainable, as it would require a sustained, strong demand and investor interest in Dogecoin. However, due to its meme coin status and the frequent occurrence of negative market conditions, maintaining such extensive demand could pose a challenge for Dogecoin, which remains vulnerable to market fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volume Crashes 27% As Price Falls, What Does This Say About The Decline? Can The Dogecoin Price Reach $20? In his TradingView post, Burr also highlighted the possibility of the Dogecoin price reaching new highs at $20. The analysts acknowledged his doubts about the feasibility of this ambitious price leap, which stands in sharp contrast to his earlier confidence in the $3 prediction for the DOGE price. A $20 target represents a massive price increase for Dogecoin, which is currently trading at $0.37. Dogecoin will have to experience price gains of about 5,300%, driven by extremely bullish conditions, favorable market sentiment, and widespread adoption.

This volatility has sparked significant interest among traders and investors as Solana tests key levels critical to its next move. Top analyst and macro investor Carl Runefelt has weighed in with a technical analysis, suggesting that a decisive break above the $225 resistance level could ignite a rally toward $246. According to Rubefelt, this level represents a pivotal threshold, and surpassing it may lead to accelerated bullish momentum. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Above Multi-Year Resistance – Top Analyst Shares Price Target The broader crypto market adds another layer of intrigue, with Bitcoin once again nearing its all-time high. Historically, Bitcoin’s movements have fueled market-wide rallies, and its current trajectory could provide the momentum needed for Solana to break out of its range and achieve new highs. As traders closely monitor both Solana’s and Bitcoin’s price action, the coming days will likely set the tone for the next chapter in this bullish cycle. Will Solana leverage market strength to surge past $225, or will resistance hold, leading to further consolidation? The unfolding narrative promises to be crucial for altcoin enthusiasts and market participants alike. Solana Testing Crucial Supply Solana is consolidating below critical supply levels that could act as a launchpad for testing its all-time high at $258. Currently trading in a tight range, Solana’s price action reflects indecision as traders and investors anticipate the next big move. According to key analyst Runefelt, the altcoin is positioned for a breakout. Sharing his technical analysis on X, Runefelt outlined a potential 12% surge, targeting the $246 resistance level—a crucial hurdle before Solana can challenge its historical peak. Breaking above this level would signal strong bullish momentum and likely set the stage for a rally to new all-time highs. However, for this scenario to play out, Solana must not only breach current levels but also hold them as support. Consolidation above these key thresholds would reinforce confidence among market participants and attract more demand, further fueling upward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Is King – STH Selling Pressure Expected To Be Absorbed By ETFs The broader market’s movements, particularly Bitcoin nearing its all-time highs, add another layer of significance. If Bitcoin sustains its bullish trajectory, it could provide the necessary tailwind for Solana to break through its consolidation phase. The coming days will be crucial in determining Solana’s direction. A breakout to the upside could solidify its place as a leading altcoin this cycle, while failure to hold above current levels might delay the rally. Key Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $219 after four days of sideways consolidation just below the critical $225 resistance level. This consolidation reflects a market waiting for a decisive breakout as traders eye the next move. Holding above the $200 demand level remains essential for confirming the bullish outlook. This support has acted as a foundation for Solana’s recent uptrend, and a failure to maintain it could signal weakness and open the door for further downside. Breaking and holding above the $225 resistance, however, is pivotal to affirm Solana’s bullish trend. This level serves as a psychological barrier and the bears’ last stronghold, with many likely to take profits or initiate shorts. If Solana can overcome this resistance, it could set the stage for an aggressive rally to all-time highs, effectively ending selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone – Last Time BTC Soared 80% A decisive breakout above $225 would not only signal bullish strength but also create a domino effect, attracting new buyers and fueling momentum. Such a move could lead to a sharp climb, putting SOL on track to challenge its $258 all-time high and potentially set new records. In the coming days, all eyes will be on Solana’s ability to reclaim key levels and build on its bullish momentum.

The crypto market leader established a new all-time high at $93,434 on Wednesday, as odds of achieving a six-figure market price by year’s end are now higher than before. Amidst the current market euphoria, CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha has shared some market insights that may indicate an impending price fall. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Entered The ‘Thrill’ Phase, Here’s What To Expect Next Bitcoin Enters Profit-Taking Zone – Sell Or HODL? In a Quicktake post on Friday, Amr Taha stated many investors may be preparing for a cash-out as the Bitcoin MVRV ratio reached 2.64. Generally, the Market Value to Realized Value is a trading indicator used to measure whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued or to identify market tops or bottoms. Amr Taha explains that a Bitcoin MVRV ratio above 2 indicates that investors currently hold significant amounts of unrealized gains and are likely to commence profit-taking. However, historical data from late 2021 and early 2022, shows that profit-taking occurs as the Bitcoin MVRV ratio moves into a range of 2.5-3.5, and is accompanied by significant corrections. Following the Bitcoin price surge over the past few weeks, an MVRV ratio of 2.64 presents substantial potential for a major price correction, despite the minor price drops in the past few days. This sentiment is further backed by the asset’s relative strength index (RSI), which remains in the overbought zone. However, Ama Taha further explains that Bitcoin may sometimes only form a major market top when the MVRV ratio reaches as high as 4. Therefore, at 2.64, the premier cryptocurrency may still sustain its current upward price trajectory, if bullish market momentum persists. The analyst advises that investors monitor the MVRV ratio as a rise towards 3 would signal the potential for further price gains while a decline to a range of 1.5-2 indicates a local market top is forming.

Short-Term Holders Realized Cap Hits $30 Billion In addition to Bitcoin’s alarming MVRV ratio, Taha also noted that short-term holders have now accumulated a realized market cap of over $30 billion, a level last observed in March 2024. The CryptoQuant analyst stated Bitcoin has historically undergone significant price corrections whenever the STH realized cap reached similar levels, signaling another warning for investors of a potential price dip. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $91,738 with a 3.97% gain in the past 24 hours. However, the asset’s trading volume is down by 7.42% and is valued at $80.73 billion.

Based on this, the analyst remarked that the party was just getting started, indicating that the flagship crypto is likely going much higher. Bitcoin Golden Ratio Multiplier Indicates Price Is Going Higher In an X post, CryptoCon highlighted how the Bitcoin Golden Multiplier Ratio indicates that the price is going much higher. He cited level 5 of the Golden Ration Multiplier, which he claimed is dual-purpose for the mid-top and cycle top. The analyst mentioned that Bitcoin formed the mid-top at level 5 in March earlier this year when it reached its previous all-time high (ATH) of $73,000. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Drive The Dogecoin Price To $1 This Bull Market CryptoCon further mentioned that it seems likely that Bitcoin will hit this level again before this market cycle is over. The analyst added that the level 5 band has increased to $122,000, and it is still climbing. In line with this, he remarked that the party is just getting started, indicating that the Bitcoin rally could still rally way higher and even reach this $122,000 target. In an earlier X post, CryptoCon also used the Magic Bands indicator to provide insights into Bitcoin’s price action and how high it could reach in this bull run. He said Bitcoin is racing to meet level 3 of the Magic Bands at $98,720. He added that the bands are set to rapidly expand to the upside as they adjust for the volume beyond the ATHs. Based on this, the analyst said that the cycle top target is now $134,000 and that the Bitcoin price could gain $1,000 weekly. CryptoCon remarked that he anticipates the cycle top sometime in late 2025. That means there is a lot of time for the bands to expand to higher prices, indicating that the Bitcoin price could rise higher. BTC Primed To Reclaim Local Highs Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto stated that the Bitcoin price looks primed to move to the local highs as long as the $87,700 level isn’t breached. The analyst also mentioned that a clear and impulsive move above the local highs at $93,800 would send Bitcoin above $100,000, making the possibility of dropping to $72,000 unlikely until the next bear market. Related Reading: Major Hindrances To Dogecoin Price Hitting $1 According To This Crypto Analyst However, if that clear and impulsive move doesn’t happen, CrediBull Crypto stated that it would imply that the move is corrective and makes the odds of retesting the range between $70,000 and $72,000 exponentially higher. He suggested that BTC could even drop below $70,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $91,200, up almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/last-chance-to-buy-ethereum-analyst-expects-6000-once-it-breaks-8-month-accumulation/,"Ethereum (ETH) is gearing up for an explosive bullish phase after decisively breaking above the crucial $3,000 mark. This milestone has fueled optimism among traders and investors, signaling a potential surge to new all-time highs. ETH’s recent price action demonstrates strong momentum, suggesting that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is ready to reclaim its place in the spotlight. Renowned analyst and investor Carl Runefelt has bolstered this bullish outlook with a compelling technical analysis. Sharing his insights, Runefelt pointed out Ethereum’s impressive recovery and growing strength. He emphasized that if current momentum continues, the $6,000 milestone could be within reach sooner than many expect. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Is King – STH Selling Pressure Expected To Be Absorbed By ETFs According to Runefelt, Ethereum’s upward trajectory is supported by increasing network activity, heightened institutional interest, and broader adoption of its smart contract capabilities. The crypto market’s recent surge, led by Bitcoin’s new all-time highs, has created an environment ripe for Ethereum to follow suit. As traders focus on ETH’s potential to outperform other altcoins, all eyes are on whether it can sustain its breakout and push higher. The coming weeks will be crucial as Ethereum solidifies its position above $3,000, potentially paving the way for a rally that could redefine expectations for this cycle. Ethereum Testing Supply Ethereum is on the brink of a significant breakout as it approaches the last major supply levels before potentially embarking on a Bitcoin-like rally. After reclaiming its local highs with strong momentum, Ethereum has captured the attention of traders and investors looking for the next big move in the crypto market. Many believe the current consolidation phase is just the calm before a bullish storm. Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting Ethereum’s readiness for a massive bull run. Runefelt emphasized that ETH is mirroring Bitcoin’s recent explosive breakout, suggesting that Ethereum could be next to surge. According to his analysis, this may be the last opportunity to buy ETH at relatively low prices before the market takes off. Runefelt set an ambitious price target of $6,000, forecasting this level as attainable once Ethereum breaks through its final supply zones. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Above Multi-Year Resistance – Top Analyst Shares Price Target Ethereum’s potential rally is supported by a combination of technical strength and increasing demand for its smart contract platform. With Bitcoin setting new all-time highs, the market’s focus is gradually shifting toward altcoins, particularly Ethereum. If ETH breaks above its current resistance, it could ignite a wave of buying pressure that sends prices soaring to unprecedented levels. ETH Testing Technical Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $3,110, following a 12% retrace from its recent local highs. Despite the pullback, ETH continues to show resilience, holding firmly above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $2,955. This key demand level is a strong indicator of long-term market strength and suggests that Ethereum remains in bullish territory despite short-term volatility. The 200-day MA serves as a critical support zone, and its defense could pave the way for a significant rally in the coming days. If ETH maintains its position above this level for an extended period, it would signal renewed bullish momentum and set the stage for a breakout to higher supply zones.

A successful breach and consolidation above this price point would confirm a breakout, positioning ETH to challenge its all-time high (ATH).

Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor Harmon gets a three-year sentence, in addition to forfeiture of assets up to $400 million, for his role in laundering over $300 million worth of Bitcoin tokens for darknet’s drug markets. According to US authorities, Harmon used the platform to help launder the drug dealers’ funds, facilitating the transfer of over 350,000 BTCs from 2014 to 2017. He gets a three-year sentence, a relatively light serving time, but faces a forfeiture money judgment worth $311,145,854 and forfeiture of all seized assets amounting to at least $400 million. A ‘Lighter Sentence’ Over Money Laundering Case According to court documents, Harmon operated Helix from 2014 to 2017 and, during this time, laundered up to $300 million worth of Bitcoins on behalf of drug dealers. After hearing the case and with Harmon’s guilty plea, US District Judge Beryl Howell sentenced Harmon to three years of jail time. In addition to prison time, Harmon will serve a three-year supervised release, pay the court up to $311 million, and surrender all seized assets, including cryptocurrencies and real estate, amounting to at least $400 million. An Ohio man was sentenced to 3 years in prison and ordered to forfeit over $400M in assets for his operating of Helix, a darknet cryptocurrency “mixer.” @DOJCrimDiv #FollowTheMoney #IRSCIhttps://t.co/4IRC4fDbPf — IRS Criminal Investigation (@IRS_CI) November 15, 2024 Helix: Harmon’s Role In Laundering Drug Money Helix was a popular crypto-mixing service on the darknet and a favorite destination of drug dealers who wanted to launder their money. According to a Department of Justice press release, the mixing site processed 354,468 BTCs, or approximately $311,145,854, during transactions. Records show that the bulk of these funds are for darknet drug markets, and some are for customers based in the District of Columbia. Harmon collected a percentage of these transactions as fees and commissions for running the service. Harmon ensured that Helix was linked to Grams, a darknet search engine, and worked with most darknet markets as part of the laundering operations. Harmon used his proprietary API to integrate Helix into the darknet markets’ BTC withdrawal system. He also customized the API to make it more compatible with other markets. Last August 18th, 2021, Harmon submitted a guilty plea for conspiracy to commit money laundering. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K?

However, the presiding judge only imposed a three-year sentence, crediting Harmon for his help in this case. This resulted in Roman Sterlingov’s sentencing to 12.5 years last November 8th. Judge Howell acknowledged Harmon’s effort to close the platform two years before the authorities charged him. The court considered this move a sign that Harmon had reformed, even before the case was filed.

Following Donald Trump’s electoral victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week and Bitcoin’s recent surge to an all-time high of $93,250, investor sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has notably improved. Anticipated Regulatory Relief In a recent interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Wood discussed her expectations for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. She stated that ARK Invest’s targets for 2030 range between $650,000 and, in a bullish scenario, between $1 million and $1.5 million. Ark’s CEO attributed the current uptrend in Bitcoin’s value to several catalysts, particularly the anticipated regulatory relief that could come from Trump’s new administration. Related Reading: Major Hindrances To Dogecoin Price Hitting $1 According To This Crypto Analyst The now 47th President of the United States has vowed to make significant changes, particularly in the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), headed by Gary Gensler and characterized by lawsuits, Wells Notices and increased scrutiny of key industry players. This has led to notable discontent over the past three years of his tenure at the regulatory agency, prompting executives and investors in the digital asset ecosystem to call for a change for a clearer regulatory framework that could invite further adoption and growth of the market. However, Trump promised to fire Gary Gensler on the first day of his new administration, which is expected to begin on January 20. He also vowed to make America the “crypto capital of the world” with a new framework and support for digital assets, with Bitcoin at the center of his economic agenda. This has resonated well with industry advocates, as evidenced by the broader market rally led by the market’s largest digital assets, which have risen nearly 25% since Trump’s election victory. Bitcoin As A Unique Asset Class During the interview, Wood also highlighted that ARK Invest was the first public asset manager to invest in Bitcoin when it was priced at just $250 in 2015. The asset manager believes that even at approximately $90,000, Bitcoin still has significant growth potential. According to Wood, Trump’s victory is pivotal, as it signals a shift toward a more favorable regulatory environment for the cryptocurrency sector—an outcome she views as crucial for Bitcoin’s future. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Above Multi-Year Resistance – Top Analyst Shares Price Target Furthermore, Wood emphasized that Bitcoin has evolved into a distinct asset class, separate from traditional currencies. She believes that this shift indicates that institutional investors and asset allocators are increasingly looking to include Bitcoin in their portfolios, recognizing its potential as both a store of value and a hedge against inflation. At the time of writing, BTC is hovering around the $90,120 mark, still up 16% in the weekly time frame, despite the current retracement experienced over the past 48 hours.

Whale and shark wallets holding a minimum of 1 million XRP recently reached a five-year high of 45.61 billion tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K? Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast The increase in accumulation suggests renewed confidence from high net-worth investors who believe there is more upside for the coin. As per Santiment, these whales collected 3.44 billion tokens over the last two years which is an uptick of 8%. The last week brought jubilant news for the XRP enthusiasts as the price rallied by over 90%. The excitement around the currency however is on the all-time high due to the prevailing communal positive energy and enthusiasm. 🐳 Wallets with at least 1M XRP now hold a combined 45.61B tokens, their highest amount held since June, 2018. In the past 2 years, whales & sharks have reversed course and accumulated 3.44B more XRP, a +8.16% increase. Traders have enjoyed a +40% return in the past 7 days. pic.twitter.com/nzYNU3CJyW — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 14, 2024 Rising Prices, Growing Conversations The strong rally of XRP has ignited conversations online once more. Nearly 5% of crypto discussion recently has focused on XRP’s impact which indicates its increasing relevance. The token is currently priced at approximately $0.71 and has strong resistance ahead of it. Analysts believe that, given factors such as funding rates and the fear of missing out (FOMO), maintaining that momentum will be essential in the next upward price movement. However, considerable concern persists. If overextended longs arise on big exchanges such as Binance, the rising trend may slow. It’s a fine line between optimism and the requirement for market health to sustain prolonged rallies. Technical Breakout Leads To Higher Targets Technically, XRP’s recent price fluctuations indicate a positive trend. Crypto researcher Jonathan Carter said that the token has broken out of a triangle pattern that has been in place since 2021. Such breakthroughs frequently herald big price movements, and for XRP, this could point to mid-term resistance around $1.68. Historical patterns, on the other hand, add to optimism. Analysts have drawn comparisons to XRP’s performance in 2017, indicating the possibility of exponential development. While estimates range as high as $4.80 by late 2024, they are dependent on sustained growth and broader market circumstances.

The trading volume within the last 24 hours has registered an increase of 120% to hit the $17.50 billion mark. This rise coupled with a 12 percent rise in open interest in respect of XRP derivatives points out to more traders betting on the potential of the token for further upside. Despite the positive developments, caution is urged. Based on CryptoQuant data, while miner sell-offs are currently contained, they are likely to be more pronounced if the rally goes beyond the allowable limits. As of now, investors in XRP are hopeful of the future, thanks to whale accumulation, technical breakouts, and a proactive community. But whether this trend can actually continue or not will depend on the balance of market forces and investors’ expectations.

Recent statistics indicate a 115% increase in the burn rate, with more than 16.1 million SHIB tokens incinerated in a single week. This increase is noteworthy since it diminishes the circulating supply of SHIB, potentially exerting upward pressure on its price if demand remains constant or escalates.

Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast A Community-Led Initiative The current increase in SHIB’s burn rate is mostly propelled by community efforts to augment the token’s worth. Advocates have united to endorse multiple burn events, transferring tokens to inactive wallets and thereby eliminating them from circulation. The total amount of SHIB burned since the year started is a whopping 410 trillion tokens, proving the community’s will to reduce supply and improve scarcity. This milestone corresponds with overarching economic principles: when supply decreases and demand remains stable or increases, the likelihood of price appreciation escalates. The Shiba Inu community asserts that these initiatives would enhance SHIB’s market standing and draw new investors seeking opportunities in the cryptocurrency sector. Market Reaction And Price Fluctuations As a result, the price of SHIB rose following news of this increased burn rate. The value of the token jumped by 27% to around $0.00002753, levels that hadn’t been witnessed for months. A good sign of the state of the market mood among investors is the community’s proactively managed supply strategy. $SHIB is repeating history, and you know what that means… The parabolic phase is coming! 📈 Are you ready for some gains? 🚀 #SHIB #Crypto pic.twitter.com/C0rNQ2faL4 — SHIB Bezos (@BezosCrypto) November 14, 2024 Additionally, whales in this context have actually been driving this positive sentiment. Major SHIB holders have undertaken large burn transactions, which have then diluted the circulating supply and challenged the community. The bigger whales are going to nudge participation in the market from other, smaller investors with their increased activity in the coin.

Due to heightened burning, enhanced community involvement, and favorable market mood, SHIB may be poised for a substantial gain. Certain analysts forecast that, should prevailing trends continue, SHIB may see price escalations of up to 80% in the near future. At the same time, the Shiba Inu ecosystem will continue to mature with new upcoming projects. These developments should further strengthen user engagement and the overall value proposition of SHIB, even in a competitive marketplace. With a new high in the burn rate of Shiba Inu, this is more than just a good development for its community and investors; it means that by actively burning its supplies and encouraging participation, SHIB might strategically be well-positioned to grow as it continues navigating the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.
