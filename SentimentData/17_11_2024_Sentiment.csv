Amidst Bitcoin’s journey to the $90,000 price zone, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency emerged as one of the biggest weekly gainers with a 60.76% price increase. Following this price surge, a crypto analyst with X username BarriC has provided some interesting predictions on XRP’s future. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Booms: $44 Million In Transactions As Activity Soars XRP To Reach $10 In Bull Market, But There’s More In an X post on November 15, BarriC released several price targets for XRP tied to certain conditions. Firstly, the analyst forecasted XRP to attain a market price between $6-$10 in the crypto bull run, representing a minimum potential 500% gain on the token’s present price. These high expectations by BarriC are rather not uncommon due to several factors especially Donald Trump’s recent electoral victory which is expected to usher in a crypto-friendly US government. For XRP, the Republican President sticking to his electoral crypto manifesto holds massive importance as it may bring a decisive end to the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, and permanently halt the regulatory uncertainty over the token. In addition, Trump’s presidency also boosts the possibility of the XRP spot ETF with the SEC expected to present fewer regulatory hurdles for crypto-linked securities. Following approval, BarriC postulates a spot ETF can drive the altcoin to a market price of $15-$20 if approval comes amidst the bull market run. Furthermore, the analyst discusses a utility run during which the altcoin will undergo massive adoption in its use for cross-border transactions and as an institutional bridge cryptocurrency for banks. If the utility run occurs as predicted with global adoption levels of XRP, BarriC forecasts the altcoin to attain a minimal price of $100.

The coin rose from around $0.69 to reach a local peak of $0.92 as Gary Gensler “supposedly” hinted at a resignation as SEC chairman. While the altcoin has recorded a slight price decline of 1.2% in the past hour, the massive purchase by whales indicates a belief in the asset for long-term profitability. At the time of writing. XRP trades at 0.89, with his market cap value now above $50 billion. In tandem, the token’s trading volume is up by 24.71% and valued at $11.75 billion.

After a period of consolidation, Bitcoin’s latest price action signals a potential breakout that could set the stage for even greater gains. As it inches closer to this critical resistance level, can the crypto giant break through and unlock new heights, or will the bears reclaim control? With the market’s eyes fixed on this pivotal moment, the next move could reshape BTC’s future. This analysis aims to explore Bitcoin’s current surge toward the $93,257 resistance level and assess the likelihood of a breakout. By examining key technical indicators and market trends, it seeks to determine whether BTC can overcome this significant hurdle and reach new highs. Additionally, it will explore the possible impact of such a breakthrough on its price trajectory and the broader market sentiment. Bitcoin’s Renewed Momentum Leading To $93,257 Bitcoin is currently maintaining a bullish stance, holding firmly above the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, a strong indicator of continued upward momentum. The price now aims for its previous high of $93,257, having successfully avoided a drop below the $85,211 support. If this pressure continues, a break above $93,257 could create a path for new highs, while holding above the $85,211 support level signals strength in the ongoing rally. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a continued upside movement as the RSI climbs to 61% after dipping to 53%, signaling that the market is maintaining its bullish strength. Significantly, the sustained rise in the RSI suggests that the uptrend is gaining traction with the potential for more price increases as the buying pressure builds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Gains 10%: Is The $100K Dream Closer Than Ever? Additionally, the daily chart reveals that BTC is experiencing strong upbeat momentum, highlighted by the formation of bullish candlesticks. The asset’s position well above the key 100-day SMA further reinforces this positive trend. As BTC maintains its current trajectory, it bolsters market optimism, setting the stage for additional gains as it aims for the $93,257 target. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is at 92%, indicating strong positive movement after recovering from a dip to 77% suggesting a shift in market sentiment with increased buying pressure. While the high RSI points to continued growth, prolonged overbought conditions may lead to a correction if buying activity begins to wane. Key Resistance: Can Bitcoin Push Through? Bitcoin is approaching a critical resistance level at $93,257, a price point that could determine the next phase of its bullish trajectory. If Bitcoin successfully surpasses $93,257, it could pave the way for new highs, indicating continued strength in the market.

Crypto Analyst Reveals Why The Dogecoin Price Is Primed For A Surge To $20,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/3-by-january-dogecoin-price/,"Crypto analyst John Burr on TradingView has discussed the potential for the Dogecoin price to reach $3 this market cycle. Driven by the positive sentiments from recent political events spearheaded by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Burr has revealed that Dogecoin can not only reach $3 but could skyrocket to $20. US Politics Could Drive DOGE To $3 According to the TradingView analyst, the Dogecoin price could be preparing for a strong bull run to the $3 target. In his report, Burrs discussed the effects of political changes on the crypto market, underscoring the changes the recent US Presidential elections have had on the Dogecoin price. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Entered The ‘Thrill’ Phase, Here’s What To Expect Next Based on its price chart, Burr claims that Dogecoin is repeating historical trends which signal an impending bull rally. The analyst also mentioned a correlation to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), hinting at future government actions or pro-crypto regulations indirectly impacting cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration ceremony as the 47th US President could also trigger the next bullish movement in the crypto market. As a result, Burr predicts that the Dogecoin price could surge to $3 on Inauguration Day. Considering that Dogecoin is trading below the $1 mark, the analyst has acknowledged that his bullish predictions for the meme coin could be wrong. He is focusing instead on the broader crypto bull market. He revealed that the market is currently at the beginning of the bull run, which gives Dogecoin more wiggle room for growth. Burrs has revealed that to some analysts, a $3 price target for Dogecoin may be conservative as they have projected extreme targets around the $40 level by next year. The analyst noted that skeptical crypto experts are unlikely to forecast an ATH beyond $3 for the DOGE price, primarily citing market cap concerns. This suggests that the DOGE market cap will have to exceed that of significant cryptocurrencies, possibly surpassing Bitcoin before it can reach $40. This substantial price and market cap increase appears unattainable, as it would require a sustained, strong demand and investor interest in Dogecoin. However, due to its meme coin status and the frequent occurrence of negative market conditions, maintaining such extensive demand could pose a challenge for Dogecoin, which remains vulnerable to market fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volume Crashes 27% As Price Falls, What Does This Say About The Decline? Can The Dogecoin Price Reach $20? In his TradingView post, Burr also highlighted the possibility of the Dogecoin price reaching new highs at $20. The analysts acknowledged his doubts about the feasibility of this ambitious price leap, which stands in sharp contrast to his earlier confidence in the $3 prediction for the DOGE price. A $20 target represents a massive price increase for Dogecoin, which is currently trading at $0.37. Dogecoin will have to experience price gains of about 5,300%, driven by extremely bullish conditions, favorable market sentiment, and widespread adoption.
