Amidst Bitcoin’s journey to the $90,000 price zone, the seventh-largest cryptocurrency emerged as one of the biggest weekly gainers with a 60.76% price increase. Following this price surge, a crypto analyst with X username BarriC has provided some interesting predictions on XRP’s future. Related Reading: XRP Ledger Booms: $44 Million In Transactions As Activity Soars XRP To Reach $10 In Bull Market, But There’s More In an X post on November 15, BarriC released several price targets for XRP tied to certain conditions. Firstly, the analyst forecasted XRP to attain a market price between $6-$10 in the crypto bull run, representing a minimum potential 500% gain on the token’s present price. These high expectations by BarriC are rather not uncommon due to several factors especially Donald Trump’s recent electoral victory which is expected to usher in a crypto-friendly US government. For XRP, the Republican President sticking to his electoral crypto manifesto holds massive importance as it may bring a decisive end to the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, and permanently halt the regulatory uncertainty over the token. In addition, Trump’s presidency also boosts the possibility of the XRP spot ETF with the SEC expected to present fewer regulatory hurdles for crypto-linked securities. Following approval, BarriC postulates a spot ETF can drive the altcoin to a market price of $15-$20 if approval comes amidst the bull market run. Furthermore, the analyst discusses a utility run during which the altcoin will undergo massive adoption in its use for cross-border transactions and as an institutional bridge cryptocurrency for banks. If the utility run occurs as predicted with global adoption levels of XRP, BarriC forecasts the altcoin to attain a minimal price of $100.

The coin rose from around $0.69 to reach a local peak of $0.92 as Gary Gensler “supposedly” hinted at a resignation as SEC chairman. While the altcoin has recorded a slight price decline of 1.2% in the past hour, the massive purchase by whales indicates a belief in the asset for long-term profitability. At the time of writing. XRP trades at 0.89, with his market cap value now above $50 billion. In tandem, the token’s trading volume is up by 24.71% and valued at $11.75 billion.

After a period of consolidation, Bitcoin’s latest price action signals a potential breakout that could set the stage for even greater gains. As it inches closer to this critical resistance level, can the crypto giant break through and unlock new heights, or will the bears reclaim control? With the market’s eyes fixed on this pivotal moment, the next move could reshape BTC’s future. This analysis aims to explore Bitcoin’s current surge toward the $93,257 resistance level and assess the likelihood of a breakout. By examining key technical indicators and market trends, it seeks to determine whether BTC can overcome this significant hurdle and reach new highs. Additionally, it will explore the possible impact of such a breakthrough on its price trajectory and the broader market sentiment. Bitcoin’s Renewed Momentum Leading To $93,257 Bitcoin is currently maintaining a bullish stance, holding firmly above the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, a strong indicator of continued upward momentum. The price now aims for its previous high of $93,257, having successfully avoided a drop below the $85,211 support. If this pressure continues, a break above $93,257 could create a path for new highs, while holding above the $85,211 support level signals strength in the ongoing rally. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows a continued upside movement as the RSI climbs to 61% after dipping to 53%, signaling that the market is maintaining its bullish strength. Significantly, the sustained rise in the RSI suggests that the uptrend is gaining traction with the potential for more price increases as the buying pressure builds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Gains 10%: Is The $100K Dream Closer Than Ever? Additionally, the daily chart reveals that BTC is experiencing strong upbeat momentum, highlighted by the formation of bullish candlesticks. The asset’s position well above the key 100-day SMA further reinforces this positive trend. As BTC maintains its current trajectory, it bolsters market optimism, setting the stage for additional gains as it aims for the $93,257 target. Lastly, the RSI on the daily chart is at 92%, indicating strong positive movement after recovering from a dip to 77% suggesting a shift in market sentiment with increased buying pressure. While the high RSI points to continued growth, prolonged overbought conditions may lead to a correction if buying activity begins to wane. Key Resistance: Can Bitcoin Push Through? Bitcoin is approaching a critical resistance level at $93,257, a price point that could determine the next phase of its bullish trajectory.

Crypto Analyst Reveals Why The Dogecoin Price Is Primed For A Surge To $20,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/3-by-january-dogecoin-price/,"Crypto analyst John Burr on TradingView has discussed the potential for the Dogecoin price to reach $3 this market cycle. Driven by the positive sentiments from recent political events spearheaded by SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Burr has revealed that Dogecoin can not only reach $3 but could skyrocket to $20. US Politics Could Drive DOGE To $3 According to the TradingView analyst, the Dogecoin price could be preparing for a strong bull run to the $3 target. In his report, Burrs discussed the effects of political changes on the crypto market, underscoring the changes the recent US Presidential elections have had on the Dogecoin price. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Entered The ‘Thrill’ Phase, Here’s What To Expect Next Based on its price chart, Burr claims that Dogecoin is repeating historical trends which signal an impending bull rally. The analyst also mentioned a correlation to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), hinting at future government actions or pro-crypto regulations indirectly impacting cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration ceremony as the 47th US President could also trigger the next bullish movement in the crypto market. As a result, Burr predicts that the Dogecoin price could surge to $3 on Inauguration Day. Considering that Dogecoin is trading below the $1 mark, the analyst has acknowledged that his bullish predictions for the meme coin could be wrong. He is focusing instead on the broader crypto bull market. He revealed that the market is currently at the beginning of the bull run, which gives Dogecoin more wiggle room for growth. Burrs has revealed that to some analysts, a $3 price target for Dogecoin may be conservative as they have projected extreme targets around the $40 level by next year. The analyst noted that skeptical crypto experts are unlikely to forecast an ATH beyond $3 for the DOGE price, primarily citing market cap concerns. This suggests that the DOGE market cap will have to exceed that of significant cryptocurrencies, possibly surpassing Bitcoin before it can reach $40. This substantial price and market cap increase appears unattainable, as it would require a sustained, strong demand and investor interest in Dogecoin. However, due to its meme coin status and the frequent occurrence of negative market conditions, maintaining such extensive demand could pose a challenge for Dogecoin, which remains vulnerable to market fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volume Crashes 27% As Price Falls, What Does This Say About The Decline? Can The Dogecoin Price Reach $20? In his TradingView post, Burr also highlighted the possibility of the Dogecoin price reaching new highs at $20. The analysts acknowledged his doubts about the feasibility of this ambitious price leap, which stands in sharp contrast to his earlier confidence in the $3 prediction for the DOGE price. A $20 target represents a massive price increase for Dogecoin, which is currently trading at $0.37. Dogecoin will have to experience price gains of about 5,300%, driven by extremely bullish conditions, favorable market sentiment, and widespread adoption.

This volatility has sparked significant interest among traders and investors as Solana tests key levels critical to its next move. Top analyst and macro investor Carl Runefelt has weighed in with a technical analysis, suggesting that a decisive break above the $225 resistance level could ignite a rally toward $246. According to Rubefelt, this level represents a pivotal threshold, and surpassing it may lead to accelerated bullish momentum. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Above Multi-Year Resistance – Top Analyst Shares Price Target The broader crypto market adds another layer of intrigue, with Bitcoin once again nearing its all-time high. Historically, Bitcoin’s movements have fueled market-wide rallies, and its current trajectory could provide the momentum needed for Solana to break out of its range and achieve new highs. As traders closely monitor both Solana’s and Bitcoin’s price action, the coming days will likely set the tone for the next chapter in this bullish cycle. Will Solana leverage market strength to surge past $225, or will resistance hold, leading to further consolidation? The unfolding narrative promises to be crucial for altcoin enthusiasts and market participants alike. Solana Testing Crucial Supply Solana is consolidating below critical supply levels that could act as a launchpad for testing its all-time high at $258. Currently trading in a tight range, Solana’s price action reflects indecision as traders and investors anticipate the next big move. According to key analyst Runefelt, the altcoin is positioned for a breakout. Sharing his technical analysis on X, Runefelt outlined a potential 12% surge, targeting the $246 resistance level—a crucial hurdle before Solana can challenge its historical peak. Breaking above this level would signal strong bullish momentum and likely set the stage for a rally to new all-time highs. However, for this scenario to play out, Solana must not only breach current levels but also hold them as support. Consolidation above these key thresholds would reinforce confidence among market participants and attract more demand, further fueling upward momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Is King – STH Selling Pressure Expected To Be Absorbed By ETFs The broader market’s movements, particularly Bitcoin nearing its all-time highs, add another layer of significance. If Bitcoin sustains its bullish trajectory, it could provide the necessary tailwind for Solana to break through its consolidation phase. The coming days will be crucial in determining Solana’s direction. A breakout to the upside could solidify its place as a leading altcoin this cycle, while failure to hold above current levels might delay the rally. Key Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $219 after four days of sideways consolidation just below the critical $225 resistance level. This consolidation reflects a market waiting for a decisive breakout as traders eye the next move. Holding above the $200 demand level remains essential for confirming the bullish outlook. This support has acted as a foundation for Solana’s recent uptrend, and a failure to maintain it could signal weakness and open the door for further downside. Breaking and holding above the $225 resistance, however, is pivotal to affirm Solana’s bullish trend. This level serves as a psychological barrier and the bears’ last stronghold, with many likely to take profits or initiate shorts. If Solana can overcome this resistance, it could set the stage for an aggressive rally to all-time highs, effectively ending selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly RSI Entering Power Zone – Last Time BTC Soared 80% A decisive breakout above $225 would not only signal bullish strength but also create a domino effect, attracting new buyers and fueling momentum. Such a move could lead to a sharp climb, putting SOL on track to challenge its $258 all-time high and potentially set new records. In the coming days, all eyes will be on Solana’s ability to reclaim key levels and build on its bullish momentum.

The crypto market leader established a new all-time high at $93,434 on Wednesday, as odds of achieving a six-figure market price by year’s end are now higher than before. Amidst the current market euphoria, CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha has shared some market insights that may indicate an impending price fall. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Has Entered The ‘Thrill’ Phase, Here’s What To Expect Next Bitcoin Enters Profit-Taking Zone – Sell Or HODL? In a Quicktake post on Friday, Amr Taha stated many investors may be preparing for a cash-out as the Bitcoin MVRV ratio reached 2.64. Generally, the Market Value to Realized Value is a trading indicator used to measure whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued or to identify market tops or bottoms. Amr Taha explains that a Bitcoin MVRV ratio above 2 indicates that investors currently hold significant amounts of unrealized gains and are likely to commence profit-taking. However, historical data from late 2021 and early 2022, shows that profit-taking occurs as the Bitcoin MVRV ratio moves into a range of 2.5-3.5, and is accompanied by significant corrections. Following the Bitcoin price surge over the past few weeks, an MVRV ratio of 2.64 presents substantial potential for a major price correction, despite the minor price drops in the past few days. This sentiment is further backed by the asset’s relative strength index (RSI), which remains in the overbought zone. However, Ama Taha further explains that Bitcoin may sometimes only form a major market top when the MVRV ratio reaches as high as 4. Therefore, at 2.64, the premier cryptocurrency may still sustain its current upward price trajectory, if bullish market momentum persists. The analyst advises that investors monitor the MVRV ratio as a rise towards 3 would signal the potential for further price gains while a decline to a range of 1.5-2 indicates a local market top is forming.

Short-Term Holders Realized Cap Hits $30 Billion In addition to Bitcoin’s alarming MVRV ratio, Taha also noted that short-term holders have now accumulated a realized market cap of over $30 billion, a level last observed in March 2024. The CryptoQuant analyst stated Bitcoin has historically undergone significant price corrections whenever the STH realized cap reached similar levels, signaling another warning for investors of a potential price dip. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $91,738 with a 3.97% gain in the past 24 hours. However, the asset’s trading volume is down by 7.42% and is valued at $80.73 billion.

Based on this, the analyst remarked that the party was just getting started, indicating that the flagship crypto is likely going much higher. Bitcoin Golden Ratio Multiplier Indicates Price Is Going Higher In an X post, CryptoCon highlighted how the Bitcoin Golden Multiplier Ratio indicates that the price is going much higher. He cited level 5 of the Golden Ration Multiplier, which he claimed is dual-purpose for the mid-top and cycle top. The analyst mentioned that Bitcoin formed the mid-top at level 5 in March earlier this year when it reached its previous all-time high (ATH) of $73,000. Related Reading: Here Are The Factors That Could Drive The Dogecoin Price To $1 This Bull Market CryptoCon further mentioned that it seems likely that Bitcoin will hit this level again before this market cycle is over. The analyst added that the level 5 band has increased to $122,000, and it is still climbing. In line with this, he remarked that the party is just getting started, indicating that the Bitcoin rally could still rally way higher and even reach this $122,000 target. In an earlier X post, CryptoCon also used the Magic Bands indicator to provide insights into Bitcoin’s price action and how high it could reach in this bull run. He said Bitcoin is racing to meet level 3 of the Magic Bands at $98,720. He added that the bands are set to rapidly expand to the upside as they adjust for the volume beyond the ATHs. Based on this, the analyst said that the cycle top target is now $134,000 and that the Bitcoin price could gain $1,000 weekly. CryptoCon remarked that he anticipates the cycle top sometime in late 2025. That means there is a lot of time for the bands to expand to higher prices, indicating that the Bitcoin price could rise higher. BTC Primed To Reclaim Local Highs Crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto stated that the Bitcoin price looks primed to move to the local highs as long as the $87,700 level isn’t breached. The analyst also mentioned that a clear and impulsive move above the local highs at $93,800 would send Bitcoin above $100,000, making the possibility of dropping to $72,000 unlikely until the next bear market. Related Reading: Major Hindrances To Dogecoin Price Hitting $1 According To This Crypto Analyst However, if that clear and impulsive move doesn’t happen, CrediBull Crypto stated that it would imply that the move is corrective and makes the odds of retesting the range between $70,000 and $72,000 exponentially higher. He suggested that BTC could even drop below $70,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $91,200, up almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/last-chance-to-buy-ethereum-analyst-expects-6000-once-it-breaks-8-month-accumulation/,"Ethereum (ETH) is gearing up for an explosive bullish phase after decisively breaking above the crucial $3,000 mark. This milestone has fueled optimism among traders and investors, signaling a potential surge to new all-time highs. ETH’s recent price action demonstrates strong momentum, suggesting that the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is ready to reclaim its place in the spotlight. Renowned analyst and investor Carl Runefelt has bolstered this bullish outlook with a compelling technical analysis. Sharing his insights, Runefelt pointed out Ethereum’s impressive recovery and growing strength. He emphasized that if current momentum continues, the $6,000 milestone could be within reach sooner than many expect. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Is King – STH Selling Pressure Expected To Be Absorbed By ETFs According to Runefelt, Ethereum’s upward trajectory is supported by increasing network activity, heightened institutional interest, and broader adoption of its smart contract capabilities. The crypto market’s recent surge, led by Bitcoin’s new all-time highs, has created an environment ripe for Ethereum to follow suit. As traders focus on ETH’s potential to outperform other altcoins, all eyes are on whether it can sustain its breakout and push higher. The coming weeks will be crucial as Ethereum solidifies its position above $3,000, potentially paving the way for a rally that could redefine expectations for this cycle. Ethereum Testing Supply Ethereum is on the brink of a significant breakout as it approaches the last major supply levels before potentially embarking on a Bitcoin-like rally. After reclaiming its local highs with strong momentum, Ethereum has captured the attention of traders and investors looking for the next big move in the crypto market. Many believe the current consolidation phase is just the calm before a bullish storm. Runefelt recently shared a detailed technical analysis on X, highlighting Ethereum’s readiness for a massive bull run. Runefelt emphasized that ETH is mirroring Bitcoin’s recent explosive breakout, suggesting that Ethereum could be next to surge. According to his analysis, this may be the last opportunity to buy ETH at relatively low prices before the market takes off. Runefelt set an ambitious price target of $6,000, forecasting this level as attainable once Ethereum breaks through its final supply zones. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Above Multi-Year Resistance – Top Analyst Shares Price Target Ethereum’s potential rally is supported by a combination of technical strength and increasing demand for its smart contract platform. With Bitcoin setting new all-time highs, the market’s focus is gradually shifting toward altcoins, particularly Ethereum. If ETH breaks above its current resistance, it could ignite a wave of buying pressure that sends prices soaring to unprecedented levels. ETH Testing Technical Levels Ethereum is currently trading at $3,110, following a 12% retrace from its recent local highs. Despite the pullback, ETH continues to show resilience, holding firmly above the 200-day moving average (MA) at $2,955. This key demand level is a strong indicator of long-term market strength and suggests that Ethereum remains in bullish territory despite short-term volatility. The 200-day MA serves as a critical support zone, and its defense could pave the way for a significant rally in the coming days. If ETH maintains its position above this level for an extended period, it would signal renewed bullish momentum and set the stage for a breakout to higher supply zones.

A successful breach and consolidation above this price point would confirm a breakout, positioning ETH to challenge its all-time high (ATH).

Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor Harmon gets a three-year sentence, in addition to forfeiture of assets up to $400 million, for his role in laundering over $300 million worth of Bitcoin tokens for darknet’s drug markets. According to US authorities, Harmon used the platform to help launder the drug dealers’ funds, facilitating the transfer of over 350,000 BTCs from 2014 to 2017. He gets a three-year sentence, a relatively light serving time, but faces a forfeiture money judgment worth $311,145,854 and forfeiture of all seized assets amounting to at least $400 million. A ‘Lighter Sentence’ Over Money Laundering Case According to court documents, Harmon operated Helix from 2014 to 2017 and, during this time, laundered up to $300 million worth of Bitcoins on behalf of drug dealers. After hearing the case and with Harmon’s guilty plea, US District Judge Beryl Howell sentenced Harmon to three years of jail time. In addition to prison time, Harmon will serve a three-year supervised release, pay the court up to $311 million, and surrender all seized assets, including cryptocurrencies and real estate, amounting to at least $400 million. An Ohio man was sentenced to 3 years in prison and ordered to forfeit over $400M in assets for his operating of Helix, a darknet cryptocurrency “mixer.” @DOJCrimDiv #FollowTheMoney #IRSCIhttps://t.co/4IRC4fDbPf — IRS Criminal Investigation (@IRS_CI) November 15, 2024 Helix: Harmon’s Role In Laundering Drug Money Helix was a popular crypto-mixing service on the darknet and a favorite destination of drug dealers who wanted to launder their money. According to a Department of Justice press release, the mixing site processed 354,468 BTCs, or approximately $311,145,854, during transactions. Records show that the bulk of these funds are for darknet drug markets, and some are for customers based in the District of Columbia. Harmon collected a percentage of these transactions as fees and commissions for running the service. Harmon ensured that Helix was linked to Grams, a darknet search engine, and worked with most darknet markets as part of the laundering operations. Harmon used his proprietary API to integrate Helix into the darknet markets’ BTC withdrawal system. He also customized the API to make it more compatible with other markets. Last August 18th, 2021, Harmon submitted a guilty plea for conspiracy to commit money laundering. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K?

However, the presiding judge only imposed a three-year sentence, crediting Harmon for his help in this case. This resulted in Roman Sterlingov’s sentencing to 12.5 years last November 8th. Judge Howell acknowledged Harmon’s effort to close the platform two years before the authorities charged him. The court considered this move a sign that Harmon had reformed, even before the case was filed.

Following Donald Trump’s electoral victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week and Bitcoin’s recent surge to an all-time high of $93,250, investor sentiment surrounding Bitcoin has notably improved. Anticipated Regulatory Relief In a recent interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Wood discussed her expectations for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. She stated that ARK Invest’s targets for 2030 range between $650,000 and, in a bullish scenario, between $1 million and $1.5 million. Ark’s CEO attributed the current uptrend in Bitcoin’s value to several catalysts, particularly the anticipated regulatory relief that could come from Trump’s new administration. Related Reading: Major Hindrances To Dogecoin Price Hitting $1 According To This Crypto Analyst The now 47th President of the United States has vowed to make significant changes, particularly in the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), headed by Gary Gensler and characterized by lawsuits, Wells Notices and increased scrutiny of key industry players. This has led to notable discontent over the past three years of his tenure at the regulatory agency, prompting executives and investors in the digital asset ecosystem to call for a change for a clearer regulatory framework that could invite further adoption and growth of the market. However, Trump promised to fire Gary Gensler on the first day of his new administration, which is expected to begin on January 20. He also vowed to make America the “crypto capital of the world” with a new framework and support for digital assets, with Bitcoin at the center of his economic agenda. This has resonated well with industry advocates, as evidenced by the broader market rally led by the market’s largest digital assets, which have risen nearly 25% since Trump’s election victory. Bitcoin As A Unique Asset Class During the interview, Wood also highlighted that ARK Invest was the first public asset manager to invest in Bitcoin when it was priced at just $250 in 2015. The asset manager believes that even at approximately $90,000, Bitcoin still has significant growth potential. According to Wood, Trump’s victory is pivotal, as it signals a shift toward a more favorable regulatory environment for the cryptocurrency sector—an outcome she views as crucial for Bitcoin’s future. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Above Multi-Year Resistance – Top Analyst Shares Price Target Furthermore, Wood emphasized that Bitcoin has evolved into a distinct asset class, separate from traditional currencies. She believes that this shift indicates that institutional investors and asset allocators are increasingly looking to include Bitcoin in their portfolios, recognizing its potential as both a store of value and a hedge against inflation. At the time of writing, BTC is hovering around the $90,120 mark, still up 16% in the weekly time frame, despite the current retracement experienced over the past 48 hours.

Whale and shark wallets holding a minimum of 1 million XRP recently reached a five-year high of 45.61 billion tokens. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K? Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast The increase in accumulation suggests renewed confidence from high net-worth investors who believe there is more upside for the coin. As per Santiment, these whales collected 3.44 billion tokens over the last two years which is an uptick of 8%. The last week brought jubilant news for the XRP enthusiasts as the price rallied by over 90%. The excitement around the currency however is on the all-time high due to the prevailing communal positive energy and enthusiasm. 🐳 Wallets with at least 1M XRP now hold a combined 45.61B tokens, their highest amount held since June, 2018. In the past 2 years, whales & sharks have reversed course and accumulated 3.44B more XRP, a +8.16% increase. Traders have enjoyed a +40% return in the past 7 days. pic.twitter.com/nzYNU3CJyW — Santiment (@santimentfeed) November 14, 2024 Rising Prices, Growing Conversations The strong rally of XRP has ignited conversations online once more. Nearly 5% of crypto discussion recently has focused on XRP’s impact which indicates its increasing relevance. The token is currently priced at approximately $0.71 and has strong resistance ahead of it. Analysts believe that, given factors such as funding rates and the fear of missing out (FOMO), maintaining that momentum will be essential in the next upward price movement. However, considerable concern persists. If overextended longs arise on big exchanges such as Binance, the rising trend may slow. It’s a fine line between optimism and the requirement for market health to sustain prolonged rallies. Technical Breakout Leads To Higher Targets Technically, XRP’s recent price fluctuations indicate a positive trend. Crypto researcher Jonathan Carter said that the token has broken out of a triangle pattern that has been in place since 2021. Such breakthroughs frequently herald big price movements, and for XRP, this could point to mid-term resistance around $1.68. Historical patterns, on the other hand, add to optimism. Analysts have drawn comparisons to XRP’s performance in 2017, indicating the possibility of exponential development. While estimates range as high as $4.80 by late 2024, they are dependent on sustained growth and broader market circumstances.

The trading volume within the last 24 hours has registered an increase of 120% to hit the $17.50 billion mark. This rise coupled with a 12 percent rise in open interest in respect of XRP derivatives points out to more traders betting on the potential of the token for further upside. Despite the positive developments, caution is urged. Based on CryptoQuant data, while miner sell-offs are currently contained, they are likely to be more pronounced if the rally goes beyond the allowable limits. As of now, investors in XRP are hopeful of the future, thanks to whale accumulation, technical breakouts, and a proactive community. But whether this trend can actually continue or not will depend on the balance of market forces and investors’ expectations.

Recent statistics indicate a 115% increase in the burn rate, with more than 16.1 million SHIB tokens incinerated in a single week. This increase is noteworthy since it diminishes the circulating supply of SHIB, potentially exerting upward pressure on its price if demand remains constant or escalates. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K? Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast A Community-Led Initiative The current increase in SHIB’s burn rate is mostly propelled by community efforts to augment the token’s worth. Advocates have united to endorse multiple burn events, transferring tokens to inactive wallets and thereby eliminating them from circulation. The total amount of SHIB burned since the year started is a whopping 410 trillion tokens, proving the community’s will to reduce supply and improve scarcity. This milestone corresponds with overarching economic principles: when supply decreases and demand remains stable or increases, the likelihood of price appreciation escalates. The Shiba Inu community asserts that these initiatives would enhance SHIB’s market standing and draw new investors seeking opportunities in the cryptocurrency sector. Market Reaction And Price Fluctuations As a result, the price of SHIB rose following news of this increased burn rate. The value of the token jumped by 27% to around $0.00002753, levels that hadn’t been witnessed for months. A good sign of the state of the market mood among investors is the community’s proactively managed supply strategy. $SHIB is repeating history, and you know what that means… The parabolic phase is coming! 📈 Are you ready for some gains? 🚀 #SHIB #Crypto pic.twitter.com/C0rNQ2faL4 — SHIB Bezos (@BezosCrypto) November 14, 2024 Additionally, whales in this context have actually been driving this positive sentiment. Major SHIB holders have undertaken large burn transactions, which have then diluted the circulating supply and challenged the community. The bigger whales are going to nudge participation in the market from other, smaller investors with their increased activity in the coin. Related Reading: Solana Rising: Key Metrics Hint At Serious Ethereum Competitor Positive Outlook For Shiba Inu As Shiba Inu progresses, numerous analysts express optimism regarding its potential price fluctuations. Due to heightened burning, enhanced community involvement, and favorable market mood, SHIB may be poised for a substantial gain. Certain analysts forecast that, should prevailing trends continue, SHIB may see price escalations of up to 80% in the near future. At the same time, the Shiba Inu ecosystem will continue to mature with new upcoming projects. These developments should further strengthen user engagement and the overall value proposition of SHIB, even in a competitive marketplace. With a new high in the burn rate of Shiba Inu, this is more than just a good development for its community and investors; it means that by actively burning its supplies and encouraging participation, SHIB might strategically be well-positioned to grow as it continues navigating the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

While the top meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe were the biggest beneficiaries of the recent bullish momentum, altcoins like Polkadot also showed good signs of impending upward movement. According to data from CoinGecko, the Polkadot price has witnessed an almost 15% increase in the last 24 hours. A popular crypto pundit on the social media platform X has said that the bullish run for the DOT token is only just about to commence while predicting the next price target for the altcoin. DOT To Surge 30% In The Next Few Days — Here’s How In a November 16 post, prominent crypto expert Ali Martinez shared an exciting analysis for the Polkadot price over the next few days. According to the analyst, the current outlook of the altcoin’s price suggests that it might be ready for a significant run to the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges Past $93,000 – Can A Breakthrough Unlock New Heights? The rationale behind this bullish projection is the formation of a bull flag pattern on the four-hour timeframe of the Polkadot price chart. The bull flag is a technical analysis pattern marked by a period of steep upward movement (the flagpole) typically followed by slight sideways price action. The bull flag is usually considered a prevailing continuation pattern for an upward trend, signaling a potential move to a higher price point. However, it is important to wait for a confirmed break out of the consolidation before ascertaining that the price will continue its upward trajectory. As shown in the chart above, the price of DOT originally appeared to be in a bull pennant as it moved towards a convergence. However, the Polkadot price broke out of the consolidation period early, forging a bull flag out of what initially seemed like a pennant pattern. Nevertheless, the price of Polkadot appears to be on the rise, with Martinez putting the altcoin’s next stop at $7.50, which represents a more than 30% rally from the current price point. It is worth mentioning that this exact projection was made by expecting future prices to mirror the length of the initial flagpole. Polkadot Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Polkadot token is valued at around $5.74, reflecting an impressive 15% surge in the past day. Meanwhile, the altcoin’s performance is even more remarkable on the weekly timeframe. According to CoinGecko data, DOT is up by more than 30% in the last seven days.

The Republican sweep may increase the likelihood that President-elect Trump will be able to implement many aspects of his agenda. Private equity as an asset class is overweight intellectual property and service-based sectors relative to the economy as a whole. By Christopher Gannatti The past year has been eventful, when looking at developments around bitcoin. In figure 1, we see the price action charted back to November 8, 2023. We know: On January 11, 2024, 11 different bitcoin exchange-traded products with exposure to bitcoin’s “spot” price were approved. We see this as a primary catalyst for the move from roughly $40,000 to roughly $70,000 by April 2024. From April 2024 until November 2024, we did not see bitcoin’s price appreciate back to this $70,000 level. President-elect Trump has voiced direct support to the bitcoin community and his decisive victory contributed to another short-term spike in bitcoin’s price, even touching $90,000. Let’s review developments we’re monitoring to discern how these positive “hopes” can contribute to a fundamentally more permissive bitcoin environment in reality. Figure 1: Bitcoin’s Price Action over the Past Year Source: Bitcoin price today, BTC to USD live price, marketcap and chart | CoinMarketCap Past performance is not indicative of future results. Dynamics Leading Up to the Trump Victory Why was bitcoin’s price trend rather directionless from April 2024 to November 2024? Possible explanations include: Post-Halving Market Dynamics : The Bitcoin halving event in April 2024 reduced the mining reward from 6.25 to 3.125 Bitcoin per block, effectively decreasing the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation. Historically, such halvings have led to price surges; however, the anticipated post-halving rally did not materialize. This deviation from historical pattern may have tempered investor enthusiasm, leading to a consolidation phase rather than a continued upward trajectory. 1 Regulatory Developments : In April 2024, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation ((DTCC)) announced “No collateral value will be given for any ETF or other investment vehicle that includes Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency as an underlying investment,” effective April 30, 2024. This decision impacted financial institutions using DTCC's services, as they could no longer use these ETFs for credit or similar financial activities. The restriction may have dampened institutional participation and contributed to a decline in Bitcoin's price. 2 Profit-Taking and Market Sentiment : Following significant gains earlier in the year, investors engaged in profit-taking, leading to selling pressure that hindered further price appreciation. Additionally, waning enthusiasm post-halving and concerns over regulatory actions contributed to a bearish market sentiment, causing Bitcoin to trade below $64,500 by early May 2024. 3 Macroeconomic Factors : Anticipation of Federal Reserve interest rate decisions and a tougher rate outlook influenced investor behavior. The prospect of higher interest rates made risk assets like Bitcoin less attractive, leading to reduced investment inflows and contributing to a decline in Bitcoin's price to below $58,000 ahead of the Fed's decision in early May 2024. 4 As bitcoin is open for trading 24 hours a day, 365 days per year, there can always be myriad factors influencing its price performance, but it is always useful to consider how different catalysts could be ebbing and flowing in their influence. Other Policymakers to Watch To say that President-elect Trump will be busy is an understatement - he has discussed many promises on many topics throughout his time on the campaign trail. It makes sense to look at other pro-bitcoin policymakers whose policies may have paths to approval under a new Trump administration. A prominent advocate for Bitcoin, Senator Lummis introduced the ""Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act of 2024,"" proposing the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. The bill aims to bolster the U.S. dollar's position by incorporating Bitcoin into the nation's strategic reserves. 5 To note some of the key provisions of the proposed act 6 : 1. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ((SBR)) : Establishes a decentralized network of secure storage facilities for Bitcoin across the U.S., managed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Designed to bolster national financial security by holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset, similar to gold reserves. Emphasizes geographic dispersion for security and resilience. 2. Bitcoin Purchase Program : Authorizes the purchase of up to 200,000 Bitcoins annually over five years, targeting a total of 1 million Bitcoins. The acquired Bitcoin must be held for a minimum of 20 years, with restrictions on selling or encumbering it, except to retire federal debt. 3. Transparency Measures : Implements a Proof of Reserve system with quarterly public reports and third-party audits to ensure oversight and public trust. 4. Consolidation of Government Holdings : Mandates that any Bitcoin held by federal agencies, including those from forfeitures, be transferred to the SBR. 5. Voluntary State Participation : Allows states to participate in storing their Bitcoin holdings in segregated accounts within the SBR, maintaining state ownership rights. 6. Funding Provisions : Utilizes discretionary funds and Federal Reserve remittances for program financing. Adjustments to the valuation of gold certificates to offset costs, reflecting modern market values. 7. Property Rights Protection : Ensures that the Act does not infringe upon the property rights of private Bitcoin holders, affirming individuals' rights to own, manage and self-custody their Bitcoin holdings. No act is without controversy, so if we consider some of the possible issues in this version of the BITCOIN Act, we can see 7 : 1. Scale of Government Involvement : Critics may view the extensive federal purchase and storage of Bitcoin as market manipulation or government overreach in the private sector. The acquisition of 1 million Bitcoins could have significant impacts on market liquidity and global pricing, raising concerns over potential price distortions. 2. Public vs. Private Sector Tensions : The establishment of a federal Bitcoin reserve may lead to debates about the role of government in competing with private investors and companies in the crypto space. 3. Long-term Hold Mandate : The 20-year mandatory holding period, while aimed at ensuring long-term strategic stability, might be seen as limiting fiscal flexibility and tying up significant resources. 4. Transparency and Security : While the Act promotes transparency through public reports and third-party audits, concerns may arise over the sufficiency of these measures, especially regarding digital security and the protection of public trust.",BTC-USD|GBTC|BTG-USD|BCH-USD|BCHG|OBTC|XBTC|BITO|BTGD,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-17 12:46:00

The altcoin has been one of the best performers in the past few days while posting a double-digit gain in the last 24 hours. Crypto Analyst Says Token Is Heading To $0.65 — Here’s How In a recent post on the X platform, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez put forward an interesting projection for the price of SEI in the short term. According to the pundit, the cryptocurrency seems ready to continue its upward momentum and movement. This bullish forecast revolves around the formation of the bull flag pattern on the SEI price chart on the four-hour timeframe. The bull flag formation often serves as a strong continuation pattern for upward price trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears In Trouble: $800 Million Set For Liquidation If BTC Reclaims This Price The technical analysis formation is characterized by a period of almost vertical upward price movement (the flagpole) followed by a slight consolidation period (the flag itself). While the bull flag pattern signals the potential for price to trend higher, it is necessary to wait for a successful break out of the consolidation for confirmation. As observed in the chart above, the price of SEI appears to have broken out of the consolidation zone, with a four-hour candlestick closing above the upper boundary. According to Martinez, this recent price action puts the next stop for the token at $0.65, representing roughly a 20% rally from the current price. As of this writing, the SEI token is valued at around $0.53, reflecting an almost 16% climb in the past day. The altcoin, which was mostly quiet all week long, is now up by nearly 18% in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko data. Is SEI Following SUI? Earlier in the past week, Martinez predicted that the price of SEI was soon going to follow the path of the red-hot SUI. Perhaps due to their similar names, these two crypto tokens have an almost identical price trajectory. $SEI will follow $SUI… $1.60 next! pic.twitter.com/UA2a9hUSs1 — Ali (@ali_charts) November 11, 2024 It is worth mentioning that SUI, which is up by more than 50% in the past week, has been impressive long before positive momentum returned to the market. However, Martinez took to the X platform to share that SEI will follow SUI’s bullish footsteps — with $1.6 in its sights.

XRP has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the ongoing market upsurge as Bitcoin broke $90,000. Amid the prevalent market push, XRP recently reclaimed the $1 price mark.XRP Joins Market RallyThis rally allowed XRP to cross the $60.9 billion market cap, its highest valuation since July 2021. As the upsurge persists, discussions around a price increase to lofty targets have resurfaced. For instance, earlier this month, market analyst EGRAG suggested that XRP could hit $17, leveraging a “bent fork” formation.Another market watcher, Steph, charged investors to procure XRP tokens before the altcoin claims a new peak of $14. While targets of a $4 price or a $6 value are logically attainable, some have doubted the feasibility of higher goals such as $14 and $17. These skeptics point to the market cap that could result from such ambitious targets. For the valuations from these audacious goals to materialize, the XRP market would need to welcome a substantial amount of capital. XRP Price at a $350B Market CapThroughout its decade-old journey, XRP has not clinched the coveted $100 billion valuation mark. The altcoin’s peak market cap was $95.5 billion, attained when its price spiked to an all-time high of $3.3 in January 2018. XRP has since dropped from this mark, struggling to maintain the $30 region this year.However, we recently assessed how much XRP would need to rally to claim a $350 billion market cap, roughly the size of Ethereum’s valuation before the latest uptrend. Such a market cap would mark a new territory for XRP, possibly buoyed by a flood of new capital.Currently, XRP has a circulating supply of 56.8 billion tokens, a jump from previous figures due to the periodic escrow releases from Ripple’s accounts. At the current circulating supply, the value of 1 XRP would need to rise by 759% to $6.15 for XRP to claim a $350 billion market cap. Both the $6 price mark and the $350 billion valuation are within reach for XRP. Some factors that could catalyze a run to these levels include the forthcoming XRP ETFs and launch of Ripple Stable coin (RLUSD) on XRP ledger.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-11-17 14:22:31

Recent social media posts by FOX journalist Eleanor Terret suggest that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler may be on the verge of resigning, possibly before Trump’s inauguration in January 2025. Pro-Crypto Candidates In The Running To Succeed Gensler According to sources close to the situation, Terret says Gensler’s resignation, which would leave his term, set to expire in 2026, uncompleted, is expected to be announced after Thanksgiving. However, while Gensler has faced heavy criticism during his tenure for his strict regulatory approach to the crypto industry, the identity of his successor remains uncertain. Related Reading: How Low Can Dogecoin Go Before Rallying Again? Expert Forecast Former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Christopher Giancarlo has dismissed rumors regarding his nomination, while several other candidates are being considered. Among the names in the mix are Dan Gallagher, Chief Legal Officer at crypto exchange Robinhood; Bob Stebbins, a partner at Willkie Farr; former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins; and Paul Hastings lawyer Brad Bondi. Terret suggests that Gallagher, while initially reluctant to leave Robinhood, may reconsider as the dynamics of the administration’s appointments shift. Stebbins, who has close ties to Jay Clayton, a former SEC chairman, is rumored to be a favored candidate, though he lacks a crypto background. Still, sources suggest he would follow the Trump administration’s lead on digital assets. Atkins and Bondi are both known for their pro-crypto stance, advocating for a “lighter regulatory touch.” Atkins serves on the board of the Digital Chamber of Commerce and co-chairs its Token Alliance, focusing on token issuance growth. Bondi has been involved in advising decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, indicating a commitment to fostering innovation in the crypto space. Trump Plans Resource Allocation For CFTC Other names circulating in crypto circles include former CFTC Chair Heath Tarbert, former Acting Comptroller of the Currency Brian Brooks, and former SEC Investment Management Director Norm Champ. Champ recently expressed his willingness to serve if asked, signaling his interest in a potential role in the upcoming administration. In addition, pro-crypto SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda is reportedly open to taking the chairmanship, possibly as acting chair, while fellow Commissioner Hester Peirce, dubbed the “crypto mom” of the agency, has privately indicated her disinterest in the role. Related Reading: Binance Dominates As Bitcoin Futures Volume Hits New Peaks Amid Historic Price Rally With these leadership changes on the horizon, Terret anticipates that the new SEC chair will be pro-crypto, while also being equipped to handle the broader responsibilities of the agency, which include oversight of public companies, the stock market, the bond market, private funds, and the consolidated audit trail (CAT). Compounding the speculation is the expectation that the Trump administration may also increase the CFTC’s role in cryptocurrency regulation.

Amidst the general crypto surge, the prominent altcoin is undergoing a remarkable price rally resulting in 104.59% surge over the last seven days. As it stands, XRP appears to be shooting for the stars with analysts now strongly bullish on how high the token can go.

EGRAG Crypto noted that XRP’s market cap is closing above the Fibonacci level of 0.702 which corresponds to $51.35 billion, and has recently reached the Fibonacci level of 0.786, which represents $60.06 billion. Importantly, the coin is also breaking past an ascending trendline that stretches back to 2017, which all presents a super bullish signal that will initiate a series of significant price explosions. According to the analyst, if the XRP monthly candle closes above the Fibonacci level of 0.786, it will confirm an ascent to the Fibonacci level of 1.618 at which the crypto will attain total market shares of $283.42 billion. In regards to price action, the current supply of 57 billion XRP indicates a potential price target of $4.96 if this market cap is achieved. However, as earlier stated, XRP’s recent price rally has ignited a strong bullish signal that is to result in a cascade of price surges. Therefore, EGRAG Crypto has projected multiple Fibonacci level targets for XRP market cap, with the attainment of each one, a confirmation of the next. Following a successful climb to the Fibonacci level of 1.618, future targets by EGRAG are levels 2.0, 2.272, and 2.618, at which XRP is expected to have market cap values of $577.86 billion, $959.66 billion, and $1.83 trillion. These market shares will correspond to prices of $10.13, $16.83, and $32.11, respectively. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Signals ‘Local Bottom’ — What’s Next? XRP Market Cap Hits $65 Billion, Becomes 6th Largest Crypto According to data from CoinMarketCap, XRP’s market cap is now valued at $65.24 billion, reflecting a 26.51% gain in the past day. Notably, the altcoin has also flipped DOGE to become the sixth-largest cryptocurrency amidst the recent price gain. XRP began gaining aggressively on November 15, price increase after SEC Chair Gary Gensler hinted at a possible resignation which may spell some good news in the Commission’s ongoing case with Ripple. These gains have been further strengthened by a massive buying spree by the XRP whales who are eyeing larger future gains. At the time of writing, XRP trades at $1.10. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume has increased by 104.46% and is valued at $23.13 billion.

In April, the issuance of bitcoin was cut in half from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin per block. Compared to its last cycle high at $67,589 on November 8, 2021, the price of bitcoin as of November 13, 2024, was 1.33x higher. By David Puell, Research Associate During its halving, bitcoin’s mathematically-metered supply - or “issuance” - is cut in half. The halving has occurred roughly every four years since bitcoin’s inception during the Global Financial Crisis. Past halvings have taken place during the early stages of bitcoin bull markets. On April 19, however, bitcoin’s fourth halving led to a choppy market, until recently. Although the launch of the US spot bitcoin ETFs in January bolstered market demand early in the year, other significant events increased supply in circulation thereafter. Chief among them were the release of long-dormant coins into circulation - those seized by the German and US governments, followed by repayments to Mt. Gox creditors. 1 Our message to investors is that bitcoin’s performance is roughly in sync with the historical four-year cycles. As a result, we are optimistic about its prospects for the next six to twelve months. In this paper, we examine the cyclical dynamics that should continue to shape bitcoin’s long-term market performance. Bitcoin Halving Cycles In April, the issuance of bitcoin was cut in half from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin per block. Since then, as of November 13, its price has increased 41.2% from $64,013 to $90,446, underperforming the last two post-halving periods during which it appreciated 53.3% and 122.5%, respectively, by this time in the cycle, as shown below. 2 Source: Glassnode, as of November 13, 2024.

Bitcoin Performance From Last Cycle High and Last Cycle Low Compared to its last cycle high at $67,589 on November 8, 2021, the price of bitcoin as of November 13, 2024, was 1.33x higher. Importantly, however, during the bear market in 2022, bitcoin’s maximum drop was “only” 76.9%, less than previous cycle declines of -86.3% in 2018, -85.1% in 2015, and -93.5% in 2011, as shown below.

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. That said, since its last cycle low, the price of bitcoin has increased 5.72x, not far from the 5.18x at this point in the 2015-2018 cycle and 5.93x in the 2018-2022 cycle. If it continues to follow the average pattern of those two cycles, the price of bitcoin over this cycle could increase 15.4x to ~$243,000 during the next year (880 days after the cycle low in November 2021), as shown in the dotted circle below.

Bitcoin Calendar Year Cycles By November 13, 2024, even though the price of bitcoin has increased 2.14x, or 114.1% year-to-date, its performance has paled relative to the highest returns in three of the past annual cycles, as shown below. That said, the multiple is clearly higher than those during the three years of negative returns in 2014, 2018, and 2022. Source: Glassnode, as of November 13, 2024.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. In 2024, with the launch of the spot bitcoin ETFs in the US, bitcoin’s performance multiple went through a notable “overbought” spike in the second quarter and, with the release of supplies associated with government seizures and repayments to Mt. Gox creditors, bitcoin suffered a prolonged “oversold” period that lasted until after the US Presidential Election, as shown below. Source: Glassnode, as of November 13, 2024. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Past performance is not indicative of future results. As of November 13, 2024, bitcoin’s performance multiple reached 2.14x, outperforming the 2.06x average 3 for all sampled years, 2011 to 2023, as well as the 2.04x average of all calendar years in which halvings have occurred: 2012, 2016, and 2020. If bitcoin were to match the general historical average or the average of all halving years at December’s end, its 2024 performance multiple could hit between 2.48x and 2.94x, its price potentially reaching between ~$104,000 and ~$124,000. Bottom line, if institutions continue to gravitate toward this new asset class, and the US government seriously contemplates adding bitcoin to its strategic reserves, we anticipate a strong close to 2024 and continued momentum during 2025. Important Information Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, and the market for bitcoin is subject to rapid changes and uncertainty. Bitcoin is largely unregulated and bitcoin investments may be more susceptible to fraud and manipulation than more regulated investments. Bitcoin is subject to unique and substantial risks, including significant price volatility and lack of liquidity, and theft. Bitcoin is subject to rapid price swings, including as a result of actions and statements by influencers and the media, changes in the supply of and demand for bitcoin, and other factors. There is no assurance that bitcoin will maintain its value over the long term. ARK strongly encourages any investor considering an investment in bitcoin or any other digital asset to consult with a financial professional before investing. All statements made regarding bitcoin are strictly beliefs and points of view held by ARK and are not recommendations by ARK to buy, sell or hold bitcoin. Historical results are not indications of future results. Mt. Gox was a bitcoin exchange that once handled up to 70% of bitcoin’s total trading volume. It declared bankruptcy in 2014 after it was found to have run a fraudulent fractional reserve, incurring the loss of 850k bitcoin from users’ funds at the time. During 2024, a large portion of reclaimed bitcoin was repaid to creditors, from an estimated 141,686 bitcoin at the start of the year to 27,877 by November 13. Data estimates sourced from Glassnode.

All averages in this article are calculated as geometric means, as opposed to arithmetic means. Arithmetic means take the sum of all values in a time series and divide it by the number of data points in said time series; conversely, the geometric mean takes the product of all values and takes the nth root of the number of data points in the time series.

This marked a significant milestone for the XRP price, which has spent the majority of the last three years trading below $0.6. Related Reading: Japan Looks To Musk’s DOGE Blueprint For Digital Transformation The rally, driven by key market dynamics and specific holder activity, highlights the role of strategic accumulation by large stakeholders. Particularly, on-chain data shows an intriguing trend among whales, sharks, and retail wallets. XRP Price Breakout To $1.26: Whale And Shark Accumulation Driving Surge The XRP price climbed to $1.26 on Binance, reaching a level not seen since November 11, 2021. This three-year high comes during a broader cryptocurrency market rally, but the XRP price growth is tied to the strategic moves of its key stakeholders and an anticipated change in leadership of the US SEC. According to on-chain analytics platfrom Santiment, large XRP holders, specifically wallets holding between 1 million and 100 million tokens, have been instrumental in this breakout. Notably, this holder cohort consists of the sharks and whales categories. That is, semi-large and large XRP holders. XRP whale and shark wallets have collectively accumulated 453.3 million XRP tokens in the past week alone, pushing their total holdings to about 18% of the total supply of XRP. At the current average XRP price, this accumulation is worth around $526.3 million. The accumulation by whale and shark wallets is no coincidence. As Santiment noted, history shows that large-scale acquisitions by market participants tend to signal bullish sentiment and often precede sustained price increases. Interestingly, while whales and sharks have been accumulating XRP, retail traders have been offloading their holdings. Santiment reported that wallets with less than 1 million XRP have collectively sold 75.7 million tokens over the past week, worth approximately $87.9 million. However, most of these offloadings have been scooped up by shark and whale wallets to essentially counter any negative effects of the dumps. Image from X: Santiment What’s Next For XRP? The massive XRP price surge has seen the cryptocurrency displacing Dogecoin in market cap rankings to regain its position as the sixth-largest asset. The XRP price is up by about 11% in the past 24 hours, while the Dogecoin price has declined by about 7%. At the time of writing, XRP has retraced a bit from this three-year high of $1.26 and is currently trading at $1.06. Nevertheless, there is still a bullish sentiment surrounding XRP, especially if the sharks and whales can continue to hold above the $1 mark. This, in turn, is set to lead to a simultaneous retail FUD that will fuel more growth. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K?

According to on-chain analytics platfrom IntoTheBlock, about $1 million worth of Ether was withdrawn from crypto exchanges last week. This shift suggests that investors are adopting a holding strategy, even as the Ethereum price consolidates below $3,200. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $800K? Galaxy Digital CEO Unveils Bold 5-10 Year Forecast Notably, the last time Ethereum had outflows of this magnitude was in May 2023. The massive exodus of ETH from exchanges could indicate that traders are anticipating higher prices and moving their holdings into private wallets. Examining The Ethereum $1 Billion Outflow The notable outflow of Ethereum from crypto exchanges is highlighted by the ‘Aggregated Exchange Netflow’ data from IntoTheBlock. This metric, which follows the total number of assets entering crypto exchanges minus those leaving, is useful for determining the bullish sentiment among traders. A high outflow signals accumulation behavior since people buy on exchanges and withdraw it to their wallets. According to the metric, the netflow of aggregated exchanges in the last 24 hours comes at a negative 59,240 ETH change. This pattern is not an isolated occurrence but part of a larger trend that has unfolded throughout the week. IntoTheBlock highlighted this ongoing behavior on social media platform X, drawing attention to Ethereum’s weekly net outflow from exchanges reaching $1 billion. Interestingly, this movement is not exclusive to Ethereum. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, has also experienced a similar trend, with its weekly exchange net outflow mirroring Ethereum’s at $1 billion. This parallel behavior suggests a broader market sentiment where major cryptocurrencies are being withdrawn from exchanges and traders across the board are anticipating a bullish market ahead. Both $BTC and $ETH saw significant outflows from exchanges this week, with net outflows for both surpassing $1 billion. The last time outflows were this high was in May 2023 pic.twitter.com/tRngqN4fPM — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) November 15, 2024 What’s Next For Ethereum? Ethereum has retraced quite noticeably since it reached $3,420 on November 12. Particularly, Ethereum fell to $3,018 as Ethereum tokens flooded crypto exchanges. Despite the apparent 11% correction, the Ethereum price has managed to hold above support at $3,000. The decline seems to have given bulls another opportunity to load up more ETH. Now that the price floor seems to have been established at $3,000, we can expect the Ethereum price to kick off a new uptrend this week. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,152, reflecting a 1.5% gain over the past 24 hours, hinting at early signs of recovery. Current price action puts Etherum forming a falling wedge pattern, which can break into either side. Related Reading: Whale Alert: XRP Accumulation Reaches 5-Year Peak – Details If the pattern breaks out to the upside, Ethereum may resume its bullish trajectory and retest the $3,400 resistance level in the coming days. Conversely, a break to the downside could trigger a deeper decline, potentially driving the price toward another support zone at $2,810.

Currently trading at $235, Solana sits just 10% below its all-time high, sparking excitement among investors and analysts alike. Related Reading: Last Chance To Buy Ethereum? Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a chart highlighting Solana’s potential for further upside. According to Martinez, the price is targeting the $250 level, which represents a critical supply zone. A successful breakout above this level could pave the way for Solana to challenge its all-time high, igniting a wave of bullish sentiment across the market. The next few days are shaping up to be crucial for Solana as it tests the resilience of its upward trajectory. Bitcoin’s bullish performance is also fueling optimism across the market, further supporting Solana’s price action. The recent breakout signals growing bullish momentum as Solana continues to outperform many other altcoins in the crypto market. Solana About To Enter Price Discovery Solana is on the verge of entering price discovery after successfully confirming a breakout above the critical $225 resistance. This pivotal move has reinforced bullish sentiment, with many analysts predicting an imminent surge to new all-time highs. As Solana breaks through key supply levels, its strong price action has positioned it as one of the most promising assets in the current market cycle. Martinez shared his technical analysis on X, emphasizing the significance of this breakout. According to Martinez, Solana appears to be entering a bullish phase, and this recent surge is just the beginning of a much larger upward trend. He identified $250 as the next target for Solana, which lies just below the all-time high of $259 set in November 2021. Martinez suggests that reaching these levels could ignite a sustained rally, pushing Solana into price discovery territory. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Above Multi-Year Resistance – Top Analyst Shares Price Target The confirmation of the $225 breakout signals growing demand, driven by both institutional interest and broader market optimism. If Solana successfully tests and holds above the $250 mark in the coming days, it could trigger a domino effect, paving the way for further bullish momentum. Entering price discovery would likely attract significant buying pressure, driving Solana to uncharted territory and establishing new highs. Bullish Price Action: SOL Levels To Watch Solana is trading at $236, clearing yearly highs and setting a new local high just 10% below its all-time high (ATH). The price surged 9% today, signaling strong bullish momentum and renewed investor confidence in Solana’s upward trajectory. Bulls appear to be in full control of the price action, with demand driving significant upward pressure. To sustain this breakout and maintain its bullish momentum, SOL must hold above the $225 mark in the coming days. This level is now a crucial support zone that validates the recent breakout and sets the stage for Solana to challenge its ATH. A successful retest and hold above $225 would likely pave the way for SOL to continue its climb toward new record highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Is King – STH Selling Pressure Expected To Be Absorbed By ETFs However, if SOL fails to maintain this critical level, a period of sideways consolidation could ensue. Such a consolidation phase would not necessarily indicate weakness but rather a healthy pause, allowing the market to absorb recent gains before resuming its upward trend. In this scenario, bulls would still have the opportunity to reclaim control and propel SOL to new highs after establishing a stronger foundation. For now, all eyes are on Solana as it inches closer to price discovery and potential new ATHs.

This milestone showcases Bitcoin’s resilience as it continues to captivate investors with its upward trajectory. The market has been buzzing with optimism as Bitcoin inches closer to new highs. However, recent on-chain data suggests that a potential pullback could be on the horizon. Related Reading: Last Chance To Buy Ethereum? Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin miners have sold over 3,000 BTC in the past 48 hours. This wave of miner profit-taking often signals a cooling phase, as it introduces additional supply into the market. While the selling activity is not uncommon during periods of strong price action, it could lead to a short-term consolidation phase below the all-time high of $93,400 set earlier this week. Despite this, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $90,000 highlights strong underlying demand and robust market sentiment. Investors and analysts are closely watching the coming days to see if Bitcoin can absorb this selling pressure and maintain its bullish trajectory. Bitcoin Looks Very Strong Bitcoin’s price action has remained robust, breaking all-time highs multiple times over the past 11 days and reaffirming its bullish momentum. However, after such an aggressive upward movement, the market appears to be entering a period of consolidation as some investors and entities lock in profits. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared key data on X that highlights that Bitcoin miners have sold over 3,000 BTC in the past 48 hours, valued at approximately $273 million. This selling activity suggests that miners, typically long-term holders, are taking profits amid the recent surge. Such moves are common during strong bull runs and can indicate that market participants anticipate a short-term price plateau or retrace. While miner selling is a natural part of market dynamics, sustained activity of this kind could signal a shift in sentiment. If selling pressure persists, it might push Bitcoin toward lower demand zones, providing potential re-entry opportunities for sidelined investors.

A brief consolidation phase may be beneficial, allowing the market to establish a stronger foundation for the next leg up. For now, investors are closely watching key levels to gauge the potential for continued growth or a deeper correction. BTC Holds Steady Above $90,000 Bitcoin is currently trading at $90,600 after a volatile few days that saw its price range between its all-time high of $93,483 and a local low of $86,600. This consolidation comes after aggressive bullish momentum that set new records, leaving investors and analysts watching the next moves closely. Despite the recent cooling off, Bitcoin’s price action remains strong, supported by increasing demand and overall bullish sentiment. If Bitcoin can hold above the $86,000 level over the next few days, a renewed surge to challenge and potentially surpass its all-time high seems plausible. The market has shown resilience, with fresh demand continuing to emerge even as minor profit-taking occurs.

Should Bitcoin lose support at $86,000, it would likely test lower demand levels, searching for a strong base to fuel its next upward move. Key support zones could provide the foundation for renewed buying interest and set the stage for the next bullish phase.
