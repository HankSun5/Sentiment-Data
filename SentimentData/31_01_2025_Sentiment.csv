As analysts foresee a 50% drop in the price of Pepe, smart investors are already looking into other methods to protect their investments. Remittix, a token that is becoming more and more popular as the top token for investors in 2025, is a notable option among these choices. Why Pepe Coin May Drop By 50% In February Pepe Coin has enthralled the cryptocurrency community over the past year with its remarkable rallies and meme-inspired beginnings. However, maintaining growth becomes more difficult, as is the case with many speculative investments. It appears that February 2025 will be a crucial month for the coin. Experts are citing a number of reasons for the 50% prediction of the Pepe coin drop One of the main causes is market saturation. Pepe Coin has been very popular, but as new investors become cautious of its speculative nature, its market capitalization is currently facing opposition. Regulatory issues are also quite important. Tighter restrictions are affecting the entire cryptocurrency industry, and coins that appeal to memes are frequently subject to extra scrutiny. Declining utility makes the problem worse. Despite having a devoted following, Pepe Coin's limited application outside of speculative trading may make it less competitive. These difficulties imply that the February Pepe price prediction is in line with a gloomy trend, which will cause investors to look for more secure and encouraging opportunities. Additionally, macroeconomic factors like inflation and interest rate increases may have an effect on investor sentiment. Speculative assets like Pepe Coin are frequently among the first to undergo large sell-offs when the larger financial markets are uncertain. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum The focus shifts to Remittix, a token positioned as the top token for investors in 2025, as Pepe Coin's prospects deteriorate. Remittix is a compelling choice for individuals hedging against the projected 50% decline in Pepe coin since it provides a distinctive combination of usability, security, and growth potential. Remittix is attracting the interest of investors for the following main reasons. Remittix stands out due to its strong use case. Remittix, in contrast to many meme coins, is based on a network intended for international transfers, addressing actual financial difficulties. It is a more solid investment because of its utility, which guarantees steady demand. Another element is a capable development team. Supported by seasoned developers and financial specialists, Remittix has a transparent roadmap and other attributes that reassure investors. Support from the community is also essential. Remittix is supported by a devoted and expanding community, which guarantees active involvement in its ecosystem and promotes long-term growth. Lastly, what distinguishes it is its protective approach during market downturns. Compared to speculative assets, tokens that provide real benefits, like Remittix, typically do better. Because of this, it is a great tool for investors who want to protect themselves from erratic market swings. Remittix's attractiveness is further increased by its capacity to establish strategic alliances with blockchain networks and financial institutions. These partnerships increase its visibility and bolster its reputation as a sound cryptocurrency investment. Remittix's dedication to sustainability and environmentally friendly operations is another important element that contributes to its allure. By implementing energy-efficient blockchain technology, Remittix responds to the increasing need for crypto solutions that are ecologically conscious. These challenges suggest that the Pepe price prediction for February aligns with a bearish trend, prompting investors to seek more stable and promising opportunities. Conclusion Due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, investors must take preemptive steps. The Pepe price prediction of a 50% decline in February 2025 highlights the necessity for substitutes. With its strong functionality and investor-focused philosophy, Remittix stands out as a ray of light for anybody looking to protect their capital. Remittix is poised to revolutionize what it means to make wise investments in the realm of digital assets as the top token for investors in 2025.

With analysts predicting a 50% drop in Pepe's value, savvy investors are exploring alternative strategies to safeguard their portfolios. Remittix is emerging as a popular choice, becoming the leading token for investors in 2025, offering a promising alternative. Reasons for Pepe Coin's Potential 50% Decline in February Over the past year, Pepe Coin has captivated cryptocurrency enthusiasts with its impressive surges and meme-driven origins. However, sustaining such growth becomes challenging, much like with other speculative investments. February 2025 seems to be a pivotal period for the coin, with experts pointing to several factors that could lead to a 50% decline in the Pepe coin value. A key factor is market saturation. Pepe Coin has enjoyed widespread popularity, yet as new investors grow wary of its speculative nature, its market cap is currently encountering resistance. Regulatory challenges also play a significant role. Stricter regulations are impacting the broader crypto sector, and meme-centric coins often face heightened scrutiny. Decreasing utility adds to the issue. Despite a loyal fanbase, Pepe Coin's limited use beyond speculative trading could render it less competitive. These challenges suggest that the February Pepe price prediction aligns with a negative trend, prompting investors to seek more stable and promising alternatives. Additionally, broader economic factors such as rising inflation and interest rates might influence investor behavior. During periods of financial market uncertainty, speculative assets like Pepe Coin are often among the first to experience significant sell-offs. Why Remittix is Attracting Attention As Pepe Coin's outlook dims, the spotlight turns to Remittix, hailed as the top token for investors in 2025. With its unique blend of utility, security, and growth potential, Remittix emerges as an appealing option for those hedging against the anticipated 50% fall in Pepe Coin. Investors are drawn to Remittix for several key reasons. Remittix distinguishes itself with a robust use case. Unlike many meme-based tokens, Remittix is built on a network designed for global remittances, tackling real-world financial issues. This functionality ensures a steady demand, making it a more resilient investment. Another important factor is its strong development team. Backed by experienced developers and financial experts, Remittix offers a clear roadmap and other features that provide investors with confidence. Community support plays a crucial role as well. A dedicated and growing community supports Remittix, ensuring active participation in its ecosystem and fostering sustainable growth. Finally, its resilience during market downturns sets it apart. Tokens offering tangible benefits, such as Remittix, often outperform speculative assets. This makes it a valuable tool for investors seeking protection from volatile market changes. Its ability to form strategic partnerships with blockchain networks and financial institutions further enhances Remittix's appeal. These collaborations boost its visibility and reinforce its status as a reliable cryptocurrency investment. Remittix's commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly practices is another key factor enhancing its attractiveness. By adopting energy-efficient blockchain technology, Remittix addresses the growing demand for environmentally responsible crypto solutions. These conditions suggest that the Pepe price prediction for February corresponds with a bearish trend, driving investors to explore more stable and promising opportunities. Conclusion Given the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, it's crucial for investors to take proactive measures. The Pepe price prediction of a potential 50% drop in February 2025 underscores the need for alternatives. With its practical functionality and investor-centric approach, Remittix emerges as a beacon of hope for those aiming to safeguard their investments. As the leading token for investors in 2025, Remittix is set to redefine smart investment in the digital asset space.

Interestingly, this renewed momentum has seen Dogecoin open interest flipping from a negative threshold into a positive one. As the meme coin’s price gains traction, traders are once again pouring into derivatives markets, pushing the total open interest above $4 billion. Dogecoin Open Interest Surges With Market Revival According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin’s total open interest has climbed back above the $4 billion mark, indicating a resurgence in trading activity. This comes after the Dogecoin price rebounded on the $0.31 multi-year support again and started its move upwards again. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Explodes Ahead Of Donald Trump Inauguration, Traders Bet On $1 Interestingly, data from Coinglass show that the Dogecoin open interest has increased by 3.11% and 2.09% in the past 24 hours and 4 hours, respectively. This shift suggests that traders are once again looking at Dogecoin as a promising asset for leveraged plays, betting on further price movements. The most notable DOGE open interest is on the Gate.io exchange, which has seen an increase of 5.14% in the past 24 hours. This brings its total open interest to $1.64 billion, accounting for 41% of the total rate. Bitget and BingX have also witnessed notable uptrends, with the Dogecoin open interest growing by 6.41% and 6.67%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. Binance, on the other hand, is yet to flip into positive open interest change. The world’s largest crypto exchange is still on a -0.13% open interest rate in the past 24 hours but is also on the verge of a positive rate with a +1.41% increase in the last four hours. Increased Leverage Could Lead To More Price Volatility A rise in open interest means that more traders are opening leveraged positions, which could amplify price swings in either direction. Interestingly, Dogecoin often experiences strong price movements during periods of increase in open interest. This latest increase alone means that there is an increase in market participation in Dogecoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Weekly RSI Approaches The MA Line, Can Price Resume Uptrend To Break $0.74 ATH? If bullish sentiment continues, this market participation may drive the Dogecoin price further upward within the $0.30 to $0.4 range in the short term. However, it also raises the possibility of more liquidations if Dogecoin were to retest support at $0.31 again. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3316, marking a 7% gain since bouncing off its multi-week support at $0.31. The next step for the meme coin is breaking above a recently developed daily candlestick resistance at $0.3316, which could then pave the way for further upside momentum if sustained buying pressure continues.

Despite a 44% year-over-year drop in hacking incidents, the hacks grew ninefold month-over-month, according to the latest report from web3 bug bounty and security services platform Immunefi. Although the situation looks dire, the figure is a huge fall compared to January last year, when hackers stole $133 million. The crypto losses in January came from two major attacks. The most affected platform was a Singapore-based CeFi Phemex exchange, which hackers targeted and escaped with $69.1 million. The second incident was an exploit of the DeFi platform Moby Trade, which lost $2.5 million. Other low-magnitude attacks were Orange Finance, IPC, UniLend Finance, The Idols NFT, Odos, Laura AI, Pika Infinity, and Sorra. There were no fraud-related cases in January. Hackers exploited the Binance chain more than any other network The month of January saw the Binance chain suffering the most. Of all the attacks, Binance accounts for 50% of the losses on the blockchain, with the platform exploited ten times. Ethereum was also vulnerable, accounting for 25% of the total attacks. Arbitrum and Base suffered two attacks each, followed by Optimism with a single attack. On the other hand, centralized finance platforms were the most exploited, losing over $69 million, 93% of the total value lost in January. Decentralized finance appeared more secure, accounting for only 6.5%, with $4.8 million lost over 18 incidents. While releasing the report, Mitchell Amador, founder and CEO of Immunefi, warned that CeFi platforms will be the most targeted platform by crypto bandits. He said. “The largest volume of losses will likely come from CeFi, as hackers target infrastructure, particularly through private key compromises. CeFi doesn’t generally suffer the most successful attacks, but when a breach occurs, it typically leads to catastrophic losses.” Amador pointed out that the worst thing that can happen is for a hacker to get your private keys and then drain your account which is a major flaw of the CEFI. Whereas DeFi bugs are more common, the impact is small because not all the money is lost. CeFi platforms are enhancing security to prevent exploitations CeFi platforms are also vulnerable to phishing attacks and, therefore, require a multi-layer security approach. CeFi must factor in protective security protocols. It should also include security features that enhance key management, ensuring reduced reliance on a single private key. Furthermore, the platform must improve OpSec’s best practices, such as regular employee security training. Amador also advised that the platforms should have bug bounty programs and real-time threat detection tools. These could be crucial in enhancing the security of these protocols and chains. The Immunefi director advises the platforms to adopt these measures because they are already using them. The firm currently issues over $181 million worth of bug bounties for ethical hackers and manages over $190 billion worth of crypto user funds. The firm has involved ethical hackers and researchers, paying them research bounties worth $112 million. The payouts began three years ago and are still critical. So far, the ethical hackers have come out with 3,000 bug bounty reports. The largest was a $10 million award for a vulnerability discovered in Wormhole’s cross-chain protocol. Immunefi claims to operate the largest blockchain security community with more than 45,000 researchers, saving over $25 billion in user funds across protocols like Polygon, Optimism, Chainlink, The Graph, Synthetix, and MakerDAO (Sky) from being stolen.

After a recent 4.94% drop in market value, many players believe Ethereum could dip below $2,000 this year.

Remittix's public presale has already generated significant attention, offering early investors a chance to get involved with this promising project before it hits centralized exchanges.

Following a recent 4.94% decline in market value, there is speculation amongst investors that Ethereum might fall below $2,000 this year. This situation arises as major holders may be offloading assets and turning their attention to new blockchain initiatives like Remittix (RTX), which are beginning to gain prominence. The public presale of Remittix has already caught significant interest, presenting early investors with a chance to join this exciting venture before it is available on centralized exchanges.

The Future of Ethereum Amid Rising Competition In the past week, Ethereum’s market value has fallen by 6%. Large investors could be cashing out, potentially triggering more sell-offs and causing further price declines. Although Ethereum holds a leading position in the DeFi and NFT markets, its dominance is being challenged by newer projects that offer faster and cheaper solutions for converting crypto to fiat currency. Short-term investors should be cautious of more potential decreases in Ethereum's value. On-chain data might reveal that more assets are leaving the Ethereum network, leading investors to question the long-term supremacy of Ethereum in the DeFi space.

This payment platform enables users to effortlessly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat money, which can then be transferred to bank accounts worldwide.

However, recent data from aggregators reveals an 18% drop in daily trading volumes for both coins, as large holders sell off their stakes and overall market enthusiasm declines. Analysts suggest this downturn for DogWifHat & BONK indicates that meme tokens that rely solely on internet humor struggle to maintain long-term interest. Many retail investors are facing significant losses, leading to a surge of complaints on community platforms. Some analysts attribute the decline to an oversaturated market, as new meme tokens emerge more rapidly than the influx of new investors. With these once-popular dog-themed coins losing their appeal, traders are beginning to look beyond humorous branding. The key question now is what kind of coin can thrive beyond the hype while addressing real-world challenges. The Rise of Real World Solutions in Crypto Tired of the unpredictability of purely speculative tokens, investors are increasingly drawn to real world solutions that may endure beyond fleeting hype. Instead of focusing on dog memes or influencer endorsements, they're searching for altcoins that connect crypto with real applications in areas like cross-border payments or corporate use. This trend isn't entirely new: Ethereum made waves by introducing smart contracts, but many tokens that followed offered little practical use beyond quick trading opportunities. Meme coins rose to fame due to their novelty but often lacked genuine partnerships or sustained demand. The decline of DogWifHat and BONK underscores how quickly that excitement can dissipate. As holders face losses, there is a growing desire for tokens supported by real functionality. Coins that solve everyday issues have the potential for steady growth, unlike those that rely on viral social media posts. Some experts suggest the shift to practical altcoins could pave the way for the next bull market, where tokens targeting substantial markets overshadow comedic counterparts. Remittix: A Rising Player in PayFi Following the decline of DogWifHat & BONK, many are turning to Remittix synergy as a more reliable option. Instead of relying on humorous marketing, Remittix targets the $190 trillion global banking industry, focusing on reducing cross-border fees and accelerating transactions. The $9.5 million raised in presale funds reflects strong confidence in merging crypto with everyday financial needs. The team plans to lock liquidity for three years and renounce the contract post-presale, addressing concerns about developer sell-offs. Critics point out that any new coin must still achieve user adoption and partnerships. However, advocates argue that reducing remittance costs is appealing to freelancers, families sending money back home, and small businesses. If successful, analysts speculate about possible 50x or even 100x returns once listed on major exchanges. Interested? Check Remittix while presale tokens are available. As meme coins falter, real-world solutions may be the key to recouping losses and potentially achieving life-changing gains. Moving from Meme Hype to Real Adoption This narrative is resonating through trading circles. The DogWifHat & BONK downturn highlights how fragile these meme assets are when enthusiasm dwindles. Meanwhile, tokens that emphasize real world solutions, such as Remittix, are becoming more attractive to investors seeking stability with the potential for significant returns. Of course, no project is without risk, especially one that is freshly out of presale. However, many who have suffered from meme coin collapses view Remittix synergy as a strategic hedge, believing that the PayFi model could better endure market downturns compared to light-hearted marketing strategies. If the idea of integrating daily finances with crypto interests you, check out Remittix to purchase presale tokens before the final stages conclude.

Recent aggregator data, however, shows daily volumes for both coins plummeting by 18%, as whales offload positions and market sentiment sours. Analysts say this DogWifHat & BONK slump signals that meme tokens relying solely on internet jokes can’t sustain interest in the long run. Retail holders appear left with steep losses, prompting a wave of complaints on community forums. Some watchers link the downturn to oversaturation, with meme tokens popping up faster than new investors can support them. As these favorite dog-themed assets fade, many traders look beyond comedic branding. The question is what sort of coin can outperform hype while also tackling serious issues. Why Real World Solutions Are Taking Center Stage Frustrated by the volatility of purely speculative tokens, investors now favor real world solutions that might outlast sudden hype cycles. Instead of dog memes and influencer pushes, they seek altcoins bridging crypto with tangible use cases like cross-border finance or enterprise adoption. This shift isn’t new: Ethereum broke ground by enabling smart contracts, but many subsequent tokens offered minimal utility beyond quick flips. Meme coins soared on novelty but often lacked real partnerships or stable demand. The meme coin crash for DogWifHat and BONK highlights how quickly that excitement can vanish. Faced with losses, holders crave tokens underpinned by genuine functionality. A coin that solves an everyday problem may see consistent growth, unlike memes that rely on viral tweets. Some watchers say the pivot to practical altcoins could define the next bull run, where tokens targeting large markets overshadow comedic clones. Remittix Synergy: A Growing PayFi Contender In the wake of DogWifHat & BONK slump, many turn to Remittix synergy for a more dependable approach. Rather than comedic marketing, Remittix focuses on a $190 trillion global banking sector, aiming to lower cross-border fees and speed transactions. Over $9.5 million in presale funds underscores strong faith in bridging crypto and everyday finance. The team locks liquidity for three years, then renounces the contract post-presale moves that calm fears of developer dumps. Critics note any new coin must still secure user adoption and partnerships. But supporters say cutting remittance costs appeals to freelancers, families sending money home and small businesses. If that vision clicks, analysts whisper about 50x or even 100x potential once it hits major listings. Curious? Check Remittix while presale tokens remain. As meme coins falter, real world solutions may be the ticket to recovering losses and possibly netting life-changing gains. Shifting from Meme Hype to Real Adoption That’s the storyline echoing across trading communities. The DogWifHat & BONK slumpunderlines how fragile these meme assets can be when enthusiasm wanes. Meanwhile, tokens emphasizing real world solutions like Remittix seem more appealing for investors seeking stability and big upside. Of course, no project is bulletproof, especially one fresh from presale. But many burned by meme collapses see Remittix synergy as a strategic hedge, believing the PayFi model could withstand bear cycles better than comedic marketing.

While some projects fade into obscurity, others continue to disrupt industries and create new wealth opportunities. Whether it’s a bullish run or a temporary dip, the right crypto investments can offer massive returns within a short time frame. Qubetics , Litecoin (LTC), and Celestia (TIA) are three standout contenders in today’s volatile market. Qubetics is redefining asset tokenization with its record-breaking presale, Litecoin remains a gold standard for fast and secure payments, and Celestia is leading the charge in blockchain modularity. These projects aren’t just trends—they’re shaping the next era of blockchain utility and investment potential. Qubetics – The Web3 Aggregator Leading Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is making waves in the crypto space by offering quantum-resistant blockchain security, designed to withstand the future challenges posed by quantum computing. With its cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, Qubetics ensures that digital assets and transactions remain secure for the long term. Qubetics is capturing the attention of crypto investors at lightning speed. This next-gen Web3 aggregator has already raised over $11.4 million in its Qubetics presale , with more than 452 million $TICS tokens sold to over 17,400 holders. Currently in its 19th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0606 per token, and analysts are already predicting jaw-dropping price jumps post-presale. With projections ranging from $0.25 to as high as $15, the potential for life-changing returns is on the table. One of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics is its role in the real-world asset tokenization marketplace. Imagine a real estate investor looking to tokenize a high-value property to offer fractional ownership opportunities to global investors. Qubetics’ blockchain-powered system simplifies the process, making asset ownership accessible, transparent, and liquid. Businesses can tokenize intellectual property, luxury goods, and even rare collectibles. This groundbreaking approach is set to redefine asset ownership, allowing anyone to invest in high-value assets with ease. Litecoin – The OG of Fast and Reliable Transactions Litecoin (LTC) has long been regarded as one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies in the market. Often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin was created to provide faster transaction speeds and lower fees, making it an ideal choice for everyday payments. With its strong security, high liquidity, and an ever-growing adoption rate, Litecoin continues to be a solid alternative investment instrument. The crypto community respects Litecoin for its resilience and continuous upgrades. The network’s recent developments, including the MimbleWimble upgrade, have improved privacy features, making LTC even more appealing for transactions. Whether it’s merchants, retailers, or peer-to-peer payments, Litecoin has positioned itself as one of the most practical cryptocurrencies for real-world use. Currently priced at $127.81 and gaining 11.55% in value recently, Litecoin remains a key asset for short-term traders looking for quick gains and long-term holders banking on its steady growth. It may not have the flashiest branding, but its reliability keeps it in the ranks of top cryptos to hold for short term. Celestia – The Modular Blockchain Disruptor Celestia (TIA) is making serious waves in the crypto world by introducing modular blockchain technology. Instead of being a monolithic network like Ethereum or Solana, Celestia separates execution, consensus, and data availability, creating a more scalable and flexible infrastructure. This unique approach has positioned Celestia as a game-changer in the blockchain space, drawing interest from developers and investors alike. Why does Celestia matter? Scalability has been one of the biggest challenges in blockchain, leading to slow transactions and high fees. By adopting a modular architecture, Celestia allows developers to build highly scalable and customizable blockchains without sacrificing security. This is a huge step forward for decentralized applications, Web3 gaming, and even DeFi protocols looking for more efficient solutions. With Celestia currently priced at $4.06, investors are eyeing its potential to surge as adoption grows. If blockchain modularity takes off the way experts expect, Celestia could be one of the biggest winners in the next few years, making it a strong contender among top cryptos to hold for short term. Final Verdict – Where’s the Smart Money Going? Crypto investing is about catching the right wave at the right time. Qubetics , Litecoin, and Celestia all offer massive potential, but for those looking for top cryptos to hold for short term, Qubetics presents a golden opportunity. With its innovative asset tokenization marketplace, explosive presale growth, and bullish analyst predictions, $TICS could be one of the best-performing tokens of the year.

Immunefi, a Web3 security platform, reported that January saw $73.9 million in losses from 19 attacks. This is a staggering increase of nine times from the previous month. However, in a silver lining, this figure represents a 44.6% drop compared to January 2024, when losses exceeded $133 million. Two Major Crypto Hack Incidents Dominate the Landscape In January, the crypto industry was hit by hacking incidents, with $73.9 million siphoned off by cybercriminals. The most significant blow came from two major attacks. This includes the hack of Phemex, a Singapore-based exchange that lost $69.1 million. The breach of the decentralized finance (DeFi) options platform Moby Trade also resulted in a $2.5 million loss. These two incidents were the primary culprits behind the monthly loss total. Other affected platforms included Orange Finance, IPC, The Idols NFT, UniLend Finance, Odos, Laura Ai, Pika Infinity, and Sorra. These hacks contributed to the remaining DeFi losses; all suffered varying degrees of loss. Interestingly, no fraud cases were reported this month. These attacks show that both centralized and decentralized platforms are constantly at risk . Hackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities across different networks. Targeted Networks: BNB Chain and Ethereum Lead the Way BNB Chain was the most targeted, accounting for 50% of the total on-chain losses. Ethereum followed closely, with 25% of the total losses tied to exploits on its network. Other networks, such as Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, also faced breaches, but these were fewer in number, with just a couple of attacks on each. Immunefi’s Role in Crypto Security While the hacking incidents were alarming, Immunefi, a platform known for its web3 bug bounty and security services, plays a key role in combating these threats. The company has paid over $100 million in bounties to ethical hackers , helping to identify and fix vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Immunefi boasts the largest blockchain security community, with more than 45,000 researchers. Over the past three years, its efforts have saved over $25 billion from potential theft, covering protocols like Polygon, Synthetix, and MakerDAO.

The upgrade, which achieved 91.43% consensus from validators, ensures token issuers have control over assets deposited in liquidity pools under specific conditions. XRP Ledger Activates AMMClawback, Enhancing AMM Pool Compliance In a recent post on the X platform , XRPScan confirmed that the XRP Ledger has successfully implemented the AMMClawback amendment. This update introduces new rules governing liquidity pools, particularly for tokens with regulatory requirements. The amendment enables token issuers to retrieve assets from AMM pools under predefined circumstances. If a token is frozen, users will no longer be able to deposit new assets into the associated liquidity pool. This restriction prevents unauthorized transactions involving frozen tokens. More so, this development comes just days after Ondo Finance confirmed its push for expanding tokenized assets. The OUSG deployment on XRPL will enhance institutional liquidity and regulatory compliance. ONDO and XRP prices surged following the news, reflecting strong market confidence XRP/RLUSD AMM Pool Now Possible With the AMMClawback amendment now active, the creation of an XRP/RLUSD AMM pool is now possible. This development will improve liquidity for both XRP and Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin launched in December 2024. Previously, RLUSD could not participate in AMM pools due to its built-in clawback feature. This limitation has now been removed, allowing RLUSD holders to contribute liquidity and trade seamlessly within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. This upgrade could enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the network. Since Ripple’s stablecoin launch, major exchanges have steadily increased its adoption. RLUSD’s reserve report confirms strong backing, boosting investor confidence. Consequently, its most recent listing on Margex expanded its reach in high-leverage trading. New AMM Pool Rules for Wallets and Token Issuers The amendment introduces stricter deposit rules for liquidity providers. If one of the paired tokens is frozen, wallets cannot deposit single-sided or double-sided assets into an AMM pool. Additionally, unauthorized accounts can deposit only once if the paired asset is allowed. Token issuers must now use the AMMClawback function to retrieve assets from pools instead of the standard clawback transaction. This provides a structured approach to enforcing compliance without disrupting normal trading activity on the XRP Ledger. The amendment received 28 out of 35 votes from validators, surpassing the 80% threshold required for approval. Additionally, the XRP Ledger community expects this change to improve regulatory alignment while expanding opportunities for decentralized liquidity.

With Ethereum updates suggesting that this rising star is poised to outshine other meme and traditional coins by 2025, let's delve deeper into what makes this coin so intriguing.

From personalized health guidance to the extraction of value from health data, the global health management sector is in dire need of a profound innovation and upgrade. Today, we are excited to announce the official launch of the iPulse Protocol, marking the beginning of a new era! The iPulse Protocol not only integrates cutting-edge technologies like AI-powered predictions, DeSci collaboration, and DePIN, but also offers unprecedented ecosystem collaboration opportunities for global research institutions, healthcare providers, device manufacturers, and users.Through the iPulse Protocol, health data will no longer remain isolated or closed. Instead, it will be transformed into intelligent, decentralized, and tradable digital assets. This means that users will not only benefit from precise health predictions and personalized guidance powered by AI and big data analysis, but also ensure the privacy and security of their data through blockchain technology, ultimately enabling data to be tokenized. At the same time, research institutions, healthcare providers, and device manufacturers will find new opportunities for collaboration within the iPulse ecosystem, jointly driving the global health management and technological innovation process. Core Features of the iPulse Protocol: Precise Health Prediction and Personalized GuidanceThe fundamental goal of the iPulse Protocol is to comprehensively and accurately analyze user health data through AI technology and provide each user with personalized health advice. By collecting data from wearable devices, medical equipment, and mobile apps, the iPulse Protocol can continuously monitor the user's health status and predict potential health risks using adaptive AI models and advanced technologies like time-series analysis.For instance, by analyzing users' heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep quality, and other physiological data in real time, combined with their historical health status, the iPulse Protocol can predict potential health problems such as cardiovascular risks and diabetes progression. It then provides targeted lifestyle and dietary recommendations to help users take preventive measures. This approach not only helps users better manage their personal health but also supports the long-term maintenance of a healthy state.Data Tokenization: Transforming Health Data into Tradable Digital AssetsIn traditional health management systems, users' health data typically belongs to medical institutions or enterprises and is not owned by the individual. In contrast, with the iPulse Protocol, users' health data can be anonymized through encryption technology to ensure privacy, while blockchain technology enables the tokenization of data. This allows users to have both usage and revenue rights over their data. For example, users can authorize research institutions, insurance companies, healthcare providers, and other third parties to access their data in exchange for compensation.The iPulse Protocol offers users a new source of income, allowing them to participate in data transactions through smart contracts, all while ensuring privacy and data security. This mechanism will further stimulate global health tech innovation, promoting the efficient circulation and sharing of health data.DeSci Collaboration: A Global Research and Medical Data Sharing PlatformIn traditional health management and medical fields, data is typically closed and regional, making it difficult to achieve effective cross-border and cross-institution collaboration. The iPulse Protocol breaks this limitation by leveraging decentralized data storage and privacy computing technologies, creating a global data-sharing platform that supports cross-border cooperation among research institutions and medical teams.This data-sharing platform not only ensures the security and privacy of the data but also provides strong support for global scientific collaboration in the health field. For example, research institutions can use anonymized data to support drug development, disease treatment innovations, and more, advancing global health science. Moreover, governments and health organizations can analyze disease transmission trends via the platform to promptly respond to emerging health crises.Applications of the iPulse Protocol: Bridging Personal and Global Health Management Applications of the iPulse Protocol Applications of the iPulse Protocol The iPulse Protocol not only provides precise health management services for individual users but also has wide-ranging applications in various fields: Personal Health Management: By continuously monitoring biological and exercise data, the iPulse Protocol provides users with personalized health reports, dietary advice, and exercise plans, even predicting potential disease risks to help users adopt healthier lifestyles. Healthcare and Insurance Support: Medical institutions and insurance companies can utilize the iPulse Protocol to obtain precise health data analysis, optimize treatment plans, and more accurately assess health risks, enabling them to design tailored insurance products. Global Public Health Monitoring: The iPulse Protocol offers a powerful data support platform for global public health monitoring, helping governments and health organizations analyze disease trends, develop prevention strategies, and respond to global health crises. Global Research and Innovation: By creating a global biological database, the iPulse Protocol accelerates cross-border health data sharing. Research institutions can access anonymized health data through iPulse to support disease research, drug development, and treatment innovations. Support for Smart Device Manufacturers: Device manufacturers can integrate the iPulse Protocol to help users achieve more accurate health management, while using the health data provided by the protocol to optimize product designs, thereby enhancing market competitiveness.Looking to the Future: iPulse Protocol Brings a New Revolution to Health ManagementWith the official launch of the iPulse Protocol, we can anticipate unprecedented opportunities for global health management and scientific innovation. Through decentralized technologies, AI-powered predictions, and data tokenization, the iPulse Protocol offers a win-win ecosystem collaboration platform for users, research institutions, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and device manufacturers. Whether it's individual health management or global health data sharing and scientific collaboration, iPulse is driving the digital transformation of the health management industry and injecting new vitality into global public health.In the future, as the iPulse ecosystem continues to evolve, global health management will become more personalized, intelligent, and decentralized. The launch of the iPulse Protocol not only brings users a new health management experience but also provides continuous momentum for the development of global medical, research, and health industries.

However, there’s even more interesting news and that is about the rise of Panshibi (SHIBI), a new crypto project making waves with its engaging presale. Can this emerging meme coin project live up to the expectations? Find the details below! Solana Price Prediction: Can an ETF Take SOL To $500? Solana (SOL) has been a powerhouse in the crypto market, delivering unparalleled transaction speeds and efficiency. Currently, SOL is priced around $231.64 , having declined by 13.10% over the past week. However, its recent bull run to $294.33, which marks a 17.56% increase over the last 30 days, speaks volumes about its potential to hit $300 or higher in the next month. Technical analysis shows the Solana price prediction chart carving higher highs, indicating a significant bull run. The circulating supply of 593.01M SOL tokens against a market cap of $112.76B solidifies its position among top-tier altcoins. While most analysts have not been able to give a target price of Solana or affirm that it will reach $500, the three-month performance of Solana has shown promising figures. Moreover, with the impending launch of a Solana ETF, experts and investors believe such significant gains for Solana can be attainable. Panshibi: More Than Just a Meme Coin While Solana continues to attract attention in the crypto markets, Panshibi stands ready to deliver exciting returns and a vibrant ecosystem that could redefine what it means to invest in a meme coin. The Panshibi project is compelling for many reasons, one of which is the total allocation of its tokens, designed to promote fairness and long-term growth. This strategic approach not only promotes community engagement but also positions Panshibi as a noteworthy contender in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Buying SHIBI tokens isn’t just about making money; it’s about becoming part of a vibrant community. When you purchase these tokens, you join a shared adventure, inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas that symbolize this project. It’s a journey into new possibilities, where everyone can contribute and benefit from each other’s growth. One of the reassuring aspects of Panshibi is that its smart contract has been thoroughly checked for safety. This means investors can feel secure knowing that the project has been vetted and is less likely to have hidden issues. With these safety measures in place, Panshibiis shaping up to be an appealing choice for anyone looking to enter the crypto market. Panshibi's Promises Over 700% Gains for Early Buyers Currently, Panshibi is running a presale that lasts for 60 days, providing a fantastic opportunity for early investors. The presale operates with dynamic pricing which causes $SHIBI prices to climb when buyers acquire more tokens. At the time of writing, Panshibi has successfully sold out Stage 1 of its presale in record time, and is now in Stage 2 priced at $0.003. The price of SHIBI is expected to rise to $0.004 in its next stage. Ultimately, once the 15 stages of its presale is sold out, early investors will have pocketed an eye watering 1,200 ROI! Looking ahead, the Panshibi team has exciting plans for after the presale. In Phase 3, they will introduce new features like staking and exclusive NFTs, giving more value to token holders. Phase 4 will focus on expanding globally and engaging the community, making sure that Panshibi continues to evolve and innovate as it grows. Conclusion Although Solana is a strong player in the crypto world, Panshibi might be the better choice for investors looking for significant returns. Panshibi presents enticing attributes such as decentralized governance, transparent operations, and a potential for rapid expansion, positioning it as a formidable contender.

Solana (SOL) is a significant player in the crypto scene, known for its unmatched transaction speed and efficiency. At present, SOL trades at approximately $231.64 , reflecting a 13.10% drop over the past week. Nevertheless, its recent surge to $294.33, which is a 17.56% uptick over the past 30 days, highlights its potential to reach $300 or more soon. The technical analysis indicates the Solana price forecast chart is showing higher highs, suggesting a strong upward trend. With a circulating supply of 593.01M SOL tokens and a market cap of $112.76B, it firmly holds its place among the leading altcoins. While most experts have not set a definitive target price for Solana or confirmed it will hit $500, its performance over the last three months has been promising. Additionally, the anticipated launch of a Solana ETF has investors and analysts optimistic about the possibility of such gains for Solana. Panshibi: Beyond Just a Meme Coin While Solana continues to capture interest in the crypto markets, Panshibi is poised to offer thrilling returns and a lively ecosystem that might redefine meme coin investments. Several factors make the Panshibi project attractive, particularly its token distribution strategy aimed at ensuring fairness and sustainable growth. This approach not only fosters community involvement but also positions Panshibi as a serious player in the constantly changing crypto world. Acquiring SHIBI tokens isn't merely about profit; it's about joining an enthusiastic community. By purchasing these tokens, you become part of a shared journey, inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas that represent this initiative. It's a leap into new opportunities, where everyone can contribute and benefit from collective growth. A reassuring element of Panshibi is that its smart contract has undergone thorough security checks. This provides investors with peace of mind, knowing the project has been thoroughly vetted and is less prone to hidden vulnerabilities. With these security measures, Panshibi is emerging as an attractive option for those looking to enter the crypto market. Panshibi's Promises of Over 700% Returns for Early Investors At present, Panshibi is conducting a 60-day presale, presenting an excellent opportunity for early investors. The presale features dynamic pricing, meaning that $SHIBI prices increase as more tokens are purchased. As of now, Panshibi has already sold out Stage 1 of its presale in record time, and is now in Stage 2 with a price of $0.003. The price of SHIBI is anticipated to rise to $0.004 in the upcoming stage. Ultimately, once all 15 presale stages are completed, early investors could enjoy a staggering 1,200 ROI! Looking towards the future, the Panshibi team has exciting plans following the presale. In Phase 3, they plan to introduce new features such as staking and exclusive NFTs, adding more value for token holders. Phase 4 will focus on global expansion and community engagement, ensuring that Panshibi continues to grow and innovate. Conclusion While Solana remains a formidable force in the crypto realm, Panshibi could be a more attractive option for investors seeking substantial returns. Panshibi offers appealing features like decentralized governance, transparency, and rapid growth potential, establishing it as a strong contender. With its current price of $0.003 per SHIBI token, Panshibi is well-positioned for a successful market entry.

For those who are just catching on, the presale has already raised over $675,000, with an impressive 18,546% ROI from Stage 7 to the final listing price of $0.008. Each week, as Pablo “travels,” tokens are burned, reducing the total supply and adding an extra layer of scarcity. The more coins are burned, the higher the value of the remaining ones. This deflationary mechanism gives Arctic Pablo the potential to soar as it continues to captivate investors. 66% APY Staking: But it doesn’t stop there. Arctic Pablo also offers an enticing staking program with a massive 66% APY. That means you can stake your coins, watch your rewards accumulate, and be part of a growing adventure. The more you stake, the more you earn. But remember, your staked tokens will be vested for two months from the launch date—patience will pay off! Final Presale Price and Burn Mechanism: The presale is gradually building towards its final price of $0.0008 per token. Unsold tokens are burned each week, which keeps the environment deflationary and further drives up the potential for profits. As we get closer to the launch, every moment is an opportunity to grab a piece of the action before it explodes.

In 2028, SHIB can reach a maximum value of $0.000114. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach a minimum value of $0.000185 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem with significant growth and utility. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about its future price trajectory. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and solidify its position in the crypto market? Will SHIB ever reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Shiba Inu Token SHIB Price $0.00002154 Market Cap $11,010,939,337.5 Trading Volume $280,254,145.75 Circulating Supply 589,254,022,224,998.1 SHIB All-time High $0.00008845 (Oct 27, 2021) All-time Low $0.00000000008165 (Aug 31, 2020) 24-hour high $0.00001820 24-hour low $0.00001896 Shiba Inu coin price prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.31% 50-Day SMA $0.00002263 14-Day RSI 36.91 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.00001914 Shiba Inu price analysis: SHIB remains largely bearish as buyer interest grows TL;DR Breakdown SHIB is currently trading below its 50-day SMA. SHIB’s key support level is at $0.00001728. If SHIB breaks above $0.00001933, it may target higher resistance levels. Shiba Inu 1-day price chart: Minor bullish attempts exist amid a broader bearish trend The 1-day chart for Shiba Inu on January 30 shows the coin trading below the 20-day SMA at $0.00002066, reflecting a bearish trend. The MACD suggests ongoing bearish momentum, confirming that the slight bullish turn is not solid enough. Minor bullish attempts exist amid a broader Shiba Inu bearish trend The RSI at 41 indicates the asset is near the oversold region, hinting at potential consolidation or a mild recovery if buyers return at the bottom. A break above $0.00001933 could signal further upside, while a rejection risks revisiting lower support levels near $0.00001728. Shiba Inu 4-hour price chart: SHIB see short-term price uptick The 4-hour SHIB/USDT chart shows a slight uptick in price. The Bollinger Bands are still narrow, indicating reduced volatility and the possibility of range-bound price movement. The Balance of Power (BOP) at -0.50 signals growing bearish dominance unless a reversal occurs. Also, the CMF is slightly positive, suggesting some buying pressure despite a bearish takeover. Increased buyer interest and accumulation could see SHIB retest the upper Bollinger band at $0.00001925. Otherwise, SHIB could retest support at $0.00001728. Shiba Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00001981 SELL SMA 5 $0.00001940 SELL SMA 10 $0.00002039 SELL SMA 21 $0.00002106 SELL SMA 50 $0.00002263 SELL SMA 100 $0.00002300 SELL SMA 200 $0.00001948 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.00002067 SELL EMA 5 $0.00002106 SELL EMA 10 $0.00002160 SELL EMA 21 $0.00002234 SELL EMA 50 $0.00002318 SELL EMA 100 $0.00002240 SELL EMA 200 $0.00002083 SELL What to expect from Shiba Inu price analysis? SHIB shows slight signs of renewed buyer interest but still faces potential rejection around $0.00001925 – $0.00001933. A breakout above this range is needed to confirm a bullish recovery. If momentum holds, Shiba Inu could move towards $0.00002066 or dip further if it breaks its immediate support level. Is Shiba Inu a good investment? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has made strides with the launch of Shibarium, its Layer-2 blockchain, and a partnership with Chainlink, boosting cross-chain functionality and utility. The upcoming TREAT token – expected to play a significant role in Shiba Inu’s reward system and governance mechanisms – further expands its ecosystem. While promising, SHIB remains highly speculative and subject to market swings, so proceed cautiously as a trader or investor. Will Shiba Inu recover? Shiba Inu is experiencing fluctuations with a recent upward trend; there are signs of potential recovery. Will SHIB reach $1? Reaching $1 for Shiba Inu (SHIB) is highly unlikely due to its massive circulating supply and the unrealistic market cap. Significant demand increases and supply reductions would be necessary to approach such a price. Will SHIB reach $10 It is unlikely that SHIB will reach $10 due to its enormous circulating supply and the unrealistic market capitalization required to achieve this feat. Will SHIB reach $100? Reaching $100 for SHIB is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply and the astronomically high market capitalization it would necessitate. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on continued adoption, broader market adoption trends, and other cryptocurrency market space developments.

39713411,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=665697,1738281307,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39713411.jpeg,MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor graces the cover of Forbes: “The Bitcoin Alchemist”,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-graces-the-cover-of-forbes-the-bitcoin-alchemist/,"Michael Saylor is everywhere, and now he’s on the cover of Forbes in an issue released Jan. 30. The 59-year-old CEO of MicroStrategy was pictured grinning under the bold title, “The Bitcoin Alchemist,” an iconic and very fitting name. Michael came into the market just five years ago and quite literally devoured Bitcoin. Since then, he has accumulated 471,107 BTC worth around $50 billion, turning his company into the ultimate Bitcoin whale and himself into a $9.4 billion man. On New Year’s Eve, Michael hosted 500 elite guests at Villa Vecchia, his 18,000-square-foot mansion in Miami, Florida. Picture this the way Forbes described it in their issue: tangerine suits, golden bodysuits, and hors d’oeuvres stamped with Bitcoin’s iconic “B” logo. Michael Saylor’s Forbes cover Dancers swirled glowing orbs in Bitcoin’s signature orange hue. Outside, the 154-foot Usher yacht rocked against the Miami skyline, ferrying in institutional investors, crypto influencers, and executives. And get this, the main event wasn’t even the new year, it was Bitcoin breaking $100,000 for the first time ever. David Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc. and publisher of Bitcoin Magazine, walked the scene, wearing a cap stamped with “Satoshi Nakamoto.” He was the one who brought Donald Trump to July’s Bitcoin conference, where Trump declared he’d turn America into “the crypto capital of the planet.” But oh no, this night belonged to Michael. The whole party felt less like a party and more like a coronation for the untitled King of Crypto, something he might have to fight El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele for. Though hey listen, this article is about Michael, not Nayib. And Michael strolled through the party in his black blazer, blue jeans, and a T-shirt branded with the Bitcoin logo. Selfie requests and handshakes piled up. Here, Bitcoin was a religion, and Michael was its high priest. The comeback of the century Michael’s relationship with money has always been a bit so-so. Anyway, he built MicroStrategy in 1989 as a data-mining company right out of MIT. By 2000, this genius was worth $13 billion, but the tech bubble popped, and so did his empire. The SEC accused him of accounting fraud, and MicroStrategy’s stock dropped like a rock—from $313 per share to under $1. His $13 billion net worth was gone overnight. “It was the darkest part of my life. When people lose money because they believe in you, that’s pretty much the worst,” he said. For the next twenty years, MicroStrategy limped along with unimpressive sales and a market cap around $1 billion. Then came 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic triggered massive global fiat printing, and Michael said he started seeing the dollar as “trash.” He didn’t see safety in dollars or bonds, but he saw safety in Bitcoin’s 21 million token limit. With $530 million in cash reserves and after months of contemplation, he made the call, said MicroStrategy would go all-in on Bitcoin. Over three years, MicroStrategy scooped up more Bitcoin than anyone else in the world, apart from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. After the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock, Bitcoin’s price doubled, then smashed $100,000 in December after Trump won the election and gave the industry what he promised us. That spike pushed MicroStrategy straight into the Nasdaq 100. The company’s stock surged over 700% last year. Michael’s net worth went from $1.9 billion in 2024 to $9.4 billion in January 2025. Pretty crazy, huh? MicroStrategy is now worth $84 billion, despite having only $48 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Wall Street doesn’t really get it, but Michael does. “We put a crypto reactor in the middle of the company and spin it,” he said. “That volatility fuels everything.” How Michael Saylor weaponized volatility and became Wall Street’s King Now here’s the magic trick: Michael knew Wall Street thrives on volatility, the very thing traditional investors fear. In 2021, he began issuing billions in convertible bonds, offering investors the option to convert debt into shares of MicroStrategy. The implied volatility of MicroStrategy’s options skyrocketed as Bitcoin prices bounced wildly. Traders loved it. “People thought I was crazy,” Michael told Forbes. “How can such a small company have that liquidity? Because we created volatility on purpose.” MicroStrategy has issued six convertible notes since 2021, totaling $7.3 billion, with interest rates between 0% and 2.25%. Investors ate them up. Allianz and State Street grabbed huge chunks. The bonds delivered returns over 250%, making them one of the top-performing debt plays in the market. Even the $3 billion issued last November—with a 0% coupon—gained 89% in just a few months. With its stock price up 2,666% since 2020, MicroStrategy’s market frenzy rivals even Tesla and Amazon. Its shares jumped from 97 million to 246 million through secondary offerings and debt issuance. In January, shareholders approved increasing the authorized shares to 10.3 billion. His strategy is simple: raise debt, buy Bitcoin, drive prices up, issue more shares, and repeat. And just when Wall Street thought he was done, Michael introduced a new financial metric: Bitcoin Yield. It measures the growth of Bitcoin holdings relative to the company’s fully diluted shares. MicroStrategy reported a 74.3% BTC Yield for 2024. Wall Street couldn’t ignore the signal, even if it seemed arbitrary. So now those guys are knocking on Michael’s door, they want in on the action too. Michael’s financial engineering is now a template for others. Bitwise counts 90 public companies—Tesla and Block included—adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. In March 2025, Bitwise will launch a Bitcoin Standard ETF tracking 35 companies holding over 1,000 BTC each. MicroStrategy dominates the list. “Size is everything,” said Jeff Park from Bitwise. “MicroStrategy is the most liquid source for trading Bitcoin-related risks.” What happens if Bitcoin crashes? Here’s the question: What happens if Bitcoin drops like it did in 2018 or 2022? The answer is, according to Michael, MicroStrategy has time. Bitcoin would need to fall over 80% and stay there for two years before this hero would be in trouble. “Actually, there’s very little debt on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet,” said Jeff Park. The debt is unsecured, so there’s no forced liquidation of Bitcoin assets even if things go south. Michael isn’t worried. Trump’s crypto-friendly administration is back, and the US national debt keeps surging. “Cash is trash,” he said to Forbes, sticking to his mantra. Trump’s spending policies will for sure hurt the dollar, which will only strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal. Michael said, “The irony of my career is I invented 20 things, and I tried to make them successful, and I really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared, and now we just carry the torch. That, ironically, has made me more successful than me trying to commercialize every one of my own ideas. It is a lesson in humility.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-30 23:55:07

Ethereum ETFs Struggle & XRP Price Prediction Shows Rally,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-pick-for-2025-web3bay-shines-with-6000-roi-ethereum-etfs-struggle-xrp-price-prediction-shows-rally/,"The digital currency market is seeing high excitement, with investor enthusiasm and high valuations. Often, these periods have been followed by market dips, highlighting the importance of choosing cryptos with strong basics that can maintain value during downturns. XRP’s price forecast shows it nearing an important barrier at $3.30, suggesting possible growth, yet a market drop could still occur. Similarly, the Ethereum ETF managed by Fidelity has seen no new investments, indicating investor wariness amid market uncertainties. Amid these market trends, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as a strong investment choice. Its decentralized e-commerce platform is reinforced by a successful $980,000 presale and an anticipated return of 6,430%. This platform promises substantial long-term potential that transcends current market volatility. At the heart of Web3Bay is a commitment to innovation, presenting a solid opportunity for investors aiming to manage the complexities of the vibrant market with a project that is both innovative and focused on practical utility. Web3Bay (3BAY): A New Force in E-Commerce Web3Bay, known as the potential “Amazon Killer,” is transforming online shopping with its blockchain-based platform. This initiative addresses traditional e-commerce issues like high fees, transparency, and data privacy by empowering users. It provides secure and open dealings with added benefits such as a 5% savings on purchases using the 3BAY token. Its presale was a hit, with $980,000 raised and over 265 million tokens sold. With the current token price at $0.004562 in its third stage, it’s accessible for many. The token’s expected increase to $0.1959 could give early buyers a return of 6,430%. Web3Bay’s strategy includes innovative features like decentralized storage through IPFS, compatibility across blockchain networks like Ethereum and BNB, and plans for second-layer solutions to speed up and reduce transaction costs. Its community-led approach gives users a voice in the platform’s direction. With growing interest in its presale, Web3Bay is setting up to revolutionize e-commerce. This is your chance to get involved before it launches! XRP Price Prediction: Potential for Major Gains or a Pullback? The current analysis of XRP suggests it’s trading at $3.12 and facing a crucial resistance at $3.30. Overcoming this barrier could trigger a significant uptrend, potentially reaching $4.19, $5, or even $6.61. Despite a mixed track record recently and a 4% decrease over the last week, the support levels between $2.52 and $2.94 are robust, providing a solid foundation for those hoping for price appreciation. Conversely, these support levels offer a reliable fallback for purchasers. The recent breakout of XRP from a triangle formation on January 13 indicates potential for continued upward movement, though the current slowing momentum suggests it could soon reach a pivotal juncture. Investors should keep an eye on the $3.30-$3.40 range for signs of a possible ascent. While a surge could bring substantial rewards, there’s also a chance of regression to lower support zones in the near term. Ethereum ETF Faces Challenges with No Recent Inflows The Fidelity-managed Ethereum ETF has experienced no new inflows lately, indicating a stall in investor enthusiasm. This aligns with Ethereum’s price holding steady at $2,850 after a recent 1.2% decrease. The absence of fresh funds highlights investor caution, possibly due to a decline in trading volume and general activity within the Ethereum network. This ETF is now under close watch as investors assess how this trend might impact the broader market. Despite potential risks of market volatility, Ethereum’s established role in decentralized finance and smart contracts might still offer profitable scenarios for those willing to handle the current uncertainties. This market hiatus could serve as a potential opportunity for strategic investors eyeing Ethereum’s long-term growth. Summing Up! In a fluctuating crypto market, XRP, Ethereum, and Web3Bay each offer unique prospects, but Web3Bay stands out with its innovative approach and substantial ROI potential. While XRP might soon exceed $3.30 and Ethereum ETF is not seeing new money, Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce . It’s redefining the space with lower fees, privacy, and user governance, with its presale already achieving significant token sales and offering a 6,430% ROI. For those seeking impactful growth, Web3Bay is poised to lead the next wave of blockchain-based e-commerce, making it a top choice for future-focused investors.

Toncoin Eyes Potential Surge & HBAR Tests Key Support,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-tg-tap-miner-lands-on-okx-wallet-enhances-gamefi-toncoin-eyes-potential-surge-hbar-tests-key-support/,"The lines between gaming and blockchain are blurring, turning once simple in-game items into valuable digital assets. Projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have shown how GameFi can create new financial opportunities for players. But getting started with these games and accessing their full potential can be tricky, limiting their widespread appeal. BlockDAG ‘s TG Tap Miner offers a different path. It uses the familiar Telegram platform to provide a simple play-to-earn experience. Now, with its integration with OKX, accessing and managing in-game rewards and digital assets is easier than ever. Meanwhile, Toncoin’s recent price action and Hedera Hashgraph’s technical outlook remind us of the ever-present volatility in the crypto market. This volatility underscores the importance of GameFi projects like TG Tap Miner that prioritize user-friendliness. OKX Collaboration Accelerates BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner Into Mainstream Gaming BlockDAG’s recent partnership with OKX is a major step in its GameFi journey, highlighting its dedication to bringing gaming and decentralized finance closer together. TG Tap Miner, BlockDAG’s Telegram-based play-to-earn game, has already seen considerable interest. Its integration with OKX’s wallet system sets it up for widespread adoption. This move aligns with the broader rise of GameFi, where projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have shown how in-game items can become valuable, tradable assets. But TG Tap Miner stands out by providing a smooth user experience through Telegram, removing the usual hurdles to entry. BlockDAG’s presale success further demonstrates its momentum, raising over $186.5 million with 17.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently in its 27th batch at $0.0248 per coin, the project has seen an impressive 2,380% return since batch 1. With OKX integrating TG Tap Miner NFTs, BlockDAG is poised for even greater growth as more players gain easy access to in-game rewards and digital assets. Looking forward, BlockDAG could further improve its ecosystem with features like staking, allowing users to earn passive income on their BDAG holdings. NFT lending could let gamers borrow assets for gameplay, creating a more fluid in-game economy. A dedicated NFT marketplace could boost the value and trading of TG Tap Miner collectibles. As BlockDAG continues its rapid expansion, its partnership with OKX signals a new era where gaming and blockchain blend seamlessly, offering exciting opportunities for those who get in early. Is Toncoin’s Set For A Potential Surge? Toncoin (TON) is currently trading near $5.02, approaching a key resistance level at $5.30, with an all-time high of $8.24. The platform’s active development environment is attracting a variety of projects, fostering ecosystem growth. At the same time, recent U.S. political changes may lead to more crypto-friendly regulations, encouraging broader adoption—a significant shift given past regulatory uncertainties. TON’s focus on scalability and efficient transaction processing positions it well for mainstream use. Given these factors, analysts predict a potential rise to $54 in 2025, suggesting substantial returns for early investors. However, the crypto market’s inherent volatility means such forecasts should be approached cautiously. While TON’s technological strengths and favorable regulatory trends make it an appealing investment, thorough personal research and risk assessment are essential before making investment decisions. Hedera Hashgraph Tests Key Support Levels Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) recently tested its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as a critical support level after a slight pullback. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests oversold conditions, hinting at a possible rebound. If the price maintains support at $0.2559, an upward push toward $0.3930 remains likely. However, breaking below this level could accelerate losses. From a technical perspective, the outlook leans bullish, with potential recovery driven by improved market sentiment. Moreover, a break above resistance could fuel further gains, strengthening HBAR’s position. Consequently, traders are watching for confirmation signals to gauge the next move. Meanwhile, the market’s response to external factors, including broader crypto trends, will play a role in determining whether the bullish scenario unfolds. While uncertainty persists, maintaining the above support could reinforce buying momentum. If buyers regain control, the upcoming sessions might witness renewed optimism, positioning Hedera Hashgraph for an extended rally toward key resistance levels. The Bottom Line As blockchain ecosystems grow, accessibility and utility are becoming crucial factors in driving long-term adoption. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner stands out by simplifying the GameFi experience via Telegram, removing the obstacles that typically hinder wider participation. Thanks to its integration with OKX, players can now easily access in-game rewards, enhancing their position within the market. In parallel, Toncoin’s price fluctuations and Hedera Hashgraph’s technical trends highlight the ongoing volatility in the crypto space, affecting investor strategies. Looking ahead, projects like TG Tap Miner that focus on combining user-friendly interfaces with strong financial incentives are well-positioned to thrive, providing a smoother entry into blockchain-based gaming and decentralized finance.

Aptos is a fast-growing layer-1 blockchain network, and the biggest compliment to its reputation could be its “Solana killer” nickname. It claims to be an upgrade on existing blockchain platforms with its solutions to enhance scalability, security and user experience. The Aptos platform supports over 200 decentralized applications ( dApps ), with over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) and a stablecoin market cap of approximately $780 million. USDT holds a 75% share of the stablecoin in circulation on the network. Before the integration, the USDC on the platform was bridged from other networks. Financial institutions can now also interact with USDC liquidity and benefit from Aptos’ network. USDC launch on Aptos Circle announced in November 2024 that it would launch on the Aptos network. Now, two months later, the company announced on its website that its stablecoin is now available on the Aptos mainnet. With the integration, USDC is now accessible to developers and users with no bridging required. USDC is the world’s largest MiCA-compliant dollar stablecoin. The token’s availability on the Aptos layer-1 network could open more growth opportunities for the Circle-issued stablecoin. Aptos has a $4.54 billion market cap, which is a reflection of its success in supporting developers to build apps for various use cases. Apps on the network include DeFi, peer-to-peer payments, cross-border remittances, and much more. Some of the top applications in the Aptos ecosystem include Aries Markets, Thala, KGen, and Cellana Finance. The Aptos network has a bridged form of USDC circulating known as IzUSDC. It is bridged from Ethereum through the AptosBridge. The growth of the bridged version is possible due to bridge providers such as Stargate. The popularity of IzUSDC was a major factor in Circle’s decision to bring native USDC to the Aptos mainnet network. At present, lzUSDC is not issued by Circle and is not compatible nor redeemable with Circle Mint. However, the Aptos team and bridge providers will be working to help facilitate the migration from lzUSDC to native USDC over time. Circle gains ground on Tether Circle, the stablecoin issuer has witnessed a recent boost in the European market due to several factors. High on the list is that it has achieved full compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. MiCA is a regulatory body that requires issuers of stablecoins to meet strict transparency, liquidity, and consumer protection standards. On the other hand, Tether’s USDT did not meet the MiCA standards required to continue operating in Europe. Tether’s market cap dropped from $140 billion to $137 billion following MiCA regulations implementation, which started on December 30, 2024. ` Circle’s collaboration with Aptos is an apparent move to close the gap on Tether’s USDT. Tether announced a similar integration last year, but with USDC on the “Solana killer” layer-1 network, USDT’s 75% dominance could be under threat.

For thousands of traders, that story is Bonk (BONK). Back in 2023, when Solana’s first major dog-themed meme coin launched, most people laughed it off as another flash-in-the-pan gimmick. Big mistake. At launch, Bonk was practically free, trading at microscopic fractions of a cent. But then it exploded. Within months, BONK surged over 4,500%, minting overnight millionaires. Investors who threw in a few hundred bucks early walked away with six-figure gains. And yet, most people ignored it—until it was too late. If you’re reading this, you probably weren’t one of the lucky ones. But here’s the good news: history is repeating itself. Another meme coin with sky-high potential is in its early stages, and this time, you don’t have to miss out. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the top new meme coin to join in February 2025 that’s poised to dominate the market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Meme Coin Revolution You Can’t Ignore Meme coins aren’t just about hype anymore. The best ones are combining viral appeal with real-world utility, and BTFD is leading the charge. Unlike most meme coins that live and die by market sentiment alone, BTFD packs an arsenal of features designed to reward long-term holders and active community members. A Presale That’s Printing Future Millionaires If you’re looking for an early-stage play with a massive upside, BTFD’s presale is the golden ticket. The coin launched at just $0.000004 and is now sitting at $0.00016 in its 14th presale stage, with an expected launch price of $0.0006. That’s an easy 275% ROI waiting to happen just by getting in before the presale ends. Let’s put that into perspective. If you invest $20,000 in BTFD at its current presale price of $0.00016, you’ll snag 125 million BTFD tokens . Once it hits the listing price of $0.0006, your investment balloons to $75,000. Now imagine if BTFD pulls a Bonk-style rally—how high could your gains go? The “Bulls Squad” is Leading the Stampede BTFD isn’t just another faceless meme coin. It has a mascot-driven ecosystem called the Bulls Squad, featuring characters like Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull. These aren’t just cute icons—they represent the movement of traders who are sick of missing dips and are ready to take charge of their financial future. The Bulls Squad embodies the fearless spirit of early adopters. In other words, BTFD rewards those who grab opportunities before the crowd catches on. 90% APY Staking – Your Money Working for You Unlike most meme coins that sit idle in your wallet, BTFD lets you stake and earn a massive 90% APY. Whether you’re looking to stack more tokens passively or double down on your long-term bet, staking ensures that every BTFD holder is earning, even when the market takes a breather. Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game – Earn While You Play Launched on January 1, 2025, the BTFD Play-to-Earn (P2E) game lets users rack up rewards while enjoying the action-packed gaming experience. This isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a full ecosystem where holders can engage, play, and win. BTFD’s explosive growth is just getting started, and with over 9,900 holders already on board, it’s clear this is more than just hype—it’s a movement. Bonk (BONK) – The One That Got Away (For Some) Let’s rewind to late 2023. Bonk (BONK) was just another meme coin floating under the radar, and most people laughed it off as just another dog-themed gimmick. But while the skeptics laughed, early believers were banking serious cash. The Crazy Bonk (BONK) Surge Bonk went from being an airdrop token to a billion-dollar market cap meme coin. It saw massive gains, climbing over 5,000% in a few months. If you had thrown just $500 into Bonk in its early days, you could have easily turned that into $25,000 or more. The market didn’t take Bonk seriously at first, but when major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase listed it, things got wild. Bonk’s price skyrocketed, and suddenly, it wasn’t just a joke—it was the hottest meme coin of the season. Why You Might Have Missed Out Most investors ignored Bonk, thinking it was just another meme coin that wouldn’t last. Others thought they’d have more time to buy in. But by the time the FOMO kicked in, it was already too late—the biggest gains had already been made. And now, history is repeating itself. A fresh meme coin is rising, offering the same kind of early-stage opportunity, but with even more firepower behind it. Why BTFD is Your Second Chance at a Bonk-Style Payday Opportunities like Bonk (BONK) don’t come around often, and when they do, you have two choices: Get in early and reap the rewards, or hesitate and watch from the sidelines as others cash in. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a strategic, community-driven project with a massive ecosystem designed to reward early adopters. If you missed Bonk, this is your moment to make things right. Referral Program – Get Paid for Spreading the Word BTFD isn’t just letting you invest—it’s paying you to bring in new buyers. Its referral system rewards both referrers and new buyers with extra BTFD tokens. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet – Get a unique referral code. Share Your Code – Invite your friends, family, or crypto community. Earn Rewards – Your referrals get 10% extra BTFD , and you receive 10% of every purchase made with your code if you rank in the top 20 referrers. Track Your Earnings – Watch your BTFD stack grow in real-time. Passive income while you invest? Now that’s a game-changer. Final Verdict – Are You Going to Let This One Slip Away Too? Bonk (BONK) was the meme coin that made early believers rich, but most people didn’t take it seriously until it was too late. Now, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is presenting the same kind of massive opportunity—but with even more power, features, and earning potential behind it. The BTFD presale is in its 14th stage, with a price of $0.00016, already raising over $5.82 million. When it lists at $0.0006, early investors will see an easy 275% ROI—and that’s just the beginning. With 90% APY staking, a live Play-to-Earn game, and the unstoppable Bulls Squad movement, BTFD is the Top New Meme Coin to Join in February 2025 . So, will you Buy The Dip this time, or will you be kicking yourself six months from now? The choice is yours.

Ethereum MVRV Momentum Has Witnessed A Bearish Crossover As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has declined under its 160-day moving average (MA) recently. The “MVRV Ratio” refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Ethereum market cap and the realized cap. The realized cap here is a capitalization model that calculates ETH’s total valuation by assuming that the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin MPI Crossover Could Suggest Bull Run Still On Since the last transaction of any coin is likely to correspond to the last point at which it changed hands, the Realized Cap essentially measures the sum of the cost basis of the circulating supply. This model could also be looked at as a representation of the amount of capital the investors as whole have put into Ethereum. In contrast, the market cap is the value that the holders are carrying right now. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, it means the market cap is greater than the realized cap. Such a trend implies the investors as a whole are sitting on unrealized gains. On the other hand, the metric being under the mark suggests the holders are carrying a lower value than they initially put in, so the average investor could be considered underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV Ratio, as well as its 160-day MA, over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has registered a decline recently as ETH’s price has followed a bearish trajectory. The indicator is still above the 1 mark after this drawdown, suggesting the overall market remains in the green. The metric’s fall, however, has meant that it has slipped under its 160-day MA. The combination of the indicator’s daily value and its 160-day is known as the MVRV Momentum. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted what happened the last time the MVRV Momentum showed a similar pattern as recently.

It would appear that the MVRV Ratio crossing under its 160-day MA led to a 40% price correction for Ethereum last year. It now remains to be seen whether the negative momentum in the indicator would also prove to be bearish for the cryptocurrency this time as well or not. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,200, up more than 2% over the last seven days.

The company admitted it has been unable to sustain operations. It wrote : “This is not the outcome we had hoped for, but we’re incredibly grateful for this community and everyone who believed in the vision and showed up with enthusiasm. Your support meant everything. Thank you for believing in us. ” Teleport shuts down as users have until February 28 to withdraw funds The company’s website currently has a message informing visitors about the wind-down process. The app will provide off-ramping support until Feb. 28 so users can receive their remaining stablecoin balances and private keys. Meanwhile, the firm hopes to post a more detailed analysis of what led to this decision in the future, but for now, we’re focused on an orderly wind-down. Led by early crypto investor and former Dropbox engineer Paul Bohm, Teleport was launched in 2022 when the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) projects began to boom. Just as Helium did, Teleport also aimed to integrate blockchain-based incentives into real-world applications. The company was different from traditional ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft since it employed Solana’s blockchain to establish an open and transparent marketplace. Teleport’s Rideshare Protocol was intended to reduce costs for riders and increase earnings for drivers by excluding the middlemen corporations. Customer acquisition was not traditional but “permissionless marketing,” where users could find drivers and riders and bring them into the network. Teleport utilized a reward system inspired by Bitcoin’s mining rewards, which rewarded early adopters with Compressed NFTs on Solana. DEC’s $9 million seed funding couldn’t save Teleport from industry challenges The Decentralized Engineering Corporation (DEC) that built the app raised $9 million in a seed funding round co-led by Steve Vassallo at Foundation Capital and Thomas Bailey at Road Capital. However, while its innovative model was built on a sound idea, Teleport failed to gain critical mass and financial health. The ride-sharing industry is competitive, with the existing players keeping their stronghold on the users by having a large user base, regulatory power, and financial backup. While the blockchain-based incentives were a way of doing things differently, they were not enough to help Teleport navigate through the operational and market challenges that the project faced.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 314,000 followers on the social media platform X that dogwifhat ( WIF ) might have bottomed out after completing a correction in a three-wave pattern on the weekly time frame. The analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis says that while WIF’s bearish trend lasted longer than he had originally anticipated, there are “some nice signs of life forming” on the memecoin’s low time-frames. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. While cautioning that it’s too early to conclude that a bull run is underway, Bluntz says, “Obviously very early days and we haven’t seen a five-wave rise from the lows “yet” but I think there’s a decent chance one has begun to form.” Source: Bluntz/X WIF is trading at $1.32 at time of writing. Next up is Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to the widely followed analyst, Bitcoin could potentially be forming a “brutal” swing failure pattern (SFP) to the downside on the two-week chart. A swing failure pattern is a tool in technical analysis that is used to determine potential points of a trend reversal. “Bitcoin has five days to not be a brutal two-week SFP.” Source: Bluntz/X Bitcoin is trading at $101,912 at time of writing.

Analysts now suggest a pivot to RCO Finance, an altcoin project that is changing the narrative in the financial sector by leveraging artificial intelligence for streamlined investing. Read on to see why analysts expect RCO Finance to become one of the top altcoin assets 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Slows Down as Memecoin Appeal Wanes Dogecoin is one of the latest tokens to be affected by the fall in demand for meme coins. Despite surging to a 3-year high in December, Dogecoin has stagnated only a few weeks later. Dogecoin trades at $0.3348 after an 11.25% drop in the past week. Analysts predict a continuation of this bearish trend for Dogecoin (DOGE), as demand for meme coins wanes in favor of more stable altcoin assets. As a result, many Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are now seeking opportunities elsewhere, with RCO Finance attracting attention as its presale revenue crosses $12 million. RCO Finance: The Next Genration of Investing Tools for the Finance Sector Traders in the financial sector today have to sift through mountains of market data, which makes finding profitable opportunities difficult. However, RCO Finance (RCOF) presents a novel solution in its Robo Advisor, an AI tool that marries smart automation with broad market access, allowing you to stay focused while doing the heavy lifting in your portfolio. Robo Advisor is a tireless researcher who scans global markets, looking for patterns and risks. It continuously collects high-quality market data from reputable sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, watching for shifts that can bring you profits. Robo Advisor will provide trading strategies tailored to your investing goals, market preference, and risk appetite. Even better, this tool can adjust your portfolio for both short and long-term needs. This is especially useful in volatile markets, where quick decisions are essential to limit losses or maximize returns. For instance, imagine having Robo Advisor at your disposal in Q3 2024, right before XRP’s price surge. This tool would have notified you of its growth early on, allowing you to capitalize on its rise to $3. The best part is that you wouldn’t need to constantly watch the market as the trading bot will be in charge of your portfolio. Robo Advisor also provides access to a diverse range of financial instruments, which include over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories. Being an RCO Finance investor, you can explore everything from stocks, bonds, futures, and ETFs to cryptocurrencies, commodities, and even real estate. You can leverage this broad access to build a robust portfolio with exposure to distinct asset classes, allowing you to balance risk and return in a way that keeps you profitable. For instance, a crypto investor facing an imminent market crash can leverage RCO Finance’s trading bot to diversify part of their portfolio into Nvidia stock, gaining some stability from tech markets. Beyond the ability to trade across multiple asset classes, RCO Finance also offers extra profit-earning mechanisms. Like other DeFi ecosystems, you can stake RCOF tokens, contributing to liquidity pools. In return, investors will receive up to 86% APY, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 10%-15%. RCO Finance also rewards investors with trading fee discounts for keeping an RCOF balance. The higher your token reserve, the more trading fee discounts you will receive. Another area RCO Finance stands out is offering unmatched privacy and convenience. Many DeFi platforms have stringent KYC policies, which usually infringe on personal privacy. RCO Finance takes a different route, removing KYC policies and offering a non-invasive paperwork process. Additionally, investors enjoy extra security as all transactions are backed by RCO Finance’s smart contract technology, which has been audited by SolidProof, showing investors that RCO Finance is committed to user safety. RCO Finance’s User Signups Crosses 10,000 as Beta Platform Goes Live Over 10,000 investors have joined RCO Finance’s ecosystem, indicating the strong demand for its services. These investors can now understand its ecosystem by exploring the live beta platform. RCO Finance’s team is also working on changes and improvements on Robo Advisor and the trading platform before its full alpha launch. This news has impressed the altcoin sector, showing that RCO Finance is committed to providing tangible solutions to investor problems. Best Crypto Coins for 2025: Why Analysts Pick RCOF Over Dogecoin In the search for the best crypto coins for 2025, investors have picked RCO Finance for its AI-based investing solutions over the meme coin appeal of Dogecoin. Already, over $12 million worth of tokens have been sold in RCO Finance’s ongoing presale. RCOF is now in stage five of its presale, selling at $0.100. By the next stage, its value will grow to $0.130. With a targeted listing price of $0.4-$0.6, RCOF is poised to become one of the fastest-growing tokens in the market. Finally, analysts say it is poised for a 14,000x growth, which could take a $1,000 investment to $250,000 by Q2 2026. Don’t miss out on the chance to elevate your investing strategy.

This decision allows NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the fund, which will hold both Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside cash reserves. The approval was granted on an accelerated basis, as indicated in the SEC filing released on January 30, 2025. US SEC Approves Bitwise ETF Holding Both Bitcoin and Ethereum According to the recent filing , the SEC approved the Bitwise ETF on an accelerated basis. The approval permits NYSE Arca to list and trade the ETF, which will provide investors with direct exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Bitwise ETF will hold spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, and cash reserves. This structure is designed to offer diversified exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The SEC’s approval follows a series of crypto-related ETF filings submitted by multiple financial firms in recent months. Following the ongoing trend on crypto ETFs, a report highlighted that Grayscale filed for a spot XRP ETF with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The asset manager will convert its existing XRP Trust into an ETF, which would be listed and traded on the exchange. This move comes shortly after Grayscale filed for Litecoin and Solana ETFs, signaling increasing interest in crypto investment products. Pending S-1 Registration Required for Trading Despite the approval of form 19b-4, the Bitwise ETF still requires SEC clearance for its pending S-1 registration. Both steps are necessary before the fund can begin trading on the exchange. The S-1 registration review will determine compliance with regulatory standards, including investor protection measures and transparency requirements. Bitwise Asset Management must await further approval before officially launching the ETF in the market. In the Thursday filing, the US SEC wrote, “In particular, the Commission finds that the Proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Exchange’s rules be designed to ‘prevent manipulative acts and practices’ and, ‘in general, to protect investors and the public interest.” Broader Regulatory Shift in Crypto ETFs The US SEC decision reflects an evolving regulatory stance on cryptocurrency ETFs. Under the current administration, firms have submitted multiple applications to launch similar financial products. Recently, VanEck and ProShares filed for ETFs tracking assets like Litecoin, XRP, and Solana. The approval of the Bitwise ETF follows prior approvals in December 2024 for crypto index ETFs from firms such as Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. It is worth noting that earlier in the week, the asset management firm submitted an S-1 filing with the US SEC for a spot Dogecoin ETF . Bitwise confirmed that the ETF’s Net Asset Value (NAV) will be based on the Dogecoin-Dollar settlement benchmark from CF trading. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have shown movement following the announcement. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $104,612.69 with a 1.13% increase over the past week, while Ethereum stands at $3,269, gaining 4% in the last 24 hours.

39715922,https://nulltx.com/?p=142095,1738288803,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,What Has Got So Many Toncoin & Polkadot Holders Loving Up 1Fuel & Are Underlying Partnerships Going To Make This 100X,https://nulltx.com/what-has-got-so-many-toncoin-polkadot-holders-loving-up-1fuel-are-underlying-partnerships-going-to-make-this-100x/,"Over the years, Toncoin and Polkadot have dominated the market among the best cryptocurrencies to buy. However, times are changing rapidly, paving the way for utility-driven altcoins like 1Fuel , which is available for the low presale entry of $0.017. Read to discover why analysts eye 1Fuel as the best crypto to invest in from this moment and why it will likely outperform Toncoin and Polkadot in the upcoming bull cycle. Toncoin falters in late January The Toncoin price has stagnated over the past two weeks, causing profound losses for investors. Like many altcoins, Toncoin initially benefited from heightened market euphoria around Trump’s inauguration, soaring to $5.6 earlier this month. Now, in the final week of January, Toncoin exchanges for $4.8, which is a 5% decline in the past week and a 14% decline compared to the past month. Polkadot holders desperate to recoup losses Amid the ongoing crypto sell-offs, the Polkadot price has left investors wanting more. For context, DOT rallied to a high of $7.6 in early January, leading holders to predict massive gains. However, Polkadot could not live up to expectations and is now trading for $6, down over 4% compared to the previous week. With rising trading volume and buying pressure, bullish analysts suggest Polkadot could be due for a consolidation or price increase. However, a descent below its critical $6 support could trigger further Polkadot price drops. Is 1Fuel the best crypto to invest in? The recent Toncoin and Polkadot sell-offs are pushing many investors to 1Fuel. At its core, 1Fuel makes blockchain tech more accessible through its secure cross-chain wallet. Unlike any other cold crypto wallet, using 1Fuel, you do not have to worry about network tokens or excessive gas fees. Just choose the token you want to use, specify the crypto you want to own (no matter the network), then focus on your goals and let 1Fuel take care of the rest. Experts agree that 1Fuel’s ease of use and cross-chain capabilities position it as an important tool for the future of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Additionally, 1Fuel’s consensus mechanism reduces the ecological footprint of blockchain transactions. This approach adds an extra layer of appeal for investors who value eco-friendly crypto instruments. OFT: Expert predictions OFT is the native token of 1Fuel, which currently offers a golden chance to make unparalleled capital gains. The OFT presale price is $0.017, and it is expected to rise 100x in the coming months. This presale event also offers OFT at the lowest possible price. So, by securing an early entry, investors can position themselves to watch a tiny investment compound when 1Fuel hits exchanges. Conclusion Toncoin and Polkadot are undoubtedly among the best cryptocurrencies thanks to their dedicated communities and loyal investor bases. However, recent sell-offs are pushing their holders to get 1Fuel, which offers a way out of these losses. Thanks to diverse use cases and sustainable infrastructure, experts are convinced it will generate 100x returns as soon as 1Fuel makes its public launch. Want to buy 1Fuel tokens before the next price increase? Join the presale today and stake your claim in the future of secure cross-chain transactions.

By transforming the $600 trillion property market, PCHAIN delivers tangible asset backing, unlike XRP and Cardano, which focus on exchange and smart contracts. Investor confidence has surged, with analysts predicting a 55,000% upside, surpassing Cardano and XRP price movements. As adoption grows, PCHAIN is poised for a significant parabolic rally, bridging real estate and digital assets while reshaping the crypto landscape. This positions it as a leader in blockchain innovation. Cardano Price: A Community Sentiment or Market Stability Cardano has become a standout performer in the ongoing altcoin rally, showcasing strong bullish momentum. Following Bitcoin’s surge to $99,000 in November, Cardano (ADA) reached a 3-year high, benefiting from the market’s upward trajectory. Analysts are now debating the longevity of this altcoin season. Many experts believe Cardano will maintain its rally, with its growing DeFi activity playing a crucial role in driving substantial growth. XRP Faces Challenges Amidst Phishing Alert XRP recently experienced a 12.18% surge, reaching $3.13 and surpassing the $3 mark. Ripple’s anticipated legal victory over the SEC and the buzz around ETFs have likely fueled this momentum. However, new concerns about security vulnerabilities could hinder XRP’s continued growth. As uncertainties persist, some investors are reconsidering their long-term strategies, exploring alternatives in the crypto market that offer more tangible utility and resilience against potential setbacks. PropiChain: A New Frontier in Real Estate Market Innovation with 55,000% Upside PropiChain is reshaping the real estate industry with advanced technology, offering a new way to buy, sell, and invest in property. Its innovative platform is positioned to outpace established players like XRP and Cardano in adoption and market impact. PropiChain integrates Metaverse technology to redefine property scouting. Its interactive 3D virtual tours break down geographical barriers, enabling global investors to explore properties remotely. This approach enhances transparency and eliminates logistical hurdles. It allows real-time property assessments without the need for physical visits, reducing costs and time. PropiChain employs blockchain-powered smart contracts to automate key processes like lease management, ownership transfers, and rental payments. This eliminates intermediaries like brokers, increasing transaction security and efficiency. PropiChain integrates AI to optimize real estate investment strategies. Its AI assistants provide 24/7 support and offer market insights, forecasting property value shifts and delivering data-backed recommendations. This ensures investors maximize profitability while minimizing risks. By tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWA), PropiChain enables fractional ownership of premium real estate. This approach democratizes access to high-value assets, increases liquidity, and invites participation from global investors, creating a more inclusive market environment. Comparing PropiChain to XRP and Cardano While XRP and Cardano have long been key players in the crypto market, PropiChain is emerging as a strong competitor with a remarkable 55,000% growth potential. XRP’s focus on cross-border payments remains hindered by regulatory issues, including its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. On the other hand, Cardano has faced criticism for its slow progress and limited adoption of smart contract capabilities. In contrast, PropiChain is making rapid advancements and meeting key milestones on its roadmap. With a clear use case, robust adoption, and significant growth potential, PropiChain is surpassing XRP and Cardano in market momentum. PropiChain Presale Gains Momentum Over XRP and Cardano PropiChain’s swift rise above XRP and Cardano reflects the increasing interest in blockchain projects with practical applications. Offering a projected 55,000% growth, PropiChain’s ongoing presale is attracting traders and investors eager for high returns. Analysts predict a $1,000 investment could generate $384,570 by Q1 2025. The first presale raised $1.3 million, while the second round has surpassed the $1 million mark. Token prices are set to increase by over 109% after this phase. PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap has helped boost its visibility and adsorption. Additionally, its smart contracts audit by BlockAudit , a security blockchain firm, highlights its accessibility and security.

But among the flurry, BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight, not just for its innovative blockchain technology but also for its groundbreaking partnership with football giant Inter Milan. This exciting collaboration, coupled with the latest Ethereum (ETH) price action and XRP’s recent licensing victories, is creating a buzz that’s impossible to ignore. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters. BlockDAG and Inter Milan: Blockchain Takes the Field BlockDAG is making a bold statement by joining forces with Inter Milan, one of the most iconic and celebrated football clubs in the world. This isn’t just a sponsorship deal; it’s a strategic partnership that showcases the real-world applications of blockchain technology in the sports industry. Inter Milan, with its massive global following and rich history, is embracing the future by integrating BlockDAG’s blockchain solutions to revolutionize fan engagement and create unique digital experiences. Imagine a world where fans can own a piece of their favorite club through fan tokens, collect and trade digital memorabilia, and access exclusive content and experiences, all powered by the security and transparency of the blockchain. This is what BlockDAG and Inter Milan are bringing to the table. By leveraging blockchain technology, they’re creating a new era of fan interaction, where supporters feel more connected than ever before. The platform’s presale has been nothing short of phenomenal, raising an impressive $186.5 million and selling over 18.2 billion BDAG coins. With the current price of $0.0248 per BDAG, early investors have seen a staggering 2,380% return on investment. This remarkable achievement underscores the strong belief in BlockDAG’s potential to transform not just the sports industry, but various sectors. This partnership between BlockDAG and Inter Milan is more than just a headline-grabber; it’s a blueprint for the future of sports and entertainment. It demonstrates how blockchain can bridge the gap between traditional industries and cutting-edge technology, offering new avenues for fan engagement, revenue generation, and global reach. XRP Scores with New Licenses Meanwhile, XRP is making headlines too. Ripple, the company behind XRP, just got the green light to operate in New York and Texas. This is a big deal because these are two of the toughest places to get approval in the US. Now, XRP can be used for cross-border payments and other digital asset solutions in these major markets. This news has definitely boosted confidence in XRP. It’s currently trading at $3.15, and many believe this is just the beginning of a bigger climb. As Ripple continues to expand in the US, XRP is becoming a top contender in the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action: Still Going Strong Ethereum (ETH) is also holding its own. Despite some recent ups and downs, it’s currently sitting at $3,191.58, showing a 3.89% increase. This rebound is likely due to renewed excitement about Ethereum’s plans to become faster and more secure. Of course, Ethereum (ETH) price action is always influenced by what’s happening in the wider crypto world. With competitors like Solana gaining ground, Ethereum needs to keep innovating to stay ahead. But with its strong foundation in DeFi, NFTs, and other cool applications, Ethereum (ETH) price action remains a hot topic. Wrapping It Up To sum it up, the crypto world is constantly evolving, with projects like XRP and Ethereum showcasing resilience and adaptation in the face of new challenges and opportunities. XRP’s recent licensing victories pave the way for broader adoption and solidify its position as a key player in the cross-border payments arena. Meanwhile, Ethereum, despite facing competition, continues to demonstrate its strength. However, it’s BlockDAG that’s truly capturing the imagination right now. Its innovative partnership with Inter Milan transcends the typical boundaries of the crypto world, demonstrating the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the sports and entertainment industries. This collaboration not only opens up new avenues for fan engagement and revenue generation but also sets a precedent for other sectors looking to leverage blockchain for enhanced transparency, security, and user experiences.

The altcoin has surged 38% in just 30 days, reaching a seven-year high of $3.39. Solana, on the other hand, has taken a 12% hit in just 24 hours, now sitting at $227.62, but that hasn’t erased the 22% Solana price surge. While both XRP and SOL have reported gains, Web3Bay (3BAY) has unlocked a massive ROI potential for early investors. Those who got in during stage 1 of this web3 cryptocurrency’s presale have already secured a 6,430% ROI potential, while those in Stage 4 are still set for 4,200% returns by launch. XRP News: 38% Surge Sets the Stage for $4.79 XRP has started 2025 with a rally that few saw coming, climbing 38% in just 30 days and reaching a seven-year high of $3.39. CoinCodex predicts XRP could hit $4.79, offering a potential 50% ROI in the short term. Adding to this optimistic XRP news, the altcoin’s upcoming Community Day (Jan 28-29, 2025) is expected to bring major announcements, with Ripple President Monica Long unveiling plans for institutional adoption and expansion in Asia-Pacific. Combine this XRP news with talk of a potential ETF, and the stage is set for a year unlike any other for XRP. Q1 Solana (SOL) Price Surge: Is $400 Possible? Solana has dropped 12% in just 24 hours and is currently sitting at $227.62, well below its all-time high of $294.33 earlier this month. But even with the dip, SOL is still up 22% for the month. Analysts at CoinCodex predict a February high of $290, though some in the community are still holding out hope for a Q1 rally to $400. Beyond short-term price swings, Solana’s long-term outlook remains strong. With discussions around blockchain adoption in U.S. government spending, some believe Solana could play a major role, fueling speculation of a much higher Solana price surge in the years ahead. Missed Web3Bay’s 6,430% ROI? 4,200% Still On the Table! Just like Solana’s price surge and the latest XRP news point to a strong Q1 surge, Web3Bay’s presale is following a similar pattern—only on a much bigger scale. Right now, 3BAY is priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, set to hit $0.1959 at launch. Those who got in during Batch 1 have already locked in a 6,430% ROI potential, but even Stage 4 investors are still looking at a 4,200% return by launch. Underlining the potential the presale has raised more than $980,000 in a very short period of time. See the pattern? With every new presale stage, the price climbs, and with every climb, the ROI potential shrinks. Someone buying this web3 cryptocurrency at Stage 4 will see far higher returns than someone who waits for Stage 10—and by then, the biggest slice of the pie will be gone. This up-and-coming e-commerce giant is setting up a completely decentralized shopping experience where users—not corporations—call the shots. Transactions happen peer-to-peer, cutting out middlemen, unnecessary fees, and banking restrictions. Buyers and sellers have complete flexibility, choosing from crypto, PayPal, and traditional finance channels, making the platform accessible to everyone—not just blockchain insiders. Finally, instead of a centralized entity hoarding profits, Web3Bay redistributes value to those who keep the marketplace thriving, building a self-sustaining economy where users benefit directly. Considering Web3Bay’s mission to decentralize online shopping and the sheer success of its ongoing presale, investors aren’t wasting any time securing 3BAY tokens before the ongoing stage 4 sells out. Which Is the Best Web3 Cryptocurrency Today? According to XRP news, Ripple’s upcoming Community Day is set to bring major updates, potentially pushing the altcoin’s price to $4.79 soon. Solana’s path looks less certain—CoinCodex projects $290 by February, with some still eyeing $400 in Q1. But after a 12% drop in 24 hours, short-term sentiment isn’t exactly reassuring. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is reinventing e-commerce entirely, cutting out middlemen, slashing fees, and putting buyers and sellers in control. With over $960,000 raised, the presale Stage 4 of this web3 cryptocurrency is almost gone. Those who missed Stage 1’s 6,430% ROI potential still have a shot at 4,200% gains, but only if they move before Stage 4 disappears.

Key Market Signals Point to a Possible Rebound,https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/is-toncoin-set-for-a-comeback-key-market-signals-point-to-a-possible-rebound/,"While the broader cryptocurrency market appears to be gradually recovering, Toncoin (TON) has yet to join the upward trend. Over the past week, TON has faced significant challenges, seeing its price dip by 5.4%. Amid this price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst has highlighted signs of a potential reversal, especially as recent data sheds light on underlying market dynamics that could impact the coin’s near-term trajectory. Related Reading: Is Toncoin Price Gearing For A Rebound At $5? This On-Chain Metric Suggests So Toncoin Open Interest and Potential Reversal Signals The CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson has provided an intriguing perspective. In a recent post titled “TON: Signs of a Reversal?” Wedson highlighted a pattern within the open interest data that could hint at a price rebound. This analysis comes at a critical time, with market participants seeking any indicators that TON might stabilize and regain lost ground. Wedson’s analysis centers around the weekly variation in Toncoin’s open interest—a measure of the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts on the asset. According to the data, the open interest delta has shown a consistent increase whenever TON experiences volatility spikes. Historically, these patterns have been observed ahead of significant price surges, raising the possibility that a similar recovery could be on the horizon. TON: Signs of a Reversal? “We’ve observed a pattern where the Open Interest Delta increases with each volatility spike—a behavior that previously preceded a sharp price surge.” – By @joao_wedson Full analysis 👇https://t.co/FC8q4QYIp6 pic.twitter.com/5luN5VojDn — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 29, 2025 TON Market Performance In recent weeks, TON’s price action has been noticeably less bullish. Even as the broader cryptocurrency market experiences gradual gains, TON has struggled to recover, consistently declining and now down roughly 11% over the past two weeks. This divergence from the broader market’s upward momentum may suggest that TON is facing its own bearish pressures, whether driven by chart patterns or on-chain factors.

This makes it the third consecutive time Uniswap’s monthly trading volume on the Base network hit an all-time high. It also recorded all-time highs in November and December 2024. Overall, Uniswap has processed over $1 trillion in total trading volume, which makes it one of the largest DEXs in the world. What Uniswap users are doing on Base The monthly transaction volume on the Uniswap DEX on Coinbase’s native network, Base hit an all-time high for the third month in a row. According to data on the Uniswap interface on Base, memecoins, AI agents, and cbBTC are the hottest assets. Memes are one of the top-performing assets this cycle, and while Solana remains the home for risk-tolerant traders, Base also posts steady numbers in those regards. It also benefits from the intersection between the AI agent and memecoin narratives. For example, one of the top-performing tokens for the month, Virtual Protocol’s VIRTUAL, which is currently trading at $2.05, posted a monthly volume of $6.6 billion and an all-time volume of $12.2 billion. VIRTUAL is sandwiched between Ethereum and USDC, two tokens that enable DeFi activity on Base. USDC is currently enjoying a monopoly of volume on the network because Coinbase delisted USDT in Europe to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Its trading volume for the month came in at $5.5 billion, with an FDC of $53.1 billion. Tether’s USDT had a notably bad January, with less than $59 million in trading volume for the entire month. Aside from memes and AI agent tokens, users on Uniswap have also been heavily involved with Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC). Coinbase built cbBTC to be compatible with DeFi applications to allow customers to participate and unlock the financial utility in dApps. cbBTC holds $2.4 billion in FDV with a volume of $695.95 million Another AI token to feature high on the list is aixbt by Virtuals (AIXBT) with a $603 million trading volume month. Uniswap’s activity contributed to a strong month for Base Uniswap’s increased trading volume in the past couple of months has contributed to Base’s growth and the network’s recent liveliness. The chain carries over 500 decentralized apps, and activity on the tokenless chain expanded to over 2M daily active users this January. Base may have started out as a chain for fun NFT and meme experiments, but it has clearly matured and is now moving forward with DeFi, evidenced by the strong performance of cbBTC. Aerodrome, Morpho Blue, and Uniswap are some of the top apps on Base. Morpho grew after it was promoted as a source for crypto-backed loans. The app allows Coinbase users to borrow against Bitcoin (BTC) collateral. Another factor boosting Base was its integration into Phantom Wallet, which was instrumental to onboarding more new users in the last quarter of 2024. Base carries about $3.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), and the network posted close to $20 billion in volume for the entire month. Still, it remains a fair distance behind Solana, another network that posted record-breaking numbers throughout January. Uniswap first appeared on the scene in November 2018 and quickly gained traction in the decentralized finance space. It was a beneficiary of the bull run that came later in 2021. By that time, Uniswap had processed over 50 million transactions. In 2022, the platform remained steady despite bear market conditions. In 2023, Uniswap processed less than 180 million transactions, but it set a new record by processing over 300 million transactions in 2024.

However, with the nature of memecoins, the market is showing signs of instability. As enthusiasm for Solana memecoins begins to fade, savvy investors are shifting their focus to more promising and sustainable opportunities. Among these, RCO Finance (RCOF) stands out as a rising star, positioning itself as the top crypto investment for the first quarter of 2025. The Bubble of Solana Memecoins: Losing Their Shine Memecoins have long been a favorite in the crypto world, enticing traders with dreams of quick and substantial profits. However, the bubble around these tokens, particularly Solana memecoins , is beginning to deflate. When placed side-by-side with utility-driven projects like RCO Finance (RCOF), the inherent weaknesses tokens become apparent. Solana memecoins have thrived on the sheer force of short-term speculative trading, which has fueled rapid price hikes. Yet, this same reliance on speculation has proven to be a double-edged sword. The lack of real-world applications or intrinsic utility has rendered these tokens highly volatile and increasingly unattractive to serious investors. For many, the allure of these memecoins is fading as their unpredictability and lack of foundational value deter long-term commitment. To make matters worse, Solana memecoins are facing intense competition as newer altcoins enter the market with fresh innovations and practical applications. This influx of projects, like AI altcoins, with tangible value has saturated the market, leaving the Solana memecoins scrambling to retain relevance. Why RCO Finance (RCOF) Is the Safer Bet for Long-Term Gains Amidst the instability brought about by the Solana memecoins, RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a compelling alternative. Positioned at artificial intelligence and decentralized finance (DeFi) intersection, RCO Finance offers AI tools to improve investment strategies. One of the standout features of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, which acts as a personal investment strategist for users. This sophisticated tool analyzes vast amounts of market data in real-time, offering personalized recommendations that align with individual investment goals and risk profiles. Unlike traditional advisors, which may charge hefty fees and require extensive market knowledge, the robo advisor democratizes investing by making it accessible to everyone, from seasoned traders to complete novices. This tool ensures that no trader is left behind due to market fluctuations and instabilities. RCO Finance also excels in providing diverse market access. Investors can explore over 120,000 assets across various classes, including stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate. This extensive range allows users to build robust portfolios to mitigate risk while maximizing returns. Moreover, RCOF introduces a unique opportunity for passive income generation through staking and rewards programs. Users can stake their tokens to earn substantial returns while supporting the platform’s liquidity. This feature not only incentivizes long-term holding but also cultivates a loyal community of investors. RCOF recently unveiled the beta version of its highly anticipated platform, igniting excitement among investors and traders alike. The platform’s innovative features have attracted over 10,000 users, showcasing its potential to disrupt the DeFi space. Building on this momentum, the upcoming alpha launch promises to deliver even more advanced capabilities, which are currently undergoing rigorous testing to ensure a seamless user experience. Security is another cornerstone of RCO Finance’s appeal. The platform undergoes regular audits by SolidProof , ensuring that investor funds are protected against potential threats. This commitment to transparency and security fosters trust among users, further solidifying RCOF’s position as a reliable investment option. Is RCO Finance Worth Investing? The current RCO Finance (RCOF) presale presents an exceptional opportunity for investors eager to get in on the ground floor of this promising project. The presale has already raised over $12.2 million and is on track to reach its target of $13 million by month’s end. Each RCOF token is priced at just $0.10, with projections estimating a potential surge to $0.60 upon listing, a remarkable 700% ROI. Beyond this, analysts predict post-listing growth to exceed $5 per token, equating to over 6,500% ROI, surpassing a significant portion of Solana memecoins in potential returns. Investors participating in the presale secure a stake in an innovative platform and gain access to AI analytics, private syndicate ETF funds, priority customer support, and governance rights. These features underline RCOF’s commitment to enhancing the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. While Solana memecoins have often delivered short-term gains fueled by speculative trading, RCO Finance goes beyond that. It aims to provide investors with both high returns and cutting-edge tools designed to revolutionize the DeFi sector, offering long-term growth and value. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this transformative journey, invest in RCO Finance today, and get access to long-term gains!

At the Plan B conference in San Salvador, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced that the integration of USDT into Bitcoin and Lightning is designed to provide “practical solutions for remittances, payments, and other financial applications that require both speed and reliability.” USDT integration on Bitcoin marks a new era for stablecoins USDT, the company’s dollar-backed stablecoin, will soon be fully operational across both Bitcoin’s base layer and the Lightning Network, a scaling network for Bitcoin, as Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced Thursday at a Bitcoin conference in El Salvador. For Tether and Bitcoin, two powerful cryptocurrency players who had not yet united, the unification represents a critical turning point. With a market valuation of about $140 billion, USDT is by far the most popular stablecoin in the world. It is used by hundreds of millions of people globally as a safe way to connect traditional banking with the cryptocurrency economy. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is by far the world’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency. However, the Bitcoin network has been slow to attract on-chain users, as it was not initially designed to support decentralized applications. Scaling networks like the Lightning Network have filled this gap, making layer-2 transactions on Bitcoin fast and affordable and enabling the integration of assets like USDT into the Bitcoin ecosystem. “Today marks a new era for stablecoins,” said Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, the leading developer of infrastructure on the Lightning Network, in a statement on Thursday. Lightning Labs developed the protocol that enables USDT to integrate with the Bitcoin network. According to Stark, millions of people will now be able to send dollars globally using the most open, secure blockchain. Tether faces increased scrutiny amid growing role in global finance USDT is available on 17 other blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Solana. As cryptocurrency continues integrating with mainstream finance, stablecoins have become more essential than ever in linking both sectors. Tether remains the most widely used stablecoin, providing users an easy way to store crypto funds in a stable asset pegged to the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins, especially Tether, have become increasingly scrutinized as their influence on the global economy grows. On Wednesday, lawmakers questioned Howard Lutnick, President Donald Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary, about his close ties to Tether, a payment method used by retail users and criminal organizations. Lutnick’s Wall Street firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, currently holds billions of dollars in collateral assets for Tether, which theoretically ensures the stablecoin maintains its dollar peg. However, no independent agency has yet verified whether Cantor and Tether are accurately reporting the size of that collateral reserve. During the hearing, Lutnick acknowledged the need for the United States to implement a comprehensive auditing process for stablecoin issuers like Tether, given the growing importance of maintaining the stability of such assets.

Some coins have skyrocketed, while others have taken a backseat. Litecoin, once a promising contender, has seen its potential fade as newer, more innovative projects take the spotlight. If you’re an investor who missed the Litecoin train, you’re probably wondering what’s next—something with that same potential for growth but even more upside. That’s where Qubetics comes into play. Qubetics, a game-changing project that’s still in its presale stage, promises to revolutionize the crypto world in ways Litecoin never could. Its unique approach to real-world asset tokenization and decentralized VPN services has analysts buzzing about its future, predicting massive returns for early investors. While Litecoin has had its moment, the opportunity to get in on Qubetics is still very much alive. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy right now , especially if you missed out on Litecoin. Litecoin: A Missed Opportunity? When it comes to popular crypto coins to buy, Litecoin has been a household name for years. It’s often dubbed “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” and for a good reason. Litecoin has a solid track record of transaction speed, security, and stability. Many saw it as a top alternative to Bitcoin, mainly due to its lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times. However, despite its longevity in the crypto world, Litecoin’s price has remained relatively flat compared to the explosive growth of newer coins. Sure, Litecoin has had its moments of growth, but if you look at its performance over the past few years, it doesn’t have the same hype or wild potential that other coins have been delivering. Analysts are predicting modest gains, with some suggesting that Litecoin could hit around $500 in the future. But let’s be honest—if you’re looking for a big bang, Litecoin isn’t the investment that’s going to make you a crypto millionaire. If you missed Litecoin’s early days, you’re probably wondering where to put your money now. The good news? There’s still time to jump into a top crypto asset with huge growth potential: Qubetics. Qubetics: The Popular Crypto Coin To Buy Now Now, let’s talk about why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy today , especially for those who missed out on Litecoin. Qubetics is currently in its 19th presale stage and has already raised over $11.4 million, with 452 million tokens sold to more than 17,400 holders. Analysts are predicting massive returns for early investors—some even forecast Qubetics’ $TICS token price could skyrocket to $15 after the mainnet launch, giving early investors a 24,630% ROI. What makes Qubetics stand out in a sea of other projects is its innovative use of decentralized privacy solutions and real-world asset tokenization. The Qubetics team is building a platform that can tokenize tangible assets like real estate, luxury goods, and more. This is a game-changer for industries that have been stuck using outdated, inefficient systems. Not to mention, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN is going to give people unprecedented security and freedom in the digital age. The beauty of Qubetics is that it’s not just another coin—it’s solving real-world problems. Imagine a small business looking to raise capital through tokenized assets, or an investor trying to gain access to previously inaccessible markets. Qubetics is providing a solution that could level the playing field and bring the power of blockchain technology to the masses. Real-World Applications: How Qubetics is Changing the Game So, what does Qubetics actually do, and how does it impact real life? Let’s break it down. One of the most exciting features of Qubetics is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This isn’t just a concept—it’s happening now. Qubetics allows businesses, professionals, and individuals to tokenize real-world assets and make them accessible to a global pool of investors. For example, let’s say you’re a small business owner who owns a luxury car dealership. With Qubetics , you can tokenize a portion of your business—turning that equity into a digital asset—and sell it to investors from around the world. This opens up new funding opportunities and allows you to raise capital quickly without the usual bureaucratic red tape. Another scenario: imagine being a property investor who has always wanted to own shares of high-end real estate but has never had the means to do so. With Qubetics, you could purchase tokenized shares of luxury properties and earn returns without the huge upfront costs. And it’s not just businesses that benefit—individuals are going to be able to tokenize their assets, whether that’s through luxury goods or intellectual property, and access a new stream of income. The possibilities are endless. Conclusion: If you missed out on Litecoin, don’t sweat it—you still have an incredible opportunity with Qubetics. With its game-changing technology and massive potential for growth, Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy now for anyone looking to make a big impact on their portfolio. The presale is in its final stages, so now’s the time to hop in before prices explode. The future of crypto is here, and it’s Qubetics—get in while you can. Call to Action: Don’t wait around—head over to Qubetics’ official site and grab your $TICS tokens today. Time is ticking, and the opportunity to secure massive returns is slipping away fast. Make your move now, and don’t miss out on the next big thing in crypto.

The space is rapidly growing, and new projects are constantly emerging with big promises. If you’re looking for a meme coin with real potential, then Arctic Pablo (APC) is one to watch. With exciting features and a presale that’s already making waves, this could be your chance to get in early. In this article, we’ll also take a look at Moo Deng and Trump Meme Coin, two other notable crypto projects, but Arctic Pablo is included in the Best Meme Coins to Join for Long Term due to its promising presale and strategic tokenomics. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins, including Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Trump Meme Coin. Token Burns: The Deflationary Strategy Behind Arctic Pablo’s Growth Arctic Pablo (APC) is taking the world by storm with its innovative token burn mechanism. This feature, integral to the project’s strategy, ensures that unsold tokens are permanently eliminated weekly throughout the presale. The burn doesn’t stop there; after the presale, any remaining tokens will also be burned, creating a deflationary environment that boosts scarcity and value. This approach is designed to enhance the long-term potential of the project and increase the value of the remaining tokens over time. Transactions related to token burns are tracked and recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust in the process. This scarcity-driven model ensures that Arctic Pablo remains one of the most exciting meme coin projects, with the potential for significant returns. As more tokens are burned, the remaining supply becomes even more valuable—perfect for early investors looking for a long-term hold. Why You Shouldn’t Miss Out on Arctic Pablo’s Presale Arctic Pablo has reached the Glacier Grove phase of its presale, and it’s generating a lot of buzz. The current price is just $0.000043 per token, offering early investors a chance to secure their position at an incredibly low entry price. As Arctic Pablo continues its journey through various stages, the price will rise, making it harder to get in at these early levels. With over $700,000 raised and the presale moving forward, investors are already looking at a potential ROI of over 18,546% from the seventh stage, Glacier Grove, to the launch price of $0.008. Arctic Pablo finished exploring the El-Dorado stage in under 3 days and exceeded expectations by completing all six initial locations faster than anticipated. Now, as the price continues to climb, there’s no better time to get in before the next surge. Arctic Pablo has proven its momentum, and with such a strong presale performance, there’s little doubt that this project is one of the best meme coins to join for long term growth. If you’re ready to be part of something big, the Glacier Grove phase offers an exceptional opportunity to buy in at a low price before the final price hike. Moo Deng: The Latest Developments and Market Success Moo Deng (MOODENG) has been gaining significant attention in the meme coin world. Currently priced at $0.10336 per coin, Moo Deng has a market cap of USD 102.32 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of USD 77.44 million. The project continues to make strides, and its growing presence in the market suggests a promising future. Moo Deng’s performance highlights its appeal among investors looking for potential growth and innovation within the meme coin sector. Whether it’s its community or unique features, Moo Deng remains a key player in the crypto space. Trump Meme Coin: Standing Strong Among Top Meme Coins Trump Meme Coin currently has a market cap of over USD 5.5 billion. This impressive figure speaks volumes about the growing popularity and strength of the project. Investors are taking notice, and the coin continues to make waves with its large following and innovative initiatives. The project has shown significant growth since its inception, cementing its place as one of the most recognized meme coins in the market today. If you’re looking for an established meme coin with strong support, Trump Meme Coin remains a solid choice. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Should Be on Your Radar All three of these meme coins—Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Trump Meme Coin—have their unique selling points, but Arctic Pablo stands out among top meme coins for long term growth. With an innovative token burn mechanism, a presale that has already raised over $700,000, and the potential for massive ROI, Arctic Pablo presents an exciting opportunity for early investors. The presale, currently at the Glacier Grove phase, is the perfect entry point, offering one of the best meme coins to join for long-term success. Don’t miss your chance to be part of Arctic Pablo’s rise—get in now while prices are still low!

Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev was speaking at a meeting of the Legislative Assembly of the Irkutsk Region, which was aired on the region’s VK channel . The Governor said he would ask Moscow to extend its wintertime mining ban in the south of the region. However, not everyone in Kobzev’s government appears to be on board with such a ban. Some fear it could drive mining firms out of the region once and for all. Russian Bitcoin Mining Hotspot Government Divided on Ban Call Many industrial players remain in the areas, despite a recent decree ordering them to power down their rigs in the winter months. A notable historical building in Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: Fanzuga [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The ban came into force on January 1. And Kobzev said the policy has already demonstrated results. The Governor said it has already “freed up about 300 MW of energy capacity.” However, he said, electricity shortages remain acute in the Angara region. He called for an end to mining “in energy-deficient regions” until work was completed on new housing and state construction projects had been completed. But Kobzev conceded that not everyone in the Irkutsk government agreed on the move. Before Russia’s Bitcoin mining boom, the area struggled to attract investors. Mining has revitalized the local economy. And with Moscow set to launch crypto mining taxes later this year, forcing miners out of the area could prove a costly decision. Russia appears to have overcome for now a deficit of yuan that led to a spike in short-term borrowing costs after the US threatened to penalize lenders for processing cross-border payments https://t.co/a0DKQ1n9nL — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) January 30, 2025 “We know that the restrictions in the southern part of the region have caused a mixed reaction. We know that there are opponents to further restrictions. However, we are confident that these measures are necessary. They will ensure the sustainable development of the region.” Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev Kobzev added that he was “confident that we will go further together.” He said: “We will obtain a year-round ban on mining in energy-deficient areas of the Irkutsk region until 2031.” The River Angara in Russia. (Source: Octagon [CC BY 3.0]) North Excempt from Ban Crypto miners continue to operate in Northern Irkutsk. And Kobzev appeared keen to let them continue doing so. At the same meeting, he ordered the creation of a “commission to determine to what extent the new federal rules” would “allow for an increase in tax returns from miners’ activities in the north.” This commission, he added, would present its findings “at the federal level,” with talks about tax rates still ongoing in Moscow. The Kremlin expressed its condolences to the families of Russian citizens who lost their lives in the American Airlines plane crash in Washington https://t.co/4iJxBExA3D — Reuters (@Reuters) January 30, 2025 Perfect Package for Miners Irkutsk, in Siberia, offers miners a seemingly perfect package of incentives: Real estate prices and rental fees are low, energy costs are similarly low, and winters are famously long. However, Irkutsk’s fame as a Bitcoin mining destination means that it has also attracted scores of “grey” miners. Many of these, Siberian power firms claim, use illegal connections to the grid to avoid detection from the authorities. The regional ban decree runs until 2031, but – at present – will allow miners to turn their rigs on again in spring this year. Should Irkutsk’s Governor get his way, scores of other regions look ready to vie to become Russia’s newest Bitcoin mining hotspot.

As a result, a Dogecoin millionaire picks a low cap AI altcoin as the best choice for life-changing gain in the 2025 bull market. In this text, we will analyze the Dogecoin millionaire view on this low cap altcoin and know why it is the best choice for 2025 gains. Which Low-Cap Altcoin Is the Dogecoin Millionaire’s Choice and Why This Dogecoin millionaire made a massive profit in 2021 when Dogecoin (DOGE) had an explosive upward trajectory. According to the crypto millionaire, joining a high-potential, low-cap altcoin early is the key to unlocking life-changing gains in the crypto market. Therefore, the Dogecoin millionaire believes PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a decentralized real estate marketplace that aims to reshape the $300 trillion sector, is the best altcoin choice for gains. The project is set to integrate AI, the Metaverse, and blockchain into the real estate industry. PropiChain has been gaining traction in the RWA sector and witnessing early success one instance is the CoinMarketCap listing which increases the visibility of the project. The project is currently in the second round of its token presale and it is going for $0.011 which is the lowest entry price anyone will get because it will be higher in the third round. Also, BlockAudit reviewed the project , and their report shows that the security of users’ assets is a top priority for the platform. This news further indicates the authenticity of the project and the high desire to protect investors from fraudulent activities that might lead to the loss of their assets. Hereunder, we will discuss in detail how the core features of PropiChain platform will revolutionize real estate and what investors stand to benefit. How PropiChain Will Transform Real Estate Investment Landscape PropiChain goes beyond the typical AI altcoin offering a comprehensive solution that is aimed at resolving traditional real estate investment hurdles and tapping into new avenues of opportunity. We will discuss in detail how this project will transform real estate. Fractional Ownership for Better Asset Acquisition Model The conventional real estate market is known for its high entry costs, which serve as a barrier for most people except wealthy investors. Therefore, PropiChain aims to eradicate this barrier by introducing a fractional ownership model for easier asset acquisition. This is a model that will enable users of PropiChain to own shares of valuable properties based on their financial capability. Returns from these properties will be shared proportionally among the shareholders of the assets. This model can be used to own a percentage in any set from any location on the globe with a capital of $100. Aside from democratizing access to the multi-trillion dollar sector, this approach will benefit sellers globally by addressing liquidity issues as it will enable faster sales compared to the traditional market. Empowering Investors with AI-Powered Real Estate Investment PropiChain leverages AI to help investors on the platform with practical insights. With the AI’s capability to analyze vast data, it could help investors pinpoint high potential areas to invest in. The AI will use data on trends, price fluctuations, demand for specific assets and so on to locate undervalued assets and give insights to users. First time real estate investors won’t need to spend extra money to hire brokers because PCHAIN’s AI can serve as a virtual assistant that will guide them on real investment. Also, both existing and new investors can use the AI chatbot as a legal adviser that will help them understand legal terms in real estate contracts before making a commitment. Also, PropiChain AI introduces an advanced method for filtering properties that will enable users to find assets that align with their investment objectives. For instance, users can search for assets with a potential returns filter and choose the one that fits their objective. Real Estate Without Borders With the Help of the Metaverse PropiChain integrated the interactive environment of the Metaverse to enable leasing spaces for digital events, showcasing assets for potential buyers, holding meetings, and remote inspections. With the help of the Metaverse, international investors will be able to participate actively in the real estate market of several continents without traveling. This innovative approach will break down the geographical barrier that is currently in the conventional real estate market. Therefore, owning assets globally will now be easy and at a cheaper cost. Conclusion The Dogecoin millionaire states that PropiChain , being an AI altcoin, is a major factor that will aid its surge. AI-meta is the hottest narrative in the crypto market at the moment, and PCHAIN aims to bring unique AI offerings to RWA via its platform. Experts are convinced it could deliver a staggering 35780% ROI in Q1 of 2025. The current token presale round, which is going for $0.011, is the best price for early investors to join before the anticipated price surge. An investment of $1000 in this round could potentially yield more than $350,000 in Q1 of 2025. Dogecoin was the success story of a lot of early investors in 2021, PropiChain is presenting another opportunity and its utility in the real estate means it can replicate and outperform Dogecoin’s 2021 run. Join now to stay ahead of market trends and optimize returns with PropiChain’s AI-powered platform.

The approval, granted on an “accelerated basis” on Thursday, allows the fund to track both spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) based on their market capitalization. This approval marks a major shift in the regulatory landscape under the Trump administration, as several firms have recently sought to list new crypto products with the SEC. Bitwise’s ETF, launched in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is designed to provide easier access to Bitcoin and Ethereum for mainstream investors. The NYSE Arca filed the necessary paperwork for the ETF in November 2024. “In particular, the Commission finds that the Proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Exchange’s rules be designed to ‘prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and, ‘in general, to protect investors and the public interest,” the agency said. It added, “The Commission finds that the Proposal, as with other ETPs that the commission has approved, is reasonably designed to promote fair disclosure of information that may be necessary to price the Shares appropriately, to prevent trading when a reasonable degree of transparency cannot be assured, to safeguard material non-public information relating to the Trust’s portfolio, and to ensure fair and orderly markets for the Shares.” This approval follows a series of changes in the SEC’s stance on crypto products, including the previous hesitance of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve Bitcoin ETF trading, which only occurred after a court ruling.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 03:06:25

Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF aims to provide investors with exposure to both digital assets, weighted by their respective market capitalizations. The fund’s structure will be similar to existing ETFs that directly hold either Bitcoin or Ether. The SEC has approved the fund’s 19b-4 filing, an essential step in the approval process. However, Bitwise still requires the SEC’s clearance for its S-1 registration application, which is necessary before trading can commence. Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF The “Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF” will offer exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in a single fund, weighted by their relative market capitalizations—83% BTC and 17% ETH as of the filing date. The ETF will determine market capitalisation by multiplying pricing benchmarks by circulating supply, according to the filing. Approval comes less than two weeks after a crypto-friendly acting chair took over the SEC. Commissioner Mark Uyeda took over as acting head of the SEC while the agency awaits Senate confirmation of President Donald Trump’s nominee for the permanent role, Paul Atkins. Bitwise Investment Advisers will manage the fund, with Coinbase providing custody and Bank of New York Mellon serving as the cash custodian, administrator, and transfer agent. Crypto ETFs boom after Trump’s return Bitwise submitted the application for the dual crypto ETF in November, shortly after the US presidential election. The election saw Donald Trump, who has expressed a more favorable stance toward the cryptocurrency industry, return to office. The administration has pledged to introduce supportive regulations to position the US as a leading hub for digital assets. The SEC has received increasing numbers of ETF proposals from investment firms seeking to expand the range of crypto-based financial products. Bloomberg analyst Nathan Dean noted that issuers are “probing the SEC’s boundaries,” with some firms even filing applications for ETFs based on meme coins. Bitwise has proposed an ETF tracking Dogecoin , a cryptocurrency known for its volatile price movements influenced by social media trends. Additionally, the SEC has received applications for ETFs tracking assets like XRP , Solana, and Litecoin, which claim to offer various forms of utility beyond speculation. The launch of US-based Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 was met with strong investor interest. The group of ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin—including one from Bitwise—has accumulated more than $121 billion in total assets. Ether-based ETFs followed later, with more than $11 billion in assets under management so far. The strong demand for these products reflects the growing role of cryptocurrencies in investment portfolios, despite ongoing debates over their classification and long-term value proposition.

Well, right now, the crypto market is buzzing with exciting opportunities, and one presale is turning heads among the top meme coin presales to buy now— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . While Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) and Mog Coin (MOG) are making moves in the meme coin space, BTFD Coin has just pulled a massive power play: burning unsold tokens from Stage 13 and dropping a mind-blowing 100% bonus offer for Stage 14 investors. Yes, you heard that right—double your tokens instantly with the LAUNCH100 code! With its P2E game now fully live, 90% APY staking, and a bullish community, BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a revolution. Considering the presale started at just $0.000004 and will launch at $0.0006, investors are staring at a 550% ROI with the bonus included. Meanwhile, MEW is navigating a volatile market, and MOG is experiencing a pullback after its December pump. Let’s have a look. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That’s Breaking Records Ever seen a presale jump straight to the next stage and burn unsold tokens? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin just did! With Stage 14 now live at $0.00016, every investor can double their BTFD stack using the LAUNCH100 bonus code. Here’s why this meme coin is dominating the market: The BTFD Coin presale is on fire, raising over $5.82 million with 9,900+ Bulls already on board and 68+ billion BTFD tokens sold. Investors are securing BTFD at just $0.00016, with a launch price set at $0.0006, promising a 275% ROI—or a massive 550% with the LAUNCH100 bonus code. Don’t miss out on one of the top meme coin presales to buy now! If you throw down $8,000 in Stage 14, you’re bagging 50 million BTFD tokens. But if you enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code, that doubles to 100 million tokens! At launch, that’s a $60,000+ valuation. This isn’t just a presale—it’s a goldmine for early adopters. The P2E Game That’s Changing the Meme Coin Scene Forget about meme coins with no utility— BTFD Coin’s P2E game is fully live, and users can earn rewards while playing. Since its full launch on January 1, 2025, gamers have been stacking BTFD just by leveling up. Unlike the beta version, which didn’t reward players, the full version pays out actual tokens—meaning playtime equals profit. The game is already buzzing in crypto gaming circles, and with the Bulls Squad leading the charge, this isn’t just another play-to-earn gimmick. It’s the future of interactive crypto investments. 90% APY Staking & Referral Program – Passive Income on Autopilot Why just hold when you can stake your BTFD for a 90% APY return? Since staking went live on December 2, 2024, early investors have been multiplying their holdings passively. Plus, the BTFD Referral Program lets you earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD if your code is used. If your referral spends $500, they get 10% extra BTFD, and you get 10% of their purchase amount. The top 20 referrers each month cash out big. It’s a win-win for Bulls! Claim the 100% Bonus Before it Ends! Ready to double your tokens?

Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) – A Meme Coin with Market Momentum MEW, a Solana-based feline challenger to dog-themed meme coins, is currently trading at $0.00438, with recent price swings between $0.00412 and $0.00446. With a total circulating supply of 88.89 billion tokens, it’s been making noise in the meme coin space. A recent highlight for MEW is its recognition as one of the top meme coins to watch. Plus, it’s collaborating with Locus Animation Studios to co-produce a 3D animated series, expanding its presence beyond crypto into mainstream media. Despite these moves, MEW has seen some market dips, so investors are closely watching whether it rebounds or continues consolidating. Mog Coin (MOG) – Facing a Correction After a Monster Pump MOG had a massive December, shooting up to $0.000004022 and crossing the $1 billion market cap mark after a 30% surge. This was largely driven by its Coinbase listing roadmap announcement on December 3, 2024, which triggered a 20% price boost. However, MOG is currently experiencing a correction, trading at $0.00000114 after dropping 32.4% in a week. Analysts are watching key support at $0.00000170 and resistance at $0.00000200 to see if it rebounds or dips further. With its market volatility, MOG is still a big name in the meme coin world, but the excitement seems to have cooled off for now. Final Thoughts Based on market trends, presale performance, and real utility, BTFD Coin stands out as the top meme coin presale to buy now . While MEW and MOG are making moves, they don’t have the insane 100% bonus offer, a fully launched P2E game, and 90% staking rewards that BTFD is offering right now. With a 550% ROI potential (including the bonus), staking, gaming rewards, and a massive community, this is a no-brainer for crypto investors looking for the next big thing. The LAUNCH100 bonus code won’t last forever, so if you want to double your investment before the presale ends, now’s the time to move. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and secure your spot before it’s too late!

Given Bitcoin’s resilience, analysts are now predicting a new BTC all-time high (ATH) in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Defies DeepSeek Sell-Off, FOMC Uncertainty Earlier this week, US stocks took a hit after Chinese AI firm DeepSeek unveiled its open-source LLM, raising concerns over the high market valuation of its American counterparts. As a result, the S&P 500 saw a strong sell-off, with NVIDIA leading the losses, dropping 16% in a single day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid NASDAQ Decline, Analyst Calls It ‘Extremely Bullish’ Similarly, in its latest meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left interest rates unchanged, in line with market expectations. While the hawkish stance was expected to deal another blow to crypto markets, BTC remained relatively unscathed after an initial dip. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,839, having essentially recouped all its losses from the DeepSeek-induced market crash. In fact, BTC has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five days, surging 1.53%, compared to the latter’s 1.25% decline. New BTC ATH In February? Seasoned crypto trader Pentoshi commented on BTC’s strength, saying that the digital asset has held up well despite the turmoil. The trader added that they see no reason why BTC shouldn’t hit a new ATH soon. Another Bitcoin enthusiast, Castillo Trading, noted that Bitcoin’s price structure “looks flawless.” They added that both lower- and higher-time frames suggest that BTC will likely go higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Target $145,000 To $249,000 Under Trump Administration: Report In a similar vein, crypto trader and entrepreneur Michael van de Poppe said that the market will likely see a new BTC ATH in the ‘coming weeks,’ potentially hinting at February as the target month. Further, crypto trader Roman shared the following chart, commenting that “Stoch & RSI have plenty of room to break $108,000 resistance and head higher.” They added that bullish divergence on BTC is also playing out nicely. For the uninitiated, both Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) and Relative-Strength Index (RSI) are momentum indicators that help traders identify whether the underlying asset is oversold or overbought in current market conditions. While projections for a new BTC ATH may be focused on the short-term, market cycle peaks are expected to occur in the summer of 2025. For instance, a recent report by Bitfinex forecasts that BTC could surge to $200,000 by mid-2025, amid shallow price pullbacks. Meanwhile DeepSeek predicts that BTC may top out between $500,000 and $600,000 by Q1 2026. At press time, BTC trades at $105,839, up 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

With two lawsuits in motion and fraud allegations flying, is this meme coin casino finally running out of luck? Pump.fun, a platform notorious for launching meme coins on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain, is now facing a second class-action lawsuit just days after the first. The legal battle, led by Burwick Law and Wolf Popper LLP, alleges that the platform is violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered securities disguised as meme tokens. **LAWSUIT ALERT** Burwick Law and @WolfPopperLLP have filed a second federal class action lawsuit on behalf of investors against the PumpdotFun platform. Full complaint available below. — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) January 30, 2025 The latest lawsuit, filed on Jan. 30 in the Southern District of New York, names multiple defendants, including Baton Corporation Ltd (operating as Pump.fun) and key figures Alon Cohen, Dylan Kerler, and Noah Bernhard Hugo Tweedale. According to court filings, plaintiff Diego Aguilar claims he suffered financial losses after purchasing several tokens on the platform, including the Fwog ( FWOG ) token, and the Griffain ( GRIFFAIN ) token. These tokens, aggressively marketed with meme culture and promises of exponential returns, allegedly led to significant losses despite reaching high valuations—such as the FWOG Token, which Pump.fun promoted as having hit a $500 million market cap. This lawsuit follows an earlier case filed on Jan. 16 by Burwick Law on behalf of Kendall Carnahan, targeting the sale of the Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ) Token. **LEGAL ACTION ALERT: PUMPDOTFUN** Burwick Law is pursuing legal action on behalf of investors in pumpdotfun memecoins. If you lost money on any pumpdotfun memecoins, you may be entitled to compensation. Read more below. — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) January 15, 2025 The complaint argues that Pump.fun operates by collaborating with influencers to co-issue and market unregistered securities. The lawsuit also alleges that the platform’s business model represents an evolved form of Ponzi and pump-and-dump schemes, extracting nearly half a billion dollars in fees from investors. Burwick Law’s legal campaign against Pump.fun comes as no surprise. On Jan. 15, Max Burwick, the firm’s founder and partner, openly criticized platforms like Pump.fun, calling them “the ultimate evolution of multi-level marketing scams, preying on human desperation and the digital attention economy.” With impending legal announcements, I want to make my personal position on the exploitation of memecoins widely available. Read it below. Please feel free to share! pic.twitter.com/adndcQNRxH — Max Burwick (@burwick_max) January 15, 2025 That same day, his firm urged investors who lost money to memecoins through rug pulls and misleading promises to come forward, later launching a dedicated website to assist affected clients. Beyond legal troubles, Pump.fun has also faced controversy over its platform features. In November 2024, it introduced a livestream function to boost user engagement. However, reports quickly emerged of users misusing the feature to broadcast disturbing and explicit content, including violent material and graphic footage involving minors and animals. The backlash forced Pump.fun to shut down the feature following widespread condemnation from the crypto community. Despite mounting legal and reputational challenges, Pump.fun continues to generate massive revenue. As of Jan. 31, data from Dune Analytics indicates that the platform’s total earnings are nearing $500 million, with nearly $47 million in revenue collected in the past week alone.",News|Lawsuit|Meme Coin|Solana,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|SOL|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-31 03:33:50

According to Bloomberg, they have met with lawyers and figures connected to Trump’s circle to explore their options. Bankman-Fried, who is also appealing his conviction, argues that his sentence is excessive, especially considering that most FTX customers have managed to recover their funds. This push for clemency follows a trend set by Trump’s previous pardons, including that of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road marketplace. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 for running an online platform Silk Road that facilitated over $200 million in illegal transactions. Trump granted Ulbricht a pardon, citing his libertarian views and the belief that his sentence was excessive. This move has sparked growing support for Ulbricht, particularly within libertarian circles. While Bankman-Fried’s case lacks broad public support, his legal team is pushing for a pardon by leveraging Trump’s history of granting clemency, which has often been based on informal appeals rather than traditional Justice Department channels. Bankman-Fried is not alone in his pursuit; Ryan Salame, another former FTX executive, is also reportedly exploring similar efforts for a pardon. As Trump’s administration has been more open to considering clemency for controversial cases, including Ulbricht’s, the push for a pardon signals a shift in the broader landscape of white-collar criminal justice. However, no formal outreach to the White House regarding Bankman-Fried’s case has been confirmed as of now.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 03:40:21

After a period of consolidation, the chart hints at a solid bullish setup t hat has been building in recent days and weeks. The market’s reaction to these support zones suggests the potential for a positive price move ahead. At the time of writing, XRP is trading below $3.10 and is down by more than one percent in the last 24 hours. Current Price Action and Support Levels After a pullback in mid-January, XRP dipped into a support area between $2.52 and $2.68. While the market didn’t immediately breakout upwards, this range remains crucial for determining the next move. As long as the price stays above this support zone, it suggests the market is respecting the current parameters, and a rebound could occur. Key Price Levels to Watch To confirm that the low has been established and wave two is complete, XRP needs to hold its current low (around $2.65). If this level holds, XRP can expect the market to potentially rally towards the $4.20–$5 range. It’s important to note that wave two is a corrective pullback, and experts anticipate a trend continuation after this phase. Critical Breakout Levels For a strong confirmation that the upward trend is resuming, XRP needs to break key resistance levels. The first hurdle is a break above $3.21, followed by a move above $3.40. Until these levels are surpassed, the market remains in a range, and a retest of the support zone between $2.76 and $2.97 is still possible. If XRP breaks below $2.76, it could see a larger corrective structure unfold, possibly pushing the price toward $2.52 again.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 04:39:34

Regulators and industry players advocate for the importance of regulation, but we face the stark reality – i t’s nearly impossible to implement effective oversight in this space. Meanwhile, stolen funds continue to be laundered through DeFi tools . How do we balance decentralization with legal obligations? Using oracles becomes an effective solution. Why traditional AML fails in DeFi – security and limitations of smart contracts Traditional AML policies struggle to adapt to the DeFi ecosystem because of a significant limitation. Smart contracts can’t make decisions that require external information, such as passing AML checks. These contracts are limited to the data available on the blockchain they run on. They cannot directly access data from other blockchains or external sources, such as websites or APIs. This is because smart contracts are executed by blockchain nodes, which do not have built-in internet connectivity and can only connect to their own blockchain. This design is intentional to preserve the security and decentralization of the blockchain. Blockchain consensus requires that all data used in a transaction must be recorded on the blockchain before the transaction can be executed. This ensures that the network operates in a trustless and secure manner, with all nodes agreeing on the same information. If smart contracts could connect to the internet, they would introduce security and operational risks. External data – like from websites or APIs – d oesn’t follow blockchain rules, making it possible for manipulated or false data to be fed into the system. Oracles bring additional information to DeFi apps This is where DeFi oracles play a key role. Oracles allow DeFi applications to bring in external data to the blockchain, enabling blockchain transactions to achieve consensus with this off-chain information. This information can include data from an AML platform, such as KYC (know your customer)/KYB (know your business) information, watchlists, blacklists, sanctions lists, transaction monitoring and transaction screening/filtering. The diagram below depicts how the AML oracle for DeFi works. How the DeFi compliance oracle works 1. User interacts with DeFi service Users engage with the DeFi service to perform common financial actions such as depositing, withdrawing, swapping, lending or staking assets. Before processing the transaction, the DeFi service must ensure the transaction complies with AML regulations. 2. DeFi service request to the AML oracle When a user initiates a transaction, the DeFi service requests an AML check for the user’s address and the associated data. The DeFi service communicates with the AML oracle smart contract, asking for the KYC/KYB assessment result and a transaction risk rating or address risk rating. 3. External AML provider monitors the AML oracle requests The external AML provider continuously monitors the AML oracle smart contract for incoming requests from DeFi services. Once the external AML provider detects a request, it begins the AML check based on the specific details provided in the request. 4. External AML provider screens blockchain and off-chain data The external AML provider conducts the AML check by analyzing both on-chain and off-chain data. On-chain data – such as transaction history, wallet addresses and other relevant blockchain activities Off-chain data, including sanction lists, watchlists and internet or deep web sources that contain information about suspicious addresses KYC/KYB data provided by users and linked to their corresponding blockchain addresses 5. AML provider responds After completing the check, the external AML provider writes the result to the blockchain and provides a reference to this data for the AML oracle smart contract. The result typically includes a pass/fail status and a link to more detailed data stored by the AML provider for audit purposes (to save on costly blockchain space). 6. DeFi service acts based on the AML check result Once the AML check result is available on the blockchain, the DeFi service automatically takes action based on its smart contract rules. If the user passes the AML check, the DeFi service proceeds with the transaction (deposit, withdrawal, swap, lending, staking, etc.). If the AML check fails or raises concerns, the DeFi service may halt the transaction or freeze the user’s funds. All of these steps occur as part of an atomic transaction In blockchain, an atomic transaction means that either all the steps in the process succeed or none of them do. This guarantees that no partial or inconsistent state is left, ensuring the integrity and security of the transaction. For example, if a user’s address appears on a sanctions list, the swap transaction would be automatically canceled by the blockchain’s rules – without any need for human intervention. This eliminates the risk of system failure or human error from a compliance officer. To sum up DeFi systems have the potential to integrate effective AML solutions. Achieving this goal will likely require time and effort. So far, oracles can be considered a universal technical solution for AML embodiment in DeFi.

As the PCE inflation data looms for Friday, traders and investors appear to be uncertain about the market’s performance ahead. Simultaneously, BTC traded near the $104K level as of press time, whereas leading altcoins illustrated mixed price actions. Here’s a brief overview encompassing some of the most trending coins for the day and how they are performing intraday. Crypto Market Today Reflects Uncertainty Ahead Of PCE Inflation Data The broader market eagerly awaits the December U.S PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation data, which is set to be released on January 31. Notably, this data remains much eyed by investors as it could pave the way for interest rate changes by the next FOMC. As a result, market participants are uncertain about future performances. In turn, even the global crypto market cap stagnated around the $3.5 trillion mark. Besides, the global market volume plunged by 16% intraday, reaching $105.07 billion. So, let’s delve deeper into the coins’ prices today. Bitcoin Price Briefly Touches $106K BTC price is currently trading at $104,331, down nearly 1% from yesterday. However, the coin briefly touched the $106K mark in its intraday movement while also reaching a low of $103,962. Notably, the volatile price action comes against the backdrop of looming U.S. PCE inflation data. Also, the flagship crypto’s futures OI dropped nearly 2% to $64.91 billion on Friday. Ethereum Price Fluxes Amid Broader Crypto Market Turbulence ETH price saw a marginal 0.5% jump in value over the past day, reaching $3,227. The coin’s 24-hour bottom and peak were $3,179.45 and $3,282.99, respectively. While the coin faces turbulence in tandem with the broader market trend, renowned analyst Ali Martinez spotlighted a highly bullish metric for Ethereum. Intriguingly, whales have heavily purchased the crypto amid its recent price dip, accumulating nearly 100,000 ETH. This massive accumulation underscores rising market confidence in the asset, signaling that potential gains are imminent. Source: Ali Charts, X XRP Price Slips XRP price slipped by nearly 1% in the past 24 hours and is currently resting at $3.09. The coin’s intraday low and high were $3.08 and $3.15, respectively. It’s noteworthy that the asset has consolidated around the $3 mark for quite some time, signaling that a potential breakout looms. Solana Price Today SOL price fell by nearly 2% in the past 24 hours, reaching $235 at the time of reporting. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $235.39 and $244.33, respectively. Solana currently mirrors volatility in sync with the broader market trend. How Is The Meme Coin Market Performing? Simultaneously, Dogecoin (DOGE) price witnessed a 1% dip in value, reaching 0.3272. Further, even Shiba Inu (SHIB) price witnessed a marginal 0.3% decrease in value intraday, reaching $0.00001855. PEPE and TRUMP mimicked the broader sector’s action, exchanging hands at $0.0000128 and $25.49, respectively.

Nevertheless, market expert Michaël van de Poppe has posted on X , sparking some optimism over future movements. “I don’t think we’ll see nothing from the FED this year,” Michaël stated. Further, he added that there could be “multiple rate cuts ahead, a weaker Dollar and a strong bull run in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Altcoins and commodities.” The post Crypto Market Today Jan 31: BTC & Altcoins Turbulent Ahead Of US PCE Data appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News|Bitcoin News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Crypto price today|Ethereum (ETH)|PCE inflation|Solana (SOL)|XRP,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-01-31 04:47:30

Traditional convertible bonds are equity plays with low coupons, but iShares Convertible Bond ETF's performance is heavily influenced by bitcoin prices. The ETF has a high technology sector exposure and political risk through holdings in Alibaba and JD. ICVT offers lower volatility but may underperform if bitcoin prices do not rally, given its holdings in MSTR 0% coupon bonds. Thesis When buying into a convertible securities fund, an investor is usually subject to equity and rates risk factors. The iShares Convertible Bond ETF ( ICVT ) is a bit more complex than that. The fund's stated objective is: The iShares Convertible Bond ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. dollar-denominated convertible securities, specifically cash pay bonds, with outstanding issue sizes greater than $250 million . With the equity market rally in the past year and lower Fed Funds from the central bank, ICVT has done well in the past year, being up almost +13%. However, an investor looking at this name should dig a bit deeper into the details and understand the true risk factors at play. In today's article, we are going to look at the fund holdings and its structuring, and articulate why retail investors need to understand that bitcoin prices play a large role in ICVT's performance, a fact not understood by many. Traditional converts are an equity play usually Going back to the basics, we have to highlight that traditional convertible bonds are mostly an equity play via their very low coupons and convertibles features: Convertible bonds are a type of corporate debt security that can be exchanged for a set number of shares in the issuing company. They are a combination of stocks and bonds, and can be a good way to diversify risk Rates are a secondary risk factor here, with lower rates helping converts funds via the discount factor and valuation. When digging into ICVT though, a third factor emerges: Top Holdings (Fund Website) The largest holding in the fund is a converts issuance from MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), a company considered by many as a leveraged bet on bitcoin. Also, kindly note that Coinbase Global ( COIN ) is also represented in the top names, COIN being also very closely correlated with bitcoin prices. Please note that the 4.4% weighting above for MSTR converts is across a number of issuances, not just one bond: MSTR Holdings (Holdings) There are bonds with a 2027, 2028, 2029 and 2030 maturity here. Let us take an example and do a deeper dive. Large Bitcoin exposure via MSTR and COIN Let us look at the 0% coupon 2029 notes. You can find the announcement for the offering here : The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 1.4872 shares of MicroStrategy's class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $672.40 per share. The initial conversion price of the notes represents a premium of approximately 55% over the U.S. composite volume weighted average price of MicroStrategy's class A common stock from 1:30 p.m. through 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 19, 2024, which was $433.7997. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. We have already established that the debt pays 0% coupon. Now, if we look at the terms for the conversion, we will see the initial conversion price of $672/share. Today, MSTR is trading at $346/share, therefore below the price of the company when it placed the debt. Kindly note the close correlation between MSTR and bitcoin. If bitcoin fails to rally from here until maturity date, the conversion feature will not be attractive, thus leaving investors getting just their principal back and nothing else. MSTR is not an operating company that makes widgets. MSTR is a financial entity that raises capital and purchases bitcoin with said cash. Converts are a more conservative way to bet on bitcoin since they represent debt, and debt has to be repaid in a principal format if the conversion price does not make sense. However, investors need to understand that the upside here for ICVT in its MSTR position lies squarely with bitcoin prices. COIN is a similar story, but COIN is less volatile and leveraged: Data by YCharts If we plot COIN, MSTR and bitcoin on the same graph (we are using the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF - IBIT as a bitcoin proxy) we can see the almost one for one correlation between COIN and bitcoin, while MSTR is very leveraged. Technology exposure The fund has a high exposure to the technology sector, a sleeve where COIN and MSTR reside: Sectors (Fund Website) We have just shown you how in fact MSTR and COIN converts are bitcoin plays. The rest of the holdings are more traditional tech companies, but the fund does hold political risk exposure as well via its Alibaba ( BABA ) and JD ( JD ) holdings. Historic performance Converts do not have the full equity delta of an equities only fund, thus lag indices over longer periods of time: Data by YCharts We can see the fund outperforming only during the zero rates environment that characterized 2020/2021 which helped both the equity and bond component. In a higher rates environment like today's funds like ICVT tend to lag indices. On the flip side, they also have a lower volatility due to their composition. Unless the underlying company defaults, the ETF will get the principal back on the convert. This translates into a 3-year standard deviation of 12%, much lower than the 18% one on the S&P 500 index. Conclusion ICVT is a convertibles bond ETF. The name tends to do best when equities rally and rates move lower. The fund comes with a lower volatility of as measured by its 12% 3-year standard deviation, but currently contains a large exposure to bitcoin related companies. The article shows how MSTR and COIN are bitcoin plays, and the ETF contains 5% of exposure to the names combined. If bitcoin fails to rally significantly from here, these bonds will not generate much of a return, especially since a large proportion have a 0% coupon. Retail investors looking at the ETF need to fully understand the risk drivers behind this fund.",MSTR|COIN|ICVT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-31 04:59:14

The asset has surged over 5% in the past day, pushing its market capitalization and daily trading volume higher. This recent movement has narrowed the gap between Ethereum’s current price and its all-time high to just 33%, giving investors reasons to pay closer attention. Various analysts have weighed in on the potential implications of this price action, offering a mix of short- and long-term outlooks. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Prolonged Consolidation: What Is Really Going On? Analyst Weighs In Analysts Discuss Key Levels and Future Targets Elite, a well-known crypto analyst, pointed out that Ethereum’s resilience came in the face of “hawkish signals” from the Federal Reserve. The analyst wrote: Despite the Fed’s hawkish signals yesterday, ETH broke past the $3,200 mark, showing impressive resilience. But that’s not all—on-chain activity is soaring. According to IntoTheBlock data, active Ethereum addresses have increased by 37% over the last few months, reaching 670,000—significantly surpassing the 400,000 level seen in early 2024. This sharp rise in network activity is viewed by some as an indication of growing demand and renewed bullish momentum as the new year unfolds. Several other analysts have also shared their perspectives on Ethereum’s price trajectory. WorldofCharts highlighted the cryptocurrency’s consolidation within a tight range, forming a bullish pennant. He suggested that a successful breakout from this pattern could propel Ethereum toward the $4,000 resistance area. This ascending triangle level, previously outlined in his analysis, may serve as a critical milestone for the asset’s upward trajectory. $Eth #Eth Consolidating Within Tight Range Of Bullish Pennant, Expecting Upside Breakout Soon, Incase Of Successful Breakout Ethereum Can Target 4000$ Area Ascending Triangle Resistance Area “Which I Shared Recently” https://t.co/Gq5sYBiKfA pic.twitter.com/B36VRnN9Qm — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) January 30, 2025 Ethereum On The Path To A $9,000 Rally? Another prominent analyst, Ted, emphasized that Ethereum’s higher lows on longer timeframes signal a strengthening bullish structure. He identified the $4,000 level as pivotal, predicting that its recovery could open the door to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Struggles Against Resistance: A Tough Road Ahead Ted went even further, forecasting that Ethereum could reach $9,000 to $10,000 within the next three to four months if these bullish conditions persist. This optimism is supported by growing on-chain activity and sustained investor interest. Ethereum is forming higher lows on the longer timeframe. $4K remains the most crucial level, and the reclaim of that will send $ETH to new ATH. Once that happens, I’m expecting Ethereum to hit $9K-$10K within 3-4 months.

January 30 th is the next key date that the market is closely watching, and it could dictate the short-term future of XRP. At the same time, NovaDEX, a Solana-based high-performance DEX could gain more whale attention with its robust staking pool and yield farming tools. Just recently, NovaDEX’s mainnet went live and it already reached several important milestones. Below, we’ll check out all the latest details on both platforms. XRP News Today: SEC Appeal Strategy and Its Ripple Effects on XRP-Spot ETFs On January 23, the SEC held a closed meeting on enforcement cases, including Ripple’s. With Mark Uyeda as acting Chair, known for opposing non-fraud enforcement, a shift in priorities is possible. A withdrawal of the SEC’s appeal requires a quorum vote, and the recent rollback of SAB 121 suggests procedural changes. The next closed meeting on January 30 may offer clarity on legal settlements and enforcement actions. If the SEC drops its appeal, it could open the door for XRP-spot ETF approvals, a highly anticipated move. Meanwhile, XRP’s RSI at 65 indicates room for further gains before hitting overbought levels. NovaDEX Might be a Promising New Decentralized Exchange with Potential DeFi Innovations and Tools NovaDEX , a recently launched decentralized exchange (DEX), might introduce several exciting features to its users, including concentrated liquidity pools, yield farming opportunities, and staking options. Since its mainnet launch, the platform has shown encouraging signs of adoption, with over 85,000 transactions reported across various activities. Early traction is evident, with approximately 1,900 users engaging with the platform. This initial growth could signal increasing interest in NovaDEX’s offerings and its potential role within the broader DeFi ecosystem. What might differentiate NovaDEX is its permissionless pool model, which could allow users to create liquidity pools for any supported token. This flexibility could provide users with more options compared to traditional DEX platforms. Additionally, NovaDEX may offer competitive rates, including lower slippage and potentially higher APRs, which could make it an attractive option for liquidity providers seeking passive opportunities. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the platform might simplify complex DeFi activities like token swapping, liquidity provision, and yield farming. This ease of use could appeal to both seasoned users and those new to decentralized finance. NovaDEX Could Create a Community-Driven Trading Ecosystem NovaDEX wants to embrace a decentralized governance model, potentially enabling its community members to play an active role in shaping the platform’s future. This approach could empower users to participate in key decisions and contribute to the project’s growth. Security seems to be a top priority for NovaDEX. The platform has completed a smart contract audit through QuillAudits, which helps ensure the safety of user assets and build trust in its community. NVX might serve as a central element, granting access to various features and benefits within the protocol. NVX has already reached significant milestones, including listings on established centralized exchanges like MEXC and decentralized platforms such as Raydium and Jupiter. The Takeaway While XRP awaits the SEC appeal and next regulatory steps, new projects could step in and start gaining traction. One project that may be particularly interesting is NovaDEX . This DEX platform has already reached some important milestones and could generate substantial buzz in the upcoming weeks with its robust tools. —- This article is not financial advice.

Tether ( USDT ), the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, has announced its integration with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ecosystem, marking a new step in the stablecoin’s expansion beyond traditional blockchain networks. Revealed on Jan. 30 at the Plan B conference in El Salvador, the move will bring USDT to both Bitcoin’s base layer and its high-speed Lightning Network , unlocking new possibilities for remittances, payments, and everyday transactions. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino described the initiative as a push toward real-world financial applications, stating that the goal is to offer “practical solutions for remittances, payments, and other financial applications that demand both speed and reliability.” Meanwhile, Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, stressed the broader impact, saying, “Millions of people will now be able to use the most open, secure blockchain to send dollars globally. It all comes back to Bitcoin.” The key to making this possible is Taproot Assets, a protocol developed by Lightning Labs that enables asset issuances on Bitcoin’s base layer while allowing transactions to be settled on the Lightning Network. Released in 2023, Taproot Assets effectively bridges stablecoins and other digital assets into Bitcoin’s infrastructure, making micropayments more efficient and reducing transaction costs. Once fully integrated, USDT will function seamlessly across Bitcoin’s main chain and its Lightning-powered layer 2 network, combining Bitcoin’s security with Lightning’s near-instant transaction speeds. Stablecoins have grown into a $220 billion asset class, with USDT dominating the sector. As of Jan. 30, USDT has a market capitalization of $139.4 billion, nearly three times that of its closest competitor, Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ), which stands at $53.1 billion. In 2024 alone, USDT processed over $10 trillion in on-chain volume, rapidly approaching Visa’s annual payment volume of $16 trillion. Tether’s latest announcement follows its recent relocation to El Salvador, the only country where Bitcoin holds legal tender status. However, in a parallel development, El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly amended its Bitcoin Law on Jan. 30, reversing the mandatory acceptance of Bitcoin and making it optional for merchants. The change aligns with International Monetary Fund conditions for a $1.4 billion loan to support the country’s economy.",News|El Salvador|Lightning Network|Stablecoin|Tether,EN,0,0,USDT|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-31 05:05:13

The lawsuit claims that all tokens are created on Pump. fun’s platform qualifies as securities, and the company has raked in nearly $500 million in fees by enabling users to launch memecoins . Filed in the Southern District of New York, the case brings up the ongoing debate of when a token is considered a security. Legal Battle Heats Up The lead plaintiff, Diego Aguilar, alleges he suffered financial losses trading Pump. fun-created tokens FWOG, FRED, and GRIFFAIN. Although Pump.fun doesn’t directly create tokens, the lawsuit argues that by providing an automated launchpad for memecoins, the company acts as a “joint issuer.” The suit targets the U.K.-registered Baton Corporation, believed to operate Pump.fun, along with its co-founders. Protecting the investor interest, Burwick Law and Wolf Pepper LLP jointly filed a lawsuit against the platform for harming investors with memecoin scams and broken promises. The firm says it has been working with people who lost money due to rug pulls and fraud. It also criticized Pump.fun for making hundreds of millions in fees while allowing harmful and offensive content on its platform. However, an X user in his post shared his thoughts on the securities controversy, known as Apate pointing out that memecoins were explicitly excluded from being classified as securities under the 1987 Securities Exchange Act amendment. He also highlights that the SEC lost a similar case in 2019 involving Dogecoin derivatives, suggesting a tough legal road ahead for regulators trying to label memecoins as securities. According to the 1987 Securities Exchange Act amendment, memecoins were explicitly excluded from securities classification. The SEC lost a similar case in 2019 against DogeCoin derivatives — Apate (@ApateAI) January 31, 2025 Not Their First Lawsuit This isn’t the first legal battle for Pump.fun. The same law firm, Wolf Popper LLP, previously sued the company over the PNUT token , which once hit a $1 billion market cap but has since plummeted by 89%. Another suit targeted the HAWK token, associated with influencer Hailey Welch. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: Bankman-Fried’s Family Seeks Trump Pardon After Ulbricht’s Release , Market sentiment Despite the controversy and lawsuits, memecoins have seen massive growth in early 2025. A clear sign of this is Pump.fun’s record transaction volume, surpassing even major networks like Solana and Ethereum. In the past month, Pump.fun made $116.72 million in revenue, beating Solana’s $116.46 million and Ethereum’s $107.64 million. In just 24 hours, trading volume hit $295.53 million, with fees soaring to $1.45 billion. Regulatory Challenges Loom Pump.fun has faced scrutiny since its launch, including a warning from the U.K. financial regulator and criticism for its now-disabled livestream feature, which some users misused. Meanwhile, the SEC under the Trump administration is shifting its approach to crypto regulation , which might change the crypto game for violators. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

If things keep going this way, the crypto giant may be one of the top picks for those seeking stable returns this year. Meanwhile, a new PayFi project has been highlighted as a standout for 2025, positioned perfectly to ride the growth of the global payments sector. Having rapidly surpassed $10 million in its presale, Remittix is transforming how we view global payments by blending blockchain’s efficiency with the trustworthiness of traditional finance. So what sets Remittix apart from other projects, and how far could Bitcoin go in 2025? Bitcoin Posts Steady Gains Bitcoin has been on a tear recently, passing $100,000 in December and hitting an ATH of $109,588 on the 20th January. This major uptick has been widely attributed to institutional players jumping on board. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even said that if major funds allocated 2-5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, prices could shoot up to $700,000. Traders have been eyeing the next big move as bitcoin remains above $100,000. The recent dip below this level had some holders sweating, but it bounced back relatively quickly. Looking forward, the future looks bright for Bitcoin. U.S. approval of Bitcoin ETFs has primed Bitcoin for more mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, central banks including the Czech National Bank are also adding Bitcoin to their reserves. Remittix Sets a New Benchmark for Global Payments Remittix (RTX) lets users change more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and send money to worldwide bank accounts within 24 hours. Without long processing times, hidden fees or accessibility issues, Remittix (RTX) is an optimal choice for businesses or individual needs who want to be able to transact internationally without high costs. The Remittix Pay API is more than a nifty piece of technology. It stands out as an indispensable tool for businesses. Using the API, companies can accept cryptocurrency payments and settle them in fiat, with funds transferred directly to a designated bank account. By supporting over 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, the API offers the flexibility that businesses need to integrate cryptocurrency without worrying about market fluctuations or complex setups. Remittix’s (RTX) design also has a strong focus on privacy and security. Transactions through the platform are delivered to recipients as standard bank transfers, concealing any connection to cryptocurrency origins. This discreet process has gained traction among users who value privacy in their financial dealings while exploring blockchain technology. Another central goal for Remittix is promoting global financial inclusion. Its 24/7 platform exists independently of traditional banking infrastructure, a lifeline for those who do not have access to global financial systems. Breaking down barriers, Remittix is reaching underbanked populations worldwide, and democratizing cross-border payments. Remittix Presale Flys High, Surpassing $10 Million In just a matter of weeks, Remittix’s presale has already surpassed $10 million raised. At the current stage, tokens are up for grabs for just $0.0498, and analysts project an 800% increase in value during the presale phase, followed by a huge rally post-launch. As Remittix (RTX) positions itself to disrupt the cross-border payments industry, it is gearing up for a big year in 2025.

The upgrade went live yesterday after attaining 91.43% validator consensus. Source – xrpscan The modifications will allow the creation of AMM pools for stablecoin RLSUD. The development remains crucial as it will likely enhance liquidity for the remittance token while enriching trading opportunities within the XRPL DEX. What the amendment means Automated Market Makers are vital in decentralized finance (DeFi) for individuals to trade without old-style order books. The XRP Ledger unveiled the AMM feature in March 2024, allowing liquidity providers to earn rewards on selected pools. Meanwhile, specific limits hindered Ripple’s stablecoin from participating in the Automated Market Maker pools. The restriction arose from the clawback functionality. The feature allows token issuers to recover tokens in scenarios involving criminal activities, regulatory obstacles, or dealings with sanctioned players. The clawback functionality went live early in 2024. Vet @Vet_X0 · Follow The XRP Ledger Clawback Amendment is now activated and usable ! 8:34 pm · 8 Feb 2024 824 Reply Copy link Read 39 replies Meanwhile, XRPL’s policies banned assets like Ripple stablecoin (as they boast the feature), excluding them from AMM pools. That restricted RLUSD holders from trading within the XRP Ledger DEX and capitalizing on automated liquidity provision incentives. The XRPL community launched the XLS-73d amendment to resolve the issue. The improvement changes how clawback-enables assets interact with the Automated Market Maker pools. The proposal witnessed massive support from validators, with votes well beyond the approval threshold of 80%. Meanwhile, the AMMClawback upgrade went live as Ripple’s stablecoin attained a crucial growth milestone. Ripple USD exceeds $100M market cap Ripple’s official, Jack McDonald, confirmed impressive growth for RLUSD. The product topped the $100 million market cap “a little over a month” after its launch. Jack McDonald @_JackMcDonald_ · Follow A little over a month since $RLUSD’s launch, we’ve seen amazing traction hitting ~$100M in market cap. As previously committed, we’ll be publishing a monthly independent attestation for RLUSD, in compliance with the highest regulatory standards.A few points to keep in mind:… 8:38 pm · 30 Jan 2025 851 Reply Copy link Read 27 replies McDonald clarified that the stablecoin remains over-reserved. That means Ripple’s reserves surpass the RLSUD’s total supply. We currently hold $6M more in reserves than the total RLUSD supply. Ripple strictly maintains reserves of highly liquid, low-risk assets to ensure our ability to fully meet redemptions. BitGo’s Brett Reeves predicted an increase in stablecoin adoption this year , citing global regulatory shifts. XRP price outlook Ripple’s native token trades at $3.09 after recovering from Monday’s low of $2.74. The daily chart indicates bearishness as XRP dipped from the daily peak of $3.15. Chart by Coinmarketcap The declined trading volume signals faded interest, suggesting more dips for XRP before potential rebounds. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Armando Pantoja expects a massive move for the remittance coin. Armando Pantoja @_TallGuyTycoon · Follow $XRP is about to explode! Charts say we are about to hit $3.85 soon. Resistance at $3.13 and $3.15. If XRP breaks these levels we’ll be at $3.85 next then on to $8.If not, Brace for a drop.

The company recently announced the integration of its USDT stablecoin with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, aiming to improve transaction efficiency and expand payment options. At the same time, European regulations under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework are prompting exchanges like Crypto.com and Coinbase to delist USDT, raising questions about stablecoin accessibility in the region. Tether Expands USDT to Bitcoin Network via Lightning Integration, Enhancing Global Payments Tether has announced its expansion onto Bitcoin through the Lightning Network, leveraging the Taproot Assets protocol. The announcement was made by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark at the Bitcoin-focused Plan B conference in San Salvador, El Salvador, on Jan. 30. Tether , the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, is set to integrate with Bitcoin’s Layer 2 scaling solution, the Lightning Network. This initiative, powered by Lightning Labs, is designed to facilitate faster and more cost-efficient transactions, broadening the accessibility of stablecoin payments worldwide. The integration uses the Taproot Assets protocol, an upgrade introduced in 2022 to enhance Bitcoin’s ability to support tokenized assets. As of now, USDT boasts a market capitalization of $139.4 billion, significantly surpassing its closest competitor, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), which stands at $53.1 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Tether also dominates the stablecoin market by processing a staggering $10 trillion in transactions in 2024 alone, placing it in close competition with traditional financial giants like Visa, which handled $16 trillion over the same period. One of the key benefits of this integration is the potential for seamless merchant adoption. Businesses that already accept Bitcoin via the Lightning Network will be able to integrate USDT as a payment method using the same infrastructure. This could significantly increase the adoption of stablecoin payments, especially in regions where volatility in local currencies drives demand for dollar-pegged alternatives. “Millions of people will now be able to use the most open, secure blockchain to send dollars globally,” Stark noted, emphasizing the role of stablecoins in providing financial stability to emerging markets. Furthermore, Lightning Labs envisions a future where AI-driven transactions and autonomous vehicles benefit from the enhanced efficiency of micropayments facilitated by USDT over Lightning. This development aligns with the broader trend of blockchain technology intersecting with emerging digital economies. Strategic Move Amid El Salvador’s Bitcoin Push This announcement follows Tether’s recent decision to relocate its headquarters to El Salvador, the first and only country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. The move signals Tether’s commitment to supporting Bitcoin adoption and advancing financial innovation in the region. El Salvador introduced the Lightning Network-powered Chivo Wallet in September 2021, aiming to promote Bitcoin usage among its citizens. However, the adoption has faced challenges, with mixed reactions from the public. Initially, the government mandated that merchants accept Bitcoin, but recent agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have led to a shift toward voluntary acceptance. The integration of USDT into the Lightning Network marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of Bitcoin’s utility beyond just a store of value. With faster transactions and reduced costs, Bitcoin’s infrastructure becomes more attractive for stablecoin-based payments, furthering the potential for global remittances, merchant adoption, and decentralized financial interactions. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, the partnership between Tether and Lightning Labs could be a catalyst for increased institutional interest and mainstream adoption. Whether this integration will drive mass adoption remains to be seen, but it undeniably represents a significant stride toward a more interconnected and efficient digital payment ecosystem. Tether Responds to MiCA Regulations as European Exchanges Prepare to Delist USDT In related news, the European cryptocurrency market is undergoing a significant transformation as exchanges prepare to delist Tether’s USDT stablecoin in response to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The new regulatory environment is forcing major platforms, including Crypto.com and Coinbase, to reassess their stablecoin offerings, raising concerns over potential market disruptions. Tether has voiced its concerns over the impact of MiCA on the European cryptocurrency sector, particularly regarding the delisting of its flagship stablecoin, USDT. Crypto.com confirmed on Jan. 29 that it will begin delisting USDT along with nine other tokens on Jan. 31 to comply with MiCA regulations. “It is disappointing to see the rushed actions brought on by statements which do little to clarify the basis for such moves,” a spokesperson for Tether said. Tether warned that the MiCA-triggered changes could create a “disorderly” market, particularly as the framework is still in its early stages. The company emphasized that these developments extend beyond USDT, affecting multiple tokens across the EU market. “These changes affect many tokens in the EU market, not only USDT, and we fear that such actions will lead to further risk being placed on consumers in the EU,” Tether’s representative said. The implications of MiCA regulations extend beyond Tether , as multiple exchanges are adjusting their token offerings. Crypto.com’s delisting efforts will impact a total of ten tokens, including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Dai (DAI). Coinbase also delisted USDT in December 2024 as part of its compliance measures and confirmed on Jan. 30 that it had removed eight tokens to align with MiCA regulations. “We regularly review the assets we make available to customers on our platform to ensure we are meeting regulatory requirements and will assess re-enabling services for stablecoins that achieve MiCA compliance on a later date,” a Coinbase representative stated. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has been actively pushing crypto asset service providers (CASPs) to restrict non-MiCA-compliant stablecoins. While exchanges can still offer these tokens in sell mode until March 31, they must fully restrict non-compliant stablecoins by the end of Q1 2025. Tether’s Strategy Amid MiCA Implementation Tether is finalizing its European strategy to ensure compliance while continuing to introduce innovative technologies. Despite its criticisms of MiCA’s complexity, the company acknowledged the EU’s regulatory efforts in structuring the crypto industry. “As we have consistently expressed, some aspects of MiCA make the operation of EU-licensed stablecoins more complex and potentially introduce new risks,” Tether stated. Tether also noted that the USD stablecoin market in Europe is relatively small compared to its widespread adoption in emerging markets. The company emphasized that MiCA should take into account the different use cases of stablecoins globally. The firm reaffirmed its commitment to compliance and innovation, highlighting its ongoing investment in projects such as Hadron and Quantor, both designed to be MiCA-compliant. As the deadline for MiCA compliance approaches, the European cryptocurrency market is at a crossroads. While regulators seek to establish a structured framework, concerns persist over the potential consequences of abrupt regulatory enforcement. Tether’s response shows the tension between regulatory clarity and market stability, emphasizing the need for balanced measures that promote innovation without disrupting financial ecosystems. Whether MiCA will ultimately foster a more secure and regulated stablecoin market in the EU remains to be seen. For now, the crypto industry is navigating uncharted waters, with stablecoin issuers and exchanges adapting to the new regulatory landscape.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,USDT|BTC|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-31 05:30:00

The commission remarked, “In particular, the Commission finds that the Proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Exchange’s rules be designed to ‘prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and, ‘in general, to protect investors and the public interest.” Bitwise’s new ETF could start trading soon if the S-1 form is approved On November 26, 2024, the NYSE Arca submitted a 19B-4 form on Bitwise’s combined Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund. On Thursday, the commission approved the filing, saying the ETF application complied with the Exchange Act, particularly Section 6(b)(5) and Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(iii). However, the regulatory agency has yet to approve the S-1 form for the Bitwise fund, which is necessary for trading to commence. According to Bitwise, once fully approved, the ETF Trust will hold both spot Bitcoin and spot ether. The trust will also “provide exposure” to the value of Bitcoin and Ether to investors. Moreover, the Trust’s asset allocation to Bitcoin and Ether will be based on the tokens’ respective market capitalizations in accordance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. On each Exchange trading day, the Administrator will also determine the Trust’s NAV and NAV per Share at 4:00 p.m. ET or at the earliest feasible time thereafter. Several crypto corporations have filed registration forms with the SEC for crypto ETFs With an expected change in crypto regulations under Trump’s administration, several crypto exchanges have filed for the approval of new crypto products. Since late November, the SEC has received multiple exchange-traded fund applications for various assets, including XRP, Solana, and Litecoin. For starters, VanEck and ProShares submitted registration forms for Litecoin, XRP, and Solana’s ETFs. Bitwise even proposed having a Dogecoin ETF, which would be interesting to see given Dogecoin is a meme coin whose value is heavily influenced by social media. Furthermore, Coinbase Derivatives, a subsidiary of the largest US crypto exchange, filed to list new futures contacts for Solana and Hedera. If the subsidiary gets its Solana Futures approved, it will have a contract size of 100 SOL. The SEC has so far approved filings from Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange to trade shares of crypto index ETFs from Hashdex and Franklin Templeton, respectively, in December 2024. Both ETFs will first hold spot Bitcoin and Ether on a market cap-weighted basis before including other crypto assets. At the time, the ETF Store President Nate Geraci wondered if other crypto corporations would join and launch similar products, pointing out that there would be high demand for such funds.

The proposed ETF would continue to hold XRP as its primary asset and track its performance on a price return basis, adjusted for operational fees, providing investors with a direct link to XRP's performance. Besides Grayscale, firms like CoinShares and Bitwise have also submitted applications for XRP-based ETFs, indicating a growing institutional appetite for structured investment products in XRP.

Recent developments suggest that the resolution of this case could be closer than expected, with some pointing to key signs indicating a possible outcome. One factor intensifying speculation is the revelation that Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has had direct discussions with President Donald Trump regarding XRP as a potential U.S. national digital asset reserve. While the idea of XRP becoming a national reserve asset remains uncertain, the fact that such discussions are happening is seen as a major development. The recent removal of the Ripple case from the SEC’s website is also being widely discussed. While this move has sparked rumors about an imminent settlement, experts warn against reading too much into it. Sherrie, a well-known expert in the XRP community, said that the SEC didn’t move the case; it’s actually been concluded and is now listed under Award Claims. Once the case was appealed, it received a new case number and can be found on the Court of Appeals website. When a user enquired about why acting Chairman Mark Uyeda has not yet dropped the case, she explained that it would be unusual for an acting SEC Chair to drop a high-profile case like Ripple’s. Normally, these big cases are handled by the official Chairman “It would be unusual for an Acting Chair to take such a liberty as to drop a high profile case such as Ripple’s. Generally these big cases are dealt with by the actual Chairman.

Market analysts are hopeful that this would significantly expand Bitcoin ecosystem, increase BTC Layer 2 adoption, and expand stablecoin utility. Furthermore, it could also put an end to ongoing discussions regarding the Tether USDT black swan event. Tether USDT Bitcoin Lightning Network Integration Is A Chess Move Amid talks of Tether’s regulatory challenges and concerns about a black swan event, the stablecoin firm made a huge announcement by integrating USDT into the Bitcoin ecosystem. In its announcement, Lightning Labs noted : “With the security and decentralization of bitcoin and the speed and scalability of Lightning, USDT will bring hundreds of millions of users and trillions in volume. It all comes back to Bitcoin”. Will Bitcoin Layer-2 Adoption Explode With Tether’s USDT? With the Tether USDT integration into the Bitcoin ecosystem, the firm will leverage the Taproot-powered Taproot Assets protocol developed by Lightning Labs. This move combines Bitcoin’s unmatched decentralization and security with the speed and scalability of the Lightning Network. Furthermore, the integration will allow USDT to operate seamlessly on Bitcoin’s base layer and its Layer 2 Lightning Network, enabling high-speed, low-cost transactions. This could be a game-changer in expanding Bitcoin’s Layer-2 capabilities thereby eating into the market share of giants like Ethereum. Furthermore, market analysts believe that the Bitcoin Lightning Network can play a crucial role in powering artificial intelligence (AI) agents. These agents will play a crucial as a medium of exchange for BTC. Very interesting prediction that #LightningNetwork will become the medium of exchange network for AI agents. — Caitlin Long (@CaitlinLong_) January 30, 2025 Expanding BTC Utility in Payments The Tether USDT integration aims to redefine stablecoin use cases within the Bitcoin ecosystem, providing a more scalable, secure, and reliable payment infrastructure. As Bitcoin gains traction among institutions and retail traders, the integration of USDT solidifies its role as a cornerstone of Bitcoin-based financial systems. Additionally, by leveraging Taproot assets, Bitcoin’s functionality will expand by supporting tokenized assets like USDT while preserving its decentralized integrity. It will facilitate a scalable and seamless payment solution while allowing microtransactions, remittances, and streamlined cross-border settlements. This makes things clear that stablecoins will take the lead from here while putting CBDCs in the back seat. Previous reports suggest that the US CBDC Digital Dollar could likely face a ban in the Donald Trump Administration. Black Swan Event Chances Shrink Tether USDT has always been under the scrutiny of regulations with concerns about whether it has enough USD reserves to support its USDT in circulation. However, the stablecoin firm has proved critics wrong time and again by showing how it manages its reserves. Furthermore, it’s among the largest holders of US treasuries, much higher than that of Germany. Last year Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that Tether could be subject to regulatory heat in the US, which could lead to a devastating effect on the crypto ecosystem. This has led to a long-term beef between Tether executives and Garlinghouse over the past few months. Despite this Tether has been facing a tough time in Europe recently, with top exchanges like Crypto.com delisting USDT stablecoin as MiCA regulatory framework kicks in. As a result, the firm also decided to move to El Salvador due to its crypto-friendly policies.

BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, changed hands near $104,400 at press time. Bitcoin prices are just 4.7% short of setting a new lifetime high, according to CoinDesk data. President Trump's reiteration of the tariffs threat looks to have clipped BTC's wings. While some fear an extended sell-off before the next big bullish wave unfolds, action in the onchain derivatives market suggests otherwise. ""While some crypto leaders are betting on BTC to fall before rallying towards $250K later this year, the Derive.xyz market remains skeptical. In fact, there’s a 9.7% chance of BTC falling below $75K before March and an even less likely 4.4% chance that it will swing over $250K before September 26,"" Nick Forster, founder at the leading decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform Derive.xyz , told CoinDesk. Flows on Deribit and the CME remain bullish as momentum looks to be building for state-level BTC reserves in the U.S. That said, gold, a traditional safe haven, and tokens tied to gold are on the rise, and the latest uptick in Tokyo inflation supports the bullish case in the anti-risk yen. Gold hits lifetime high Gold rose to a record high of $2,799 per ounce early Friday, taking the month-to-date gain to 6.5%. The lifetime high comes as participants in the London bullion market rush to borrow the yellow metal from central banks, motivated by reports of heightened gold deliveries to the U.S. The flurry of activity is reportedly driven by worries over possible import tariffs, according to Reuters . According to Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund's Founder, Jeroen Blokland, gold's rally to record highs against major fiat currencies hints at currency debasement . The intentional devaluation of paper money could also source demand for alternative investments like cryptocurrencies. Gold-backed tokens are already drawing strength from the XAU price rise, although they continue to trade at a discount to the yellow metal. Tether gold (XAUT) rose to its lifetime high of $2,796 on Bitfinex early today, TradingView data show. Meanwhile, PAXG also teased a move to record highs above $2,800. Tokyo inflation surges, AUD/JPY looks south Consumer inflation in Tokyo, which tends to lead nationwide trends, sped up slightly in January, government data showed . Notably, the core figure, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, rose 2.5% in January from a year earlier, compared with the 2.4% increase seen in December. The fastest annual increase is conducive to more Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate hikes and yen strength. Last week, the central bank raised the policy rate to 0.5%, the highest in over 16 years. A potential surge in the yen could destabilize riskier assets, as seen in August of last year. AUD/JPY, the FX market's risk barometer, has dived out of a consolidation pattern, hinting at more losses and broad-based risk-off ahead.",Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Xaut|Paxg|Tokyo|Inflation,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XAUT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-31 06:00:12

Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, both professors at Stanford Law School and part of FTX’s inner circle, are reportedly engaging with individuals connected to Trump's inner circle, according to the report. In recent weeks SBF's parents have tried to engage with the Trump administration to discuss potential clemency for their 32-year-old son, who was handed a 25-year prison sentence after being convicted of fraud. The specifics of whether direct communications with the White House have occurred remain unclear, per Bloomberg . The appeal for a pardon leans on Trump's recent history of using his clemency powers to free widely-supported individuals, such as Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Unlike Ulbricht, however, Bankman-Fried lacks widespread public support, though he argues his sentence is excessively harsh, especially since most FTX customers have recovered their financial losses. Bankman-Fried's FTX, formerly the world's third largest crypto exchange, went bust in November 2022 after a CoinDesk scoop said the platform's sister concern, Alameda Research, was on shaky financial footing. It was later found that Alameda used backdoor code to raid billions in customer funds from FTX — an arrangement helmed by Bankman-Fried and other Alameda founding members. The once-crypto titan has since been sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $11 billion after getting convicted of seven counts of fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering.",Policy,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-31 06:02:33

Indonesia is currently ranked as the third-highest country in terms of crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis . Less than 8% of the population is said to hold crypto, according to the latest data. Not only that, Indonesia is also currently at a transition phase when it comes to its crypto industry, with regulatory supervision being transferred to the FSA from its Commodity Futures Trading Agency. Mohammed AlKaff AlHashmi, co-founder of HAQQ Network, a layer1 permissionless blockchain that prides itself in implementing a system that is fully compliant with the Sharia laws, told crypto.news that just last week, Indonesian regulators gave the HAQQ Network’s coin, the Islamic Coin or ISLM, the stamp of approval. The token is already available on local Indonesian crypto exchange, Indodax. “If I’m successful in Indonesia and my protocol is accepted, I will be everywhere in the world. If my blockchain, coin or smart contracts are mostly adopted in Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim country in the world. I will have no barrier to enter other Muslim countries,” he explained. This is because AlHashmi believes that Indonesia will soon grow into the largest crypto hub in Asia.

Speaking from experience, he also highlights the smooth process his team went through in order to get regulatory approval from Indonesia’s Commodity Futures Trading Agency. The process was detailed, but it was quicker compared to other countries. “First their knowledge and background in terms of Technology especially web 3 they’re very knowledgeable and people in their team have a very good background and history before they joined,” said AlHashmi. “Also I would say their regulations are flexible enough to enable project owners to do good business to protect the community as well,” he added. AlHashmi and the HAQQ network team are currently in talks with the Indonesian FSA regarding their approval status, as the financial watchdog is poised to takeover crypto asset oversight from Commodity Futures Trading Agency. “When we look at Indonesia as a market, I would say it is incomparable. It can be number one to be honest. Because I have seen statistics of growth happening in a very big volume. The volume of trade, transactions and users, I think Indonesia can be very soon one of the top 3 countries in the world.” Mohammed AlKaff AlHashmi, co-founder of HAQQ Network Untapped potential in Indonesia’s unbanked According to the Indonesia Embedded Finance Business Report 2024-2029, around 74% of the population is unbanked or underbanked. This means a majority of Indonesian do not have access to traditional banking services. AlHashmi sees this 74% as an untapped market that could truly benefit from using the decentralized blockchain, especially one that implements a system that is compliant to Islamic laws. Considering Indonesia has the largest population of Muslims worldwide with roughly 241.5 million, based on 2022 data, a lot of its citizens are skeptical of traditional banking systems due to religious reasons. Although some banks do offer Shariah-specific services, not all of them are easily accessible to the public. Islamic financing is based on Sharia principles that emphasize justice, transparency, and social welfare. One of its main principles is the prohibition of charging or paying interest. You might also like: More than 60% of Indonesian youths invest in crypto: report “We have something unique on the blockchain, or in we developed it in a way to maintain the Sharia compliance there, which is called the Sharia Oracle, because we are a decentralized blockchain,” said AlHashmi. HAQQ Network has already implemented a similar system in Brazil for halal food certification, indicating the food is prepared in a way that complies to Islamic law. As Brazil as the largest halal food export, the country has benefited greatly from HAQQ’s blockchain. “We have done a pilot successfully in Indonesia, with different entities and the distribution and everything done in a very satisfactory way,” he said. Expanding products for the Indonesian crypto market Mohammed AlKaff AlHashmi said the protocol is getting ready to introduce a range of crypto products into the Indonesian crypto market. One of which is making Zakat donations doable through the blockchain. “Zakat is a must donation for Muslims who are rich a certain cap of resources, and they are not using it for a year. Zakat donation distribution is very important and crucial worldwide,” said AlHashmi. Because Zakat donations are often manned by people, donators often become uncertain whether their donations will reach the intended parties, such as orphanages and other charities. With the blockchain, the process of submitting donations becomes much more transparent and traceable to the user. “So what we have done, we have designed a solution on the blockchain called Fairshare. And the solution, it enables all donators to donate in a very transparent way, and it also actually it connects the wallet through smart contracts,” he said. In fact, HAQQ has already started implementing this program in Indonesia. In collaboration with NUCare for Empower Widows Initiative and Bright Future for Orphans, HAQQ implemented pilot donations through Fairshare. Additionally, HAQQ also launched a pilot for shariah compliant loans with the Indonesian entity, Agridesa, that combines technology and product development for agricultural sectors. In the future, AlHashmi hopes these products will encourage wider crypto adoption in Indonesia, raising its potential to become a global crypto hub.

This week’s expiry event is a large one because it is the end of the month. However, crypto derivatives expiry events such as this rarely influence spot markets, which have remained relatively flat this week. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.68, which means that there are more call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $120,000 strike price, which is $2.4 billion, according to Deribit. There is also around $1.65 billion in OI at the $110,000 strike price, as derivatives traders continue to speculate that BTC prices will rise from current levels. Earlier this week, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the “longer-term outlook remains constructive with expectations of continued upward momentum.” Meanwhile, Deribit reported that Bitcoin’s brief drop below $100,000 this week caused changes in the derivatives market. Short-term traders were buying more put options than usual, but longer-term traders remained optimistic, favoring call options, it stated. Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit Around 600,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring in addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options. These have a notional value of $1.95 billion and a put/call ratio of 0.43. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $10.3 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization has fallen just over 1% on the day to $3.68 trillion, where it was at the same time last week. Bitcoin reached $106,000 in an intraday high on Thursday but started to retreat during the Friday morning Asian trading session, falling to $104,300 at the time of writing. It has recovered from a Monday dip into the five-figure territory but failed to gain further momentum this week. Ethereum remains weak, having failed to reach $3,300 and trading at just over $3,200 at the time of writing. The altcoins were generally mixed with minor gains and losses on Friday morning. Stellar (XLM), Sui (SUI), and Litecoin (LTC) were doing a little better than the rest. Analysts have observed that February is usually much better for crypto price action than January, so things could be about to heat up.

Meanwhile, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund increased its indirect Bitcoin exposure, while El Salvador continues accumulating Bitcoin despite amending its laws to align with IMF conditions. Additionally, Grayscale launched a Bitcoin Miners ETF that gives investors indirect exposure to the mining sector. European Central Bank Stands Firm Against Bitcoin in Reserve Strategies Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), dismissed the possibility of Bitcoin (BTC) being included in central bank reserves as there is a need for liquidity, security, and safety in reserve assets. Her comments were made after Czech National Bank Governor Aleš Michl suggested the institution explore Bitcoin as part of its diversification strategy. However, the Czech central bank’s board did not explicitly mention Bitcoin in its plans. Lagarde’s statement is one of the first clear rejections from the ECB regarding Bitcoin as a reserve asset, especially at a time of growing discussions around digital asset stockpiling. The comments also follow US President Donald Trump’s executive order to establish a working group for exploring regulations on a national digital asset reserve. At least one ECB member has advocated for exploring a digital euro in response to the Trump administration’s openness toward crypto. The push for Bitcoin adoption as a reserve asset gained a lot of traction globally. This is particularly true in the United States, where lawmakers from states like Texas , Utah, Illinois, Wyoming, and Arizona introduced legislative proposals for Bitcoin stockpiling. These initiatives were inspired by the advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund, which championed the idea of Bitcoin as a financial hedge. Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also urged global policymakers to consider BTC reserves as protection against inflation. Christine Lagarde at the European Council El Salvador is still the best example of a nation that is actively accumulating Bitcoin for its national reserves. The country’s approach has set a precedent, though many central banks are still a bit hesitant to follow suit. Despite these discussions on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, its price has been rather volatile recently. At press time, BTC was trading hands at $104,203.66 after its price slipped by 0.36% over the past 24 hours. Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund Expands Bitcoin Exposure It has become very clear that not everyone necessarily agrees with Lagarde’s thoughts on Bitcoin. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund that is managed by Norges Bank Investment Management, recently increased its indirect exposure to Bitcoin through investments in crypto-friendly companies. NBIM’s exposure to Bitcoin (Source: K33 Research ) According to K33 Research , the fund’s exposure to Bitcoin reached 3,821 BTC, which is valued at $356 million by the end of 2024. This is an annual increase of 153%. It seems like the exposure is attributed to rule-based sector weighting rather than a deliberate strategy to prioritize Bitcoin. The sovereign wealth fund holds a $500 million stake in MicroStrategy, along with investments in crypto exchange Coinbase and Bitcoin mining companies like Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms. The Government Pension Fund Global, as it is officially known, reported record profits of $222 billion in 2024, which was its second consecutive year of impressive gains. The fund’s CEO, Nicolai Tangen, credited most of this success to large returns from the technology sector. The increasing presence of publicly traded crypto companies and the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have made it much easier for institutions to gain both direct and indirect exposure to digital assets. In the United States, spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated more than $124 billion in net assets in just their first year of trading. As regulatory frameworks become clearer, many analysts believe institutional adoption of Bitcoin will expand even more. A pro-crypto policy shift in the United States is already influencing global markets as there is a very clear growing interest in digital assets seen in Europe and beyond. Swiss crypto bank Sygnum recently surveyed 400 institutional investors across 27 countries and found that 57% plan to increase their exposure to crypto assets. This suggests that institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets is likely to accelerate as financial markets grow and evolve. Sygnum Bank survey key findings (Source: Sygnum ) El Salvador Amends Bitcoin Law to Meet IMF Terms El Salvador’s Congress recently quickly approved legislation amending its Bitcoin laws to comply with terms set by the International Monetary Fund as part of a $1.4 billion loan agreement . The bill was passed just minutes after President Nayib Bukele sent it to the Legislative Assembly, securing 55 votes in favor and only two against. The amendment scales back the government’s Bitcoin involvement and makes its acceptance optional for businesses, unlike the previous legal requirement. Ruling party lawmaker Elisa Rosales stated that the reform ensures Bitcoin’s permanence as legal tender while making its implementation a lot more practical. Despite the amendment and Lagarge’s recent comments, El Salvador continues to expand its Bitcoin holdings, and recently purchased an additional 11 BTC. The country’s Bitcoin Office confirmed its plans to keep accumulating Bitcoin, which could intensify in 2025. El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves currently stand at 6,049 BTC, which is valued at approximately $633 million, with an overall profit of 127% based on an average purchase price of $46,000 per Bitcoin. Meanwhile, former US Senator Bob Menendez, who was a very vocal critic of El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for accepting bribes in gold and cash. An FBI search of his home uncovered $480,000 in cash and gold bars worth an estimated $150,000. Grayscale Launches Bitcoin Miners ETF Grayscale also recently expanded its crypto investment offerings with the launch of the Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF (MNRS) , which provides exposure to Bitcoin mining companies and the broader mining ecosystem. The fund was announced on Jan. 30, and it invests in firms listed in the Indxx Bitcoin Miners Index , which tracks companies primarily generating revenue from Bitcoin mining, mining-related hardware, software, and services. MNRS does not invest in digital assets directly or through derivatives but may have indirect exposure due to its holdings. Grayscale believes in the fundamental role of Bitcoin miners in maintaining the security, integrity, and functionality of the Bitcoin network. The company pointed out that Bitcoin mining firms present an alternative for investors who may not have direct access to Bitcoin or prefer a different way to get some exposure to the market. According to David LaValle, Grayscale’s global head of ETFs, Bitcoin miners are positioned for huge growth as adoption increases, making MNRS a very attractive option for a broad range of investors. MNRS details (Source: Grayscale ) The launch of the ETF happened as Bitcoin mining stocks have faced challenges despite Bitcoin’s 100+% gains in 2024. While Grayscale pointed to the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and mining companies, data from the Hashrate Index and Google Finance shows that most publicly traded mining firms struggled to capitalize on the rally. In fact, some stocks saw declines of up to 84%. However, the downturn in mining stocks in late January followed a broader market drop linked to the frenzy surrounding DeepSeek’s new AI model. Despite recent challenges, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Miners ETF is part of the continued push to expand investment options in the crypto sector to offer investors a structured and rules-based way to gain exposure to the mining industry.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-31 06:10:56

His close ties to the Democratic Party, including a $5.2 million donation to Biden’s 2020 campaign, could also work against him under a Trump administration. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Can Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda Drop the Ripple Case? , However, SBF’s family and friends sent many letters to the judge during his trial to reduce his imprisonment; they painted a positive picture of him by calling him a compassionate genius business tycoon who failed due to his ‘neurodiverse’ traits. All these factors and Elon Musk’s support may prove beneficial for him. Odds Are Stacked Against Him Despite the discussions, betting markets remain doubtful about SBF’s chances. Polymarket currently gives him only a 6% chance of receiving a pardon, compared to Ulbricht’s 95% before his release. With Trump likely facing pressure to be selective in his pardons, it remains uncertain whether SBF will receive the same leniency. However, the crypto world is watching closely to see how this unfolds. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to a filing lodged with the regulatory agency, the XRP Trust is among the largest investment instruments anchored to Ripple’s native token, with more than $16 million in assets under management. Spot XRP ETF Grayscale’s justification for seeking to convert the trust into an ETF is that such a product would give investors greater access to XRP without the cost and complexity of directly buying the asset, all while being overseen by a national securities exchange. The asset management giant now joins a host of investment firms, including CoinShares, Wisdom Tree, ProShares, REX Shares, and Bitwise, who have all submitted filings for XRP ETFs. The flurry of activity comes hot on the heels of the inauguration of Donald Trump as the 47th U.S. President. His pro-crypto outlook has encouraged many digital asset companies to explore new offerings, with Grayscale submitting applications for Solana and Litecoin ETFs only a week ago. Earlier, the Stamford-based company also introduced its Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF to expose investors to publicly traded BTC mining companies such as Riot, Marathon Digital, and Core Scientific. The SEC, under interim Chair Mark Uyeda, has set up a dedicated task force to develop a regulatory framework for the crypto industry. While the agency, under its former head Gary Gensler, approved ETFs tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum, its insistence that most cryptocurrencies qualified as securities meant that the market’s options for crypto-related ETFs were limited. XRP Under Fire XRP itself is at the center of a long-running legal feud between its parent company and the SEC, with the regulator accusing Ripple Labs and several of its executives of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. While a recent removal of the lawsuit on the financial watchdog’s website sparked speculation among the XRP community that the case may have been finally resolved, attorney Jeremy Hogan insisted that it is still on and nothing had changed. Meanwhile, a recent executive order to explore the creation and makeup of a national digital asset reserve had sections of the Bitcoin community up in arms against XRP over its possible inclusion in such a stockpile. The endless drama seems to have taken a slight toll on the coin’s price, which dropped by a marginal 0.6% in the last 24 hours. The loss is more significant across a fortnight, with CoinGecko data showing XRP dipped by nearly 7%. However, it’s not all doom and gloom; over 30 days, Ripple’s native token is up 44.9%, with analysts optimistic it can break its all-time high of $3.4 in the short term to jump to $4.5.

Due to the skepticism surrounding Avalanche’s trajectory, Remittix (RTX) enters the spotlight with its distinct capabilities. Remittix is the new altcoin whose blockchain ICO has garnered significant attention, raising over $10 million due to the influx of new investors. Because of its enticing PayFi features, Remittix’s token presale has become a popular discussion among investors who want to take their $100 investment to $10000 this year. Find out more! Avalanche’s Platform Developments Prepare It For A New Milestone Avalanche holders fear that a decline below the $30 support levels will draw near because of AVAX’s failure to spike despite the key developments on the platform. AVAX trades at about $33.9, declining over 4.8% within the last 7 days, signaling the project’s bearish trend. Yet, investors remain optimistic about Avalanche’s future trajectory due to the growth in its platform. The Avalanche team partnered with DYOR, a crypto research platform with the aim of creating and providing reliable resources for crypto institutions. Swissborg also integrated Avalanche into its Meta-Exchange (MEX) to introduce cross-chain trading functionality. However, these developments haven’t sparked a meteoric rise in the platform; hence, there is skepticism that the project’s price will make any significant shifts. That’s why Remittix is preparing to soar amidst the bearish market; hence, traders turn to it. Can Pepe Deliver On The Hype? PEPE has gained credibility and trust as a popular meme coin project, with many whales storming its platform. Chandler, a popular crypto commentator, recently shared in a post on X that February may be a wild month for PEPE. PEPE whales have begun a bullish movement again as a whale recently deposited 500 billion PEPE tokens on Coinbase, signaling a massive sell-off. Data from Lookonchain suggests that the whale cashed out profits of up to $35.5 million, but it is still holding on to 1.2 trillion tokens. Even though PEPE trades at about $0.00001275 , some investors believe it could enter $2 if it maintains its appeal among investors. Yet, RTX, a new presale coin, takes centre stage with its unique ecosystem. Remittix Revolutionizes The Crypto Payment Scene With Its Unique Features This is on the lookout for the best coins to buy now, and they have found their way to the Remittix public presale because of the project’s strategic positioning in the market. This new altcoin project offers practical solutions to the challenges of the cross-border industry through blockchain technology, Just picture paying any amount of your choice to your friends or relatives abroad in crypto, and they receive these funds in their fiat currency without exchange losses or hidden fees. This PayFi solution is why investors are hopeful that Remittix will outpace Avalanche and Pepe this year. The Remittix project is on a mission to transform the $190 trillion global payment scene as one of the best coins to buy now for anyone interested in distinct blockchain projects. Businesses can also use Remittix’s Pay API model to set up merchant accounts to manage their crypto receipts and payments. Remittix supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies through its flat-fee strategy and reasonable prices. The Remittix presale is in its ICO phase, which has gathered over $10 million, trading at just $0.0498. Experts project massive profits for RTX, with the possibility of the project surging to $1 upon launch. The high demand for Remittix’s presale coin signals its appeal and potential to take your portfolio from zero to a hundred before the end of this year. Join the RTX presale today!

One moment, meme coins are skyrocketing, and the next, they’re making a dramatic dip before bouncing back up. If you’ve been paying attention, you know that short-term crypto investments can be a wild ride—but also one of the most exciting ways to multiply gains in a short span. The meme coin market is still stealing the spotlight in 2025, and there’s one coin making waves for all the right reasons. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is dominating the buzz with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, high-yield staking, and an engaged community. But it’s not the only coin worth watching. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to join for short term , we’ve rounded up four exciting picks that could deliver serious returns. BTFD Coin: The P2E Game That’s Changing the Meme Coin Space BTFD Coin is riding the meme coin wave but bringing something fresh to the table—a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that just went live on January 1, 2025. This isn’t just any meme coin; it’s tapping into gaming, NFTs, and staking to offer a multi-layered way for investors to grow their holdings. While meme coins usually thrive on hype alone, BTFD is building an ecosystem that rewards its holders beyond just market speculation. The BTFD P2E game is already attracting thousands of players who can earn $BTFD tokens simply by playing. Imagine a gaming experience where every move you make, every battle you win, and every mission you complete directly translates into crypto earnings. And with the presale still running, early adopters have a rare chance to stack up $BTFD before it lists at a much higher price. Right now, BTFD is in Stage 14 of its presale, priced at $0.00016 per coin, with over $5.82 million already raised and more than 68 billion $BTFD tokens sold. The community, known as the Bulls Squad, is closing in on 10,000 holders, all gearing up for what could be a massive post-listing price surge. If the price hits its projected $0.0006 listing price, an investment of $10,000 today at $0.00016 per BTFD would give you 62.5 million BTFD tokens. At $0.0006, that investment could be worth $37,500. And with price predictions aiming for $0.006, the moonshot potential is staggering. Why did this coin make it to this list? The combination of P2E gaming, high-stakes rewards, and a thriving community makes BTFD Coin a standout pick. The presale won’t last forever, and with each stage, the price inches up. If you’re eyeing the best cryptos to join for short term win, this might be your best shot before the next price jump. To grab your share of BTFD before the presale ends, set up MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT, and head over to the presale page . Connect your wallet, choose the amount to buy, confirm your transaction, and once the presale is over, claim your BTFD tokens. Simple as that! Dogecoin: The Original Meme Coin That Still Moves Markets Dogecoin is the OG of meme coins, and if there’s one thing history has taught us, it’s that DOGE has an uncanny ability to bounce back stronger every time it dips. First created as a joke, it has since become a household name, with Elon Musk repeatedly fueling its rallies through social media. Unlike many meme coins, Dogecoin has actual utility as a payment method, with major companies like Tesla and AMC accepting it for purchases. The community’s unwavering support, combined with periodic hype cycles, makes DOGE a solid short-term trading asset. Its liquidity, market cap stability, and ability to surge on hype alone give traders multiple entry and exit points. Why did this coin make it to this list? Dogecoin’s resilience and massive following make it a strong contender for quick profits, especially when the meme coin trend heats up. Shiba Inu: The Ecosystem-Driven Meme Coin Shiba Inu started as a Dogecoin rival, but it has evolved into something far bigger. What makes SHIB unique is its expanding ecosystem, including ShibaSwap, NFT projects, and a metaverse initiative that’s in development. Unlike typical meme coins that rely solely on hype, SHIB’s team is actively working to build long-term value. One of its most significant short-term catalysts is Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain that aims to reduce gas fees and enhance SHIB’s scalability. This upgrade could attract more investors, pushing its price higher. Additionally, SHIB’s burn strategy is gradually decreasing supply, adding long-term scarcity. Why did this coin make it to this list? With Shibarium, DeFi projects, and NFT expansions, SHIB has real potential for short-term price jumps when major updates roll out. Pepe Coin: Riding the New Wave of Meme Coins Pepe Coin (PEPE) exploded onto the scene as a community-driven meme token that quickly gained traction due to its cultural relevance and viral appeal. As a newer meme coin, it thrives on speculation and volatility, making it an ideal short-term play for traders looking to capitalize on quick swings. Its low market cap compared to DOGE and SHIB means it has more room for aggressive price movements. With a strong presence on social media and an engaged community, PEPE continues to see rapid price action whenever market sentiment shifts in favor of meme coins. Why did this coin make it to this list? Its rapid price movements and high volatility make it one of the most exciting meme coins to trade for short-term gains. Conclusion Meme coins continue to be one of the most exciting and unpredictable sectors in crypto, but with the right picks, they also present massive short-term opportunities. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to join for short term, these four have the momentum, hype, and potential to deliver serious returns. But if you want to maximize your gains before a coin hits the open market, BTFD Coin stands out as the most strategic move right now. The P2E game, high-yield staking, and an explosive community set it apart. With only a limited time left in the presale, now’s the time to stack up on $BTFD before the next price increase.

Imagine buying early into a project that’s still under the radar but set to explode, much like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu did. The secret? Getting in before the hype kicks in. This is exactly why BTFD Coin (BTFD) is making waves in the market right now with its 100% bonus offer in Stage 14 of its presale, giving investors double the coins before it skyrockets at launch. Meanwhile, Notcoin (NOT) is seeing a massive whale accumulation, signaling bullish momentum, and Book of Meme (BOME) is navigating major price swings, making it a volatile yet intriguing play. Let’s break it down—what’s happening with these three top new meme coins with 1000x potential, and why is BTFD’s presale the opportunity of the year? BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Presale That’s Printing Gains with 100% Bonus! Ever missed a big crypto rally and wished you had bought the dip? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin is all about—it represents Buy The Dip , and right now, it’s serving up the ultimate dip-buying opportunity with a 100% presale bonus. With Stage 13 completely burned, Stage 14 is now live at $0.00016 per coin, and if you use the code “LAUNCH100”, you double your BTFD Coins instantly. That’s free money in the crypto world, and smart investors aren’t sleeping on this one. BTFD Presale Performance and The Ultimate 550% ROI Opportunity The BTFD presale is exploding, with over $5.82 million raised, over 68 billion coins sold, and 9,900+ holders already in. With a projected listing price of $0.0006, early investors are looking at a massive upside. Right now, in Stage 14, BTFD is priced at $0.00016 per coin, but here’s where it gets exciting—the LAUNCH100 bonus code gives buyers 100% extra coins , doubling their holdings instantly. For example, a $5,000 investment at the current price would normally get you 31,250,000 BTFD coins, but with the bonus code, that jumps to 62,500,000 coins. When BTFD hits $0.0006 at launch, that investment could be worth $37,500, delivering a 550% ROI before the bull run even starts. This is why BTFD Coin is one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. The presale won’t last forever, and once the bonus disappears, so does the chance to double your coins. Now is the time to grab the dip. But it gets even better. BTFD isn’t just a meme coin—it’s got an entire ecosystem fueling its growth. Staking: 90% APY – Passive Income Just Got Real The BTFD staking platform launched on December 2, 2024, giving early buyers 90% APY returns. That means your coins grow even before the listing happens. Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game: Earn While Playing! BTFD’s full Play-to-Earn game dropped on January 1, 2025, allowing users to earn rewards just by playing. This isn’t some cheap cash grab—the game is built to keep players engaged, driving long-term demand for BTFD Coins. Referral Program: Earn Even More BTFD Coins! BTFD also rewards users who spread the word. If you bring in investors using your unique referral code, you get 10% of their purchase amount in BTFD tokens. If you land in the top 20 referrers, your bonus stack goes even higher. How to Grab Your BTFD 100% Bonus – Step-by-Step Visit the BTFD Presale Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter bonus code : LAUNCH100 (all caps, no spaces!) Confirm the bonus in your wallet Buy now and double your coins! This bonus is only available in Stage 14—once it’s over, it’s gone forever. Don’t wait and BTFD before it’s too late to join the top new meme coin with 1000x potential. Notcoin (NOT): Whales Are Loading Up—What’s Next? Notcoin (NOT) has been making headlines as whale accumulation surges. Big-money players are quietly stacking up NOT, a clear sign that they’re betting on a price breakout. Notcoin (NOT) is currently priced at $0.0044, with a market cap of $453.23 million, and whale accumulation is on the rise. Notcoin recently shifted from a “tap-to-earn” model to an “explore-to-earn” approach, rewarding users for engaging with the ecosystem. This strategic shift could bring more adoption, but right now, the real action is in the whale moves—and if history repeats itself, a major price pump might not be far off. Book of Meme (BOME): Extreme Volatility, But Opportunity? Book of Meme (BOME) has been a rollercoaster, with wild price swings that keep traders on edge. Book of Meme (BOME) is currently priced at $0.0034, with a market cap of $231.87 million, after a 345% surge in March 2024 following its Binance listing. BOME skyrocketed to $0.027 in March 2024, but since then, it’s struggled to hold momentum. Despite its high volatility, the meme coin community still watches it closely, waiting for the next big spike. Could it bounce back? Time will tell. Final Thoughts: Why BTFD Is the Smartest Play Right Now With Notcoin gaining whales and Book of Meme battling volatility, the meme coin market is heating up, but BTFD Coin offers the best opportunity among the top new meme coins with 1000x potential. The 100% presale bonus with LAUNCH100 doubles your coins instantly, while Stage 13 token burns create a supply shock. Staking at 90% APY, a live Play-to-Earn game, and a projected 550% ROI at launch make this a golden opportunity. Stage 14 won’t last forever—join the BTFD Coin presale now at the BTFD site before the bonus disappears!

Purpose Investments Inc. also filed for a spot XRP ETF with Canadian authorities. XRP is trading at $3.08, showing signs of a retest of lower support levels in the near future. XRP could be on the verge of a bullish rally. This comes as Grayscale, a major digital asset management firm, filed for a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca. A 19b-4 filing was submitted by the NYSE Arca on behalf of Grayscale. The goal is to convert Grayscale’s XRP Trust into a spot ETF. But according to FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, more XRP ETF applications could be seen from various issuers next week.

While new projects gain traction, specific digital assets continue to dominate as blockchain use grows. Top cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin have maintained their position as market leaders, although Litecoin and Cardano have different advantages. Remittix (RTX) , meanwhile, is becoming a more intriguing competitor with practical financial use. These assets may see significant gains as speculation increases, according to crypto price predictions, but which one will increase the most? Cardano (ADA): Growth Potential It is also possible that Cardano will be ranked among the best-leading cryptocurrencies in 2025. Many pundits say the price of Cardano might rise if it keeps getting more institutional support. With solid fundamentals, although growing slower than some of its rivals, it sits in the position of one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy for long-term investors. According to cryptocurrency price prediction, ADA may see severe surges provided the blockchain adoption keeps pace. Litecoin (LTC): Reliability It has been widely known since time immemorial that Litecoin is like “silver” in Bitcoin’s aspect: a cryptocurrency with low fees and much faster transactions than its “sister cryptocurrency”. Although new other cryptocurrencies may surface later, it’s also for the reason of dependability that Litecoin maintains an upward, steadily growing slope; therefore, a better adoption in payments will add more merit for it to stick in 2025 among top cryptocurrencies. According to crypto price predictions. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Control The term “digital gold,” Bitcoin is the most commonly used digital asset. With a limited supply, it will surely benefit from institutional interest and remains the most sought after cryptocurrency. Bitcoin still remains one of the best protections against inflation and a store of value. However, as more analysts said, Bitcoin is on its path to continue dominating the market for new records. Its supposed value fluctuations may be less than other lesser altcoins, but the same is generally one of the best investments for long-term stability that crypto has to offer. Ethereum (ETH): Innovation ETH is in high demand because of its extensive application in DeFi and corporate solutions. Ethereum has been one of the ideal cryptocurrencies to purchase, because to its institutional adoption and continued innovation. According to many crypto price projections, ETH may outperform a number of altcoins, making it one of the finest cryptos to invest in for long-term gains. Remittix (RTX): The Future of Crypto Payments With its PayFi methodology, Remittix is revolutionizing cryptocurrency payments by providing smooth crypto-to-FIAT transactions. By allowing companies and people to convert digital assets into fiat bank transfers, RTX directly competes with payment giants like Stripe and Wise, in contrast to most blockchain startups. Remittix is therefore among the most cutting-edge financial solutions available in the cryptocurrency market. RTX’s emphasis on real-world adoption is one of its main advantages. Remittix’s ability to immediately convert digital assets into practical fiat currency provides them a competitive edge as the demand for crypto payments develops globally. Experts are describing the project’s presale as one of the best crypto to buy before its widespread adoption soars, and it has already generated a lot of interest. Remittix may experience substantial uptake in 2025 as a result of growing regulatory clarity and companies looking for trustworthy cryptocurrency payment options. According to crypto price predictions, RTX’s distinct role in the payment sector may spur significant price increases, positioning it as a possible breakout star among the top cryptocurrencies. In 2025, all five of these cryptocurrencies have a lot of promise. While Cardano and Litecoin offer special benefits in terms of scalability and payments, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to be the leading participants. Remittix, on the other hand, is a notable upstart in the payment sector that tackles practical financial issues. Among the top cryptocurrencies, RTX may yield the biggest rewards as adoption increases, according to crypto price predictions. Investors looking for the next big thing should give Remittix careful thought. Join the Remittix presale today and become part of the next big movement in crypto payments.

Analysis Company Answers by Analyzing Previous Bulls,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-there-still-upside-potential-in-bitcoin-price-analysis-company-answers-by-analyzing-previous-bulls/,"Leading cryptocurrency analytics firm Glassnode has published its latest assessment of Bitcoin’s market trends, noting structural similarities between the current bull market and the 2015-2018 cycle. According to Glassnode, Bitcoin’s price growth rate has slowed with each cycle, indicating increasing market maturity. The current bearish profile closely mirrors the 2015-2017 cycle, and historical patterns suggest the potential for an acceleration phase in the bull market at this stage relative to the lows of the cycle. The firm reports that BTC’s realized capital has grown 2.1x in the current cycle, below the peak of 5.7x in the last cycle but still in line with the growth seen during 2015-2018. Notably, the market has yet to experience the full impact of the euphoria phase, according to the analytics firm, suggesting further potential for expansion. Related News: Step by Step to XRP Spot ETF: New Move from Grayscale Glassnode notes that there has been a significant shift in Bitcoin’s supply dynamics, with exchange balances falling to 2.7 million BTC. This decline is largely attributed to Bitcoin being moved to ETF wallets, which are typically managed by custodians like Coinbase. The combined holdings of exchanges and ETFs have remained stable at around 3 million BTC, suggesting a shift in market structure rather than a supply shock. *This is not investment advice.

But could there be another investment opportunity or two to compete with the rising Dogecoin price? New online casino Rollblock (RBLK) and speedster Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) certainly think so. Rollblock (RBLK): Presale investment opportunity of the year Professional traders looking for the best investment opportunities regularly turn to presales, as this is where the best new tokens are to be found before they trade on the open markets. Raising its hand in this arena is Rollblock, the world’s first Ethereum-based play-to-earn casino. The deal with Rollblock is that it is already up and running, not something that is yet to be developed. Rollblock offers its players several hundred games to choose from and is seeing a massive number of daily users. Now, Rollblock is having a presale to raise liquidity for its online casino, and in return, it is offering all token holders a weekly dividend from the income generated by the online casino. And what’s more, Rollblock is even throwing some DeFi into the mix. RBLK tokens can be staked for enormous APY rewards you will not find anywhere on traditional markets. Basically, Rollblock is offering its investors literal money for nothing. Investors get rewarded just for HODL-ing. This product offering makes Rollblock the investment opportunity of the year! Dogecoin (DOGE): Dogecoin price setting the standard The OG meme coin has evolved beyond its original purpose as a critique of cryptocurrencies into a bona fide digital asset. In many ways, Doge Epitomizes what cryptocurrency is about – pure decentralization with its value decided by the community, not decree. The Dogecoin price started 10,000 times lower than its current price, and as an investment opportunity, it was the token to beat. While Doge took a pounding since its May 2021 high, the Dogecoin price is far from down and out. The Dogecoin price is predicted to exceed its ATH by the end of March, and break the $1.00 barrier by April. As an investment opportunity, the Dogecoin price growth will be hard to beat. But it can be beaten! Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR): Speedster is starting to topple the big players HBAR is yet another Layer-1 solution available to blockchain developers and is starting to scare the big guns. HBAR is a speed demon. High throughput and low latency make it the perfect chain where security and speed are of the essence. In that regard, HBAR is certainly teaching Ethereum a few lessons. HBAR’s market cap saw a 10-x increase in the last year, signaling that it is on the map and ready to do business. Compared with Solana barely doubling its market cap and Ethereum just about standing still, it becomes obvious why HBAR is a great investment opportunity. Conclusion Crypto always offers a great investment opportunity, and it’s easy to make the mistake of looking at the obvious. It is easy to predict significant gains on the Dogecoin price, but looking beyond Doge, Hedera Hashgraph, and Rollblock show there are much faster tokens than Dogecoin to invest in! Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are available on all good crypto exchanges, but Rollblock’s RBLK token is only available during presale at $0.052 directly from their website.

With the 2025 bull run on the horizon, three meme coins—Shiba Inu, FLOKI, and Doge Uprising —are drawing significant attention, hype, and investment. Each project brings unique strengths to the table, positioning themselves for potential explosive growth. Let’s explain why these meme coins could be the top picks for crypto enthusiasts looking to make millions in the coming year. Shiba Inu: The Veteran with Unfinished Business Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has been a household name in the crypto world since its meteoric rise in 2021. What started as a Dogecoin rival quickly became a massive ecosystem with staking, a decentralized exchange, and a growing NFT presence. Despite its current price sitting far below its all-time high, many analysts believe the project has room to grow—especially with ongoing developments such as the Shibarium Layer-2 solution, designed to enhance transaction speeds and reduce gas fees. Another reason SHIB remains attractive is its strong and dedicated community, often referred to as the “SHIB Army,” which continues to push for mainstream adoption. If SHIB manages to secure further utility and real-world partnerships, it could see another wave of significant gains in 2025. FLOKI: The Underdog with Big Ambitions FLOKI ($FLOKI) started as just another dog-based meme coin but has since developed into a serious contender in the space. With aggressive marketing campaigns and focusing on building real-world utility, FLOKI has gained a solid foothold in the meme coin market. The project’s ecosystem includes landmark features such as Valhalla, an NFT Metaverse game, and FlokiFi, which offers DeFi products designed to enhance the token’s long-term value. The FLOKI team is working on partnerships with mainstream sports teams and global influencers to expand its reach, making it one of the most aggressively marketed meme coins in the space. FLOKI’s ongoing efforts to stay at the forefront of buyers’ minds could pave the way for substantial returns in this bull cycle. Doge Uprising: The Revolution Rising with Presale Potential While established names like SHIB and FLOKI have already experienced their parabolic runs, Doge Uprising ($DUP) is the new contender that is already capturing the next wave of meme coin mania. With its ongoing presale flying, early adopters are betting on its winning blend of meme culture and financial incentives. Unlike traditional meme coins that rely solely on community hype, Doge Uprising integrates features such as staking rewards, deflationary tokenomics, and manga-inspired storytelling, creating a layered experience for investors. The project’s narrative—centered around a futuristic rebellion against digital oppression from tech overlords (a very timely theme)—resonates with a younger audience and adds an element of engagement beyond mere speculation. With presale stages offering progressively higher token prices, those getting in early benefit the most. As Doge Uprising prepares for its public launch, its potential to become the next viral hit is gaining traction. Which Meme Coin Could Deliver the Biggest Gains? Each project offers unique opportunities. Shiba Inu brings an established ecosystem and mainstream recognition, FLOKI offers aggressive expansion strategies and utility, and Doge Uprising provides the excitement of early entry and a fresh take on the meme coin narrative. For investors looking to diversify within the meme coin sector, a combination of all three could provide stability and high growth potential. As history has shown, meme coins have the power to defy expectations and generate astronomical returns when the market conditions align. Don’t miss out on the next big meme coin revolution.

As over 1 billion tokens were removed from the asset’s circulating supply in the past 24 hours, a bullish market sentiment bubbled the meme-themed asset. Further, with on-chain metrics reflecting strong market support for the crypto, an upshot is that investors eye SHIB price gains ahead despite the current market volatility ahead of the U.S. PCE inflation data release. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets 7200% As Nearly 1Bln Tokens Destroyed As per the latest data by Shibburn , the Shiba Inu burn rate witnessed a whopping 7240% uptick on January 31. This massive upswing is primarily attributed to the removal of 1.1 billion tokens from the circulating supply. Source: Shibburn official site Notably, the wallet address 0xc7d04.. appears to be responsible for the lion’s share in the intraday burn rate upsurge, sending slightly over 1 billion tokens to a null address. In turn, the SHIB circulating supply at the time of reporting shredded and reached 584.25 trillion tokens. Overall, the massive blow to the asset’s supply has reverberated market optimism, mirroring the law of supply and demand. Recent Community Advancement Bolsters Market Sentiment Further, the recent launch of ShibOS remains a hot topic across the Shiba Inu community. The recently introduced blockchain-based platform offers users a smooth Web2 to Web3 transition for various use cases. This chronicle has aided the meme coin in broadening its horizon, thereby attracting further market attention. Can SHIB Price Breakout Amid Burn Surge? At the time of reporting, SHIB price traded at $0.00001866, showcasing a highly turbulent intraday movement. The top dog-themed meme coin’s intraday bottom and peak were recorded as $0.0000185 and $0.00001896, respectively. It’s noteworthy that the token faces a critical resistance at the $0.000019 level. Nevertheless, the massive Shiba Inu burn rate surge has uplifted the market sentiment for the asset despite the broader sideways price movement. On-Chain Metrics Signal Strong Market Support Renowned crypto market enthusiast Zach Humphries has posted on X, spotlighting bullish metrics for the meme token. Almost 74% of Shiba Inu holders have held onto their holdings for over a year, underscoring retained market interest in the asset despite price fluctuations. Further, nearly 47% of holders are making returns on the current price level. However, if these holders decide to sell ahead for profit-booking, volatility in price may be expected moving ahead. Nevertheless, current stats reflect a highly prominent market stand for the meme coin, with the Shiba Inu burn surge injecting additional bullishness on future prospects.

Investors are eyeing fast crypto returns from promising altcoins as the bull market gains momentum. BONK, a rising meme coin, continues attracting attention, while ICP pushes Web3 innovation. Meanwhile, Rollblock is reshaping online gaming with its blockchain-powered platform. As excitement builds, these three projects could deliver high crypto returns in the upcoming bull market. Which of these three should take your money? Find out here! Rollblock ignites a new era in crypto gaming with trust and rewards Rollblock is changing the online gaming industry by combining blockchain technology with fair play. With over 7,000 games, a growing sports league, and a focus on user security, the platform has gained attention as a promising crypto project. Investors believe Rollblock could grow significantly, as its presale has already raised almost $10 million. The platform stands out by preventing fraud and manipulation, which have become common in online gaming. Transactions are on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring that every bet remains transparent. Regular audits and a gaming license add more trust, making Rollblock a secure choice for players. Beyond gaming, Rollblock rewards its community through a unique revenue model. It reinvests part of its profits into buying back RBLK tokens. Some of these tokens are permanently removed from circulation, while others go to stakers. This model creates scarcity, which can support long-term value. With the presale gaining traction, investors see Rollblock as an opportunity for growth. The token price remains low at $0.052, but many expect a strong future performance. As demand increases, Rollblock’s vision for fair and secure gaming could set new standards in the industry. Internet Computer Protocol: Overcoming Challenges and Poised for Growth ICP aims to decentralize the internet by allowing applications to run entirely on a blockchain. Despite its ambitious goals, ICP has faced criticism for its complex structure and slow adoption. Some developers find ICP’s system challenging to work with, limiting the number of projects built on it. Concerns have also been raised about governance. The Network Nervous System, which controls updates and policies, has received backlash for centralization risks. Early investors saw a sharp drop in ICP’s price after its launch, raising doubts about its long-term stability. Still, ICP continues to attract developers and investors. It provides fast transactions and strong security, making it a potential leader in decentralized computing. As more applications adopt ICP, its value could rise, giving it a strong place in the blockchain world. Bonk’s journey in the Meme coin market BONK has established itself as a strong player in the meme coin space, representing community spirit and fun and drawing in supporters who believe in its long-term value. BONK grew rapidly after its airdrop to the Solana community, attracting traders and long-term holders. Despite losing attention sometimes, BONK has dedicated followers who believe in its potential. Market activity around BONK shows steady interest, though newer tokens continue to emerge. Some investors remain confident that BONK will maintain its place in the meme coin market. While ICP and BONK’s early hype has cooled, their strong base suggests they could still surprise traders. While both fight to regain their hype and dominance, Rollblock boasts the best and fastest crypto returns in 2025.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs drew in $588.22 million in inflows on Jan. 30 nearly a 540% jump from the inflows recorded the previous day. BlackRock’s IBIT took the lead once again as the fund attracted $321.5 million in inflows from investors. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with an inflow of $209.14 million while Bitwise’s BITB and ARK 21Shares’ ARKB saw an inflow of $22.98 million and $12.64 million. Notably, none of the BTC ETFs experienced outflows on the day. The following BTC ETFs also contributed to the positive momentum: Franklin Templeton’s EZBC: $6.11 million. VanEck’s HODL: $5.97 million. Invesco Galaxy’s BTCO: $5.24 million. Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin Trust: $4.65 million. The total trading volume of these investment products stood at $2.94 billion while the cumulative total net inflow surpassed $40 billion for the first time since their launch. The BTC ETFs now hold total net assets of $123.43 billion marking 5.94% of the total BTC supply. At press time, Bitcoin ( BTC ) was down 0.8% over the past day, exchanging hands at $104,267 per coin.

Fidelity’s FETH recorded inflows of $15.41 million, while Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust attracted $12.79 million. Grayscale’s ETHE fund was the only outlier of the day, reporting an outflow of $40.29 million, which offset a significant portion of the inflows. The remaining five Ethereum ETFs remained neutral.

According to a Jan. 30 update from the commission, the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF cleared its first regulatory hurdle after its 19b-4 filing was granted “accelerated approval.” It now awaits the regulator’s decision on its S-1 registration, the final step before trading can commence. A 19b-4 approval allows an exchange to list and trade a new financial product, while an S-1 registration is required for issuing new securities to the public. Bitwise filed for the ETF in November in a bid to offer investors exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum within a single product. The fund is structured to track the spot prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum, with asset weightings based on their relative market capitalizations. As of its latest filing, the allocation stood at approximately 83% Bitcoin and 17% Ethereum. The ETF will calculate these weightings by multiplying each asset’s circulating supply with a pricing benchmark. You might also like: Grayscale files for XRP ETF with NYSE While this is the first crypto ETP approval under the new SEC administration currently being led by acting chair Mark Udeya, it is the third joint Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF to receive a green light from the regulator. Since the fund’s structure closely mirrors previously approved products, such as the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs from Hashdex and Franklin Templeton, the filing was approved within the first deadline. “The structure of the Trust, the terms of its operation and the trading of its Shares, and the representations in the Exchange’s amended filing are substantially similar to those of the spot bitcoin and spot ether ETP proposals approved in prior Commission orders,” the SEC wrote. Bitwise is currently awaiting approval for two other products, including a Dogecoin ETF for which it filed an S-1 on Jan. 29, and the Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF that will invest in equity securities of publicly traded firms holding over 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasuries. Issuers are hopeful that the new SEC under President Donald Trump will be more open to a broader range of crypto investment products. As such, firms have started exploring ETFs beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. For instance, Tuttle Capital has filed for ten leveraged ETF products tracking a variety of altcoins like XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL), Official Trump (TRUMP), Melania Meme (MELANIA), etc. Other issuers like Grayscale and Canary have also filed for altcoin-based ETFs.

Crypto is booming, but not everyone is cheering. A $70 billion hedge fund says President Donald Trump ‘s support for cryptocurrencies could end in disaster. Elliott Management warns that crypto is at the center of a speculative frenzy, adding that prices have soared with “no substance” and that politicians backing crypto are playing a dangerous game. Per a Financial Times report on Jan. 30, the hedge fund warned in an investor letter that Trump’s actions endanger the crypto market as the “inevitable collapse” of the bubble “could wreak havoc in ways we cannot yet anticipate.” The fund sees parallels with the AI boom and sky-high stock prices, calling investors “a crowd of sports bettors.” But crypto, it says, is “ground zero” for the mania, thanks to its “proximity to the White House.” You might also like: Sam Bankman-Fried’s parents want Trump to pardon son: report The hedge fund, which managed $69.7 billion in assets under management in 2024, said in the letter that any official pushing alternatives to the greenback is making a “profoundly dangerous” move. Trump’s business ties to crypto are growing. He and his sons backed a platform called World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance fund, which already draw scrutiny over possible inside trading. In January, President Donald Trump and Melania Trump launched meme coins Official Trump ( TRUMP ) and Melania ( MELANIA ), fueling the crypto craze. Trump Media, where he owns a majority stake, also plans to invest up to $250 million in crypto, crypto.news reported earlier. Elliott’s founder, Paul Singer, is a longtime Republican donor. He gave $56 million in 2024 but has been critical of Trump’s policies. Still, he donated $5 million to a Trump PAC last election.

Investment advisory firm Tuttle Capital Management filed for a 2x leveraged Cardano ETF. This can be either very good or outright disastrous for Cardano (ADA). Cardano’s market cap increased significantly in 2024, but January 2023 saw the first Cardano market cap retraction since April last year. This is an uncertain time, and Cardano ETF or no Cardano ETF, investors do not like uncertainty. This is why investors are looking for safer havens in presales like the one currently on offer from the new online casino Rollblock (RBLK) . Cardano (ADA): 2x leverage Cardano ETF on the cards Connecticut-based wealth management firm Tuttle Capital Management has recently applied for a 2x leveraged Cardano ETF. This is exciting but brings dangerous waters. The net effect of this Cardano ETF is that any gains Cardano makes will be leveraged twice to double the profit. But, should the Cardano price tank, then the Cardano ETF will suffer twice the loss. Looking at Cardano’s performance critically, its market cap tells an interesting story. It reached its peak in September 2021, when its market cap reached $77.4 billion. Since then, it’s been all downhill for Cardano. Cardano’s market cap plunged to less than $9 billion in September 2023 before having quite a lucrative 2024. And now the market cap is down again… This illustrates great market uncertainty, and one must have a high-risk profile to want to enter a 2x leveraged Cardano ETF. Yes, there is money to be made, but in rough seas, a safe harbor may be a better option. Rollblock (RBLK): The safer investment in uncertain times. When the markets are up and down like a roller coaster, the wise investor seeks to escape the volatility until the markets become more predictable. Presale offers are the best way to ride out market uncertainty because the prices are fixed, and returns are guaranteed. Rollblock, a new online gambling platform, is taking the lion’s share of investor interest here and has amassed almost $10 million in liquidity. Rollblock’s big drawcard is that it is a going concern, providing players with over 7,000 games with live dealers, sports betting, and a host of other options. Rollblock’s presale is an investment opportunity to get in on an endeavor with a proven track record. And an ‘investment’ it is! Like traditional investments, Rollblock offers its token holders a weekly payout of the casino income. Not many cryptocurrencies offer that! It is literally money for nothing, with the Rollblock scheme rewarding investors for merely holding the token. And since the Rollblock product offering is not subservient to the swings and roundabouts of market whims, the Rollblock investment is one of the most stable options one can find in turbulent times. Conclusion The Cardano ETF option may look lucrative, but with its wild market cap fluctuations and the crypto markets unable to pick a direction, it may be wise to sail close to the shore for a while. This is where the Rollblock crypto presale comes in. It’s a safe haven for serious investors. Rollblock is now available at $0.052 during presale directly from the website.

OFFICIALMAGACOIN Just Shattered Expectations,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-100-turn-into-1-million-officialmagacoin-just-shattered-expectations/,"While Bitcoin (BTC) proved it’s possible by delivering exponential returns to early investors, the spotlight now shines on OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a newcomer that could replicate such success. With a presale price under $0.20 and a rapid rise in popularity, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is capturing the imagination of crypto enthusiasts who believe that $300 today could turn into $999,000 in the near future. Why OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Transform Your Investment 1. Early-Stage Opportunity OFFICIALMAGACOIN is still in its presale phase, offering a ground-floor opportunity for investors to buy in before the token gains mainstream attention. This is the stage where gains of 1,000x or more become achievable, as seen with Bitcoin in its early days. 2. Exclusive AvailabilityUnlike widely distributed coins, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand, ensuring that early adopters benefit as interest surges. 3. Record-Breaking Presale SuccessRaising over $1 million in presale funds in record time, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its appeal among investors. Such strong initial support is a hallmark of projects poised for explosive growth. 4. Massive Growth PotentialExperts are predicting OFFICIALMAGACOIN could follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps, transforming small investments into extraordinary returns. With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever. How It Stacks Up Against SOL, MATIC, KAS, and BTC Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its days of exponential growth are behind it. Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum OFFICIALMAGACOIN is generating. Don’t Miss Out on OFFICIALMAGACOIN The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but OFFICIALMAGACOIN might just be that opportunity. With its affordable price, exclusivity, and massive growth potential, it’s a must-watch for 2025. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and stay updated on their journey via Twitter/X.

Meanwhile, Web3 casino Rollblock is positioned to mimic Pepe’s legendary rally and become one of the hottest players of the year. Find out what makes this newcomer special and why analysts are tipping it as the next 100x gem. Rollblock: The GambleFi Revolution Is Here By leveraging blockchain technology, Rollblock tackles the many issues plaguing online gambling for years, most notably, the obsolete security protocols and lack of transparency. Rollblock wants to bring back user trust by implementing top-tier DeFi-powered functionalities to enhance the gaming experience while removing any possibility of manipulating bets once placed. 45,000 players have already made Rollblock their platform of choice, and hundreds more sign up every day. Over 7000 games await newcomers, ranging from all-time favorites such as blackjack and roulette, to live games and AI-powered exclusives. In addition to this, Rollblock recently introduced a brand-new sports betting platform, which in turn led to a 600% surge in new registrations in December alone. One of Rollblock’s most intriguing features is its revenue-sharing mechanism, which will see users earn some of the highest APY on the market. To achieve this, Rollblock will spend up to 30% of the casino revenue to buy $RBLK from the open market. This amount is then split between recurring staking rewards and token burns at a 40/60 ratio, allowing holders to benefit from passive income and scarcity-driven appreciation. Pepe Rebounds, Is This The Reversal Investors Have Been Waiting For? After a retest of the $0.000011 support, Pepe bounced back with a 12.5% intraday increase, showing impressive strength. Although its weekly and monthly losses currently stand at 15% and 28%, respectively, the worst seems to have passed, as selling pressure is diminishing and buyers are taking control. This is also reflected by the 10.4% surge in Open Interest, indicating growing confidence among investors. Analyst Prorok has shared an intriguing chart reading that draws a parallel between Pepe’s current price action and its 2024 performance. He asserts that if history were to repeat, Pepe could soon experience a near-vertical breakout and potentially reclaim the $0.000028 all-time high by February. Once this happens, the road ahead will be clear for Pepe to enter bullish price discovery and conquer new peaks.

Table of Contents Dogecoin hype: Is $2 within reach? Lightchain AI: Next-gen blockchain solution Why Lightchain AI is the smart investment choice Dogecoin continues to captivate the crypto community with its lighthearted approach and meme-powered popularity.

Among the rising stars in the crypto space is Lightchain AI, a new platform currently priced at $0.00525 during its presale, with over $13.5 million raised, a clear indicator of its potential. Dogecoin hype: Is $2 within reach? Dogecoin’s success has been fueled by its strong community and widespread appeal, but its path to reaching $2 faces challenges. As a meme-based token, DOGE’s value relies heavily on hype, celebrity endorsements, and social media trends rather than intrinsic utility. This makes its price highly volatile and dependent on external factors. Additionally, the cryptocurrency market is becoming increasingly competitive, with tokens offering advanced technology and real-world applications gaining more attention. As a result, Dogecoin’s speculative nature raises questions for investors about its long-term potential. Many are left wondering whether to continue holding DOGE or to diversify into projects with stronger fundamentals and practical use cases in order to secure more stable and sustainable returns.

Since the blunder, the ROSS token is now up more than 700%. According to Arkham , the two wallet addresses are listed on the donation site FreeRoss.org, which is run by the Silk Road creator’s family to get him released from prison. The Solana ( SOL ) addresses received 50% of the token supply from the developer of pump.fun token, ROSS. ROSS is a meme coin that was created after Ross Ulbricht was released from prison after President Trump pardoned him on Jan. 22. The token is currently on the rise, going up by more than 735% in the past 24 hours, according to DEX Screener . On Jan. 30, the wallets holding 50% of the ROSS token supply “accidentally nuked the price” of 5% of the pump.fun supply when it tried to provide liquidity on Raydium. Thus, selling the tokens at a price much lower than the current market price.

MEV bots or maximal extractable value bots are deployed to look for opportunities to make profit in the market and can automatically carry out trading activities, without missing a beat. After losing $1.5 million worth of ROSS tokens, the Ross Ulbricht-linked wallets were not deterred. The operator tried again, attempting to add single-sided liquidity so that it could sell the meme coins off passively. However, they accidentally created a pool with Raydium Constant-Product Market Maker instead of Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker; once again selling the tokens at the wrong price. This time the mistake was even more fatal, as roughly 35% of the Ross Ulbricht token supply was lost and snatched up by another MEV bot. The bot sold the tokens for over $600,000, dragging the meme coin’s price down by around 90%. The wallets reportedly still hold around 10% of the token supply, worth around $200,000. Since the disastrous sell-off, ROSS has regained its footing. At the time of writing, the token has gone up as high as 735% in the past day. It is currently trading hands at a price of $0.0104 with a trading volume of $14.8 million.

One of the hardest hit among them was Core Scientific Inc. In just the last five days, the Core Scientific stock has slumped down around 25%. The stock currently trades at around $12. But the Chinese startup driven decline in Core Scientific stock may be overblown, according to Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani. Down more than 30% versus its high in late November, shares of the Austin headquartered miner trading at a deep discount at writing, which warrants an investment for significant potential returns in 2025, he told clients in a research note today. Core Scientific stock could return to $17 Bernstein recommends loading up on Core Scientific stock on the weakness as it could climb back to the $17 level by the end of 2025. Analyst Chhugani called the Nasdaq listed firm a leader in hybrid miners or companies that have an active bitcoin mining as well as an artificial intelligence business. CORZ has a first-mover advantage over its rivals with a $6.7 billion deal with Nvidia-backed CoreWeave in 2024, he added. Our top pick, CORZ offers ready power access and data centre buildout to HPC cloud partners such as CoreWeave, who in turn are contracted by hyperscalers and AI labs. Core Scientific shares do not currently pay a dividend though. CORZ is being valued as pure-play bitcoin miner Core Scientific is currently trading at an enterprise value of about $2.7 million per megawatt – more like a pure-play bitcoin miner than a hybrid. The company based out of Austin, Texas has about 70% of its capacity allocated to AI. Still, data centres don’t seem to be baked into its valuation at writing, Chhugani argued in his report. Bitcoin miners are the second derivative of the AI capex story. They have a 12-18 months finite window to build a hybrid data centre business, while the hyperscalers capex remains persistent. Versus its 52-week low, Core Scientific stock is up a whopping 350% at writing. How Core Scientific did in its latest reported quarter Analyst Gautam Chhugani remains super bullish on Core Scientific stock even though the company’s third-quarter financial results in November were not all that encouraging. CORZ saw its revenue tank 16% on a year-over-year basis to $95 million as its loss also widened to $455 million in Q3. At the time, chief executive Adam Sullivan told investors: Based on our existing pipeline and growing list of potential new clients, we now have line of sight to a total of more than one gigawatt of critical IT load to contract, significantly expanding the value we can create for our shareholders. Note that Bernstein is not the only one among Wall Street firms to take a bullish stance on bitcoin miners following the DeepSeek driven decline. Analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald and Piper Sandler also called the sell-off overdone in their research notes this week.

Ethereum’s breakout could trigger a broader surge in altcoin prices this cycle. Lower interest rates and institutional demand may fuel the next altcoin season. The cryptocurrency market has seen extended bear cycles, especially in altcoins. Because of this, many analysts think that the upcoming bull cycle could be the longest and most significant in history. According to Michaël van de Poppe, an analyst, Bitcoin could reach $500,000, and Ethereum might surge to $20,000. If this happens, a new altcoin season could be around the corner, bringing massive price surges across the market.

Analysts are expecting strong reversals across the board with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) leading the charge. Meanwhile, newcomer Rollblock is making waves in the crypto gambling space and could soon take the spotlight as thousands of investors are rushing to secure an allocation in the viral RBLK presale. Rollblock Grabs Attention With Passive Income Model Community-backed casino Rollblock is set to disrupt the $500 billion gambling industry with its cutting-edge framework that bridges the gap between DeFi and online gambling. This project aims to deliver a high-end casino experience supported by robust security features powered by blockchain technology. Rollblock ensures that no bet can be altered, as all transactions are immutably and permanently recorded, setting the bar higher than ever in terms of transparency and safety The platform is fully audited by SolidProof, licensed by Anjouan Gambling, and compliant with the latest gambling regulations. Over 45,000 players have joined the Rollblock ranks and are enjoying the 7,000 games immediately available, ranging from all-time classics such as poker and roulette to brand-new AI-driven exclusives. Additionally, sports betting was introduced recently as well, leading to a 600% spike in new registrations. One of the most intriguing features of the Rollblock ecosystem is the lucrative revenue-sharing mechanism. The casino will spend up to 30% of its weekly profits to repurchase RBLK tokens from the open market. 60% of this amount is burned, which increases deflationary pressure, priming Rollblock for sustainable price surges. The remaining 40% is distributed to holders as recurring staking rewards, allowing them to also enjoy the benefit of scarcity-driven appreciation. Ethereum Is In The Green As Buyers Step In Ethereum has started showing signs of life again after a prolonged descent toward the $3,100 zone. At the time of writing, Ethereum sells for $3,200, following a 2% intraday increase. The chart shows that Ethereum is moving within the bounds of a bullish falling wedge pattern, and analysts predict a 35% rally if it breaks the upper trendline. Historically, February has been Ethereum’s strongest month, averaging 17% returns, with a 46.2% gain last year. On-chain metrics show bullish momentum, as daily active addresses hit a yearly high of 588,000, and major investors, including Trump’s World Liberty Financial, increased their Ethereum holdings substantially. Exchange net flows suggest buying pressure, and the Stochastic Oscillator is hinting at a reversal. If Ethereum clears resistance at $4,000, it could gain space velocity and soar above $5,000 in the upcoming months. Solana Reclaims Key Resistance At press time, Solana (SOL) trades at $240 following a 3.6% daily upsurge, regaining ground after a drop below the $230 support. This rebound is accompanied by a 46% jump in volume, with over $6.3 billion worth of Solana changing hands across platforms. Cboe BZX Exchange has refiled Solana ETF applications for Bitwise, VanEck, and other prominent fund managers after the SEC’s previous rejection in 2024. The shift in regulatory leadership under the acting SEC has sparked optimism, as the pro-crypto stance contrasts with former Chair Gary Gensler’s restrictive approach. Polymarket bettors estimate an 86% chance of Solana ETF approval in 2025, with JPMorgan analysts predicting SOL ETFs could attract $3–6 billion in assets, potentially outperforming Ethereum ETFs. If Solana ETFs hit the markets in 2025, analysts expect the fresh capital to propel Solana above $300 and possibly reach a peak of $500 at the height of the bull run. Discover The Rollblock Presale, One Of The Most Explosive Plays Of 2025 Right now, RBLK is priced at just $0.052 with nearly $10 million raised in the ongoing presale.

If Ethereum overcomes the $4,000 resistance, it could accelerate and climb above $5,000 in the coming months. Solana Breaks Through Key Resistance Levels Currently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $240 after a 3.6% daily increase, reclaiming its position after dipping below the $230 support level. This recovery is matched by a 46% increase in trading volume, with over $6.3 billion in Solana transactions occurring across various platforms.

Family seeks clemency after Ulbricht’s release,https://invezz.com/news/2025/01/31/will-trump-pardon-sam-bankman-fried-family-seeks-clemency-after-ulbrichts-release/,"Sam Bankman-Fried’s family is actively exploring avenues for a presidential pardon as the FTX founder serves a 25-year sentence for fraud. His parents, both legal scholars, have engaged with lawyers and individuals linked to Donald Trump’s inner circle, aiming to secure leniency, as per a Bloomberg report. The president’s history of controversial pardons, including that of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, has fuelled speculation that Bankman-Fried could be next in line for clemency. While the FTX founder continues to appeal his conviction, his defence hinges on claims that customer losses were largely mitigated. His legal team argues that the sentencing was disproportionate. His legal team is expected to argue that other executives involved in corporate collapses received significantly lighter penalties. This narrative could shape efforts to win public or political support for clemency. Trump’s history of white-collar pardons fuels speculation Bankman-Fried’s pursuit of clemency follows a broader trend in Trump’s approach to criminal justice, particularly regarding non-violent financial crimes. The president has demonstrated a willingness to override conventional legal channels, often granting pardons based on personal appeals rather than Justice Department recommendations. Ulbricht’s case set a precedent, as his life sentence for running the Silk Road marketplace was commuted by Trump. The controversial move was widely supported within libertarian circles, with advocates arguing that his punishment was excessive. The Bankman-Fried camp is now leveraging this argument, claiming that his sentencing does not align with the financial impact of his actions. Another factor at play is Trump’s stance on cryptocurrency. While the president has been critical of digital assets, his recent engagement with the crypto community suggests a shift. Bankman-Fried’s legal team may attempt to frame his prosecution as part of a broader regulatory crackdown that aligns with government overreach, a narrative that has previously resonated with Trump’s base. Despite this, public sentiment remains largely against Bankman-Fried. While Ulbricht’s supporters painted him as a libertarian idealist, Bankman-Fried is viewed as a privileged insider who mismanaged billions. His high-profile donations to Democratic politicians could also work against him, making a Trump pardon more difficult to achieve. Political calculations could shape Bankman-Fried’s fate Despite the speculation, securing a pardon remains a formidable challenge. Unlike Ulbricht, whose support base championed libertarian ideals, Bankman-Fried has been widely vilified as the face of corporate fraud. However, Trump’s unpredictable approach to pardons leaves room for uncertainty. His administration previously granted clemency to individuals who were not aligned with his political interests, sometimes in response to public campaigns or lobbying efforts. Bankman-Fried’s parents, who are deeply embedded in the legal community, may attempt to navigate these networks to bolster their case. There is no confirmation of formal outreach to Trump’s team, but discussions within legal circles suggest that Bankman-Fried’s camp is weighing its options. Trump’s decisions on clemency have often been influenced by media attention and political calculations. If Bankman-Fried’s supporters can craft a compelling argument, the case could gain traction.

Ueda told the Parliament that the recent increase in the consumer price index above the 2% target has been led by cost-push factors such as elevated food and fuel prices that will likely dissipate. The comments come a week after the bank raised the benchmark borrowing cost to 0.5%, the highest in over 16 years, and could assuage fears of a yen-led risk-off in global markets, including cryptocurrencies, as observed in August. The governor, however, maintained that rate hikes will continue if the economy evolves as expected.

Although profit and losses are common in the industry, this happened with a crypto liquidity blunder on Raydium, taking the crypto community by surprise. Let’s discuss how this happened. Ross Ulbricht Lost $12M While Providing Liquidity To Raydium Ross Ulbricht was recently pardoned by Donald Trump after being convicted in 2015 of money laundering and drug trafficking conspiracies. During these 11 years, the crypto community continuously supported him. They even created the ROSS crypto coin to support him after his release and shared 50% of the token’s supply with him, which contributed to this $12M loss. According to Arkham Intelligence , Ulbricht or the wallet controller ran two separate transactions in an attempt to liquidate these tokens on January 29. To his surprise, a critical error was made where the person mistakenly created the Constant-Product Market Maker (CPMM) pool instead of the Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker (CLMM), which allows the liquidity providers to set a specific price for the trade. However, this mistake caused the CPMM to immediately make the ROSS tokens available for trade at unfavorable prices. This cost the Silk Road Founder $12M and heavily impacted the ROSS price. Ross Token Price Crashed 90% The ROSS/SOL trading pair chart shows a massive 90% crash caused by this crypto liquidity blunder. According to the chart, the price dropped from $0.039 SOL per ROSS to $0.0036 SOL, a 90-92% drop within just two hours. At present, the token trades at $0.0005209 and is showing a 55% decline on the weekly charts. However, despite that, the token is attracting investors’ attention, as its trading volume is continuously rising. It is currently at $508.27K after a 24% surge. As the Silk Road founder lost 40% of the ROSS token’s supply, the massive liquidity unloading resulted in a constant price drop. However, a few exploited the situation, profiting from this drop. MEV Bot Turned $556 into $643K With Ross Ulbricht Mishap This first transaction from Yblirict’s account became an opportunity for the Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) bot. The bot spent around $556 to buy 398.6M( 5% of the ROSS Token supply), which would have been worth $1.5M in regular price. Soon after that, the bot sold it for 2,669 SOL ($643k), making a profit of nearly $600k. This incident highlights the high risk associated with crypto trading. The market has many factors and complexities, which need to be considered and learned to stay profitable or at least minimize loss. Investors should have proper technical knowledge of the industry to avoid such mishaps. Bottom Line Donald Trump’s presidential pardon freed the Silk Road founder after 11 years. This Ross Ulbricht news has been bullish for the ROSS token, pushing its performance for this good. Interestingly, even before this pardon, the ROSS price jumped 22% . However, it crashed 50% over the week after Ulbricht or his wallet controller mistakenly availed 40% of the total supply at a low price. With that, Ulbricht faced a $12M loss; meanwhile, an MEV bot made $600k in profits.

The token is attempting to recover a key support level, which could set the stage for a retest of its latest all-time high (ATH). Following its recovery, an expert at VanEck has forecasted a 300% surge in SUI’s price this year. Related Reading: Dogwifhat (WIF) Surges 16% Amid Las Vegas Sphere Project Expectation, Breakout Coming? SUI Retests Key Support Level The crypto market is moving toward a green end-of-week after a bloody Monday. The correction saw Bitcoin lose the $100,000 zone, and most cryptocurrencies significantly retrace from their January highs. Amid the pullback, SUI lost the $4 support for the first time since December, dropping to its lowest price in over a month. The cryptocurrency has been one of the strongest altcoins this cycle, leading the market throughout the Q2 2024 retraces and Q3 rally. This year, SUI has also risen as one of the leading cryptocurrencies, surging above the $5 barrier for the first time and hitting its latest all-time high (ATH) of $5.36 at the start of the month. Since then, the token has hovered between the $4.05 to $5.20 price range. After Monday’s fall to $3.49, the $4 mark acted as resistance, with the cryptocurrency failing to break past it until today. SUI jumped 9.8% to recover the key support zone, bouncing another 5% to $4.2 on Thursday morning. Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt noted that the token is testing its ascending level again after losing it as support. This ascending line has been a key support level over the last few months but acted as resistance after the recent correction. To turn this line back into support and continue its ascending trajectory, SUI must hold above the $4.18 mark. Reclaiming the ascending line could also propel SUI’s price to retest the $5 barrier. SUI’s Price Eyes Double-Digits This Year Patrick Bush, senior investment analyst at asset manager VanEck, shared his outlook for SUI’s long-term performance in a recent competitive analysis against Aptos (APT), which are often compared. According to the analyst, SUI is set to outperform APT this year due to the Network’s advantages, efficiency, and scaling potential, which has translated into a better-priced DeFi ecosystem to market makers: We believe the evidence supports Sui over Aptos due to its performance advantages and scaling potential. We find that It currently offers capabilities that are not replicated in Aptos. Among these are Local Fee Markets, Pilot Fish, and Fast Path. Additionally, Sui may offer a set of technical capabilities and economics that prove more attractive to market markers, resulting in a better-priced DeFi ecosystem. The analysis underscores that SUI’s attractiveness has drawn token investors and application builders, resulting in a better token performance and a more vibrant ecosystem. Related Reading: Bitcoin Preparing For A February Rally? Analyst Says New High Is Two Weeks Away Bush also pointed out that the cryptocurrency leads in retail investment: “In Fact, in the last 90 days, global search interest for Sui was higher than it was for Solana on 17 days and higher than Ethereum on 16 days,” he noted. The analyst projected the token to reach a market capitalization of $61 billion by the end of 2025, which would see the price rising to around $16, a 300% increase from the current range. As of this writing, SUI trades at $4.13, a 14% increase in the daily timeframe.

Accordingly, leading cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has reintroduced on-chain crypto staking for US customers in 39 states and 2 territories. “Starting today, customers residing in eligible states will be able to securely stake eligible tokens through Kraken Pro. These customers will be able to participate in bond staking, which locks/ties crypto assets to the network for a set period of time.” At this point, Kraken has allowed staking for 17 altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and Cardano (ADA). This move comes after Kraken shut down its staking service in early 2023 and settled with the SEC over allegations that it sold unregistered securities, paying the SEC $30 million. Mark Greenberg, Global Head of Consumer at Kraken, said: “The launch of this new staking product in the US is an extremely positive development not only for Kraken, but also for the entire US crypto space. “We are excited to bring back a brand new product that will allow BD customers to continue staking with Kraken and play a key role in strengthening the fundamental security of blockchain networks.” *This is not investment advice.

Svenson tells his 82,300 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin possesses more upside potential despite the bearish sentiment in the crypto market which he attributes to the severe price correction witnessed on some altcoins over the recent past. “So needless to say, Bitcoin’s doing extremely well despite the sentiment that you guys may have been feeling or seeing across the market. …we do have room to move up in this cycle it clearly didn’t just begin and it’s also not coming to an end. We’re in the middle and we’re near the really exciting part.” The analyst says that based on history, the “really exciting part” of the cycle for Bitcoin starts 40 weeks after the halving. The fourth halving event occurred on April 19th of 2024 and it’s nearly 41 weeks since. “Forty weeks after the 2012 halving, things got really bullish and then the bear market begins 80 weeks after the 2012 halving. Move over to 2016 halving – 40 weeks later things got really bullish, bear market begins 80 weeks after the 2016 halving. Go over here to 2020 halving, things were already really bullish until the 40th week in the last cycle although the altcoin cycle began at the 40th week, Bitcoin sort of went sideways but altcoins got most bullish at this point. And then 80 weeks later the bear market begins. Just like the other cycles.” Source: Kevin Svenson/YouTube According to Svenson, the price of Bitcoin could rise by up to 35% from the current level. “I think that we’re going to get probably another major parabolic swing to a much higher target before this parabolic trend actually ends. So I’m very bullish $124,000, $134,000, $142,000… these prices seem very possible to me.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,023 at time of writing.

Errol Musk, alongside business partner Nathan Browne, will officially back the “MUSK IT” token with the ambitious goal of establishing the Musk Institute, a new for-profit think tank that Errol aims to spearhead, per Fortune . The Musk Institute plans to “go beyond rockets” and build flying vehicles and other scientific pursuits. It is unclear how Elon Musk will be involved in this, if at all. ""I’m the head of the family. It really started with me in our family—I’ve been ‘Musking It’ for years,” he told Fortune, dismissing any concerns about leveraging his surname for this project. The Musk Institute plans to collaborate with nobility in the UAE to foster innovative engineering projects, though specifics on timelines or project details are still forthcoming. A Middle East-based crypto company initially launched the token in December. Errol and Browne were later onboarded and attached themselves after conceiving the idea for the Musk Institute. MUSK IT boasts a $25 million market capitalization as of Friday, CoinMarketCap data shows, with $79 million in trading volumes and a 130% price rise in the past 24 hours. The token was issued on Solana platform Pump.fun, its contract address shows, with one billion tokens in circulation. Token data shows 44,000 MUSK IT holders and the top ten addresses hold over 20% of the token’s total supply — cumulatively worth over $7 million at current prices. It zoomed from 1 cent to 20 cents shortly after Fortune’s publication on the low liquidity and muted trading volumes and is back to just over 2 cents during Asian afternoon hours. However, the specifics of how ""Musk It"" will operate, particularly its ""tokenomics,"" remain shrouded in mystery. Neither Errol Musk, Browne nor the Musk It website provided detailed insights into the token's structure or distribution plans. Errol’s promotion is the latest in a long list of so-termed celebrity tokens, or typically short-lived memecoins that ride the hype of a known personality before eventually dying out. As such, one of the conditions laid out by Errol and Browne before the partnership was that the MUSKIT token “cannot be a pump and dump.” But despite the distance from Elon Musk’s projects, the Musk It site prominently features several of his innovations — from a SpaceX rocket to a Tesla Cybertruck with only a “Mars Base; Opening Soon” note on the homepage .",Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-31 08:07:16

Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum could not hold above $3,300, and its price fell by 4% this week. However, sellers did not seem determined enough to break below $3,000, which is currently acting as a key support level. In the past three weeks, the price action was rather flat with ETH unable to move much beyond its current level. Any attempt at breaking above $3,300 was quickly rejected. This long consolidation could be followed by a major breakout from this range in the future. Looking ahead, Ethereum’s momentum has turned bearish on the weekly MACD, which could indicate that sellers may continue to put pressure on the asset. If the key support at $3,000 is lost, then bears will have the upper hand and control the price action. Chart by Tradingview Ripple ( XRP ) XRP managed to return above $3 after a brief fall under this key level on Monday. Nevertheless, the price closed the week with a 2% loss, and the support at $3 appears weak at the time of this post. The key resistance is found at $3.3. Another fall under $3 may be interpreted as bearish by the market and push the asset into a more significant correction after its massive pump from late 2024. Buyers will need to show strength here if they want to avoid a longer correction. Looking ahead, XRP is found at a crossroads. The bullish momentum has faded, and the buy volume has been decreasing for weeks. If nothing changes, sellers will have the upper hand in the days to come. Chart by Tradingview Cardano (ADA) ADA struggled this week after its price fell by 6% and is now under $1 again. The key support at $0.9 managed to hold and stop the asset from falling lower, but the momentum remains somewhat bearish. Similarly to XRP, ADA lacks the momentum to make new highs at the time of this post and is found in a dangerous position of losing its current support. If $0.9 falls, then the next level of support will be found at $0.73. Looking ahead, Cardano’s momentum appears to be shifting bearish. The weekly MACD is also quickly approaching a bearish cross, which would make a longer correction likely and encourage sellers to press forward. Chart by Tradingview Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin fell by almost 2% this week but continues to show resilience even if it was unable to maintain a price above $690, which is currently acting as a resistance. The key support is found at $605, and this level may be revisited in the future if the overall market remains bearish. Even if that happens, BNB will still show an uptrend with higher highs and higher lows. Looking ahead, BNB appears to consolidate around $600 and is well-positioned to make new highs should the market turn bullish again in the future. For that to happen, the asset will have to break above $690. Chart by Tradingview Solana (SOL) Solana closes the week with an 8.5% loss. This correction is normal, considering its price had a major rally in early January. Should the correction continue, the most important support level is found at $206. If SOL hopes to make new highs, it has to break the key resistance at $260. So far, this cryptocurrency has been unable to close a weekly candle above this level. Until that happens, a new all-time high appears unlikely. Looking ahead, it is best to be patient and wait for the correction to end. Buyers could return later to see Solana attempt a breakout above $260. However, until then, the key support at $206 could be revisited.

The Solana futures market is set to introduce contracts where the standard size is 100 SOL, equating to a value today of $23,700. Additionally, there will be smaller contracts available, known as “nano” Solana futures, with each contract representing 5 SOL. According to a Jan. 30 filing with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Solana ( SOL ) futures contracts will be offered on a monthly cash-settled basis and will go on offer from Feb. 18. 2025. You might also like: Trump’s crypto ties could cause ‘havoc,’ $70b hedge fund warns The newly offered structure will allow traders to engage with Solana price movements through futures trading, offering flexibility in investment size depending on whether one opts for the standard or the nano contracts. As per the filing, Coinbase Derivatives revealed that the position limits on offer for the Solana futures will be 30 percent lower than those offered on its Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures, as part of its efforts to manage liquidity and volatility. Referencing Solana’s heightened volatility relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), an excerpt from the filing reads: Solana’s current 30-day volatility is approximately 3.9%. In similar timeframes, Bitcoin and Ethereum’s 30-day realized volatilities are around 2.3% and 3.1% respectively. When compared to other digital assets, Solana’s volatility is moderately higher, reflecting its emerging market position and the rapid growth of its ecosystem. Benchmark rates for settlement will be provided by the German index provider MarketVector Indexes GmbH, which will have effect of placing the proposed Solana futures under the regulatory supervision of Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority . The introduction of Solana futures comes at a time when the US president Donald Trump’s executive order declaring crypto as a “national priority” has triggered a rush of positive crypto market sentiment. Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan recently suggested that the executive order and the general warming of regulatory ties with the crypto industry could break Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle, and keep the current bull run going into 2026.

Experts suggest it might reach $5 ahead of Stellar (XLM) achieving similar success. With the project gaining momentum, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of crypto investors, promising considerable potential for those who invest early. Analysts highlight its swift growth, which could outpace major players like Stellar, offering substantial returns for early adopters. Reasons Analysts Expect Lightchain AI to Outperform Stellar (XLM) Experts believe Lightchain AI will surpass Stellar (XLM) due to its innovative AI system and intelligent token framework. By integrating real-time AI processing with a decentralized network, Lightchain AI enhances data management and decision-making compared to traditional blockchain solutions. Its transparent AI system allows users to verify the integrity of AI models, ensuring fair and open operations for decentralized applications (dApps). The tokenomics of Lightchain AI include staking rewards, a deflationary model, and incentives for developers to contribute to the ecosystem. The LCAI token serves as a utility token for staking, transaction fees, and compensating contributors. These features ensure sustainable growth over time, in contrast to Stellar's narrower focus on payments. With its AI-centric approach, Lightchain AI is well-positioned for market success. Key Factors Driving Lightchain AI's $0.005 to $5 Potential Priced at just $0.005 in its current presale, Lightchain AI has attracted significant interest from investors, with some experts predicting it could climb to $5. The primary drivers of this anticipated growth are its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and decentralized governance, which address scalability and efficiency challenges faced by other blockchain platforms. As the demand for intelligent decentralized applications and innovative AI solutions grows, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The platform's expanding ecosystem, combined with its low presale price, makes Lightchain AI an enticing opportunity for early investors looking to maximize their returns in the blockchain sector. The Growth Path and Potential of Lightchain AI for Early Investors Lightchain AI's presale is building unstoppable momentum, and the reasons are clear. By merging state-of-the-art AI with blockchain technology, this platform is attracting astute early backers eager to take advantage of the potential for significant returns.

The approval was given just 45 days after the filing, bypassing the standard 240-day period. On January 30, the SEC approved NYSE Arca’s 19b-4 filing , allowing Bitwise’s ETF to be listed and traded. The fund will allocate assets based on the market capitalization of Bitcoin and Ethereum, holding only these two cryptocurrencies along with cash reserves. The SEC stated that the ETF was eligible for accelerated approval due to its similarity to previously approved spot crypto ETFs. “The Commission finds good cause to approve the Proposal prior to the 30th day after the date of publication of notice of Amendment No. 126 in the Federal Register,” the agency announced. This decision follows the SEC’s approval of the first-ever combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs from Hashdex and Franklin Templeton in December 2024. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart commented on X (formerly Twitter) that the approval was expected given prior similar filings. Senior Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas agreed, noting that even under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, this outcome was predictable. Balchunas also pointed out the unusually fast approval, emphasizing that it took only 45 days instead of the standard 240-day review. “I really want to interpret this as a sign the new SEC will be faster, but no way to know really. Litecoin on deck, know more soon,” he added. The SEC's approval process for this ETF began when NYSE Arca filed the 19b-4 form on November 26, 2024. Following a public comment period and an amendment on January 21, 2025, the regulator decided to expedite approval. This marks another step forward for Bitwise in the crypto ETF sector. The investment firm has also applied for Solana ( SOL ), XRP (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) ETFs. However, due to meme coins’ speculative nature, their approval remains uncertain. Meanwhile, the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund is still under review. This fund is designed to track the performance of the top cryptocurrencies, potentially expanding Bitwise’s influence in the digital asset market. With the SEC showing a willingness to approve crypto-related ETFs at a faster pace, the industry is closely watching how future filings, including Litecoin, will be handled.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|ETH|MARKET|DOGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-31 09:04:52

Though XRP remains a hot topic, astute investors are now eyeing a new opportunity with significant growth potential - Lightchain AI . Currently priced at $0.005625 and having gathered over $13.2 million during its presale, Lightchain AI is being touted as the next breakthrough in the crypto world, with early investors anticipating substantial returns by the first quarter of 2025. Ripple's Recent Surge - A Sign of Future Trends? The recent surge in Ripple’s price has brought renewed excitement for XRP as it strengthens its position as a frontrunner in cross-border transactions. Ripple’s collaborations with financial entities and its dedication to addressing global payment inefficiencies have bolstered investor trust, elevating the token’s market value. Although Ripple’s growth highlights its market strength, its expansion could face challenges as the blockchain industry transforms. Investors seeking prospects beyond XRP’s current trajectory are now investigating new ventures like Lightchain AI , which blend innovation and scalability with early-stage growth promise. Lightchain AI - Emerging Leader for 2025 Lightchain AI is rapidly attracting attention for its innovative take on blockchain technology. By merging artificial intelligence with decentralized networks, the platform tackles crucial issues in sectors like data analysis, automation, and enterprise operations. Its AI-Driven Developer Tools empower businesses to enhance workflows and build smart decentralized applications (dApps), distinguishing it from conventional blockchain solutions. The presale has been impressive, amassing over $13.2 million, and experts are already predicting notable gains for early backers. With its strong emphasis on innovation and a developer-centric platform, Lightchain AI is set to achieve significant growth in the near future. Converting $230 to $15,000 - Is It Achievable? The cryptocurrency market is familiar with dramatic increases, and Lightchain AI’s early-stage pricing offers an enticing opportunity for those seeking substantial returns. At its current presale rate of $0.005625, investing $230 translates to about 40,888 tokens. If Lightchain AI’s value rises to $0.367 as analysts predict, this $230 investment could soar to $15,000—a phenomenal return. These forecasts are not outlandish, given the platform’s cutting-edge features and the increasing need for AI in blockchain solutions. As Lightchain AI’s adoption rises, so does its potential to become a major force in the cryptocurrency arena. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",More News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-01-31 09:05:19

As the leading cryptocurrency hovers near key levels, questions arise: Has Bitcoin already reached its market top, or is there still room for another explosive rally? Historical data, on-chain metrics, and technical indicators provide contrasting signals, making this a critical moment for Bitcoin’s trajectory. Has #Bitcoin $BTC reached a market top, or is another monster rally still ahead? Let’s dive in! — Ali (@ali_charts) January 30, 2025 While some indicators suggest the market may be peaking, others point to significant upside potential. Factors such as realized profits, miner selling, declining capital inflows, and reduced network activity raise concerns. However, historical cycle patterns and technical models indicate that Bitcoin might still have room to run before reaching its ultimate top. Selling Pressure and Capital Outflows Signal Market Weakness A key concern among investors is the rising selling pressure in the market. Historically, Bitcoin market tops have coincided with significant spikes in realized profits. December 2024 saw over $3 billion in profits realized, which has fueled speculation that a local top might be forming. In addition to profit-taking, miners have added to the selling pressure. In mid-January 2025, Bitcoin miners sold over 20,000 BTC—worth approximately $2 billion—introducing a considerable amount of new supply into the market. This selling behavior is not unusual, as miners often offload holdings to cover operational costs, but the scale of recent sales has raised eyebrows. Long-term holders (LTHs), who are typically more reluctant to sell, have also started offloading their holdings. Over the past week alone, the supply held by LTHs has decreased by 75,000 BTC, indicating that even the most patient investors are securing profits. Adding to the bearish sentiment, capital inflows into the crypto market have sharply declined. Since December 10, 2024, inflows have plummeted by 63.3%, dropping from $134.65 billion to $43.37 billion. This reduction in fresh capital suggests that new investors are hesitant to enter the market at current levels, further increasing the risk of a downturn. Network activity has also declined, with Bitcoin’s transaction volume and wallet interactions dropping to their lowest levels since November 2024. This decline in market participation could be a sign that enthusiasm is waning, a pattern that often precedes corrections in past cycles. Can Bitcoin Still Push Higher? Despite the increasing signs of market weakness, several models and technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin has not yet reached its peak. One widely followed metric is Bitcoin’s 200-day simple moving average (SMA). Historically, Bitcoin’s price tends to enter its final cycle rally once it surpasses 2.4 times its 200-day SMA. Currently, this level sits at $184,600, meaning Bitcoin could still have room for significant upside before hitting a peak. The Mayer Multiple, another key metric used to gauge Bitcoin’s valuation relative to its long-term trends, also supports the idea of further gains. This model suggests that Bitcoin’s potential market top could be around $182,000. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin has recently formed a bullish cup-and-handle pattern, a classic setup that often precedes large rallies. If this breakout plays out as expected, Bitcoin could reach a target of $276,400, reinforcing the argument that the current cycle has not yet peaked. The upcoming Bitcoin halving event—scheduled for April 2025—also supports the idea that the bull market still has room to grow. Historically, Bitcoin halvings have triggered parabolic rallies within six to twelve months. If this pattern holds, Bitcoin’s final market top could occur between May and October 2025. Exchange Balances and ETF Impact Another factor influencing Bitcoin’s supply dynamics is the shift in exchange balances. Over the past several months, Bitcoin balances on centralized exchanges have dropped from 3.1 million BTC in July 2024 to 2.7 million BTC. While this decline is often interpreted as a supply shock—indicating that investors are moving their holdings into private wallets—most of this movement is actually due to Bitcoin flowing into ETF custodian wallets. #Bitcoin balances on exchanges have dropped to 2.7M $BTC from 3.1M #BTC in July 2024. While often seen as a supply shock from investor withdrawals, most of this decline is due to coins moving into #ETFs custodian wallets, primarily Coinbase: https://t.co/sWo1JFfbOD pic.twitter.com/Ib6KWJK9qv — glassnode (@glassnode) January 30, 2025 Since the SEC approved Bitcoin spot ETFs, institutional demand has surged. Eight out of the eleven approved Bitcoin ETFs have chosen Coinbase as their custodian, consolidating a significant amount of BTC under one entity. As a result, while exchange balances appear to be shrinking, the reality is that much of this Bitcoin is simply transitioning into institutional custody rather than being permanently removed from circulation. When adjusting for non-Coinbase ETFs (such as FBTC and HODL), total Bitcoin holdings across exchange wallets and ETF custodians remain around 3 million BTC—similar to levels seen in January 2024. This suggests that the apparent decline in exchange balances reflects a structural shift in market dynamics rather than a true supply shock. On January 29, the Bitcoin spot ETF had a total net inflow of $92.0895 million, and the Ethereum spot ETF had a total net outflow of $4.8176 million. https://t.co/59u0BnEqLG — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 30, 2025 Institutional demand remains strong, as evidenced by Bitcoin ETF inflows. On January 29, 2025, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded a net inflow of $92.1 million, indicating that institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin despite broader market uncertainties. Key Levels to Watch With Bitcoin’s price hovering near critical levels, market participants are closely watching support and resistance zones. The most immediate support level lies at $97,877—a major accumulation zone. If Bitcoin holds above this level, it could act as a launchpad for the next leg of the bull run. However, a break below $97,877 and $91,700 could signal a deeper correction, potentially driving Bitcoin down to $74,000. Such a decline would likely shake out weak hands but could also present a prime buying opportunity for long-term investors. Did you know that there are currently 42.26M wallets holding less than 0.01 BTC, making up 77.4% of the existing 54.62M non-empty wallets? We go through some of the simple ways you can analyze supply distribution for any asset in our latest insight. https://t.co/yRIl1Agi6n — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 30, 2025 Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin Bitcoin is currently at a crucial inflection point. While rising selling pressure, declining capital inflows, and weakening network activity raise concerns about a potential market top, historical price models and technical patterns suggest that the bull market may still have room to run. If Bitcoin can maintain key support levels and continue attracting institutional demand through ETFs, it could push toward new all-time highs. However, a failure to hold critical price zones could trigger a sharp correction, testing investor conviction. As the market awaits Bitcoin’s next major move, all eyes remain on whether fresh capital will enter the space or if the recent selling pressure will lead to a deeper retracement. The coming months will determine whether Bitcoin’s bull cycle is nearing its end—or if another explosive rally is still ahead. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

DeepSeek AI Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $220,000",https://bitzo.com/2025/01/top-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-now-deepseek-ai-predicts-bitcoin-could-reach-220000,"Is Bitcoin Still the Prime Cryptocurrency to Invest In? DeepSeek’s RI AI model has already made waves in the global financial markets by outperforming expectations and maintaining lower capital expenditures compared to its American AI counterparts. Now, it has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts with its optimistic Bitcoin forecast, projecting the leading cryptocurrency to reach a peak of $180,000 to $220,000 by the fourth quarter of 2025. DeepSeek’s Bitcoin Price Forecast The detailed nature of DeepSeek’s Bitcoin price projection showcases the advanced capabilities of the R1 model. This model analyzes a broad range of factors to predict a potential price range of $180,000 - $220,000. One such factor is the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, which links Bitcoin’s scarcity to its price, calculated by dividing the current supply (stock) by the annual production (flow). The S2F model is often cited to explain the price surge that follows Bitcoin's halving events, due to the resulting decrease in supply flow. DeepSeek indicates that according to the S2F model, Bitcoin might peak between $150,000 and $250,000, influenced by institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and mainstream acceptance. Additionally, DeepSeek examines the logarithmic growth curve, which predicts a price target of $130,000 - $180,000, potentially higher with regulatory clarity and increased institutional interest. Moreover, the R1 model evaluates on-chain metrics like the MVRV ratio and the NUPL indicator, alongside the diminishing returns principle, suggesting a possible peak between $170,000 and $200,000. By integrating all these elements, it estimates that Bitcoin's price could hit between $180,000 and $220,000 by November 2025. However, it also cautions that unforeseen events or global economic downturns could impact the expected bull market. DeepSeek calls for a $180k - $220k bitcoin cycle top price by November 2025 👀 pic.twitter.com/73gaURhCJT — Bitcoin News (@BitcoinNewsCom) January 27, 2025 While the precise future price of Bitcoin remains uncertain, DeepSeek's forecast adds to the evidence that Bitcoin's peak is yet to come. CFA Julien Bittel also recently highlighted the substantial growth potential of the top crypto asset, using the GMI cycle top finder. Leading Cryptos to Consider Buying Now Apart from Bitcoin, meme coins and AI agent coins are also highly recommended by experts as top cryptocurrencies to buy now. For example, low-cap meme coins continue to offer significant returns, regardless of the overall market conditions. Therefore, it's not surprising that tokens like Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) are in high demand. The WEPE presale has quickly amassed over $62 million, with contributions growing by over a million each day. Just last week, an investor made a significant purchase of over $460k worth of WEPE, indicating the meme coin's high growth potential. Beyond the popular Pepe The Frog meme, Wall Street Pepe’s community intelligence features have made it a favorite among fans. All WEPE holders will soon join a VIP group and gain access to exclusive market insights. This is in addition to trading and staking rewards available for WEPE holders. Predictably, early investors are anticipating substantial growth with this new meme coin, with many considering it a potential 100x crypto opportunity. Similarly, AI agent coins seem to be nearing a local bottom. AIXBT, VIRTUAL, and ARC appear to be completing their ABC correction and are set for a bullish turnaround. A new AI agent coin — Mind of Pepe (MIND) — is also experiencing high demand and has raised over $4 million in its initial coin offering. With a growing interest in low-cap AI coins fueled by the DeepSeek excitement, it's no wonder experts are optimistic about MIND’s potential for growth.",More News,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|TOKEN SALE|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-01-31 09:05:36

Lightchain AI has emerged as a popular choice among these investors, offering an innovative blend of blockchain and artificial intelligence. With $13.2 million raised in its presale at a token price of $0.005625, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a high-growth alternative that provides stability and opportunity in a volatile market. Ripple’s Advantages and Ongoing Obstacles Ripple's XRP is known for its rapid transaction speeds, completing payments in mere seconds, which makes it a strong contender for international money transfers. The strategy to integrate XRP into the U.S. banking system aims to address long-standing global financial issues, potentially increasing its adoption. However, Ripple faces significant hurdles, primarily its legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over allegations of unregistered securities sales. This regulatory uncertainty has led to market volatility, with XRP experiencing a 12% decline in the past week. Additionally, concerns about centralization persist, as Ripple controls a substantial portion of XRP's supply, sparking debates about its decentralized nature. Despite these challenges, Ripple continues to innovate, having recently introduced a U.S. dollar-pegged coin to compete in the expanding stablecoin market. Lightchain AI - A Stable and Promising Alternative Lightchain AI distinguishes itself as a blockchain initiative that merges practical use with cutting-edge technology. Its secure AI integration allows businesses to conduct complex calculations while safeguarding data privacy, a capability that appeals to sectors like healthcare, logistics, and energy. This practical application makes Lightchain AI more than just a speculative asset, providing investors with a sense of stability and enduring value. Furthermore, Lightchain AI’s scalable framework ensures it can meet the increasing demands of decentralized applications (dApps) and businesses. By addressing real-world issues with innovative solutions, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining popularity among institutional investors and large-scale investors, including those who hold XRP. Reasons XRP Investors Are Choosing Lightchain AI For those holding Ripple, Lightchain AI presents an additional investment opportunity that lessens risks while offering exposure to innovative technology. The project’s emphasis on developer-friendly tools ensures a thriving ecosystem , fostering continuous growth and innovation. This focus on practicality and scalability aligns with the priorities of investors seeking projects with clear utility. Lightchain AI’s presale success is another factor driving interest from XRP holders. Raising $13.2 million in its early stages demonstrates strong market confidence in its vision and execution. By diversifying into Lightchain AI , Ripple investors can hedge against the uncertainty surrounding XRP while positioning themselves for significant returns. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-01-31 09:05:53

This month, both Toncoin (TON) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are losing their luster. In contrast, a new altcoin named Remittix (RTX) is capturing attention, with some touting it as a potential 50x breakout with similarities to XRP. Here's a deeper dive into the pressures facing Toncoin (TON) and Dogecoin (DOGE), why there's buzz around Remittix (RTX) as a rising star, and what the future could hold for these tokens in the coming weeks. Declining Sentiment for Toncoin (TON) Toncoin (TON) once grabbed headlines due to its Telegram connections and an innovative sharding system that offered rapid transactions. However, recent trends indicate that some large holders are reducing their stakes in Toncoin (TON), likely contributing to what many are dubbing the ToncoinDogecoin Dip. Critics argue that Toncoin (TON) needs to distinguish itself from other layer-1 blockchains, particularly as new projects emerge. Nonetheless, advocates for Toncoin (TON) believe this is a temporary setback and that the coin's technology still has the potential to attract users looking for speed and scalability. Whether these beliefs hold true will depend on a rebound in on-chain activity soon. Is Dogecoin (DOGE) Experiencing Meme Fatigue? In addition to Toncoin (TON), Dogecoin (DOGE) is also seeing a decline in sentiment recently. Famous for its meme-based rallies, Dogecoin (DOGE) has surged thanks to social media buzz and celebrity endorsements. However, the enthusiasm for meme coins can wane quickly. As the price fluctuates, some investors worry that Dogecoin (DOGE) might stall unless it gains new supporters or reignites its community. While the latter half of last year brought promises of significant upgrades, actual progress has been limited. If Dogecoin (DOGE) fails to revive the excitement that once drove it, larger investors might continue moving towards newer tokens—such as Remittix (RTX)—in search of greater returns. Remittix (RTX): The 50x Prospect So what is prompting some to label Remittix (RTX) as a 50x opportunity? Much of the excitement hinges on Remittix's approach to cross-border payments, which aims to enable users to exchange crypto for fiat with reduced fees. Analysts suggest that if mainstream users adopt Remittix (RTX), it could surpass more established cryptocurrencies. Early data seems promising: the token has already raised over $8.2 million, selling more than 385 million tokens at $0.0406. The price is set to increase to $0.0418, fueling even more FOMO among traders. Unlike Toncoin (TON) or Dogecoin (DOGE), this altcoin aims to address a specific, everyday need—something many see as a guaranteed strategy for widespread adoption, potentially overshadowing the Toncoin Dogecoin Dip in terms of overall buzz. Could It Match XRP's Potential? Why are some drawing parallels between Remittix (RTX) and XRP? Both focus on payment solutions, though XRP targets large financial institutions, while Remittix (RTX) opts for a more straightforward approach to everyday transactions. The excitement surrounding a potential 50x increase suggests that if Remittix (RTX) successfully launches its product, it could see a surge in market cap similar to XRP's past performance. Though skeptics caution that new coins often fade after initial hype, the community backing Remittix (RTX) appears confident that its practical application will position it as a leading contender by year's end. Conclusion So will Toncoin (TON) and Dogecoin (DOGE) manage to bounce back, or will the shift towards Remittix(RTX) gain momentum? Analysts are divided, but the quick change in sentiment suggests a strong appetite for new cryptocurrencies with practical uses. If Remittix (RTX) continues to gain popularity and secures major exchange listings, it could reinforce its status as the next big altcoin. Meanwhile, TON and DOGE might just need a fresh boost—such as significant partnerships or celebrity endorsements—to reignite interest. Until then, all attention remains on Remittix (RTX), the 50x contender capturing the imagination of both major investors and everyday traders.

Animecoin ( ANIME ) rose to an intraday high of $0.0502 on Jan. 31, marking a 15% surge from its weekly low of $0.0437 as of press time. The altcoin market cap was seated at $278 million while its daily trading volume was up 40%, hovering around $153 million. The Azuki-backed meme coin rallied after Bithumb, a major South Korea-based crypto exchange, announced the addition of a KRW trading pair for the ANIME token on Jan. 31, alongside the VTHO token at 7 PM KST. The token will be available on the Arbitrum network. Buy orders for ANIME will be restricted for approximately five minutes after trading begins. During this period, sell orders will be limited to prices within -10% to +100% of the base price. Automated orders can be placed only after the first trade has been executed following the start of trading. According to the announcement, the base price for the Animecoin token is expected to be approximately $66.11 once trading officially begins.

But this time could be different, the analysts say. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in 2024 has brought in more institutional investors. “These institutional investors not only hold Bitcoin for longer durations but are also buoyed by the confidence provided by more transparent regulations.

Based on that framework, the current cycle suggests “potential upside targets of $157,000 or even as high as $315,000,” the analysts suggest, though the timing remains unclear as “this time, the dynamics may indeed be different.” Read more: Bitwise’s Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF gets initial SEC nod",News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Singapore|Wall Street,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ASIA|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-31 09:10:09

Several major backers, including a16z, Coinbase , and Ripple , have increased their contributions, strengthening Fairshake’s financial power. While it’s unclear which Senate races will be the group’s top targets, the political landscape has shifted. After Kamala Harris supported crypto and lost, anti-industry sentiment in Congress has noticeably decreased, though some opponents remain. Fairshake, known for its heavy spending in elections, is preparing for the upcoming midterms. According to CNBC, the PAC started accumulating funds right after Donald Trump won the presidency in November. A16z donated $25 million soon after, pushing the total to $103 million, with more contributions continuing to roll in. Election campaigns are costly, and Fairshake is expected to invest heavily. During the 2024 election cycle, the PAC spent approximately $180 million to influence races. The midterms are expected to be just as competitive, making the fund's growing war chest crucial. Aside from supporting Trump, Fairshake played a role in backing down-ballot candidates such as Bernie Moreno. In a statement, the group reaffirmed its commitment to supporting candidates who promote innovation, economic growth, and balanced regulation. Coinbase and other previous donors have doubled their financial support, while companies like Ripple and Uniswap have also contributed new funding. However, the key question remains: which candidates will Fairshake challenge? The crypto industry now holds a strong position in U.S. elections. In the last race, Kamala Harris was hesitant to embrace digital assets but eventually positioned herself as a pro-crypto candidate. She secured high-profile donations from industry figures, but they fell short compared to Trump’s backing. With the Democrats gradually shifting toward crypto-friendly policies, Fairshake’s strategy is unclear. Some likely targets include prominent industry critics, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, who continues to oppose Trump’s crypto policies. Since the launch of the TRUMP meme coin, several lawmakers have called for investigations into potential criminal activity. Fairshake could fund candidates to challenge these figures in 2026. Another strategy might involve keeping Republican lawmakers in check. While most GOP members have aligned with Trump’s pro-crypto stance, some officials who previously opposed digital assets have now voiced support. The threat of Fairshake’s funding could ensure they stay loyal to the industry. With nearly two years until the midterms, Fairshake has time to plan its approach. Whether it focuses on defeating crypto opponents or reinforcing its influence within the GOP, the PAC is positioned to be a major player in shaping the elections.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|UNI,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-31 09:10:22

BTFD Coin is making serious waves, attracting big-name investors looking for the next big win. Over the years, meme coins have evolved from joke assets into full-fledged investment opportunities. It all started with Dogecoin, which many wrote off as a gimmick, but it ended up gaining massive value thanks to strong community support and social media hype. Since then, dozens of new meme coins have hit the market, each trying to capture that same magic. BTFD Coin is one of the latest to enter the space, but unlike most meme coins, it’s offering more than just internet culture—it’s bringing a massive 90% APY on staking, creating real incentives for investors to jump in early. The meme coin scene is only getting bigger, and with projects like BTFD Coin and Pudgy Penguin are changing the game, investors have a new reason to take them seriously. They’re a chance to get in on a movement that could be the next big thing. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin Built for the Bulls BTFD Coin is making serious noise in the crypto space, positioning itself as one of the best new meme coins to join now. The presale has already hit its 14th stage, raising over $5.8 million, with more than 68 billion coins sold. At just $0.00016 per coin, it’s still early days, and investors are scrambling to get in before the price skyrockets. What makes BTFD stand out isn’t just the meme factor—it’s the 90% APY staking rewards that have everyone talking. Unlike typical meme coins that rely purely on hype, BTFD Coin is offering real incentives for holders. Staking rewards are locked for 16 weeks post-launch, ensuring that those who get in now can see serious returns down the line. The Bulls Squad, the growing community behind the coin, has already amassed over 9,900 holders, proving that momentum is building fast. Getting in on the presale is straightforward. You simply visit the official presale page , connect your wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet), and enter the exclusive bonus code “LAUNCH100” to unlock additional perks. Once you choose how much BTFD you want to buy, confirm your purchase, and you’re in. With its aggressive staking rewards, rapidly growing community, and presale performance, BTFD Coin is shaping up to be one of the most exciting meme coins of the year. The only question is—are you getting in now, or are you going to wait until it’s too late? Dogecoin: The Meme Coin That Started It All If there’s one coin that proved memes and crypto could go hand in hand, it’s Dogecoin. Launched in 2013 as a joke, it quickly gained traction, becoming one of the most recognisable cryptocurrencies in the world. What started as a parody soon turned into a community-driven movement, with Dogecoin being used for tipping, donations, and even sponsoring major events. Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently been at the forefront of discussions due to potential developments in the cryptocurrency investment landscape. Notably, several U.S. asset managers have filed for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that would invest in memecoins, including Dogecoin. This move has sparked debates about the speculative nature of such assets. The cryptocurrency community is closely monitoring these developments, especially the potential approval of Dogecoin-focused ETFs, which could significantly influence DOGE’s market dynamics in the near future. Even today, Dogecoin remains a top player in the meme coin space. While newer projects like BTFD Coin are bringing fresh innovation, Dogecoin is a reminder of what’s possible when a meme coin captures the public’s imagination. Pudgy Penguins: A Deep Dive into the NFT Phenomenon Pudgy Penguins burst onto the NFT scene as a collection of 8,888 unique, hand-drawn penguin avatars, each exuding its own charm and personality. These digital collectibles quickly garnered attention for their vibrant designs and the strong community that rallied behind them. The project’s ethos centers around “vibes & positivity across the metaverse,” aiming to foster a welcoming environment for both newcomers and seasoned NFT enthusiasts. In a strategic move to expand their brand beyond static images, Pudgy Penguins has partnered with Mythical Games to develop “Pudgy Party,” a AAA mobile game slated for release in 2025. This game promises to combine accessible, pick-up-and-play mechanics with challenging action rounds, allowing players to navigate obstacle courses and engage in competitive gameplay. Customization will be a key feature, enabling players to personalize their penguin avatars with unique outfits and accessories. The game aims to appeal to both casual players and gaming enthusiasts, offering a fun and competitive environment to enjoy with friends and family. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the Next Big Meme Coin Based on our research and market trends, meme coins are no longer just a fun side investment—they’re becoming serious contenders in the crypto space.

39727603,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=665867,1738315159,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39727603.jpeg,US investigates DeepSeek’s access to Nvidia chips via Singapore,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-deepseeks-nvidia-chips-singapore/,"US officials are deep into an investigation to find out if Chinese AI startup DeepSeek found a backdoor route to Nvidia’s high-end chips through Singapore, evading American export bans, according to a report from Bloomberg. The chips are banned for sale directly to China, but America says DeepSeek may have secured them through third-party distributors in the Southeast Asian hub. The FBI and White House are leading the charge, reportedly using intel from anonymous sources tied to the investigation. The investigation comes just days after DeepSeek’s launch of its AI chatbot, R1, earlier this month. The bot shocked industry veterans with its powerful human-like reasoning and efficiency. Analysts say it rivals, if not threatens, AI tools built by US giants like OpenAI. But many suspect that R1’s development wasn’t all homegrown. Rivals, most especially OpenAI, believe the Chinese company relied on Western tech, possibly Nvidia’s powerful semiconductors, to push R1’s performance through the roof. FBI focuses on Nvidia’s H800 chips in DeepSeek probe Investigators are zeroing in on Nvidia’s H800 chip, a less-powerful version designed specifically for the Chinese market after the US imposed its first export restrictions in 2022. According to documents reportedly reviewed by the officials, DeepSeek’s V3 AI model—released just last month—was trained using a whopping 2,048 H800 chips. The V3 model directly laid the foundation for R1’s chatbot capabilities, making Nvidia’s hardware critical to DeepSeek’s AI success. In October 2023, US authorities expanded the ban, blocking even the H800 chips from entering China. Nvidia quickly pivoted by creating another stripped-down version called the H20 chip, which complied with new restrictions but had reduced performance. Now the Trump administration is discussing extending the ban to cover H20 chips, with Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick making it clear that he’s more than ready to tighten the screws. Source: Bloomberg “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around it, drive their DeepSeek model,” Howard said during his Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday. “If they’re going to compete with us, fine—but stop using our tools to do it.” He promised aggressive action, adding that the current loopholes in export enforcement “have got to end.” The AI boom has driven Nvidia to the top of the chip-making game, but new restrictions could carve away significant chunks of its revenue. The company issued a statement claiming its partners are required to follow all export laws and that any violations will be addressed “swiftly.” Singapore under the microscope as chip revenue raises questions Singapore accounts for about 20% of Nvidia’s reported revenue, but the report claims most of that revenue didn’t come from chips physically shipped to Singapore. According to Nvidia’s own filings, much of it involves orders placed by Singaporean entities but destined for other countries, some of which could include China. “We track ‘bill to’ locations, not ‘ship to’ locations,” Nvidia clarified in response to questions about the investigation. This distinction means Singapore-based buyers could place large orders for chips meant for delivery elsewhere. The FBI wants to know if intermediaries helped divert these orders into Chinese hands. US Representatives John Moolenaar and Raja Krishnamoorthi sent a letter on Tuesday to National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, urging the administration to slap stricter licensing requirements on chip exports to Singapore. “Countries like Singapore should be subject to strict licensing requirements absent a willingness to crack down on shipments to China,” the lawmakers wrote. While Singapore wasn’t included in the initial geographic scope of US chip restrictions, investigators are now exploring how that loophole may have given Chinese companies like DeepSeek an advantage. Under current rules, large shipments to Singapore require a license, but smaller shipments (less than 1,700 chips) only need notification. The lack of tighter controls has created an opening that many in Washington are eager to close. Nvidia stock fell nearly 7% following the announcement of the US probe, extending a rocky week that also saw declines for Microsoft, Oracle, and Alphabet. In total, tech companies lost almost $1 trillion in market value as investors panicked over China’s growing AI capabilities. Microsoft and OpenAI are doing their own investigation into whether DeepSeek accessed OpenAI’s data without permission. DeepSeek’s claim that it developed its AI models at a fraction of the cost of US competitors has brought suspicions that it may have exploited Western-developed tools or datasets. Microsoft is particularly concerned that DeepSeek’s progress could weaken its long-term dominance in the AI market.

The news was revealed on January 30 during the Bitcoin-focused Plan B conference in El Salvador, featuring key speakers Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark. The integration utilizes the Taproot Assets protocol, introduced in 2022, to extend Bitcoin’s capabilities for supporting tokenized assets. Elizabeth Stark expressed enthusiasm for the development, stating, “Millions of people will now be able to use the most open, secure blockchain to send dollars globally.” Lightning Labs highlighted that this upgrade will benefit merchants already accepting Bitcoin payments through Lightning, enabling seamless USDT transactions using the same infrastructure. Broader Stablecoin Adoption Tether’s expansion onto the Lightning Network is a strategic move to broaden its stablecoin payment ecosystem. Stark emphasized that users in emerging markets could greatly benefit from this integration, as stablecoins often provide a hedge against currency devaluation. According to CoinGecko, Tether is the world’s largest stablecoin , commanding a market cap of $139.4 billion — nearly three times that of its closest competitor, Circle’s USDC. In 2024, Tether processed $10 trillion in transactions, inching closer to Visa’s $16 trillion transaction volume. Lightning Labs believes this development could power a future “wave” of AI-driven transactions and autonomous vehicle payments. Business development director Ryan Gentry also stressed the potential for innovation, particularly in enabling micropayments through USDT on Lightning. Tether El Salvador Move and Bitcoin Ecosystem The announcement comes shortly after Tether’s relocation to El Salvador, the only country where Bitcoin is legal tender. El Salvador initially mandated merchants to accept Bitcoin payments through the government-backed Chivo Wallet in 2021, though the initiative faced challenges. Recently, as part of a $1.4 billion agreement with the IMF , the country made Bitcoin payments voluntary for merchants. With this integration, Tether positions itself as a driving force in stablecoin adoption across Bitcoin’s ecosystem, pushing boundaries in both traditional payment networks and emerging technologies like AI.

The latest entry into the scene is Errol Musk, father of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who is diving into the crypto scene with its token, “Musk It”. Following in the footsteps of Donald Trump and his family, who have capitalized on meme-driven cryptocurrencies, Errol hopes to raise between $150 million and $200 million through the project. Despite having no direct involvement in its creation, he has publicly endorsed the token, which was launched by a Middle Eastern crypto company in December.

The token was initially launched in December by a Middle Eastern-based crypto company but gained little traction. Looking at the cold market reaction, Errol and his business partner, Nathan Browne, later decided to publicly endorse it, emphasizing that their involvement isn’t a “pump and dump” scheme. While Errol claims to have recently spoken with Elon about the project, representatives for Elon and his brother Kimbal have remained silent, and neither is involved in the venture. Another Meme on the Block- Will it Cause Disruption? Errol Musk launching “Musk It” might make his already troubled relationship with Elon even worse. With so many tokens popping up under famous names, there’s growing concern that these could shake up the crypto market, especially for well-established projects. Memecoins, which have no real use or regulations, are risky and often lead to losses. Recently, Trump-themed coins caused a massive pump-and-dump, leaving investors in doubt, especially after Trump denied any involvement. Since there’s little information about “Musk It,” its financial structure and long-term goals are unclear. Many investors assume it’s linked to Elon Musk, but Errol denies using his son’s name for profit, saying success isn’t limited to Elon alone. Now, a proposed class-action lawsuit claims that all tokens on Pump.fun are “unregistered security memecoins,” raking in nearly $500 million for the platform.

Dogecoin Price Crash Incoming? His chart posted via X depicts an ascending wedge formation running into a confluence of resistance between $0.338 and $0.343, as well as a notable support zone in the $0.31 region. The chart highlights higher lows (marked as “LL” on the chart) forming the lower boundary of an ascending wedge. Meanwhile, overhead resistance (a rectangular zone around $0.338–$0.343) has repeatedly capped upward price movements. This wedge appears to be compressing price action—often a setup for a significant breakout or breakdown. A horizontal resistance zone around $0.34 stands out. DOGE’s price has attempted multiple short-term moves above this level but failed to secure a confirmed breakout, suggesting sellers are firmly defending that zone. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Climbs To $4 Billion Again After Market Rebound On the downside, a green box spanning roughly $0.310 marks an area where buying interest has historically picked up. Below that level, the chart references a lower support marker near $0.262, indicating a more substantial potential drop if the wedge pattern breaks down decisively. The analyst specifically points to the upcoming weekend as a wildcard. Historically, lower trading volumes on Saturdays and Sundays can exacerbate volatility. If Dogecoin fails to hold its rising trend line—currently near $0.328–$0.330—and liquidity thins out, the price could swiftly test the lower support around $0.310, or potentially slide toward the $0.262 zone if the selling momentum accelerates. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Setting For A Massive Leg Higher – Analyst Sees Bullish Consolidation Above Key Level While a breakout above $0.343 could invalidate this bearish setup, Tapia’s cautionary note underscores the significance of a potential breakdown from the wedge formation. Weekend price action often diverges from midweek patterns due to reduced participation, meaning a sharp move in either direction could unfold more quickly than usual. DOGE Needs To Hold $0.31 The daily chart supports Tapia’s thesis. There, Dogecoin (DOGE) finds itself under intensifying downward pressure as price action hugs a persistent downtrend line. After hitting a local high in December, DOGE has retreated below key exponential moving averages (EMAs). The 20-day EMA (currently at approximately $0.3457) and the 50-day EMA (near $0.3473) have both curved lower, signaling waning short-term momentum. A glance at the chart reveals that DOGE is now just slightly above the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, calculated around $0.313. This Fib zone has acted as the most crucial support since mid-December, but any decisive daily close beneath it could accelerate selling. Traders are keeping a close eye on the 100-day EMA (around $0.3179), which is sandwiched just above this Fib level. If the price fails to defend the area between $0.313 and $0.317, then eyes will turn to the 200-day EMA at roughly $0.2613 as a critical long-term support. If this level breaks to the downside as well, the 0.236 Fib at $0.212 could quickly become a reality.

On Friday, crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed that the large investors, also known as whales, bought 100,000 ETH amid the token’s recent price volatility. In the aftermath, market watchers anticipate price gains ahead despite unchanged interest rates this FOMC and looming U.S. PCE inflation data release. Ethereum Whales On Buying Spree Ignite Optimism According to an X post by Ali Martinez on January 31, Ethereum whales purchased over 100,000 coins during the recent price dip. The massive purchase reflects a potential ‘buy-the-dip’ sentiment prevailing among large-scale investors. In turn, long-term prospects for the crypto’s price remain bullish in the wake of heightened buying pressure and rising interest in the asset. Source: Ali Charts, X Also, it’s worth mentioning that the Trump family project has bought $250 million worth of ETH recently. Ethereum co-founder and ConsenSys founder Joseph Lubin revealed on X that the massive purchase comes as the project looks to set up a DeFi business. Although these events project bullishness on future price actions, it’s worth mentioning that the coin currently encounters significant volatility amid current broader market trends. Market Uncertain Amid Latest U.S. Economic Data The crypto market currently mirrors a muted investor interest right ahead of the PCE inflation data release scheduled for later today. CoinGape reported that Bitcoin and Altcoins faced volatility on Friday, with another macro event impacting investor sentiments. Notably, the latest U.S. FOMC meeting has decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50%. This data raised concerns over risk assets such as crypto, as investors may want to mitigate losses by investing more in U.S. dollar-backed assets. Nevertheless, large-scale investors appear to be digesting the latest decision by the Fed whilst hoping the PCE inflation data cools down. This market anticipation is highly reflected by the massive accumulation by Ethereum whales. What Lies Ahead For ETH Price? At the time of reporting, ETH price witnessed a nearly 2% increase in value and is currently trading at $3,246. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $3,182.14 and $3,282.99, respectively. It’s worth mentioning that the most critical resistance level for the coin lies at the $4,000 mark, a key barrier over the years. Source: Ali Charts, X However, the massive buying by ETH whales has paved a bullish way surrounding long-term price prospects. Additionally, market expert Michaël van de Poppe posted on X, “ETH vs. BTC can still print a bullish divergence.” This statement indicated that while the price is declining, the broader momentum is improving, indicating that a potential reversal looms. Source: CryptoMichNL, X Also, the analyst added, “I think that the dynamic and pendulum between the DXY (US Dollar Index) and ETH is going to change towards Ethereum rather than the Dollar.” Despite the recent risks presented to crypto in light of macroeconomic events, this statement projects optimism about the crypto’s future price action.

Ethereum experts expect its value to reach $5,000 by mid-2025 because of EIP-1559’s deflationary mechanism and increasing institutional participation. ETH supply has tightened as staking participation is almost 28% and annual ETH burn reaches $3.8 billion which creates conditions for a substantial price appreciation. The upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrades, including proto-danksharding, will further enhance scalability and transaction efficiency. This positions ETH not just as a blockchain pioneer but as a magnet for innovative projects seeking robust infrastructure. Meme coins succeed through low fees and fast networks which makes the sector important for ETH investors who continue to hold blue-chip assets. Ethereum’s Bullish Trajectory: Staking and Scarcity Fuel $5,000 Target The shift of Ethereum towards staking-based validation systems has reduced its supply creation to the point where it becomes a deflationary asset over time. The shrinking circulating supply becomes more apparent when more investors stake their tokens through contracts thus potentially driving market demand upward. Major financial institutions now recognize Ethereum’s leadership position in blockchain technology while increasing their institutional interest. If spot Ethereum ETFs become available they could strengthen the effect of scarcity on long-term price growth. Experts predict Ethereum price will rise to the $3,700–$4,500 region while a robust bull market may drive it above $5,000. Ethereum stands poised to reach new all-time highs because of growing staking activity combined with supply reductions and increased market interest. While Ethereum price momentum captures headlines, its ecosystem is quietly incubating the next generation of meme coins. Unlike speculative predecessors, new entrants are leveraging Ethereum’s security and global reach to build sustainable communities. Panshibi isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a strategic evolution. Built on Ethereum, $SHIBI combines the viral appeal of Shiba Inu-themed tokens with a unique Asian panda motif, tapping into a region responsible for 60% of global crypto transactions. But what truly sets Panshibi apart is its hybrid model Is Panshibi Ethereum’s Next Breakout Star? Much like Ethereum’s 2015 debut, Panshibi’s presale offers ground-floor access to a transformative project. Early backers can acquire $SHIBI at $0.003 during Stage 2, with prices escalating to $0.026 at launch, a 760% jump pre-listing. Analysts at ChainTrend forecast a 1,000X surge post-launch, citing parallels to Shiba Inu’s 2021 breakout but with stronger safeguards against volatility. The presale’s structure is deliberately scarcity-driven: 60% of tokens are allocated to early participants, while team holdings remain locked for two years. Panshibi’s tokenomics are engineered to maximize scarcity and hype, a proven formula in the meme coin sector. With an aggressive marketing push and a rapidly expanding community, Panshibi is positioning itself as the next major contender in the space. The project’s ability to tap into social media-driven momentum, combined with strategic token burns, creates an environment where early investors could see massive returns. Analysts’ projected Ethereum price surge isn’t just about ETH: it’s a rising tide lifting its most important ecosystem participants. As developers flock to its upgraded network, projects like Panshibi benefit from heightened visibility and liquidity. With a $1 billion market cap target (a fraction of Dogecoin’s peak), $SHIBI could reach $1 by 2025, turning a $1,000 investment into more than $100 thousand. Crucially, Panshibi’s SocialFi roadmap featuring NFT integrations and decentralized governance will leverage Ethereum’s programmability to create real-world utility. This positions $SHIBI as more than a meme: it’s a case study in how Ethereum’s infrastructure enables tokens to evolve beyond speculation. Panshibi’s contract has received audit certification while featuring a 10-year locked liquidity to protect against rug-pull vulnerabilities commonly found in meme coins. The combination of meme culture with Ethereum-grade utility has triggered a presale rush that saw $SHIBI reach over $275,000 within a week due to investor belief in its roadmap. Act Now—Ethereum’s Rally Won’t Wait, and Neither Will $SHIBI’s Presale! With Ethereum’s price poised for historic gains and stage 2 of $SHIBI token presale more than 16% sold in just 6 days , the energy and hype on Panshibi is undeniable. Savvy investors recognize that $SHIBI’s success is intertwined with Ethereum’s growth—a dynamic reminiscent of how Solana’s rise propelled tokens like $BONK. Don’t miss this dual opportunity: capitalize on Ethereum’s bullish momentum by joining thousands of investors betting on Panshibi’s surge. Buy $SHIBI’s ico today at $0.003 before Stage 3’s price increase to $0.004—or watch from the sidelines as Ethereum’s ecosystem crowns its next best coin to invest in.

However, the best way to do this is to look at coins with a lot of potential that haven’t yet been pumped. Here we’ll explore Elluminex, Toncoin, Hedera, and Near Protocol. Why Elluminex Could Be The DeFi Hub TON Needs Elluminex is a DeFi project being built on the TON blockchain. The aim of the ex-Silicon Valley team is to create an ‘all in one DeFi hub’ for TON and Telegram. Unlike many new coins and meme coins, Elluminex has put its focus on utility. They are building features like a powerful DEX to make swapping easy, a staking platform so users can easily generate yields, a cross-chain bridge to make getting on and off-chain simpler, and to improve blockchain interoperability. There will also be an AI portfolio tracker to help people make great decisions and have a watchful assistant even when they sleep. As the ELX coin is at $0.06 in the presale’s first stage, Elluminex could be a very high potential investment. Its low market cap (currently at $21M), and user-focused roadmap, suggest that there is a lot of room for growth. Especially when given the rapid growth of TON and the new partnership between TON and its integration with Telegram’s 950M active user base. TON’s Telegram Partnership Brings More Utility For Toncoin Toncoin has been one of the most talked-about coins in 2024 and 2025, thanks to its deep integration with Telegram. Telegram recently announced that all new mini-apps on its platform must operate on the TON blockchain, which means that Toncoin will be the go-to currency for everything from in-app purchases to advertising. The new partnership also mandates that Toncoin will be the only cryptocurrency used for Telegram Stars, Ads, and Premium services. This all gives TON a huge advantage over most blockchains. Despite this, Toncoin remains underpriced, likely because the market hasn’t fully digested the impact of these changes. As adoption grows, TON could see substantial upside, especially if it becomes the central token for mass crypto adoption through Telegram. Stellar Provides A Strong Alternative For International Payments Stellar, often seen as Ripple’s quieter sibling, is another coin in which we see significant potential. Stellar focuses on fast, low-cost cross-border payments and has already made partnerships with financial institutions to enable global remittances. What makes XLM particularly interesting right now is its valuation. While Ripple has surged after winning its legal battle with the SEC, Stellar remains relatively undervalued. This is despite offering a similar use case for international payments and positioning itself as a competitor in the same space. For traders looking for a coin with strong fundamentals but more room to grow than XRP, XLM could be an ideal pick. Hedera Delivers Enterprise-Ready Blockchain Solutions Hedera Hashgraph is unique due to its enterprise focus and innovative hashgraph consensus mechanism. As it is backed by major companies like Google and IBM, Hedera has the potential to be the blockchain of choice for businesses looking for scalable, energy-efficient solutions. Its current price, however, doesn’t, in our opinion, reflect the scale of its partnerships or the scope of its real-world use cases. From supply chain tracking to decentralized identity verification, HBAR is powering solutions that are being used now, not at some random point in the future. As more companies turn to blockchain technology for real-world applications, Hedera is ready to seize the market, and its undervalued price makes it a strong candidate for growth. Near Protocol Is Quietly Building The Blockchain Of Tomorrow Near Protocol is on the list because they are quietly building some of the most advanced technology in the blockchain right now. Near’s sharding technology means it can process transactions faster and more efficiently than many of its competitors, or at least according to NEAR (testing actual TPS is a minefield). NEAR also offers a developer-friendly environment, which has helped attract developers to make decentralized apps on its ecosystem. Despite its cutting-edge technology, NEAR is trading well below the valuations of other layer-1 blockchains like Arbitrum or Ethereum. This has created a potentially appealing entry point for traders who believe in its long-term scalability and potential to attract more developers. As blockchain adoption increases and more dApps go live on NEAR, its ecosystem could grow significantly. This makes it another undervalued pick for the current market cycle.

While doubts persist, the project continues to attract new users, with strong adoption in countries like South Korea and India. Nothing Surprising The team behind Pi Network extended the deadline for Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications and migration to the mainnet to February 28, 2025. The move aims to provide users with “additional time and opportunity to secure their Pi.” The previous deadline for completing the aforementioned procedures (known as the Grace Period) was moved several times and was eventually set for today (January 31). In addition to the constant delays, Pi Network has yet to launch its native token and open mainnet (despite being around for almost six years), which has triggered frustration across the community, and some members have even described the project as a scam. Meanwhile, the developers explained that the latest extension operates independently of the Open Network launch timeline. “It is possible that Open Network could occur before or after the Grace Period ends and upholds the Grace Period’s core objectives of fairness and accessibility. Submit your KYC application and complete your Mainnet Checklist by February 28, 2025 , to avoid any forfeiture,” the announcement reads. Pi Network has previously indicated that the Open Network will see the light of day in Q1 2025. Somewhat expectedly, though, many people have their doubts that this will be the case , expecting further delays instead of actual progress. The Popularity is on the Rise Contrary to the surrounding uncertainty, Pi Network continues to attract new members to its ecosystem. Pi News recently posted photos from a Megha Event in India, during which local supporters gathered to discuss the project. Pi Network has become well-known in many countries across the globe , establishing a stronghold in Asia. Nations where it has gained widespread popularity include South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, China, and others. Last year, Wu Blockchain revealed that the number of Pi Network users in South Korea crossed 1.3 million, which exceeds the local client base of leading crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. In fact, the only two domestic cryptocurrency-related entities with more users are Upbit (4.36 million) and Bithumb (2.24 million).

Many online retailers and companies now accept digital currencies as payment, making them a flexible gift option. If you’re thinking about giving cryptocurrency as a gift, there are a few things you should keep in mind. You’ll need to choose the right coin, figure out how to store it securely, and understand any tax implications. Read on as we’ll break down the process of giving crypto as a gift. Choosing the Right Cryptocurrency There are so many cryptocurrencies available today. Some are new and untested, while others are well-established and widely used. When selecting a cryptocurrency as a gift, it’s best to choose a trusted and stable option. Popular Cryptocurrencies for Gifting: Cryptocurrency Symbol Reason to Gift Bitcoin BTC Most recognized and widely accepted Ethereum ETH Supports smart contracts and decentralized apps Solana SOL Known for fast transactions and low fees USD Coin USDC A stablecoin tied to the US dollar It’s always best to first research the coin before you purchase it. Keep in mind the recipient’s interests and how they might use the gift. Ways to Gift Cryptocurrency There are several ways to give cryptocurrency. Every method has its pros and cons. 1. Gift Cards Many websites sell cryptocurrency gift cards. The recipient can redeem the card on the same platform where it was purchased. This is a beginner-friendly option. 2. Sending Crypto from an Exchange Buy the cryptocurrency on an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken. Transfer it directly to the recipient’s wallet address. This method is fast and simple but requires the recipient to have a wallet. 3. Paper Wallets A paper wallet is a printed document containing private and public keys. It is created using an online generator. This is a low-cost way to store crypto offline, but it can be lost or damaged easily. 4. Hardware Wallets A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores crypto securely. It is the safest option, as it is offline and protected from hacks. Some well-known brands include Ledger and Trezor. 5. Physical Coins Some companies sell metal or plastic coins with embedded crypto keys. These coins often have holographic seals to protect the private key. They are a novelty but should not be relied on for long-term storage. Storing the Gifted Cryptocurrency Once you’ve purchased the cryptocurrency, you need to store it securely. Leaving it on an exchange is risky because online accounts can be hacked. Storage Method Pros Cons Exchange Wallet Easy to access and use Vulnerable to hacking Paper Wallet Offline storage, free to create Can be lost or damaged Hardware Wallet Highly secure, offline Costs money to purchase The greatest option for long-term storage is a hardware wallet. Give guidelines on how to secure cryptocurrency if you’re giving it to someone who is unfamiliar with the field. Are Crypto Gifts Taxed? Giving cryptocurrency as a gift is typically not taxable. However, when the recipient sells the cryptocurrency, taxes can be due. Key Tax Rules: The recipient may be required to pay short-term capital gains taxes if he sells the bitcoin within a year. He pays long-term capital gains tax, which is significantly less, if the sale is made after a year. Taxes are to be paid by considering the value at which originally purchased. Even in the event that the gifted bitcoin loses value and is sold at a loss, the recipient can still qualify for an exemption. A unique way to introduce someone to the world of cryptocurrencies is to give them a gift of digital assets that have the potential to appreciate in value and make a very progressive gift. This will help the recipient through some things they need to know in storing, using, and protecting their gift. If they have never been into cryptocurrencies, providing instructions or guiding them through will make it easy. Gifting cryptocurrency can be a fun and valuable present for any occasion; all one needs is to go about it correctly.",Reviews|Gift,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-01-31 09:44:59

Just take a look at Notcoin, the once-overlooked digital asset that turned small investments into life-changing wealth. Many dismissed it in its early days when it was still an experimental concept, only to watch in disbelief as its value skyrocketed. Now, a similar opportunity is unfolding with Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC)—one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. With its presale now in Glacier Grove (Phase 7) at just $0.000043 per APC, the price is still incredibly low compared to its listing price of $0.008. As Arctic Pablo advances through its presale journey, the price is set to climb higher, making early entry crucial for those looking to capitalize on its massive ROI potential. Notcoin: The ICO That Many Overlooked but Now Wish They Hadn’t Notcoin started as a simple play-to-earn tap game that seemed too basic for many investors to take seriously. At launch, its token traded for fractions of a cent—an easy buy-in for those who saw its potential. But while skeptics stood on the sidelines, early adopters stacked their bags. Fast forward to today, and Notcoin’s meteoric rise has proven its doubters wrong. Investors who got in at the earliest price points now sit on returns that few could have imagined. The success story of Notcoin serves as a harsh reminder: those who wait too long often pay the price of regret. But the crypto market never sleeps, and a new contender is making waves in the meme coin space. Enter Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC)—a project that’s rapidly gaining traction as one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Arctic Pablo: The New Meme Coin Powering Through Presale with Insane Gains Arctic Pablo isn’t just another meme coin. Its presale has already sold out six phases at lightning speed, with Phase 6, El-Dorado, selling out in under three days. Now, Glacier Grove (Phase 7) is live, offering $APC at just $0.000043, a price that won’t last long as the project moves forward. This is the redemption moment for investors who missed Notcoin’s early days. The ROI from this stage to listing stands at over 18,546%, with a projected price of $0.008 at launch. The numbers speak for themselves—those who secure their APC tokens now could see enormous gains. The Burn Mechanism: Fueling Long-Term Value Unlike many other meme coins that flood the market with excessive supply, Arctic Pablo permanently removes unsold tokens weekly during the presale. Additionally, any unsold tokens after the presale will be burned, ensuring a deflationary structure that enhances scarcity and boosts value over time. This strategic burn mechanism makes Arctic Pablo not just an exciting presale, but also one of the top new meme coins to invest in now for long-term holders. Over $ 675,000 Raised —And Growing Fast Momentum is building rapidly. With over $675,000 already raised, Arctic Pablo proves investors are hungry for the next big opportunity. Those who act now lock in the lowest possible price before the presale moves to its next phase, where costs will increase again. Every phase has sold out quickly—will Glacier Grove be next? The Clock Is Ticking—Get in Before the Next Price Surge Missed Notcoin’s early days? That ship has sailed. But the crypto space never stops moving, and Arctic Pablo is here, offering a golden opportunity for those who recognize potential before it’s too late. As each phase sells out, the price of $APC rises, bringing new milestones closer and increasing returns for early investors. With Glacier Grove now live at $0.000043, time is running out for those who want to secure one of the top new meme coins to invest in now before the price jumps again. Final Thoughts: Secure APC Before It Enters the Next Phase Notcoin’s early investors took a chance and saw staggering returns. Those who waited for a better entry point only watched as the price soared beyond their reach. Arctic Pablo is now at a crucial moment—the chance to get in before massive listing gains. With its presale accelerating, a deflationary burn mechanism, and an ROI of over 18,546% from Glacier Grove to listing, Arctic Pablo is undoubtedly one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. The presale won’t wait—will you take action, or will this be another missed opportunity?

This pullback has undone 50% of the gains noted after the FOMC meeting and will likely continue this descent as month-end volatility kicks in. With the long-term outlook still bullish and historical data signaling more gains in February, will BTC reach new highs at $123K? Let’s explore. Will Bitcoin Price Hit $123K? Since mid-November 2024, Bitcoin price has been moving sideways. Although BTC has attempted to leave this range multiple times, it has lacked strength. As a result, multiple new highs have been created in the past 78 days of the ongoing consolidation. The most recent ATH of $110K was set up on January 20. Between November 14 and 22, 2024, Bitcoin shot up nearly 14% to $99,660. Using Fibonacci tool to this trend shows the next ATH was formed at 161.8% Fib level. Considering a similar outlook, the next ATH could form around $123K. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart 4 Conditions Could That Can Propel BTC to $123K To achieve a new all-time high at $123K or beyond here are four changes or developments that need to occur. Bitcoin price needs to overcome the $105.5K resistance level . This level is where BTC faced rejection, pausing the post-FOMC rally. The second condition that hints BTC could reach a new ATH is the divergence between retail and institutional investors. Data from Santiment shows that wallets holding 0 to 10 BTC, belonging to retail investors have been dropping. On the other hand, wallets holding 100 to 1000 BTC have been accumulating. Typically, retail investors react much more to short-term noise and tend to capitulate before the price reaches new highs. Whale accumulation hints that the uptrend is not over and a new ATH is possible. Retail vs. Whale Wallets Whale transaction activity, ie., tranfers worth $100K, have dropped since January 24. As noted in the image a spike in this metric often helps drive prices higher. On the contrary, a drop suggests that whales are not interested and is likely going to lead to a period of consolidation or drop. Once this indicator sees a reversal, Bitcoin price has a high probability to reach ATHs . Whale Transaction Count From a historical standpoint, the average monthly return for January is around 4%. But February’s average return hovers around 15.66% . Hence, the chances of a new ATH in February , potentially at $123K are high . Monthly Returns Out of the above four conditions, two are met, Bitcoin needs to overcome $105K hurdle and whale transctions greater than $100K needs to pause its freefall and spike again. Once all four conditions are met Bitcoin price could set up a new all-time high at $123K. Key Levels to Watch as BTC Price Drops With the end of January, investors can expect the volatility to remain high . Since Thursday’s $106,450 high, Bitcoin price has shed 2.04%. Investors can expect this short-term downtrend to continue around the New York open. In such a case, here are some key demand levels to watch: $101.5K, $100K, $98.2K and $96.8K. $101.5K is the confluence of the 78-day range’s upper limit and the current week’s VWAP. Beyond this, the 2025 VWAP at $100K and the 78-day consolidation’s VWAP at $98.2K are the next key support levels. The last and the most important support level is the highest volume traded level in the past 78 days at $96.8K. These key support levels are good places to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) at a discount. A bounce at these levels could lead to an ATH. Here is a key resistance level to watch: $105K . Overcoming this level will allow Bitcoin price to revisit the current ATH of $110K and set up a new one at $123K.

The launch enables token issuers to reclaim assets under some detailed conditions. According to blockchain explorer XRPScan, the amendment went live on Jan 30, 2025, at around 07:53:12 PM UTC. Prior to the Thursday launch, XRPScan had the AMMClawback amendment’s two-week activation countdown through its official X account on January 16. The feature will reportedly enhance security and regulatory compliance by allowing issuers to retract tokens in cases of fraud, legal enforcement, or misuse. According to XRP documentation , the clawback function is not enabled by default. To activate it, issuers must send an “AccountSet transaction” to activate the setting dubbed as “Allow Trust Line Clawback.” However, accounts with existing tokens on the Automated Market Maker pool cannot enable the feature. Moreover, the feature must be activated before setting up any trust lines, offers, escrows, payment channels, checks, or signer lists. Once enabled, the function is irreversible, permanently granting the issuer the ability to claw back assets from trust lines. Ripple USD expands to XRPL AMM pools The AMMClawback amendment also marks a major shift in RLUSD’s usability within the XRP ecosystem. Previously, RLUSD was primarily limited to trading on centralized exchanges using traditional order books. Now, with the new amendment, the stablecoin can be integrated into the XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX) and AMM pools. Adding RLUSD to the pools could grow liquidity across the XRP Ledger. In addition, traders and liquidity providers will have more avenues to trade with RLUSD. For those unfamiliar with the significance of this amendment, the AMMClawback feature on #XRPL now enables issuers of specific tokens to reclaim (or ""claw back"") tokens under certain conditions, such as fraud prevention, regulatory compliance, or legal enforcement. This move… https://t.co/Qq1eifx9NM — Luke Thomas (@DEarthshaker) January 30, 2025 Former Ripple executive Emi Yoshikawa expressed enthusiasm about the XRP/RLUSD pair’s inclusion in the XRPL DEX AMM. “ Excited to see the XRP/RLUSD pair in the XRPL DEX AMM. Congrats to the XRPL community! ” Yoshikawa wrote in a January 30 X post . “ This amendment will allow tokens with clawback clauses, such as RLUSD, to be used in XRPL AMM. Active trading of the XRP/RLUSD pair is expected in the future. ” As of the time of this publication, the XRPL cumulative market cap, which includes both CEXs and DEXs, was $275.7 million, with both trading platforms listing more than 23,180 tokens, per data from XPmarket. RLUSD surpasses $100 million market cap The launch of AMMClawback comes as Ripple USD (RLUSD), Ripple’s stablecoin, surpasses a market capitalization of $100 million. In an X post on Thursday, Jack McDonald, Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Stablecoins, confirmed the milestone, noting that RLUSD reached this level just over a month after launch. “As previously committed, we’ll be publishing a monthly independent attestation for RLUSD, in compliance with the highest regulatory standards,” denoted McDonald, echoing the company’s transparency promise that requires the RLUSD’s reserves to be audited by an independent licensed third-party accounting startup. McDonald further explained that RLUSD is over-reserved. By analysis, it means Ripple holds more collateral than the total circulating supply. The Ripple SVP also revealed that the company maintains $6M in excess reserves to handle its stablecoin’s backing. “Ripple strictly maintains reserves of highly liquid, low-risk assets to ensure our ability to fully meet redemptions,” he concluded.

As Ripple (XRP) consolidates, analysts note similarities between the current price action and the 2017 rally. As a result, experts are forecasting a 2,900% surge if history repeats. How high will XRP reach if this outlook comes to pass? XRP Price Breaking Out Like 2017; Next Major Move a 2,900% Surge? XRP price has broken out of a formation that mirrors its 2017 pattern but on a much larger scale. Analysts highlight that this breakout is more than twice the size of the previous cycle, raising expectations for a significant price surge. In 2017, XRP’s breakout reached two key price targets. The recent movement suggests a similar trajectory, with the first target already met. The next anticipated milestone stands at $99, which would represent a staggering 2,900% gain from current levels. Analysts note that historical price structures often repeat in crypto markets. If the Ripple price follows the same trajectory as in 2017, the top altcoin could grow exponentially. Tweet While technicals indicate a breakout, fractals and history suggest a 2,900% surge. How likely is this? From a fundamental outlook, the odds of an ETF approval are spiking, suggesting a major overhaul and adoption awaits XRP, making it likely for an absurd and exponential rally. Polymarket Predicts 83% Chance of XRP ETF Approval by June 2025 Polymarket data indicates an 83% likelihood that a Ripple exchange-traded fund (ETF) could receive approval by 2025. This marks a significant rise in market confidence, reflecting growing optimism surrounding cryptocurrency ETFs. The probability has climbed by 13% recently, signaling increased speculation among investors. XRP’s potential ETF approval could follow Bitcoin’s path, drawing institutional interest and enhancing mainstream adoption. This could fuel the XRP price surge ahead. Will XRP ETF Launch in 2025? According to Polymarket data, the odds of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) receiving regulatory approval in 2025 have risen sharply to 82%. This increase signals growing investor confidence and reflects a notable shift in sentiment within the cryptocurrency space. The surge in approval probability highlights the anticipation surrounding potential regulatory developments that could pave the way for XRP’s entry into mainstream financial markets through an ETF. X XRP Price Analysis & Key Levels to Watch The price of XRP today is at $3.06, showing a slight decline of 1% in the last 4-hour session on Binance. The cryptocurrency is currently testing the $3.00 support level, a key psychological zone that has held strong in recent trading sessions. Most of the cryptocurrencies today are trading in a sideways trend, with BTC hovering around $103k. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48, indicating a neutral stance. A break above $3.50 could pave the way for a move toward the $3.84 level, which aligns with previous highs. However, failure to maintain above $3.00 may lead to further downside pressure, potentially bringing Ripple price prediction closer to lower support levels. XRP price chart: TradingView XRP price movement resembles its 2017 surge, fueling speculation of a massive rally. If history repeats, a 2,900% gain could be on the horizon, but market conditions remain key.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, he explained that XRP operates on a decentralized ledger, but in practice, Ripple Labs holds major control over it. Ripple Labs is responsible for selecting a list of validators who process transactions, and most users rely on Ripple’s default node list. Georgiades pointed out that this centralization weakens XRP’s position as a truly decentralized asset, and he believes it could be vulnerable to regulatory overreach. Governments could exert control over transactions by targeting specific institutions or geographical regions, which could fragment the network. This could lead to a breakdown of trust, network forks, and a loss of value, ultimately questioning the token’s purpose and competitiveness in comparison to centralized systems. “I see the downside less in terms of impacting Bitcoin in particular and more pertaining to other altcoins, specifically Ripple. There’s a lot of positive sentiment in the market for Ripple right now and a lot of excitement around Ripple is because of a potential strategic Reserve. But I see a lot of fundamental flaws in XRP in particular, and honestly view a strategic Reserve backed by Ripple as being the demise of the network itself for a number of reasons,” he said. (SIC) In addition, Georgiades shared his view on Bitcoin’s recent market movements. He believes the market has already priced in several positive catalysts, such as potential regulatory changes and the possibility of Bitcoin becoming a reserve asset. However, he said that it will take years for any fundamental changes to fully impact the market.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|WALLET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 09:57:50

Parallel to this, there’s also a push to start a Solana ETF in the United States. Additionally, demonstrating a greater interest in Solana-based assets, Cboe filed fresh registrations with the SEC for some Solana Trusts. Remittix (RTX), a brand-new initial coin offering, is debuting during these events. The project is selling out its presale, and many investors are already buying in. Shiba Inu News: Major Partnerships and Growing Ecosystem Shiba Inu is another meme coin , continuously enhancing its ecosystem through creative alliances. The project creator, Shytoshi Kusama, recently described a “potent partnership” to extend the project’s reach and utility. Shiba Inu and Chainlink have combined Shibarium with Chainlink’s Cross Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This expands the use cases of Shiba Inu’s native tokens (SHIB, BONE, and LEASH) and cross-chain communication. How Solana’s ETF Approval Could Impact Its Price If a Solana ETF is approved, the SOL price of $239 could surge. As Ethereum and Bitcoin experienced massive inflows when their ETFs launched, Solana might see a similar tsunami. Solana would now have a way for institutional investors who avoid direct crypto investments due to regulatory concerns. It might pour enormous dollars into the marketplace, driving the Solana price to record highs. Analysts predict that the first year of any Solana ETF can earn between $3 billion and $6 billion. If this occurs, there would be a severe shortage of supplies, which might drive up the price of Solana. Historically, major crypto events like ETF approvals have triggered strong rallies, and Solana could be next in line. Remittix (RTX): The Best Crypto ICO to Watch in 2025 Remittix is revolutionizing global payments by seamlessly combining the speed and efficiency of blockchain with the simplicity of traditional fiat transfers. Unlike outdated platforms like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase, Remittix eliminates unnecessary delays and excessive fees by enabling instant crypto-to-fiat conversions, making international transactions smoother than ever. Designed as a modern financial solution, Remittix ensures faster, cheaper, and safer cross-border transfers. It caters to businesses managing global operations and individuals sending money across borders. As users seek blockchain-powered payment methods, Remittix is positioning itself as among the most effective crypto investments to enter this lucrative market. The RTX token, the backbone of the ecosystem, is currently priced at just $0.0498 during its presale. This offers a rare opportunity for early investors to secure tokens before mass adoption drives up demand. Remittix blockchain ICO response is primarily positive. This project has generated over $10 million from over 8,000 buyers. With a structured roadmap and increasing attention, Remittix is certainly the top crypto ICO to watch in 2025. Is Remittix the Right Investment for You? If you’re looking for a high-potential investment, Remittix is worth considering. The project stands out among new token offerings with its innovative approach to digital payments and rapidly growing market.

Is It True?,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/xyzverse-is-a-scam-is-it-true,"XYZVerse is a scam! XYZVerse promises to become the G.O.A.T. of meme coins, but there is no substance behind these proclamations. XYZVerse's claim of passing a KYC audit is a false claim. Concerns like these have been popping up online about XYZVerse (XYZ), with some accusing it of being a scam and warning about potential fraud. But, if the crypto community is good at one thing – sniffing out and identifying scams, and many members have conducted their own detailed analyses to get a better understanding of the allegations against XYZVerse. XYZ is a meme coin that combines sports fandom with crypto culture and the project has reportedly raised nearly $6 million in its presale to date, which is now 77% complete, continuing to attract investor interest. Further breaking it down in numbers, XYZVerse has nearly 30,000 people following its verified X account , while its official Telegram channel boasts 15,000 users. XYZVerse has actually successfully passed an audit conducted by Pessimistic , a leading blockchain security firm. Yet, even with solid numbers and real facts on the table, some people still question XYZVerse’s legitimacy. So, let’s break it down and take a closer look at the details to clear things up. What Is XYZVerse? XYZVerse is a sports-based memeverse that merges elements of sports, gaming, and decentralized finance. Operating on the Polygon blockchain, it provides a scalable and low-cost network tailored to fans of football, MMA, eSports, and other competitive sports. XYZVerse deserves credit for building a unique ecosystem where users can leverage blockchain technology to engage, trade, and participate in sports-related activities. The project has a solid governance structure in which XYZ token holders can influence platform decisions through a voting structure. Token holders can also benefit from revenue-generating opportunities such as staking, in-game economies, and NFT trading. Why Are Investors Labeling XYZVerse a Scam? Most XYZVerse critics highlight red flags surrounding its marketing strategies, team anonymity, and the speculative nature of its token. Let’s take a look at the most pressing questions and attempt to answer each one. Claim Fact Check XYZVerse’s marketing creates FOMO to lure investors. XYZVerse’s strategic marketing campaigns highlight its features and upcoming developments. Investors are properly educated about the potential value of the XYZ coin and long-term prospects. While some hype and clever marketing tactics are used to promote the project, the primary purpose is educating the community, not about creating pure hype. The XYZVerse team is anonymous, making it untrustworthy. Anonymity is very common in the crypto space and reputable projects more than 100 times XYZVerse’s size operate with an anonymous structure. What matters is that XYZVerse’s technology, roadmap, and tokenomics are transparent and well-documented. The XYZ token has no real utility beyond speculation. The XYZ token powers the XYZVerse ecosystem. The coin enables transactions, staking, and governance. Its utility is designed to create a functioning and value-driven platform. Is XYZVerse Legit? Before jumping to conclusions, it's worth considering the solid proof that backs XYZVerse’s legitimacy. 1. Transparent Tokenomics XYZVerse has laid out a clear and transparent tokenomics model. With 25.8% of the total supply allocated to its presale and over 86% of tokens already sold, the project has raised more than $5 million to date. Additionally, the tokenomics include allocations for development, marketing, staking rewards, and community incentives, ensuring the platform’s long-term viability. Source: XYZVerse 2. Legitimate Roadmap and Timeline XYZVerse has published a comprehensive roadmap that details its vision for long-term growth and sustained development. The timelines appear properly thought out. For example, staking and liquidity mining programs are planned to go live in Q1, 2025, with the first wave of gamified products for users, play-to-earn features, and platform for mass crypto adoption development scheduled for Q2.

The audit stated that: “All 31 tests pass successfully” and “the overall quality of the code is good.

Also, the platform utilizes multi-signature authentication for its treasury and team wallets. 4. Long-Term Partnerships XYZVerse is in the process of establishing relationships with well-known blockchain projects, developers, and other key partners. For example, the team plans to form partnerships with metaverse projects and NFT marketplaces to introduce new opportunities for digital ownership, in-game economies, and interactive experiences. Source: XYZVerse 5. Media Coverage and Public Reception XYZVerse has received more than its fair share of attention from crypto media outlets. Most of the coverage was focused on XYZVerse's impressive growth, outlook, and unique approach in combining sports with crypto, and gave the project and XYZ token an industry-standard level of credibility. We at Crypto Daily, as well as other trustworthy sources such as сrypto.news, Coinspeaker, ZyCrypto, and Tron Weekly have all previously reported on XYZVerse and its developments. A recently published post on Crypto Daily discusses XYZVerse’s potential 5,000% upside return if the project hits all of its timeline goals. In an article published on Crypto.news , the XYZVerse presale progress is described as follows: “With nearly $6 million raised and over 77% of its presale sold out, XYZVerse has proven itself as one of the most promising new crypto projects.” This strong statement appeared in a piece published on Coinspeaker: Image Source: Coinspeaker One of the articles on Tron Weekly speculated how Cardano investors are shifting focus to XYZVerse and legacy investors attached to older projects are reevaluating their decision to identify new players in the meme coin space. While we've already mentioned that XYZVerse is leveraging bold marketing tactics, the fact that reputable crypto media outlets are collaborating with this project adds to its credibility. So, Is XYZVerse a Scam? While skepticism is common in the crypto world, allegations against XYZVerse don’t hold up under scrutiny. Let’s break it down once and for all by looking at the pros and cons of the project. Pros Transparent tokenomics and a reasonable roadmap Active and engaged community and strong social media presence Security audits and other initiatives to confirm platform safety Marketplace for trading digital assets, creating real-world utility for the XYZ token. Plans for XYZ token listings on major exchanges. Cons The platform is still a young startup, with many features yet to be launched. Team anonymity could prevent traditional investors even though an unknown management is an industry-standard practice. Despite being a relatively new project, XYZVerse has strong fundamentals: transparent tokenomics, a reasonable roadmap, and an engaged community – all signs of legitimacy and long-term potential. With a focus on innovation, transparency, and community engagement, XYZVerse is likely to continue winning over skeptics as it further evolves.",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|TRADING|MINING,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-01-31 10:07:23

Speaking at the 3rd International Conference on Technology, Humanities, and Management held in Maldives, Tan Sri Azam, chief commissioner of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, highlighted that technological advancements have introduced new challenges in combating crime, local media reported on Jan 30. As such, MACC is integrating AI and blockchain into its investigations to combat. According to Azam, while these technologies have enabled more sophisticated crimes, they also offer powerful tools to trace illicit activities and strengthen anti-corruption efforts. Azam pointed to AI’s ability to enhance data analysis and fraud detection , allowing MACC to uncover financial irregularities that might otherwise go unnoticed. Blockchain, he noted, ensures “immutable transaction records,” making it harder for bad actors to manipulate financial data.

Using the new tools, MACC will monitor key sectors, including law enforcement, public procurement, financial transactions, and subsidy distributions, where corruption risks are high. Azam added that the development aligns with the commission’s goal of enhancing transparency, integrity, and accountability across various sectors. Blockchain-based solutions have long been touted as a tool to combat corruption. Officials at Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation, for instance, have previously acknowledged that the technology can help protect state records and reduce corruption in oversight bodies. Malaysia’a blockchain and crypto plans Meanwhile, the development comes as part of a broader push by the Malaysian government to embrace blockchain and digital innovation. According to the country’s blockchain roadmap issued by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, the government has outlined 20 strategic initiatives and 10 core programs to integrate blockchain into public services and other areas. Such efforts have been reflected across recent partnerships, including one involving Sam Altman’s World Network (formerly Worldcoin). MIMOS Berhad, the Malaysian government’s research arm, has inked a memorandum of understanding with the Worldcoin Foundation, Tools for Humanity, and MyEG to integrate Worldcoin’s biometrics technology into Malaysian infrastructure. Beyond blockchain, lawmakers have also shown interest in positioning Malaysia as a key player in the global digital economy. As previously reported by crypto.news, Anwar Ibrahim, the country’s prime minister, underscored this ambition following a meeting with the Abu Dhabi government and Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, articulating that Malaysia must develop policies for cryptocurrency and blockchain to ensure the nation “does not get left behind.” Read more: Malaysia’s Securities Commission cracks down on Bybit for operating without registration",News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|Malaysia,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|WLD|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-31 10:10:40

Here’s All,https://coingape.com/is-blackrock-next-to-file-for-xrp-etf-after-grayscale-heres-all/,"Grayscale’s recent XRP ETF filing with the NYSE has triggered a wave of speculation in the crypto community. With multiple asset managers entering the ETF race for Ripple’s native crypto, many are now eyeing BlackRock as the next potential player to follow suit. Adding to the buzz, FOX journalist Eleanor Terrett hinted at more filings soon, fueling investor curiosity. Grayscale XRP ETF Filing Sparks Market Optimism Grayscale has officially submitted a 19b-4 form through the NYSE to convert its existing XRP Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) . If approved, the ETF will be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Notably, the Trust, which was created following Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in the Ripple vs. SEC case, currently holds $16 million in assets under management (AUM). Meanwhile, this move marks Grayscale as the latest asset manager to apply for an XRP ETF in the US. Notably, this filing comes on the heels of Grayscale’s other ETF applications, including Litecoin ETF, Solana ETF, and Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF . Having said that, it appears that the firm is aggressively expanding its ETF offerings, raising expectations for more filings from other big players. Is BlackRock Next To File For XRP ETF? Adding to the recent excitement, FOX journalist Eleanor Terrett shared an X post suggesting that more XRP ETF applications could surface next week. Terrett stated: “Keep an eye out for possibly more filing activity by issuers with $XRP ETF applications next week.” In addition, responding to a user’s question about BlackRock’s possible entry, Terrett said, “Issuers with XRP ETF applications.” Although this statement left room for speculation, she refuted claims of such possibilities in the next week. In other words, while she didn’t confirm BlackRock’s involvement, her words have fueled market chatter. Given BlackRock’s history of leading ETF innovations, especially with its successful Spot Bitcoin ETF launch last year, many believe the firm could be strategizing an XRP ETF launch. What’s Next For Ripple’s Native Crypto? XRP price today traded in the red and exchanged hands at $3.08, while its trading volume fell 31% to $4.7 billion. It appears that the investors are staying on the sideline after the US Fed maintained the interest rate at the latest FOMC. In addition, the traders are also moving cautiously ahead of the crucial US PCE inflation data, scheduled for later today. However, with soaring optimism over a potential XRP ETF launch in the US, speculations soared over a continuing rally in XRP price. For context, eight asset managers have now officially filed for an XRP ETF , including Bitwise, CoinShares, Canary Capital, 21 Shares, WisdomTree. Furthermore, if BlackRock steps in, it would add significant credibility to XRP’s position in the investment market. Having said that, speculations over potential XRP addition in the US Strategic Reserve have already fueled a clash between Bitcoin maxis and XRP enthusiasts. Meanwhile, the experts still remained optimistic about the crypto’s future trajectory, given the latest ETF filings and other market developments. Amid this, a top expert recently predicted a potential XRP price rally to $5, if it breaks a crucial support level ahead. The post Is BlackRock Next To File For XRP ETF After Grayscale?

Pepeto is unlike other memecoins that are based on hype as it integrates advanced blockchain technology, staking rewards and interoperability features. As investors explore new opportunities, many believe Pepeto could redefine the memecoin landscape. Pepeto’s Strategic Roadmap Pepeto’s roadmap focuses on technology and long-term sustainability. Every milestone has been met so far, demonstrating strong project execution. A key feature of Pepeto is its staking mechanism, which allows investors to earn passive income while strengthening the network. PepetoSwap, the project’s upcoming decentralized exchange, is expected to transform memecoin trading by providing a seamless experience. This initiative ensures that early investors and long-term supporters benefit from Pepeto’s expansion. As #Pepeto grows, it poses a serious challenge to Dogecoin, which has largely relied on social media-driven hype rather than a structured ecosystem. A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 Dogecoin’s Rise and Its Limitations The factor which pushed Dogecoin fast ahead in the crypto market is that it began as a joke. While DOGE has not been that talked about recently, it has stayed one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in general due to the tremendous support by the likes of Elon Musk, and a community that has never stopped cheering. At press time, DOGE trades at $0.334925 with a trading volume over the last 24 hours of $1,913,700,299 up 4.41%. While Dogecoin is still popular, without any real-world utility, it relies on market sentiment and not technological advancement. Volatility and price fluctuations are high due to high dependence on speculation. While Cardano (ADA) tried to outpace DOGE’s market capitalisation, no other cryptocurrencies have been successful. #Pepeto’s innovative approach may reverse that. Major Listings and Future Growth Pepeto’s presale phase includes listings on five major exchanges, ensuring broad accessibility and investor confidence. These listings increase visibility and enhance the token’s credibility, setting the stage for widespread adoption. The structured listing approach creates a solid foundation for liquidity and user onboarding. With a total supply of 420 trillion tokens and a carefully planned distribution model, #Pepeto is built for long-term success. Investors can stake their holdings to further reinforce price stability and earn rewards. Unlike traditional memecoins that rely on speculative trading, Pepeto’s economic framework fosters sustainable growth. Its tokenomics strategy mitigates risks associated with sudden sell-offs and price manipulation. How to Buy and Stake $Pepeto Acquiring $Pepeto is a simple process: Set Up a Wallet – Investors need a Metamask or a compatible wallet to store their tokens. Fund the Wallet – Users can load their wallets with ETH, USDT, or BNB. Purchase and Stake – Investors connect their wallets to the Pepeto website, choose a payment method, and decide whether to stake their tokens for additional rewards. Staking offers significant benefits, including a 355% return rate, making it an appealing option for early adopters. Pepeto’s staking rewards are distributed at a rate of 32,015,981.73 $Pepeto per ETH block over a two-year period. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

This new feature gives issuers the ability to recover tokens, even after they’ve been sent, offering a level of control never seen before. But that’s not all. This amendment also opens the door for Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, to be used in Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools, unlocking a world of new opportunities. Let’s dive in and explore the details. What Issuers Should Know With the AMMClawback amendment, issuers can now recover tokens that are sent to unintended or illegal recipients. This is particularly important if tokens are linked to illegal activities, as issuers can quickly take back the funds. This feature adds an extra layer of security and control to the XRP ecosystem. Before this amendment, RLUSD could only be used within centralized exchanges. Now, with RLUSD enabled in AMM pools, Ripple’s stablecoin can be used more widely. This opens up new opportunities for its adoption and liquidity, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi) spaces. Increasing Liquidity for RLUSD Experts believe that the XRP/RLUSD pool will significantly increase the liquidity of Ripple’s stablecoin. By allowing RLUSD to be used in decentralized platforms, this update is expected to create more opportunities for growth, helping to strengthen its value and stability. Ripple’s Focus on Regulatory Compliance Former Ripple executive Emi Yoshikawa expressed excitement about the development, praising the XRPL community for its continued support. Jack McDonald, another Ripple executive, highlighted the company’s commitment to global financial regulations. He stated that RLUSD is fully compliant with the highest regulatory standards, ensuring its continued success in the global market. Experts agree that the new AMMClawback feature aligns with international financial regulations. This update ensures that if RLUSD is linked to fraud, Ripple can quickly take back the tokens, offering more protection for users and investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Can Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda Drop the Ripple Case? , Ripple USD Market Overview The market cap of Ripple USD stands at $72,339,549.

Support levels at $3.06 and $3.10 crucial for XRP’s near-term price stability. Technical indicators suggest weakening momentum, signaling potential price pullback. XRP’s price is on the radar as February 2025 approaches, and while the current forecast suggests modest growth, the token is struggling to break out. Trading around $3.08 and down a slight 0.71% in the past 24 hours, XRP’s next move is the subject of much speculation. Analysts are eyeing a potential 2.05% increase in the coming month, which would put the average price at $3.15 — a 6.70% return from current levels. Market Overview and Price Trends XRP has been showing signs of consolidation in the past few weeks, trading within a narrow range of $3.06 to $3.14. After peaking at $3.14, the price dipped slightly, currently sitting at $3.08. This downward shift marks a period of price consolidation, with lower highs and consistent rejections at the $3.12 and $3.14 resistance levels.

POTUS has reaffirmed his stance about de-dollarization, saying that if their nations do not maintain the dollar’s role in global trade, he will impose 100% import tariffs. POTUS wrote on Truth Social, “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar, while we stand by and watch, is over.” Source: DJT truth social The intergovernmental economic – now turned political block – includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. There is now new additions including Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates. They have been discussing alternatives to the US dollar for international trade. Trump added, “They can go find another sucker nation. There is no chance that BRICS will replace the US dollar in international trade, or anywhere else, and any country that tries should say hello to tariffs, and goodbye to America!” BRICS vs. America – The economic power thirst Trump’s reference to tariffs against BRICS countries highlights his return to his well-known trade strategies. In his first term, Trump placed taxes on many goods to help reduce trade imbalances and support American manufacturing. At the 15th BRICS Summit, the Russian president urged BRICS countries to reduce their use of the US dollar. Putin insisted they should ramp up transactions in their own currencies and improve teamwork among their banks. Is this even possible? To have a BRICS currency that can compete with the US dollar, the member countries would need to give up their own currencies. This means that they need to create a central bank to manage the new currency together. Note that the bloc economies are too different from one another for a monetary union to work well. This is because successful monetary unions usually come from small economies that are closely linked. In addition, they should trade extensively and have shared goals, cultures, similar economic trends, and integrated job markets. Another thing to consider is that several BRICS countries, especially China, send a lot of goods to the US market. For instance, in 2022, the US bought $536.8B in goods from China. This made it one of the biggest trade ties globally. Trump’s threats to raise tariffs might harm business relationships. Something to note: BRICS represents nearly half of the world’s population and is also considered a counterpart to the G7 group of countries. Trump’s tariff plans have yet to account for the impact the Biden administration has left behind. The weak leadership empowered BRICS to grow – a milestone not seen since the group was formed. The imposition of tariffs in Mexico and Canada is happening Tariffs are no longer a threat to some nations. Trump has said he will follow through with tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico with 25% on 1 February. POTUS’s reasoning behind this is that Mexico’s so-called ‘illegal aliens’ have been crossing the border into the U.S. On the other hand, Canada has been allowing the flow of drugs like fentanyl. The president asserted, “Until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very [a] big price!” However, Trump said he’s still considering whether to include oil from those countries as part of his import taxes. He stated, “We may or may not.” What will determine his decision is whether oil prices charged by Washington’s two North American trade partners are fair. On the other hand, officials in Ottawa and Mexico City came up with strategies to respond to Washington’s tariffs with tariffs of their own. The planned action has increased the likelihood of a detrimental trade war. Also, businesses in the United States and around the world have issued warnings regarding the potential for pervasive disruption in the event that the Trump administration proceeds.

However, it turned out that the hashrate of the solo miner was donated by the 300+ members in a fundraiser for 256 Foundation. Several X accounts and at least one news outlet wrote about a “lucky” solo miner who won the entire mining reward of over 3.1 BTC. The Bitcoin Historian account on X claimed that the $400 worth home miner managed to solve a block with a reward worth $330,000. BREAKING: A $400 home #Bitcoin miner just mined a block worth OVER $330,000 They beat ONCE IN A LIFETIME odds 🔥 🔥 pic.twitter.com/sRGzMqjQRC — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) January 30, 2025 Later, it was revealed that the “solo miner” in question used the hashrate aggregated from over 300 miners. This hashrate was donated in the 10-hour-long event, which was the first-ever annual fundraiser launched by 256 Foundation , a non-profit organization with an unusual mission of making Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin in general more accessible and simple for people. Why does solving the block by a solo miner turn heads? Back in the day, it was possible to mine hundreds of bitcoins with a usual PC, and some really did it out of curiosity or because they were tech-savvy enough to realize the potential of Bitcoin when these coins cost nothing. Reportedly , by the end of 2009 there were less than a hundred Bitcoin miners who mined around 2.5 million bitcoins at the lowest difficulty, which increased 90 trillion times since then. Those days, the mining reward was 50 BTC per block (against 3.125 BTC as of today), and mining required nothing but pretty much any then-modern computer. It could be a regular laptop without a fancy GPU. In 2011, bitcoins still didn’t cost much while the price was volatile. To understand how miniscule the BTC value was, you can take a look at the now famous list of the rewards for competitors in the StarCraft 2 gaming tournament in 2011. The prize fund of $1,000 was distributed among the best four teams, while the fifth (the worst) one received some 25 BTC as a booby prize. A StarCraft gaming tournament took place 10 years ago and these were the prizes that teams could win: https://t.co/EF0La7UDLy pic.twitter.com/wOeo1r2JuF — Documenting ₿itcoin 📄 (@DocumentingBTC) February 6, 2021 As the BTC value began to rise, the mining difficulty started to take off. Despite the protests from Satoshi Nakamoto , miners started to use GPUs early in the fall of 2010. The affordable opportunity to get bitcoins out of your laptop started to fade away. Participating in mining pools became the remedy for those who still want to earn some bitcoins via mining. The mining pool participants contribute their hashing power to the overall pool’s hashrate and collectively, they are able to solve blocks. The reward is split among the participants. Things intensified in 2013 when the first application-specific integrated circuits, high-end devices manufactured to mine bitcoins, entered the game. Industrial-level companies fill the factories with long rows of ASICs, doing the only thing–mining new bitcoins. ASICs are too noisy and hard-to-maintain so they are not something you would use at home. Read more: What is a crypto mining farm? The ultimate guide Selling bitcoins that were mined soon became a must to cover the costs of mining. Miners not selling their bitcoins is a new trend of the Trump Trade era when Bitcoin maximalism saw a new bloom amid the promises of crypto-friendly regulations and the BTC price crossing the $100k mark. Before, miners had to sell BTC to stay afloat. Given how high the difficulty is, even mining via the pool requires costly mining devices. A few mining pools are responsible for most hashrate in Bitcoin mining, meaning that a solo miner has to be really lucky to solve the block before one of the mining pools does it. On the one hand, the mind-boggling difficulty rates save the network from weakly organized bad actors (all the good-willing enthusiasts get blocked, too, though). On the other hand, it creates a situation when only a few organizations are validating all the transactions, and we can only hope that none of them has ill intentions. Considering the fact that Bitcoin solo mining is not a part of the mainstream narrative in the crypto community, the news about the block solved by a solo miner takes people by surprise. 256 Foundation: bring Bitcoin back to the people The foundation was created in February 2024. Its goal is “dismantling the proprietary mining empire” and “making Bitcoin and freedom tech accessible for all.” 256 Foundation is busy educating people about Bitcoin so that it would be easier for anyone to engage with it, use it, improve it, or mine it. To make Bitcoin more accessible, 256 Foundation develops and distributes free and open-source software for mining. Giving its users the freedom to do with the software whatever they want is one of the core principles of 256 Foundation, so they can share, upgrade, use, or even sell the solutions made available by 256 Foundation. Today is the deepseek moment for Bitcoin mining. Because this block was found in a public way we are able to get access to low level logging on the Apollo II. Block found, proccessed, and submitted to the Bitcoin network within 500ms (half a second). This with 300 dollars… pic.twitter.com/oXvCMo11jL — John S (@JStefanop1) January 30, 2025 On Jan. 30, the foundation held its first fundraiser. In a 10-hour-long event, over 350 entities were mining in the 256 Foundation pool. The hashrate was contributed to the solo miner, which solved the block at around 881 Ph/s rate. Thus, the 256 Foundation community raised 3.146 BTC. The entities participating in the fundraiser mining event were using the FutureBit Apollo devices. These devices were created as an opposition to the centralization of mining. It allows solo miners to solve blocks again. The message behind 256 Foundation and FutureBit is that mining is more affordable than the big pools and corporations want you to know. They encourage people to try mining Bitcoin and see that it is not impossible if people follow their advice. The FutureBit founder sees it as a David and Goliath situation, and for now, despite the lucky shot, Goliath is at his full strength.

Notably, the coin has rallied intraday against the backdrop of strong technical indicators, defying the current broader crypto market’s volatile trend. Simultaneously, market participants anticipate whether the coin could sustain a price rally ahead, primarily in the wake of macroeconomic events impacting broader market sentiments. Here’s Why JasmyCoin’s Price Is Pumping Today Notably, JasmyCoin’s price appears to be pumping primarily due to strong market technicals, defying broader trends. According to market enthusiast Paul Webborn on X , the token further reflects a highly bullish outlook, with its current surge in line with the Elliott Wave theory. For context, the Elliott Wave theory is a technical analysis that suggests prices move in repetitive patterns called waves. These waves are categorized as ‘primary, intermediate, and minor.’ As per the market enthusiast, the token has completed primary waves 1 to 4, leaving room for gains as the final impulse wave (5) progresses. The next resistance level lies at $0.082, whilst $0.32 remains the final target, per the market analyst. Overall, this bullish projection and market breakdown have echoed noteworthy optimism surrounding JasmyCoin’s price action ahead. Source: Paul Webborn, X Derivatives Market Signals Rising Market Interest Further, the derivatives data for the asset underscored heightened market interest in the asset as it showcases the potential for further gains. According to the latest Coinglass data, JASMY futures OI shot up by 44%, reaching $63.10 million today. Further, the derivatives volume witnessed a staggering 648% increase to $562.54 million. As a response, JasmyCoin’s price surged remarkably amid burgeoning market interest and further money inflow to its ecosystem. Coin’s Price Shoots 23% As of press time, JASMY token’s price witnessed a 23% surge in value and is currently sitting at $0.03253. The coin’s intraday bottom and peak remain at $0.0261 and $0.03392, respectively. Further, intraday trading volume for the asset rose by 443% to $553.15 million, underscoring optimism among traders amid the recent pump, It’s also worth mentioning that the coin defies the current crypto market trend ahead of the U.S. PCE inflation data release. Bitcoin & altcoins witness a turbulent action after unchanged interest rates this FOMC whilst the PCE data looms. Despite these macroeconomic events bringing investor uncertainty around risk assets, JASMY continues to pump. Meanwhile, market analyst ‘CryptoELITES has further posted on X, portraying a bullish outlook for the coin. “Jasmy is heading to $0.31 very soon,” the analyst added, sparking optimism over the future price action for the token.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin’s price over the past six months has soared by 196.34%, showing significant growth. In the last month, the price increased by 5.84%, indicating steady progress. However, the past week saw a decline of 8.57%, bringing the current price range to between $0.31 and $0.38. The nearest support level is at $0.29, while resistance stands at $0.42. If Dogecoin breaks through the $0.42 resistance, it could aim for the second resistance level at $0.49. On the downside, if it falls below the support at $0.29, the next support is at $0.22. The simple moving averages for both 10 days and 100 days are at $0.33, suggesting the price is hovering around its average. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index at 56.23 and the Stochastic at 74.33 point towards potential upward movement. The MACD level of 0.001159 also supports this outlook. Based on these factors, Dogecoin may see a rise in price in the near future, possibly testing the resistance levels. Investors might watch for a break above $0.42 to signal further growth. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced mixed performance lately. Over the past week, its price dipped by 7.64%, and over the past month, it decreased by 11.75%. However, looking at a broader timeframe, SHIB has gained 27.19% in the last six months, indicating significant long-term growth. Currently, SHIB is trading within a range of $0.00001802 to $0.00002117, hovering near its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.00001857 and $0.00001874, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 56.27, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic oscillator is at 74.06, hinting at potential upward momentum. Key support and resistance levels are critical to watch. The nearest support level is at $0.00001694; if the price falls below this, it could test the second support at $0.00001379. On the upside, the nearest resistance is at $0.00002324. Breaking through this level might lead SHIB towards the second resistance at $0.00002639, representing a potential increase of around 30% from current prices. The recent technical indicators suggest that SHIB could be poised for a rebound if it can surpass these resistance levels. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB are strong, but XYZVerse (XYZ) is positioned to outperform them, uniting sports fans for massive gains in the 2025 bull run.

However, the whale address may be linked to the project, performing a buyback. World Liberty Financial showed a new large-scale buy from a whale, for a total of $10M. The purchase comes during the second stage of the presale, where WLFI tokens are offered for $0.05. So far, the fund has sold 23.76B tokens, getting closer to the end of the second stage at $25M. WLFI sales have accelerated thanks to the popularity of the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme token. Additionally, Justin Sun, TRON’s founder, joined with several significant purchases. The latest whale transaction, however, points to a potential insider wallet. The purchases originated from a multi-sig wallet, which acquired more than $20M of WLFI in the past few days. Whale wallet linked to main World Liberty Fi addresses On-chain investigators noted the wallet is not a random whale buyer, as WLFI is mostly acquired in small batches by retail clients buying in support of Trump. The selling of WLFI is further limited for US buyers, as it is only open to accredited investors. The recent buyer has already become the single biggest investor after Justin Sun, based on the size of purchases and the accumulated stake. The address, however, has shown an early link to the WLFI cold wallet, which first funded the buyer when generating the wallet. Additionally, the buyer’s wallet has signing rights to the WLFI cold storage wallet. The connection between the buyer and seller addresses suggest World Liberty Fi may have organized a form of buyback, or another action linked to insider buying. The recent purchase is also viewed as a potential buyback, adding to the fund’s initial insider holding of over 80% of the WLFI supply. The token will remain locked for at least 12 months after the completion of funding rounds. After that, the code suggests WLFI may become transferable. However, there are no mechanisms for the token’s usage beyond voting, where the public will have a limited influence due to holding a smaller share of the supply. The involvement of large-scale wallets brings the target sale of WLFI closer. The token completed its first presale round on January 20, after the hype created by the launch of TRUMP. Since then, WLFI sales slowed down, once again pressured by the realization that the token will not be transferable and may not start trading any time soon. World Liberty Fi grows crypto portfolio World Liberty Fi is also growing the value of its crypto portfolio, which appreciated to over $413M. The fund acquired Ethereum (ETH) and other assets from the ecosystem in preparation for its DeFi activity. In the meantime, the assets appreciated, though for now the fund has no intentions of selling. The fund’s balance increased from a recent value of $380M, after additional token buying and market appreciation. The fund also acquired MOVE tokens, which slid to $1.86M, causing an unrealized 7.5% loss. World Liberty Fi holds over $205M in ETH, showing confidence by buying the recent market dips. The buying of ETH is seen as a relatively risky move, but the fund will own an asset that can be used for collateralized lending. Despite the relatively slow development for crypto standards, World Liberty Fi is closely watched as a potential bullish sign for crypto development. Some consider the fund as a bid to extend the ‘Made in USA’ crypto concept. $WLFI has a lofty goal: cement the U.S. dollar as the cornerstone of DeFi by creating a future where dollar-backed stablecoins dominate global transactions. This won’t happen overnight. While the project could be a hit, there are some token concerns in the near term: (1/5) — Weiss Crypto (@WeissCrypto) January 30, 2025 The fund’s popularity has even reached the AI agent space.

Dogecoin Unleashed: Is the Meme Coin Ready for Another Surge? Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it used a Shiba Inu dog, a popular internet meme, as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant. Every minute, 10,000 new coins are mined, and there’s no maximum limit. What began as a fun alternative to serious cryptocurrencies quickly gained attention. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared. It became one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market value, reaching over $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz, especially tweets from Elon Musk, and a booming crypto market. Dogecoin’s technology is simple and based on existing cryptocurrency systems, which makes transactions fast and cheap. Its abundant supply and strong community support make it unique. Some see potential in its wide acceptance and low transaction fees. However, others are cautious because of its origins as a meme and the lack of a clear development plan. In the current market, cryptocurrencies are experiencing ups and downs. While Bitcoin and Ethereum focus on new features and improvements, Dogecoin relies on community and social media influence. Whether Dogecoin will surge again is uncertain, but its story shows how community and viral content can impact markets. Conclusion While DOGE and others are good, XYZVerse (XYZ) is exploding as a community-driven sports memecoin, aiming for massive growth and uniting fans worldwide.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP whales offload token, driving prices down; meanwhile, Panshibi emerges as a promising new meme coin Table of Contents Ripple’s latest news: XRP selloffs may spark a trend Panshibi lives up to the hype Conclusion Over the last day, XRP whales have sold more than $300 million worth of XRP tokens, driving the XRP price into a nosedive in the market. The knock-on effect of large token outflows like this usually takes up to weeks and may even trigger other selloffs from other crypto investors. Analysts aren’t very bullish about the prospects of the XRP token. Holders of the Defi coin can expect a continuous downtrend, at least in the short term. Meanwhile, several new projects are entering the market. The new presale token Panshibi, has become an interesting option despite only just entering the second stage of its presale. Ripple’s latest news: XRP selloffs may spark a trend Crypto analysts believe that the selloff by XRP investors could fuel a trend throughout the broader crypto market, considering how influential Ripple has grown in the past few months. The latest news about Ripple revealed that XRP whales have dumped $360 million worth of XRP tokens in the last 24 hours, further contributing to XRP’s declining price. If the situation does not change soon, then XRP’s price might emerge at pre-2024 levels during the height of the bear market. ETF approvals and major exchange listings are expected over the next few months and would likely trigger a price rally for XRP. However, those are long-term changes that have no real guarantee. You might also like: Expert suggests having Panshibi alongside Bitcoin and Cardano in 2025 Panshibi lives up to the hype The Panshibi presale token is living up to the expectations of crypto analysts, who said the token could become one of the best-performing meme coins in 2025. While the meme coin’s presale has been capped at $10 million, it is still attracting investors from across the industry. Panshibi’s appeal comes from its narrative, which combines three strong communities: Asia, Pandas, and meme coins. It also offers much in the way of utility, as its token holders get access to staking rewards, governance rights, and exclusive VIP membership perks. Having entered the second stage of its presale, Panshibi is currently selling at $0.003. Panshibi’s presale will consist of 15 stages, with 60% of its total supply up for grabs. Conclusion While analysts ponder over why XRP’s price continues falling, Panshibi is moving quickly with its presale and is on course to become a lead performer. The token is now attracting interest from analysts, investors, and enthusiasts across the industry. Stage 1 investors have already gained 50% ROI as the SHIBI coin has surged from $0.002 to $0.003, and there are still some presale gains for investors who join in now.

Ethereum (ETH) shows signs of a potential price surge, fueled by significant whale activity. Despite recent underperformance, whales accumulate ETH during the recent dip, a sign of strong bullish sentiment among major market players. According to a post on X (formerly Twitter) by well-known analyst Ali Martinez, whales scooped up a massive 100,000 ETH during the market dip when investors saw ETH drop to the support at $2,900. As the support level holds strong, market analysts make bullish predictions for the cryptocurrency. Yet another crypto analyst on X, Ted, stated that in the short term, ETH could climb as high as $4,000 before witnessing any significant correction. The analyst believes that a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency is likely by March while he predicted ETH at $4,500 in the month of February.

The frenzy intensified with President Trump’s pro-crypto statements, promises, and actions. Within a month, new meme coins have emerged from Solana and other ecosystems, recording huge inflows in billions of dollars. $MOCHI and $BENJI are two meme coins making waves this January. $CHONE is also not left behind, with speculations around its future making headlines. The Meme Coin Frenzy: $MOCHI and $BENJI Take Part Both new and old meme coins are enjoying the current frenzy around their asset class. One major contribution to the large inflows into meme coins could be the participation of institutional investors and whales. There are over 300 meme coins in the market right now, and the combined market cap is nearly $100 billion. $MOCHI . and $BENJI contribute $35 million and $49 million, respectively. While this might be relatively small, they recently made the top gainers spot, with one rising as high as 300% in one month. $BENJI is currently enjoying a 17% increase in the last 24 hours. It’s riding on the momentum it picked up in the last month, climbing over 140%. $MOCHI has gained 192% in the last month, adding an 18% increase to its market cap. $CHONE Could Be The Next Breakout Star In under one month, $CHONE has gone from no holder to close to 2,000 holders. It also moved its market cap above $500k, hitting 900k at some point before a slight decline. Chill Drone ($CHONE) brings a fresh narrative in a market where recycled narratives are the order of the day. This gives $CHONE an advantage as a first mover, which could later be copied and further publicized. This was a major characteristic of Dogecoin that triggered its widespread adoption. With a few celebrity mentions and the right ad spend, $CHONE could be the next big thing everyone is chasing after. $CHONE’s philosophy adopts a counter-culture approach. And in a world where many follow the herd mentality, a group remains that chooses to think and move at their own pace. Chill Drone calls investors away from the chaos and endless battle for domination. It introduces an alternative where everyone is relaxed while holding on to profitability. The peak of this adventure will be actualized when $CHONE introduces its GameFi feature. $CHONE’s Roadmap Chill Drone ($CHONE) has shown a very clear path to the moon via its roadmap. After its token launch, the next plan is to list $CHONE on decentralized and centralized exchanges. This will open up $CHONE to the global market liquidity. The next major step will be launching its game with real-life rewards. This is where it gets interesting for investors. $CHONE holders get to enjoy entertainment while holding a profitable bag. They will also get rewards that can be converted to real-world value. The success of this gaming stage will usher the Chill Drone into the next phase, which is global recognition and adoption.

Here are the Critical Levels to Watch!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/attention-there-is-a-10-3-billion-options-earthquake-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-today-here-are-the-critical-levels-to-watch/,"While the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) rose above $ 106,000 following the FED decision, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market came today, as every Friday. These options are even more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to the news of Singapore-based crypto options data platform Greeks.live, 80,000 Bitcoin and 603,000 Ethereum options will expire on January 31 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.68, the maximum loss point is $98,000 and the notional value is $8.38 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.43, a maximum loss point of $3,430, and a notional value of $1.96 million. Analysts said the market has been slow this week, largely because it is trying to digest the impact of the 3-month-old Trump trade. “Trump’s inauguration did not bring the expected large amount of capital to the crypto community, causing cryptocurrencies to weaken due to the launch of new memccoins and slow policy announcements. But in the long term, there seems to be a lot of positive things to look forward to for Bitcoin and altcoins to rise.” The “maximum loss” price is the level at which option buyers suffer the greatest losses and market makers see the greatest profits. Historically, prices tend to drift toward the maximum pain level as expiration approaches, making $98,000 a critical level to watch. What Does the Put/Call Ratio Signal for Bitcoin and Ethereum? The put/call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of put options by the number of call options. A ratio below 1 means there are more buys than puts, indicating an uptrend. A ratio above 1 means there are more puts than calls, indicating a downtrend. A ratio close to 1 means the market is balanced or neutral. For Bitcoin, this ratio is 0.68, indicating that the upward trend is still ongoing. For Ethereum, it is 0.43, indicating an upward trend. Accordingly, these rates indicate an upward trend for BTC and ETH. However, time will tell how these rates will affect the price. At this point, do not make your investment decisions based on a single data or report. https://twitter.com/GreeksLive/status/1885248799893053866 *This is not investment advice.

The approval of ETFs by the SEC, BTC reaching All-Time High at $108K, the regulators’ embracing crypto payments and the mega bounce back of Donald Trump by winning the 2024 US Elections. What was only a $1.6 trillion crypto market cap at the beginning of 2024, nearly tripled to reach $3.33 trillion by October end of the year (sourced from TradingView Data). Owing to this, the major exchanges saw an unprecedented surge in the user base with Coinbase registering growth at 14.3% Y-o-Y basis and globally recognised platform, Binance, surpassing 250 million global registered users in 2024. And the enthusiasm shared by new investors after the Trump and Melania Token launch in the beginning of 2025, augurs well for the continued growth story expected for 2025 too. Thus, as this year is poised to witness remarkable growth in the crypto user base with new investors leading the surge, newly established exchanges are sprawling up on the crypto landscape to drive the change. Next Gen Crypto Exchanges offering New Solutions Exchanges like EasyBit, Simple Swap, Stealth Ex, FreedeX are trying to get rid of the elite and experienced investors’ biases in the Crypto market. The complex technical concepts and rigid price prediction mechanisms deter new investors from entering the crypto space. This is rendering the sole foundational aims of democratisation and decentralisation by Blockchain tech irrelevant. Fear of being new and becoming a victim of volatility infused risks drive the new desperate crypto entrants away. However, new Exchanges like FreedEx are promising to make crypto simple and transparent. Coming as the needed support, the 2024 established Dubai-headquartered exchange, FreedEx, received USD $50M in funding this week – to make the Crypto trading experience user-friendly and innovative. “New Dawn for Crypto” CEO of Freedx, Jonathan Farnell, calls the coming up of the Freedx Exchange as a “new dawn for crypto”. He highlights how the exchange is aiming to create a secure, regulated, innovative and compliant platform. It is using the expertise from its foundational team of experienced professionals in the crypto, finance and tech sectors. To mark its global footprint, it has already secured regulatory licences in Panama and a Bitcoin license in El Salvador. How many people wanted to buy crypto but never did because it was too complicated? Confusing signups Complex processes Lack of guidance Millions have been left behind—not because they didn’t want crypto, but because it wasn’t built for them. Crypto needs to be simple… pic.twitter.com/0EvD8N47IW — Freedx (@FreedxExchange) January 31, 2025 User-Centric Features and 24/7 Support In order to drive mass adoption by everyday users, FreedX aims to offer an around-the-clock support team to its users. They can live chat, phone, or email, for any of the issues faced by them or to seek clarity on any of the investment actions, say how to transfer funds to your wallet, among others. Apart from focusing on major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum, FreedX also aims to make available the access to its users the untapped potential of over 7,300 cryptocurrencies. Since only 20 of them dominate 86% of the market, it regards the rest of the cryptos as a goldmine of untapped potential. Set for its beta launch in Q1 2025, Freedx aims to offer proprietary security protocols, high-speed order matching engine, and advanced trading tools for simplified trading experience for its users. You can look at the step-by-step guide to enter crypto trading here: https://freedx.com/blog/crypto-trading Therefore, a newcomer into the crypto market can be relieved of stressful trading mechanisms and overcome its fear of naivety. Moreover, as new exchanges continue to develop and simplify the trading processes, they can ensure mass adoption of crypto soon.

Historische data tonen aan dat de koers vaak snel terugveert na volatiliteit, soms met winsten tot 34%. Ook institutionele interesse neemt toe, met een netto-instroom van $67,77 miljoen in ETH ETF’s, geleid door BlackRock. In dit artikel analyseren we de recente koersontwikkelingen, de impact van institutionele investeringen en de koersverwachting van Ethereum. Ethereum koers herstelt na FOMC In de afgelopen maanden heeft Ethereum een opvallend herstelpatroon laten zien na perioden van marktvolatiliteit als gevolg van FOMC-aankondigingen. Uit gegevens van Sentiment Feed’s Net Realized Profit/Loss (NPL)-indicator blijkt dat ETH vaak een significante prijsstijging doormaakt tijdens deze momenten van verhoogde volatiliteit. Specifiek reageert Ethereum op plotselinge dalingen met snelle herstelbewegingen, waarbij de omvang van deze rebounds varieert. In sommige gevallen steeg de koers met maar liefst 34%, terwijl het herstel in andere situaties beperkter bleef, rond de 14%. Door Ethereum’s prijsschommelingen te overlappen met de capitulatiedata op de grafiek wordt dit patroon nog duidelijker zichtbaar. Sinds de laatste FOMC-aankondiging is Ethereum al met 5,35% gestegen, wat wijst op een aanhoudend positieve trend. Dit sterke marktsentiment kan ETH verder omhoog stuwen richting de $3800, ondanks wereldwijde economische onzekerheden. Daarnaast maakt de institutionele vraag naar Ethereum een comeback. Op 30 januari steeg de totale dagelijkse netto-instroom voor Ethereum ETF’s naar $67,77 miljoen. BlackRock liep voorop met een aankoop van $79,86 miljoen aan ETH. Andere opvallende kopers waren Fidelity en Grayscale, met respectievelijke aankopen van $15,41 miljoen en $12,79 miljoen. De enige verkoper op 30 januari was de Grayscale mini-Ethereum trust, die $40,29 miljoen vrijgaf. De overige vijf Amerikaanse spot Ethereum ETF’s registreerden geen instroom. ETH breekt uit na bullish omkering Op de 4-uursgrafiek laat de ETH prijstrend een bullish omkering zien met een ‘double bottom’ patroon. Zoals eerder voorspeld, heeft de omkeringsrally het 23,6% Fibonacci-niveau op $3248 overschreden. De herstelrally heeft tevens de bovenste Bollinger-band opgerekt, wat een stijging van 1,12% in de afgelopen 4 uur weerspiegelt. Nu Ethereum een post-retest omkering heeft voltooid op het 23,6% Fibonacci-niveau, lijkt de opwaartse trend de overhead-weerstandstrendlijn uit te dagen. Met de rally die voortduurt, suggereren de Bollinger-banden een mogelijke uitbraak. Koersverwachting Ethereum Volgens de In/Out of the Money-grafiek van Intotheblock nadert ETH een cruciale weerstandzone tussen $3264 en $3342. Deze zone bevat 6,26 miljoen ETH, wat het een hoogaanbodgebied maakt. Momenteel houdt de ‘at the money’ zone 7,85 miljoen ETH vast tussen $3109 en $3264, wat wijst op een belangrijk niveau. Op de daily benadrukken Fibonacci-niveaus cruciale doelen bij het 50% en 100% retracementniveau, respectievelijk op $3509 en $4079. Aan de onderkant blijft de $3000 supportzone naar verwachting sterk in het eerste kwartaal van 2025. Hoewel ETH er goed voor staat en met de tweede plek qua marketcap de meest prominente altcoin is, kan het interessant zijn om ook opkomende crypto met een lagere marketcap te ontdekken voor potentieel grotere winsten. Een opvallend voorbeeld hiervan is Mind of Pepe (MIND) . Dit project combineert AI-innovatie met meme coin charme en fungeert als een autonome AI agent in crypto. Het analyseert altcoin trends en biedt exclusieve inzichten aan MIND holders. De presale heeft al $4,6 miljoen opgehaald en biedt ook de optie om te staken tegen een APY van 490%.

39731352,566d582e-fd29-4755-b9e2-bc61466b354a,1738324800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/39731352.jpeg,Crypto Daybook Americas: USDC Takes January Crown as Bitcoin Looks to Core PCE Data,https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/01/31/crypto-daybook-americas-usdc-takes-january-crown-as-bitcoin-looks-to-core-pce-data,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The crypto market is treading water and the biggest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, is taking a bull breather. Its upward momentum is getting stifled by Trump's renewed tariff threats, which are also sending gold prices soaring to record highs and propping up demand for the U.S. dollar. But there is action in some corners of the market. The VIRTUAL token popped after its recent listing on Upbit, and Hyperliquid's HYPE token has seen a 3% gain. Litecoin is also making waves, with its perpetual futures open interest on centralized exchanges climbing to 5.19 million LTC, the most since Dec. 9, according to Coinglass. The surge hints at fresh capital flowing into the market, likely fueled by hopes of a spot ETF listing in the U.S. Speaking of stablecoins, USDC is stealing the spotlight as the star performer this month, boasting a remarkable market cap growth of 21% to $53.12 billion. That's its best month since May 2021, according to TradingView data. In contrast, USDT, the heavyweight champion of dollar-pegged stablecoins, eked out just a 1% increase. USDC even outperformed bitcoin, which grew a respectable 10%. According to IntoTheBlock, USDC's outperformance is likely due to its compliance with Europe’s MiCA regulations, while rivals like USDT face tough headwinds . But don’t count USDT out just yet; its market is starting to bounce back, and the simultaneous growth of USDC is offering a bullish impulse for the crypto market. As we keep an eye on the macro landscape, the pivotal U.S. core PCE — the Fed’s go-to measure for inflation — is set to be released. Expectations are for a hot headline figure, with core reading, which excludes food and energy, showing positive improvements that might help BTC break out of its dull price action near $104,000. However, ING is cautioning that the dollar might stay strong into the weekend. “If we don't receive any news on Canada and Mexico by the end of today, there's a risk that the dollar could strengthen further as the market starts to price in a higher chance of tariffs being announced tomorrow,” it wrote. So, stay alert!

PumpFun developers have been making waves in the cryptocurrency market for a while now by selling revenues from their platform in the form of SOL. ZachXBT, on the other hand, said that what really needs to be paid attention to is the sales made by Ripple founders and the company, but no one is paying attention to this. According to the data, a total of $ 109 million worth of XRP was sent from founder Chris Larsen's wallet to cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp and Bybit in January alone and sold. Related News: Giant Memecoin Developers May Have Started Reselling Again, Onchain Data Shows However, Ripple and its executives have been regularly selling large amounts of coins for a long time. One user asked how the amount of XRP held by developers for many years has not been exhausted. In response, ZachXBT said that the coins in question were mined and transferred to developer wallets before XRP was released. He added that the founders and developers still have several billion dollars worth of XRP in their wallets. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) changed the game for early investors, delivering life-changing returns, and Solana (SOL) is recognized for its exceptional scalability. Now, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN , a new coin in the market, is grabbing headlines with predictions of 55,000% growth potential. Having raised $1 million during its presale in minutes, it’s being closely watched by experts who see it as the next breakout token alongside top contenders. Why THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Creating a Buzz 1. Fresh Entry, Massive Upside Being new to the market, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a rare opportunity to invest before its value skyrockets. Early investors stand to benefit from the kind of exponential returns only seen in the early days of tokens like SOL and XRP. 2. Exceptional Presale Success The presale success of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN , raising $1 million almost instantly, is a clear indicator of its high demand and market appeal. Its early momentum positions it as a leader among emerging cryptos. 3. Exclusivity Fuels Demand Unlike XRP, LINK, and DOT, which are widely available across exchanges, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively sold at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This controlled access ensures scarcity, increasing its value for early adopters. How It Stands Against Competitors XRP: Dominates payments but lacks the early-stage growth potential of this new coin. Solana (SOL): Scalable and fast, but its growth is already stabilizing compared to this fresh token. Chainlink (LINK): Strong in decentralized oracles but can’t match the excitement surrounding THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS): An emerging project, but its momentum falls short of this token’s presale success. Don’t Miss This Game-Changing Opportunity With experts predicting up to 55,000% gains, THE NEW OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most talked-about crypto of 2025. Its record-breaking presale, exclusivity, and high-growth potential make it a must-watch token alongside Solana. Secure your tokens now at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM and join the revolution!

Aave ( AAVE ) could be heading to Sonic, an EVM-compatible blockchain network from the creators of Fantom, if a fresh governance proposal gains support. Submitted by the Aave Chan Initiative on Jan. 31, the Aave Request for Comment #8d417 points to Sonic’s high transaction speed and fee-sharing model as key incentives for deployment. If approved by Feb. 4, the move would come with a $63 million liquidity commitment, including a $15 million funding pledge from the Sonic Foundation, $20 million in Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ), and up to 50 million $S tokens (around $27.15 million). Aave would also contribute $800,000 in stablecoins.

Seasonality data shows that Bitcoin and Ethereum often rise during the month. With many coins being down by double digits this year, there are chances that many will rebound. So, here are some of the best altcoins to buy in February to 10x your portfolio. Summary of the Best Altcoins to Buy in February for 10x Gains Historical data shows that Bitcoin and altcoin prices typically boom in February. CoinGlass data shows that Bitcoin price has only fallen two times since 2013. It jumped by 43% in the last February. Ethereum has only fallen in one February since 2017. Some key potential catalyst for altcoins in February will be: Strategic Bitcoin Reserve announcement by Donald Trump. Potential crypto ETF approvals, especially Litecoin. Federal Reserve clarity on rate cuts. Bitcoin Seasonality The best altcoins to buy for 10x gains in February will be Fartcoin, Grass, and Mantra. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Fartcoin, the fourth-biggest meme coin on the Solana ecosystem, is one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for 10x gains in February. The main bullish catalyst is that it has formed a rising broadening wedge pattern on the four-hour chart. This wedge pattern is usually a bearish sign, but there is a likelihood that the Fartcoin will rebound, retest the upper side of the wedge, and move above it. In the future, the Fartcoin price may surge to $2 and then resume the downward trend. This future crash will likely happen in the second quarter when most altcoins crash. Fartcoin Price Chart Mantra (OM) Mantra is another best altcoin to buy with the potential for big gains in February. It has already surged by almost 5,000% in the last 12 months, and charts point to further gains ahead. The daily chart shows that the coin formed a bullish flag pattern, with the flag pole happening in November and the rectangle between December and January. Mantra price has already soared above the upper side of the bullish flag pattern, meaning that more gains may accelerate in February. Potential catalysts will be: Fear of missing out (FOMO). Growth of its Real World Asset Tokenization ecosystem. Its high staking yield. Mantra Price Chart Grass (GRASS) Grass is one of the cheapest altcoins to buy in February. It has crashed by over 55% from its highest point after its airdrop in November last year. Fortunately, the coin has formed a falling wedge on the 4H chart, with the two lines nearing their confluence level. This could be a sign of a potential rebound in February, especially if Bitcoin and Ethereum bounces back. The initial target will be $3.8875, an all-time high, which is 125% above the current level. Grass Price Chart Summary of the Best Crypto to Buy in February Grass, Fartcoin, and Mantra offer sizable reward potential in February this year. The other notable tokens that may surge during the month are Hedera Hashgraph, Stellar Lumens, Monero, and Pepe.

Ripple (XRP) is in prime position to follow. Can they both break free? How high can they go? $ETH inverse head and shoulders playing out? Source: TradingView $ETH is breaking out right now. The price has broken through the descending trendline and it just remains to be seen whether it holds above, or whether this is a fake-out. Declining volume could point to a fake-out, but this can be remedied. It might be expected that the price returns to test the breakout area first, and it will be at this point where it will be seen if a bounce occurs, or if the price returns back under the descending trendline. A major factor in support of the breakout thesis is the inverse head and shoulders pattern, which can seen in the chart above. If the confirmation of the breakout is successful, this will potentially also confirm that the inverse head and shoulders pattern is playing out. If it does so, the measured move would be to exactly $4,000 - just short of the local high. $ETH $4,000 target Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $ETH gives more of a bird’s eye view. Here it can be seen that the price is indeed at a very crucial point. A successful breakthrough of the descending trendline will correspond with a breakthrough of the 0.618 Fibonacci. The 0.786 Fibonacci also coincides perfectly with the measured move for the inverse head and shoulders pattern, at $4,000. Given that the last rally did in fact make a slightly higher high, it might be expected that the price is able to push on from there, if of course it can get there. $XRP could follow $ETH price action Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $XRP shows that this cryptocurrency could follow the $ETH breakout. The price will either break above the descending trendline, or it will break below the strong support at $2.90. Just as is the case with $ETH, a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern is a possibility. That said, there has already been a rejection at the descending trendline for the right shoulder. Although if the breakthrough happens in the very near future, the pattern could still play out. $XRP incredible parabolic gains Source: TradingView When looking at $XRP on the weekly timeframe one can truly appreciate the incredible parabolic gain that this cryptocurrency has made just since the beginning of last November. 591% is quite some reward for those who clung on over the last six years or so. Will this incredible rise continue? With all the crypto hype induced by the new Trump administration, anything is possible. If the price is able to get above the previous high, the 1.618 Fibonacci level is an inspirational target - who knows … Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a recent interview, Abiodun revealed the world’s “largest consumer platform” is coming to crypto this year, talking about adoption. The interview was hosted by DBCrypto , aired on January 30 on YouTube, discussing how Sui blockchain is growing. On that note, Mysten Labs’s CPO explained that Sui is a “base layer that gives interoperability at the API levels.” To illustrate this vision, Abiodun explained that, with Sui, people can “atomically transact through APIs,” mentioning Airbnb and other known APIs that have some sort of transaction mechanisms. Crypto and Sui path to adoption this year: ‘Largest consumer platform is coming’ Then, DBCrypto asked the executive, “how do we get to the Aribnbs and other companies,” tracing crypto’s path for adoption. In which Adeniyi Abiodun revealed an upcoming milestone for the crypto industry and Sui, specifically. “This year Sui will experience the largest consumer platform coming to Sui, coming to crypto, in the world. That’s going to happen this year. I can’t say much about it, but this is the kind of thing we are talking about.” – Adeniyi Abiodun Exploring further, the executive believes gaming is the best way to showcase the amazing technology blockchain has. In his words, gaming people already “has notions” of digital ownership, trading, and other blockchain-powered operations, done more efficiently here. Additionally, Abiodun also revealed that Mysten Labs is working with game studios to build fun games based on the Sui Network – instead of building liquidity-extractive games, as happened in the previous cycle. “The way the games have been offered to the market so far (…) doesn’t add to the gaming experience. It’s just another way to charge rent. But we’re working with a number of top studios that are building fun games. Leveraging this as a base layer to enable interoperability of assets, marketplaces, offer products and services in new interesting ways, build new rewards and loyalty systems that are not encumbered, or you know closed loop systems to a large extent.” – Adeniyi Abiodun Notably, the Avalanche (AVAX)-based game “Off the Grid” recently got mainstream gaming recognition , as Finbold reported, validating this vision.

Jupiter (JUP) Jupiter (JUP) has seen significant price movement lately. In the past week, its price jumped 39%. Over the month, it rose 36%, and in six months, it’s up 21%. These gains suggest a strong short-term upward trend. Currently, Jupiter trades between $0.78 and $1.30. The nearest resistance is at $1.55, possibly challenging further price increases. The support level is at $0.51, providing a potential floor if prices drop. Simple moving averages over 10 and 100 days are $1.12 and $1.10, indicating a stable trend. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The RSI is at 48.21, neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold. The stochastic is 55.52, also neutral. The MACD is positive at 0.001207, suggesting bullish momentum. Jupiter might rise to test resistance at $1.55, a 19% increase from current prices. If it falls, it could reach support at $0.51, a 61% decrease. Polygon (ex-MATIC) (POL) POL (ex-MATIC) (POL) has experienced notable fluctuations recently. In the past week, its price dropped by 8%, and over the last month, it decreased by almost 12%. Despite these short-term declines, the coin has grown by 7.25% over the past six months, suggesting some resilience in its long-term performance. Currently, POL is trading between $0.41 and $0.47, sitting just above its 100-day simple moving average of $0.41. This position indicates a potential stabilization point. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 60.40, which is approaching overbought territory, while the Stochastic oscillator is high at 89.10. These indicators suggest that the coin might be gearing up for a reversal or a period of consolidation. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is at $0.51. If POL breaks through this barrier, it could aim for the next resistance at $0.57, which would be an increase of about 20% from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.39. Falling below this could see the price testing the second support at $0.33, a potential decrease of around 20%. The coin’s movements around these levels will be crucial in determining its short-term direction. Ondo (ONDO) Over the past six months, Ondo (ONDO) has nearly doubled in value, boasting a 99.02% price increase. In the last week alone, it surged by 23.28%, and over the past month, it climbed 16.29%. Currently, ONDO is trading between $1.23 and $1.52, reflecting strong momentum in the market. Technical indicators show that ONDO is nearing important price points. The nearest resistance level is at $1.67, and breaking past this could lead to further gains. The next resistance sits at $1.95, presenting another target for bullish traders. On the downside, support levels at $1.10 and $0.8109 may provide a safety net if the price dips. The coin’s Simple Moving Average over 10 days is $1.55, slightly above the current price, while the 100-day SMA is $1.39. The Relative Strength Index is at 69.33, indicating that ONDO is approaching overbought territory. A high Stochastic value of 84.42 supports this, suggesting the market may be due for a correction. However, a positive MACD level of 0.0495 points to continued bullish momentum. Traders are watching to see if ONDO will push past the $1.67 resistance, which would signal potential for further upward movement. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot (DOT) has experienced notable price changes. In the past week, the price fell by 7.60%, indicating short-term bearishness. Over the month, DOT dropped 11.04%. However, over six months, it gained 16.18%, suggesting a positive longer-term trend. Trading between $5.79 and $6.84, DOT is near key levels. Immediate resistance is at $7.49; support is at $5.39. A break above resistance could signal bullish reversal; falling below support may lead to further decline. Second resistance and support are at $8.54 and $4.34. Technical indicators are mixed.

FET Primed for Potential Rebound Amid Crypto Market Buzz Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, or FET, shows a mixed price movement. Recently, it has faced a decline, sitting between $1.08 and $1.31. Despite a dip of around 17% over the past week, there’s hope among traders. The RSI at 48.52 suggests it’s not overbought, hinting at room for growth. With a resistance level at $1.45, breaking through it could lead to further gains, possibly reaching the next level at $1.68. This would represent a potential rise of over 28% from its current low point. Positive market sentiments on altcoins could boost FET further if this momentum continues. XRP on the Rise: Could It Break Through Key Resistance Levels? XRP has shown impressive growth recently, surging over 47% in just one month and a massive 452% in the past six months. Currently, XRP is fluctuating between $2.83 and $3.29, with eyes on the $3.55 resistance level. If it breaks through, it might target the $4 mark. The 10-day moving average is slightly above $3, indicating short-term bullish momentum. The RSI suggests it’s not overbought, leaving room for upward movement. However, the stochastic level hints at potential consolidation. If support holds at $2.65, we could see another rally. The potential for further gains is there as the crypto market anticipates an altcoin season, boosting XRP’s prospects. RAY’s Potential Surge: Raydium Poised for a Breakout? Raydium (RAY) has recently shown strong growth, increasing over 50% in the past month and an impressive 332% over six months. Currently trading between $5.81 and $8.59, it’s nearing a crucial resistance level at $10. The RSI is just below 48, suggesting a balance between buyers and sellers. If bulls push through $10, the next target is $12.81, outpacing current prices by over 50%. The 10-day simple moving average is above the 100-day, indicating potential bullish momentum. However, pay attention to support levels, especially if the price approaches $4.46. A steady climb could set up RAY for a breakout, but keeping an eye on market conditions is critical. TRON (TRX) Ready for a Potential Breakout TRX is showing strength in its price movement, hovering between $0.23 and $0.26. The 10-day simple moving average is just ahead of its 100-day average, suggesting ongoing momentum. RSI near 66 shows some buying pressure. With price levels testing the $0.28 resistance, TRX could jump about 15% towards the next resistance at $0.32 if it breaks through. On the downside, there is solid support at $0.21, minimizing immediate risks. Stochastic levels imply moderate movement, hinting at further consolidation. Over the past 6 months, TRX has shown impressive gains, up over 100%, suggesting potential for another significant upward move aligned with market trends. Keep an eye on how it handles the resistance levels. Conclusion While coins like FET, XRP, RAY, and TRX may show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming for financial freedom for all. Offering a remarkable 700% ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, its triple utility and community-driven mission invite participation in the fight against crypto villains.

This week’s report highlights a significant risk-off event early in the week, as DeepSeek’s LLM announcement coincided with sharp declines across major indices and crypto markets. Despite this volatility, open interest in perpetual swaps remained stable, with funding rates momentarily turning negative before recovering. The options market also saw increased trading activity during the sell-off, even as forward-looking volatility expectations declined. Key Insights: BTC Open Interest Shows Minimal Movement – Despite the highest single-day trading volumes in BTC call options this month – reaching nearly $250 million during the spot price decline – volatility has continued to decline in both realized and implied terms. Short-tenor options are exhibiting lower volatility with a neutral skew, while longer-dated volatility smiles maintain a bullish bias towards out-of-the-money (OTM) calls, continuing a trend seen since the election. ETH Options Maintain Bullish Momentum – Trading volume for ETH options has surged to its highest levels in a month, with open interest remaining heavily weighted toward calls. While the global market sell-off briefly impacted short-tenor ETH volatility smiles, ETH options have continued to trade at higher volatility levels relative to BTC. Despite ETH’s spot recovery lagging behind BTC’s, its options market remains strong. Solana Options See Solid Open Interest – Following a price rally spurred by the launch of two presidential meme coins, Solana (SOL) has retraced alongside the broader crypto market. However, open interest in puts and calls remains elevated, with trading activity surpassing pre-rally levels. Stable levels of newly opened put options suggest strategic protective buying to hedge profitable long positions in other instruments.

39734323,https://nulltx.com/?p=142386,1738330648,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,TRON Primed to Hit $0.5 Soon as Binance Coin Nears Breakout – Can This New Coin Outperform Both This Year?,https://nulltx.com/tron-primed-to-hit-0-5-soon-as-binance-coin-nears-breakout-can-this-new-coin-outperform-both-this-year/,"Since reaching an ATH of $0.44 on December 4, 2024, Tron’s price has lost about 50% of its value, pushing the altcoin price below $0.25. Binance Coin’s price has also dipped below the $700 mark, which has now turned into a strong resistance zone. Although analysts are projecting a resurgence soon, the current market sentiment doesn’t look great. For traders looking to recover from losses, Cutoshi (CUTO) has proven to be a reliable project, giving early buyers over 100% in profits. The Ethereum-based meme coin sets itself apart from other meme coins by combining fun meme and DeFi utilities. Based on the success recorded in the presale so far, traders think CUTO might outshine top cryptocurrencies in 2025. Tron Price Prediction: Can TRX hit $0.5? Tron (TRX) has been declining for several weeks, and it will take some time and effort from the bulls to break its all-time high of $0.44. Looking at CoinMarketCap , the Tron price dipped 6% in the past month and 3% in the past 24 hours. The Tron trading volume has also plummeted by 30%, while the market cap has decreased by 2% in the past day. While these stats signal bearish market sentiment, Vishal Sahul , an analyst, preaches patience to holders and prospective Tron coin investors. Monitoring the Tron price chart, Vishal states that Tron is on a downtrend and will be unable to break key resistance levels. Vishal’s advice is for investors to wait for a clear upward breakout above the $0.25 and $0.258 zones. Tron market sentiment is neutral as key Oscillators are flashing mixed signals in Tradingview . While the Neutral VNMA (10) is green, the Hull Moving Average (9) and momentum (10) are flashing buy signals. In the past few days, Trump World Liberty Finance has accumulated Tron as Tron founder Justin Sun is now among the advisors of WLFI. This means TRX is one of the altcoins to watch in 2025. Binance Coin Could Pump Towards an Upside, Analyst Claims BNB, the crypto of the Binance exchange has faced massive bearish pressure in the past few days as French investigators launch a fraud probe against the top crypto exchange. While BNB price soared by 117% in the past year, it has declined by 4% in the past week as the altcoin price drops below the $670 support zone, as per CoinMarketCap . However, crypto Tutor , a crypto analyst, believes the BNB coin will rise in value soon. The analyst claims that the tightening of high-timeframe MAs on the BNB price chart shows an incoming move, which might be a bullish movement. The 14-day RSI of the BNB crypto coin is 39, which shows it is not yet in overbought territory. Also, while BNB is trading above the 200-day SMA, as per Tradingview , it is still below the 50-day SMA. For the top altcoin to reclaim the $700 mark, it needs to break through the $680 and $690 resistance zones, which are turning into strong resistance levels. Smart Investors Bullish on Cutoshi as Token Sets Sight on $2M in Presale While TRON and Binance Coin have gained popularity in the crypto space, a new player, Cutoshi (CUTO) , is set to rival them and become a top contender in the lucrative DeFi industry. Inspired by the traditional Chinese Lucky Cat, which is known to bring luck and prosperity to people, Cutoshi aims to bring wealth and prosperity to investors’ assets, which is Satoshi Nakamoto’s original teaching. As such, it is safe to say that Satoshi doesn’t want BlackRock to control crypto but to prompt a system that embodies the values of decentralisation, privacy, and monetary freedom. By infusing these teachings, Cutoshi is developing a platform where decision-making powers and control lie in the hands of the user. At the heart of the Cutoshi project is a multi-chain DEX. The Cutoshi DEX is designed to allow users to swap assets across many blockchain networks, ensuring security and privacy, unlike centralized exchanges. Outside that, Cutoshi is a tribute to decentralized finance, echoing the principles of freedom, privacy, and monetary empowerment to the masses. The overall aim of Cutoshi is to bring DeFi to the masses. With Cutoshi, everyone’s prosperity is important and not just for institutions. Through Cutoshi farming, users will be able to earn rewards for completing quests while the educational academy promotes DeFi literacy. While in presale, the CUTO token is sold for just $0.031. With the bullish momentum, analysts pick it as the best DeFi token to buy while projecting 100x gains in 2025. What are the Best Crypto Gems to Invest in Right Now? As the market continues to fluctuate, BNB coin and Tron are good cryptos to buy for long-term profits. However, for investors looking for short-term rewards, Cutoshi might be a better option given its launching date is drawing closer. Past precedents show that tokens witness massive rallies on launching. Adding to its utility like the DEX, Academy and farming mechanism, Cutoshi might enter the top 10 meme coins soon. Overall, it is one of the best altcoins to invest in 2025.

Due to the increasing excitement around the next crypto rally, traders acquire undervalued altcoins to capture tremendous returns. We have witnessed a considerable increase in the trading volume of SUI and PEPE and the emerging project in presale, Elluminex (ELX). Let’s analyze these altcoins and explore the growth potential of Elluminex, the early-stage project dubbed the next DeFi leader. Sui Breaks Support Trendline: Is The Uptrend Over? After an extended cup-and-handle pattern developed over seven months after March 2024, SUI broke out of the $2.16 resistance level on 6 November 2024. This sparked a massive rally, and SUI surged over 80% within ten days. After this, the price pulled back over 23% but reversed and continued to rise in an uptrend channel. SUI traded in this channel for over two months, but the price dropped below the lower trendline on Monday. The price has declined by over 0.45% in the last 24 hours, and SUI currently trades at $4.40. Despite the decline, its daily trading volume has increased by 54%. The price has dropped below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) but is above the 100-day SMA. SUI is just 17.86% below its ATH at $5.35, and since the price has corrected significantly and the volume is increasing, it may reverse to continue the uptrend. PEPE: Demand Increases Near Crucial Support Level During the recent rally, PEPE gained over 250% within a month but lost demand after reaching the $0.000028 price level, which caused it to drop to the $0.0000165 support level. As the PEPE price lost momentum, it consolidated between this support and the $0.000021840 resistance levels for over a month. PEPE plunged below this range a few days ago and is trading at $0.00001548 after a 3.4% intraday surge. The price has immediate support at $0.00001437, where the demand resists further decline. If PEPE drops further, the next significant support level is $0.00001316. However, the MACD oscillator is declining fast, indicating increasing bearish pressure. The RSI is 39 and is steadily dropping, suggesting PEPE is moving towards the underbought region. Elluminex (ELX): Next-Generation DeFi Hub On TON The DeFi sector is plagued by fragmented liquidity, high transaction costs, complex interfaces, and limited exposure to early-stage investment opportunities. These issues arise mainly from outdated methods and inefficient infrastructure. For the steady growth of DeFi, more innovative and advanced platforms are required. Thus, Elluminex aims to become the first comprehensive DeFi hub and revolutionize the industry by leveraging the remarkable capabilities of the TON blockchain. Elluminex will provide investors with an all-in-one DeFi platform where users can easily trade, stake, farm, bridge, and track their portfolios from a single point of contact. Thus, Elluminex users will have better security and efficiency as they will no longer need to navigate various platforms. The core component of this DeFi hub will be the Elluminex DEX, which will be integrated with a cross-chain bridge. This DEX will allow users to connect their TON wallets and make direct asset transfers across multiple blockchains. Moreover, TON’s 100,000 TPS, infinite sharding, and scalable architecture ensure lightning-fast transactions, low slippage, and consistent prices even during high network activity. Elluminex will also provide users access to an AI-powered portfolio tracker and advanced trading features such as limit orders and LP trading. The native token, ELX, will be essential for transaction fees and accessing advanced platform features. The token presale has started, and ELX is currently valued at $0.06, which will surge to $0.08 in the next stage. Early investors have an excellent opportunity to acquire this token while it is undervalued and capture enormous returns as the project grows to capture the DeFi market.

This development is significant as it forms part of the software company’s plans to acquire more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy To Raise $563 Million From STRK Offering MicroStrategy estimates it will raise $563 million from its STRK offering. This came following a press release in which the company announced the pricing of its offering of 7.3 million shares of its Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock (STRK) at a public offering price of $80 per share. The company also revealed that the issuance and sale of the STRK stocks will take place on February 5, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. Based on the STRK pricing, MicroStrategy estimates that the net proceeds from the offering will be approximately $563.4 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the company’s offering expenses. The company also mentioned that it intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to acquire more Bitcoin and for other general corporate purposes. Saylor’s company has been on a hot streak since the start of last year, acquiring BTC for twelve consecutive weeks and counting. The company announced this week that it had purchased 10,107 BTC for $1.1 billion.

Though it might be a fun thought, many doubt whether Dogecoin (or DOGE) can pull off such an epic rally especially now that the meme-coin market feels oversaturated with players like PEPE. Meanwhile, a new PayFi altcoin named Remittix (RTX) has arrived, raising over $10,065,398.81 so far and selling 420,759,183.33 tokens at $0.0498. Observers say its real-world application might stand out amid a sea of comedic tokens. Below is a closer look at how each coin stacks up. Why the DOGE $42 Prediction Seems Unlikely For a while, Dogecoin soared on social media hype and celebrity endorsements, but the idea of hitting $42 from $0.3333 suggests an astronomical leap. Even fans of DOGE call it a huge stretch, given the coin’s heavy reliance on meme trends. Sure, a sudden wave of hype could spike the price short term, but sustaining it to that level sounds less realistic in a crowded market. On top of that, coins like PEPE now compete for the meme spotlight, dividing community focus. Against this backdrop, the stable approach of Remittix (RTX) might be more appealing to those preferring practicality over viral mania. PEPE Feeling the Heat in Saturated Markets With PEPE once hailed as a new comedic contender, the coin has found it tough to hold momentum as meme coins pile up. Some blame oversaturation, as every week brings another frog- or dog-themed token. PEPE still commands a loyal following, but overshadowing established coins like Dogecoin or fresh, functional altcoins like Remittix (RTX) gets trickier by the day. While PEPE could surge again if social media stirs up interest, watchers say the window for exponential growth might be narrowing. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is going a different route entirely catering to real-world needs rather than jokey hype. Remittix (RTX) Emerges as a Practical Option Enter Remittix (RTX), the PayFi solution that raised over $10,065,398.81 and sold 420,759,183.33 tokens so far and are being sold for $0.0498. Designed for cross-border payments, RTX offers a refreshing angle in a market saturated by memes like Dogecoin and PEPE. Where these comedic coins bank on viral buzz, Remittix (RTX) seeks mainstream adoption through cheaper remittances, bridging fiat and crypto seamlessly. Fans argue this everyday practicality sets RTX apart, possibly driving more stable long-term gains. As memes scramble for attention, some experts say the functional approach behind Remittix (RTX) might captivate both new and experienced investors who are tired of short-lived meme rallies. Saturated Meme Coins vs. Functional Tokens Given the meme-coin clutter, the question is whether comedic tokens can retain enough attention to satisfy bold goals like the DOGE $42 prediction. Dogecoin still claims a massive fan base, but the current wave of PEPE clones could dilute the hype. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) aims for a different crowd: those who favour tangible services over viral jokes. With more than $10 million raised, RTX shows that plenty of traders are looking for stablecoin growth tied to a real use case. Memes provide short bursts of excitement, but eventually, many users gravitate toward altcoins that address real financial problems. Conclusion In this busy market, an ambitious DOGE $42 prediction might grab headlines, but saturating the meme space with coins like PEPE suggests that purely comedic tokens face new hurdles. By contrast, Remittix (RTX) offers a PayFi angle that appeals to people who want more than a meme. With $10,065,398.81 raised and the price is $0.0498 currently, Remittix (RTX) presents a practical alternative one built around cheaper remittances. While Dogecoin and PEPE can still stir up quick gains if viral mania hits, the rise of Remittix (RTX) shows the market’s hunger for functional solutions. The months ahead will reveal if memes can keep pace with real-world utility. Don’t miss out on the next big crypto opportunity. Discover Remittix now.

Since the Trump election victory, several asset managers have filed applications for memecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including DOGE, an unthinkable move just months ago under the previous administration and its SEC head Gary Gensler. With a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion, DOGE is the world’s largest memecoin. Wrapping the token in an ETF or in Grayscale's case, a trust, could attract capital from institutional investors.

However, a new rival is making things complicated. This new competitor is gaining attention, and some believe it could slow XRP’s growth. Will XRP still rise, or will this new challenger change everything? Let’s see what’s happening and what it means for XRP’s future. XRP’s Big Move, What’s Next for the Popular Crypto? A fresh collaboration with Ondo Finance is the reason XRP is in the headlines. This alliance will bring OUSG, a new digital asset, to the XRP Ledger, therefore enhancing XRP value. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, has also voiced his thoughts on American handling of digital currencies in the meanwhile. Instead of focusing only on Bitcoin, he believes the United States needs to have a range of cryptocurrencies including XRP. Several Bitcoin aficionados who were furious claim Garlinghouse is trying to stop a Bitcoin-only strategy. Conversely, he said that rather than having one coin control the market, cryptocurrencies should be based on fairness and variety. He called the concept of relying only on Bitcoin “outdated.” Recently XRP has been showing a positive trend, which implies that its price might rise not too far off. Right now, it is testing a noteworthy $2.90 pricing level. Should it exceed this level, it may reach $4.23, a notable increase for investors. Conversely, should XRP fail to keep above $2.90, it may drop below $2.62. Technical indicators at this time show that buyers are still robust even if momentum is starting to slow down. Investors are closely considering the next events! Why Remittix Could Be the Best Coin to Invest in Today In the fast-moving world of crypto, finding the best coins to buy now is a challenge. Many investors are looking for the best coin to invest today, and one name stands out— Remittix (RTX) . This project aims to transform global payments, not just another cryptocurrency. It is not just any coin. Currently in its presale stage, remittix (RTX) may be bought by early investors at a reduced price before it becomes public for general use. Though demand is fast rising, the presale token starts at just $0.0498 per RTX. More than $10 million have been received for the project, suggesting investor interest in it and belief in its potential. Remittix is a full platform meant to improve payments all around, not just a bitcoin token. Remittix helps solve the problem of many people all over without having access to traditional banking. The platform is open around-the-clock so clients may transfer and get money right away without paying outrageous fees or running across delays. The RTX coin finds many significant uses within the Remittix ecosystem. Staking their RTX tokens will let investors get rewards over time, thereby enabling them to increase their holdings. Furthermore serving a governance function, the token allows holders to vote on significant decisions about the expansion of the platform. RTX is also used for network-based transactions, hence it is a vital part of the Remittix system. With a limited supply of only 1.5 billion tokens, RTX has strong potential for price growth. Many experts believe it is one of the best coins to buy now and the best coin to invest today. If the project continues to grow, RTX could be a game-changer in 2025 and beyond.

Often, when I speak with everyday Bitcoiners — plebs, if you will — they share with me that they’re torn between carrying on with their “fiat job” and getting more involved in the Bitcoin space on a professional level. I usually tell them that they can start by incorporating Bitcoin into what they currently do for a living, though, I haven’t had a great example of someone doing this that I can point them to — until this morning. When it’s time for the clients of osteopath Rob Shaw, based in Essex, UK (just outside of London), to pay him for his services, he presents them with the option to pay with British pounds or bitcoin via a Musqet PoS device . First Bitcoin payment accepted with @Musqet_Bitcoin POS terminal. This device reduces traditional payment fees and also enables Bitcoin transactions. Learn more by listening to this @Princey21M podcast. #Bitcoin 👇🏻 https://t.co/8Ac9VgOopL pic.twitter.com/VHBa4mmERM — Chelmsford Osteopathic Practice (@essexosteopath) May 29, 2024 (Please note he doesn’t go into a lesson on Bitcoin’s underlying technology or the principles of Austrian economics as he does this.) Rob shared that here and there a client will act surprised when presented with the option to pay with bitcoin but that most simply make their choice between the two and proceed with making their payment. Rob’s efforts have led to two of his clients now regularly paying in bitcoin, and he also provides a touchpoint for those who have yet to begin paying with it. In this way, Rob is a Bitcoin bridge. (And, ironically enough, it was an organization called Bridge 2 Bitcoin that introduced Rob to Bitcoin as a payment technology for his business.) He’s subtly introducing people to Bitcoin, giving them the option to cross over into Bitcoin land in the process. On Tower Bridge in London with Rob. Some might call this “ orange-pilling ” (a term I don’t like much because it feels too coercive), but I’d argue that this is a more refined way to present bitcoin to people. In offering it as an official payment method for professional services, it legitimizes Bitcoin and prompts those unfamiliar with it to begin viewing it in a new light. If professionals around the world employed such an approach, Bitcoin adoption would accelerate notably. So, instead of feeling that you have to drop whatever you’re doing for work to join the Bitcoin industry full-time, consider being a bridge to Bitcoin and bringing the Bitcoin industry to what you’re already doing.

Interestingly, thirteen new mega whales with over 10,000 ETH joined the network within twenty-four hours. This move shows that whales see potential in Ethereum despite its recent turbulent price moves. As Ethereum navigates this volatility, new players like Remittix (RTX) are taking over the crypto space. Remittix aims to revolutionize cross-border payments by integrating cryptocurrencies with traditional banking systems, offering a streamlined and transparent process. Its presale token, RTX, is currently available at $0.0498, with over $10 million already raised. While Ethereum remains a significant player in the crypto market, the emergence of innovative projects like Remittix offers investors new opportunities to consider. Trump’s Ethereum Holdings Spark Market Interest Recent reports reveal that Donald Trump holds nearly $200 million worth of Ethereum (ETH), making him one of the most prominent political figures with significant crypto exposure. This news has caught the attention of investors significantly as Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) expands into digital assets. TMTG recently launched Truth.Fi, a division focused on crypto and investment strategies. Even though the attention is on Bitcoin and ETFs, Trump’s individual Ethereum holdings signal his interest in blockchain. Ethereum remains a good player, but investors are now wondering if it is the best crypto to invest in or whether newer projects like Remittix present better opportunities. Remittix (RTX): A Game-Changer for Global Payments Sending money across borders has always been a hassle due to the slow transaction and hidden fees. But all these have ended with Remittix (RTX) bridging the digital asset and conventional banking gap. With Remittix, users can convert over forty cryptocurrencies into FIAT and send cash to bank accounts globally. Unlike traditional services that charge delays and unclear costs, Remittix applies a flat-rate pricing model. Businesses also benefit from the Remittix Pay API, which allows them to accept crypto payments while settling in FIAT. This simplifies transactions for e-commerce platforms, freelancers, and global service providers, helping them access funds faster without dealing with multiple currencies. For investors looking at the best crypto to invest in, Remittix stands out as a presale token with real-world utility. With Ethereum price prediction trends showing strong interest in blockchain-based financial solutions, this could be a prime opportunity to get in early. $RTX Token Presale is A Huge Opportunity in Global Finance Remittix is making waves in the $190 trillion global finance industry by fixing the flaws in cross-border payments. Its fresh approach and real-world use case make it a project worth watching. Many investors are monitoring the latest Ethereum price prediction trends, and Remittix stands out as a strong alternative. It combines the benefits of crypto and traditional finance, offering a real solution for fast and low-cost global transactions. This presale token could be a significant opportunity for those searching for the best crypto to invest in before its price takes off. If you’re looking for a promising presale token with high growth potential, Remittix might be worth considering. With its strong fundamentals and growing demand, it’s gaining attention alongside discussions about the Ethereum price prediction and other significant crypto investments.

However, SHIB’s price remains in red territory on a weekly scale. The Burning Goes Through the Roof The second-largest meme coin, Shiba Inu, saw its burn rate skyrocket by approximately 7,200% in the past 24 hours. This resulted in over 1.1 billion tokens being sent to a null address. While the USD equivalent of the destroyed stash is insignificant, continuous efforts in the field will reduce the circulating supply of SHIB, making it more scarce and possibly more valuable in the future (should demand increase or remain constant). Another bullish factor worth mentioning is Shiba Inu’s exchange netflow . According to CryptoQuant’s data, outflows have exceeded inflows in the last week, suggesting a potential shift from centralized exchanges toward private wallets. This , in turn, reduces the immediate selling pressure. Despite the positive developments, the price of the meme coin has underperformed on a weekly scale . It currently trades at around $0.00001876 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing an 8% decline for that timeframe. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko How’s the Big Rival Doing? The undisputed leader in the meme coin sector – Dogecoin (DOGE) – has performed quite similarly to SHIB in the past seven days. Its price has tumbled by approximately 9% to the current $0.33. DOGE Price, Source: CoinGecko Nonetheless, crypto X is rammed with analysts who believe that a massive DOGE rally is incoming. The X user Lucky recently told his over two million followers that the meme coin “is gaining serious momentum.” They suggested that Dogecoin’s next potential rally would be “epic,” claiming that the $1 milestone “is just a matter of time.” Earlier this week, Ali Martinez wondered how some could bet against DOGE since “at any moment” it could explode by a staggering 900% in just 48 hours. Such a rally would mirror the asset’s performance at the end of January 2021, when the valuation exploded by triple digits in a few days. Meanwhile, the meme coin might receive a serious price boost should the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approve Bitwise’s intention to launch a spot DOGE ETF in America. The investment vehicle will give people more options to gain exposure to the meme coin, which could positively reflect its performance.

PEPE price has fallen nearly $0.000012 after a 20% drop last week. This downturn is attributed mainly to major holders selling off massive amounts, flooding the market, and driving prices down. By contrast, projects with real-world applications are gaining ground. One example is Remittix , which is making waves with its ongoing ICO. As the market evolves, many are shifting their focus from speculative meme coins to projects like Remittix that provide tangible solutions and real-world value. PEPE Experiences a Dip Amid Broader Market Declines PEPE was up 12.92% as of this writing at $0.00001292. This inconsistency mirrors the broader correction of crypto markets as investors await the Fed’s first interest rate decision of 2025. As for PEPE’s performance, the meme coin has endured a tough week. The coin experienced some days of falls before hitting $0.00001292. PEPE has had ups and downs since touching an all-time high on December 9. However, a move above the 200-day and 50-day moving averages might herald a recovery for PEPE bulls. Meme coins like PEPE remain speculative, but Remittix can be the next crypto to 100x . Despite recent price variations, some experts consider meme coins a high-risk, high-reward investment. Watch the PEPE price action—its next big move could still be ahead. Remittix (RTX): A Game-Changer in Global Payments and a Top Crypto to Watch Remittix is catching the eye of investors as one of the most promising new crypto projects. This could be it if you’re looking for the next crypto to 100x . Unlike many other digital currencies focusing on hype, Remittix addresses real issues, particularly international payments. Its goal is to make sending money across borders cheaper, faster, and easier than the usual payment methods. Already making a splash, Remittix has raised over $9.8 million in its presale, with its current token price at $0.0479. Before the presale ends, experts estimate that the value could rise by 800% . Remittix is definitely one to watch in 2025 if you’re considering investing in the future of digital payments. Remittix is not just another crypto coin riding the waves of trends. Instead, it’s focused on creating tangible user benefits—especially by cutting down the high fees traditionally associated with money transfers. This makes it an attractive option for everyday users who want a reliable solution rather than just speculative hype. Its RTX token has a limited supply of only 1.5 billion, which adds to its appeal. As a result, demand is rising fast, with investors eager to secure their stake early. The Remittix platform also allows users to stake, vote, and earn rewards with their tokens, increasing their value. Remittix could surpass meme coins like Pepe in both price and adoption if the presale momentum continues. Many see this as just the beginning of what could be a rapid rise in the world of crypto. If you’re looking for a new crypto with strong potential, Remittix might be your next big opportunity.

Meanwhile, it is speculated that it would take Elon Musk’s endorsement to truly cause a spike in the the meme coin’s value and market cap. It remains to be seen what happens to the meme coin segment with the recent development in MUSKIT’s token value. MuskIt Coin Skyrockets The value of MuskIt coin has skyrocketed by 262.73% in the last 24 hours, and the meme coin is exchanging hands at $0.03916. Recent data further shows that there is a spike of 7723.53% in 24-hour trading volume. However, the token is still down from a high value of 0.2241 which it achieved earlier today. Muskit Coin price The surge in the value of MuskIt is briefly credited to Errol Musk, Elon Musk’s father. According to a Fortune report , Errol is hoping to raise around $200 million by capitalizing on the meme coin which shares his family name. It has been reported that the funds will be utilized to support the Musk Institute which is a for-profit think tank. Interestingly, the MuskIt coin was originally launched on December 12, 2024, but the meme coin failed to gain sufficient momentum. It has now made a comeback and is seeking a potential endorsement from Elon Musk to mark higher upticks. Will Elon Musk Endorse MuskIt Coin? MuskIt coin shares its name with the Musk family and Errol Musk is looking to capitalize on it. What is missing from the list is an endorsement from Tesla CEO Elon Musk who is often seen supporting Dogecoin. Elon Musk has not come out in support of MuskIt but the community is speculating that he would soon join the meme coin’s hype. It was earlier speculated that a Dogecoin price rise would take the value to around $0.6 after Elon revealed DOGE target. This essentially refers to the cuts that the DOGE department would undertake on the US Federal spending. Elon Musk does hold a significant influence but there is little to confirm his potential association with MuskIt coin in the future. Meme Coins Sector In Focus Meme coins have been gaining traction since the launch of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins on Solana. MuskIt had added more interest around the meme coin segment. TRUMP meme coin is one of the three meme coins with over 300% gain in January. It is being traded at $26.42. Other meme coins on the list are MTAUR and XCN. MELANIA meme coin is down but has been able to leave a significant impact on meme coin enthusiasts. MuskIt is speculated to follow the same path if Errol Musk continues to pursue his interest in backing it. For now, Errol Musk has said that he hoping this does not turn out to be a pump-and-dump scheme.

However, the last few days have been difficult for Shiba Inu and its investors are now worried about a further decline in the coming weeks. On the other hand, Remittix (RTX) is gaining a lot of attention. Its ongoing ICO has already raised over $10 million, and experts believe it could hit $1 this year. At its current presale price, that would mean massive returns for early buyers. With Shiba Inu price facing uncertainty and RTX showing strong growth, many traders are shifting their focus to this new opportunity. Remittix: A Game-Changer in Global Payments Remittix (RTX) is revolutionizing the banking sector by lowering the cost and speed of cross-border payments. Remittix enables customers to send money globally by translating more than 40 cryptocurrencies into local currencies, as opposed to services like Stripe and Wise which solely manage FIAT transfers. It’s quickly rising to the top of the list for people searching for dependable and reasonably priced payment options because it has flat prices and no hidden charges. Remittix has made transactions easy without making the location a barrier. The platform also supports more than 30 FIAT currencies and 50 crypto pairs. The Remittix API helps freelancers and businesses by enabling them to accept payments in many currencies without incurring additional costs or delays. Security is a major focus. The platform’s smart contract passed a BlockSAFU audit, ensuring safe and transparent transactions. At the core of the system is the $RTX token, giving holders voting rights and staking rewards of up to 18% APY. Remittix is also planning to launch a platinum debit card in 2025, allowing VIP investors to spend their crypto like cash. Currently, in its presale at $0.0498, it’s one of the best crypto ICO opportunities for early investors. With its potential to dominate the payments market, some believe it could see massive growth. If you’re looking for the best crypto ICO to invest in, Remittix is worth considering. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Jumps, But Price Takes a Hit Shiba Inu is having a hard time bouncing back after it experienced a decline in supply. This Shiba Inu price, $0.00001839 is the lowest the token has seen in a while. Although SHIB is currently under pressure, investors are hoping for a price spike. Over 6.2 million SHIB tokens were burned in the last day, as reported by Shibburn, increasing the weekly total to almost 28.4 million. Over 410.7 trillion SHIB have been burned so far. The intention is to increase SHIB’s scarcity, which may eventually contribute to its rising value. Despite these challenges, some analysts predict that if the market recovers or meme coins get more hype and attention from celebrities, the price of Shiba Inu might reach $0.0005 by Q3 2025. SHIB remains one of the most popular meme coins to keep an eye on because of its burn strategy and promos. Don’t Miss Out on Remittix’s Explosive Growth While Shiba Inu remains a popular meme coin, its price struggles despite massive token burns. In contrast, Remittix (RTX) is built for real-world use, offering a game-changing crypto payments solution that banks and businesses can adopt. Remittix is currently in presale at a modest entry price, and analysts anticipate a 5,000% increase upon debut. One of the most potential investments for 2024 is RTX because of its tremendous utility, in contrast to SHIB, which depends on hype.

Here’s What Peter Brandt Thinks,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-ready-for-a-major-price-surge-heres-what-peter-brandt-thinks/,"The post XRP Ready for a Major Price Surge? Here’s What Peter Brandt Thinks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Veteran trader Peter Brandt has spotted a bullish pattern in XRP’s price chart, and it could mean big gains ahead. With recent gains in the XRP price, the XRP community has been fueled with excitement. If the pattern plays out as predicted, XRP could skyrocket to as high as $4.8. Analyst Bullish Outlook on XRP Peter Brandt is no stranger to making accurate market predictions, and his latest analysis of XRP suggests that the cryptocurrency could be set for a breakout. As XRP has been gaining attention due to its strong performance in the past few with an average gain of almost 500%. Perhaps the recent XRP moves have shown signs of a significant upward move. Hey $XRP _pill_poppers To be clear: I could care less what XRP is going to do. If it goes up I want to be long. If it goes down I've never shorted it, but prefer to troll the poppers. No other way right now to define the chart other than a bull flag. Of course this could change pic.twitter.com/riMwNI7DMW — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) January 30, 2025 Brandt pointed out a “bull flag” pattern on XRP’s daily chart, indicating that the coin might soon push higher in price. He believes that if the pattern plays out as expected, XRP could rise by as much as 15%, reaching $3.5487, or even soar by 43%, potentially hitting $4.39. In fact, Brandt’s analysis is in line with previous predictions. Earlier, he suggested that XRP could reach as high as $4.6, based on another flag pattern he observed on its chart. XRP Set to Breakout Aligning with the analysis of Peter Brandt, market expert “Disrupt Yourself” confirms the formation of a bull flag on the XRP price chart. The structure is visible on the asset’s 3-hour timeframe, with the analyst speculating that a breakout could push XRP to $3.9. Adding to the bullish sentiment, Cryptodanovic also supports this pattern. In a recent X post, he pointed out that XRP is currently trading within the bull flag structure. He believes that once the asset breaks out of this pattern, it could soar to an impressive $4.8. XRP Price Analysis As of now, XRP is trading at $3.10 , reflecting a slight rise in the last 24 hours. However, for a strong confirmation of an upward trend, XRP needs to break past key resistance levels. The first challenge is moving above $3.21, followed by a push over $3.40. Until then, the market remains in a range, and a retest of support between $2.76 and $2.97 is still possible. If XRP drops below $2.76, we might see a larger correction, with the price potentially heading back to $2.52.",News,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 13:51:36

In a lengthy X article posted on January 30, 2025, Smith claimed, among other things, that Mumtaz stole intellectual property from the winning team at a Solana ( SOL ) hackathon in 2023, screamed verbal abuse at a corporate vendor, and used deceptive tactics to misrepresent the technical capacity of Helius in a way that inflated its appearance. Eventually, Smith said, Mumtaz constructively dismissed him and began actively obstructing subsequent fundraising efforts for his new startup. https://t.co/Ag4Jiaj5cP — miles̴ (@wedtm) January 30, 2025 According to Smith, the genesis of his dispute with Mumtaz stemmed from what he described as an “unconventional” corporate structure at Helius, where Mumtaz hired a C-team made up of only former Coinbase and AWS engineers without any prior C-level experience. He claims that when he suggested that more experience was needed, Mumtaz took it as a threat, and began laying the groundwork for his constructive dismissal. You might also like: Helius shows off Solana’s upgrades and improvements Intellectual property theft and workplace toxicity In the article, Smith referenced the Infrastructure and Tools track at Grizzlython , the 2023 Solana hackathon, where Xray came second with its human-readable Solana block explorer. According to him, despite Mumtaz having already hosted and funded the Xray team earlier which should have counted as a conflict of interest, Mumtaz was allowed to vote, which helped at least partially in helping the team finish second. Subsequently he said, Mumtaz claimed Xray as a Helius product and informed the team that they had received payment for it by being among the Hackathon winners. Smith also claimed that he subsequently witnessed Mumtaz scream abuse at a female Cloudflare sales rep because he was unhappy with the price of an Enterprise package. Corporate misrepresentation and post-Helius career sabotage Due to what he implied was a subpar recruitment policy of hiring incompetent AWS engineers, Smith claimed that Helius was falling short on multiple technical performance areas, and was masking the mediocre performance by using paid services like QuickNode to do the actual work it was pretending to do. This matters because this is how Helius pretends to have the best uptime, when really they have shitty internal uptime and mask it by paying QuickNode to pick up the slack. Eventually, Smith said, his relationship with Mumtaz deteriorated to the point where he got fired by text while attending his son’s baseball game. Smith claimed that it took a further 6 weeks to get Helius to honor his final paycheck. Subsequently, Smith revealed, many of his fundraising attempts for his startup have hit a brick wall once investors who have expressed keen interest reach out to Mumtaz for a reference. In 2024, Helius raised a $9.5 million Series A funding round to help grow its head count from 14 full time staff to at least 18, including 4 new engineers.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While the true identity of Bitcoin’s creator remains a mystery, new projects like Cutoshi are blending decentralized finance with fun, community-driven solutions. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s mysterious origins and the cypherpunk movement The future of crypto: Bitcoin, Cutoshi, and DeFi adoption Many people have asked who is the legendary creator behind Bitcoin? At first glance, it’s Satoshi Nakamoto, but this is just a pseudonym for the anonymous creator. Although no one knows the identity for sure, there are a handful of suspects. Bitcoin’s mysterious origins and the cypherpunk movement Those who watched the recent HBO Documentary Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery might think that the nom de plume ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ refers to Peter Todd. The documentary captures Todd saying (with a glint in his eye) that if he were Satoshi, he would have destroyed the way for Satoshi’s Bitcoin holdings to be accessed. This is important because if the Satoshi era coins were sold, the price could crash drastically. According to CryptoSlate, Satoshi has over 1.12 million BTC in wallets associated with the creator/s. Although director Cullen Hoback made a compelling case for Peter Todd as the inventor of Bitcoin, the crypto community isn’t so sure. The most likely list of suspects includes Len Sassaman, Nick Szabo, Adam Back (also featured in the documentary), Hal Finney, and Peter Todd. But perhaps more important than the identity of the creator is Satoshi Nakaomoto’s vision and what Bitcoin stands for ideologically and practically. Bitcoin wasn’t created in a vacuum. For years, cypherpunks worked on digital cash systems that could exist outside government control. E-gold, B-money, and Bit Gold all took steps toward a decentralized financial system, but each had weaknesses like centralized servers, legal vulnerabilities, or reliance on intermediaries. Satoshi Nakamoto solved these issues by combining cryptographic breakthroughs with proof-of-work, creating a peer-to-peer system that couldn’t be shut down. Bitcoin exists because centralized money can be frozen, censored, or inflated at will. Cypherpunks saw the risks and wrote code instead of asking for permission. Bitcoin’s whitepaper laid out a system where transactions are verified by miners, not banks, and ownership is secured by private keys, not third parties. There’s no CEO, no company, and no government that can change the rules. That’s why Bitcoin survived while previous attempts at digital money failed. This principle of self-sovereignty doesn’t stop with Bitcoin. It has shaped everything that came after, including new projects that blend meme culture with financial autonomy. A new coin called Cutoshi is building on this, merging Nakamoto’s ideals with a fun, community-driven approach to DeFi. You might also like: Trending DeFi meme coin Cutoshi hits $1.45m raised in record time The future of crypto: Bitcoin, Cutoshi, and DeFi adoption Cutoshi is not the same as Bitcoin. It’s a meme coin based on the Chinese Lucky Cat. But it’s also a coin that wants to bring new people into the world of crypto and decentralized finance. In fact, their concept draws from some of the principles of Satoshi, including financial autonomy, decentralization, and permissionless access to money. The Lucky Cat might be the face of Cutoshi, but behind the memes is a push to make DeFi simple and actually usable for the everyday working man. Most meme coins rely on hype alone. Cutoshi is taking a different route by building an appealing interface and meme with DeFi tools and rewards that give people a reason to stay, including: A peer-to-peer DEX designed for easy, low-cost trading. A learning academy that helps people to understand DeFi without getting lost in the weeds. A system that rewards early adopters while keeping transaction fees low. CUTO is still in presale, sitting at a market cap of around $13.6m and on sale for $0.031. It’s early, just like Bitcoin, when Satoshi’s first supporters started mining. The difference is that now, crypto is mainstream, and the demand for decentralized alternatives is bigger than ever. Although Bitcoin will probably always be the king of crypto, it’s up to early-stage projects with a big community like Cutoshi, to make DeFi fun and accessible to ordinary people.

Over the past week, the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum have been bouncing in ranges. But while the market leaders wobble between ups and downs, there’s another exciting coin to watch—Rollblock. This new iGaming underdog is outdoing industry stalwarts with its impressive presale performance. Rollblock is gearing up for its ATH, and investors are paying close attention to its next stage! Rollblock: The fast-growing GambleFi platform with big potential Industry stalwarts are taking hits from the crypto market fluctuations. However, the iGaming revolution, Rollblock, isn’t slowing down at all. This exciting gaming platform is gaining all the attention in its ongoing presale, which is leaping closer to a new ATH as the hottest presale right now. The platform is live and already offers more than 7,000 casino games, along with a brand-new sports betting league that’s attracting a slew of users. In December alone, $1.75 million was bet on the platform, and sign-ups shot up by an amazing 600%. This is just the beginning for Rollblock, and many people think it could offer incredible ROI this year. One of the most exciting parts of Rollblock is its special staking rewards. Staking gives sweet APY returns, a revenue-sharing program rewards token investment, and rebates reward active participation. The growth has been astounding and outstanding! Over 420% price growth to $0.052, and presale raise has reached $9.8 million. Bitcoin wobble below ATH: $120k in sight? Recently, BTC has attracted much interest in crypto news after hitting a new ATH at $109,000. However, it has fallen in a tightly bound range after falling sharply below $98,000. Whale investors’ accumulation in institutional interest is looking like Bitcoin’s only way out. Whale investors are accumulating Bitcoin on the retail and institutional levels. These investors are driving up the demand for BTC, which may drive the price higher. On the technical front, BTC is at the higher low of its bullish trend, which may indicate another leg up in the short term. Analysts are looking at $120k as the next stop in the short term. Ethereum price falls 5% MoM. Whale investors to the rescue After dropping below $3,000, ETH is making a return. The price appears to have recovered over $3,200 and seems to be on an upward trend. This is mostly due to huge investors purchasing much of ETH by leveraging the reduced pricing, but can it reach a new ATH? 13 large investors that acquired more than 10,000 ETH each within 24 hours. One of these large investors is World Liberty Financial, Donald Trump’s DeFi initiative, which purchased 3,247 ETH valued at $10 million. Experts are observing ETH’s price as it seems to be about to break out. Conclusion Market stalwarts are reeling. Bitcoin’s consolidation has cut gains from many alts, including Ethereum. However, the crypto news has nothing on the new iGaming revolution surging astronomically in presale. With an enticingly low presale price at just $0.052, experts think Rollblock could come to dominate a sizable part of the $540 billion online gambling market. This is undoubtedly a great opportunity for early investors to make big profits, especially as Rollblock thrives in the GambleFi space.

Stellar ( XLM ) traded at $0.4240 on Friday, down 33% from its peak in November last year when it experienced a strong rally. Technicals suggests that XLM price may soar in February Stellar has formed several bullish patterns, signaling the potential for further gains in February. First, the consolidation phase in December and January formed part of a bullish pennant pattern, a widely recognized continuation signal. This pattern consists of a long vertical rally followed by a symmetrical triangle. A bullish breakout typically occurs when the two lines of the triangle approach convergence. Second, the Elliott Wave formation suggests additional upside potential. This pattern consists of five key phases, beginning with a bullish wave, followed by a corrective pullback. The third wave, which took place in November, is usually the longest, and it was followed by the fourth corrective wave. Based on this structure, Stellar may enter its fifth bullish wave in February. Third, Stellar has formed a golden cross pattern on the chart, where the 50-week and 200-week moving averages have crossed. The price has remained above these two averages, indicating that bullish momentum remains intact. Therefore, Stellar may rebound and retest its all-time high of $0.7960 in February, representing a potential 90% increase from its current level. You might also like: How high can the Ripple XRP price get in February? XLM price chart | Source: crypto.news Potential catalysts for Stellar price Stellar will likely jump for several reasons. First, historical data shows that February is often a strong month for cryptocurrencies. Seasonal trends indicate that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) tend to perform well in February and March. If this pattern holds, other widely followed cryptocurrencies, including Stellar and XRP, could benefit. Second, Donald Trump is considering focusing on Made in USA coins to appeal to the crypto industry. This move would benefit a coin like Stellar, which was created in the US in 2014. Further, an XRP ETF approval would be beneficial to Stellar because the two coins are often seen as cousins since they are in the payment industry. Jed McCaleb, its founder, was also part of the Ripple ( XRP ) team. Therefore, the odds of a Stellar Lumens ETF approval would also rise when that happens.

The network’s DeFi sector also saw a boost, with Etherlink’s total value locked (TVL) growing significantly, driven by both the increase in Tezos ( XTZ ) price and the platform’s appeal for lower fees and faster transaction speeds. However, this growth in Etherlink’s TVL came at the expense of Tezos L1, which saw a decline in its TVL.

Finally, the Quebec upgrade introduced several improvements aimed at supporting the seamless integration of Ethereum-based assets and dApps, boosting the network’s appeal for DeFi applications.

If BTC reclaims the $108K resistance, it could trigger a short liquidation cascade, propelling the price toward $115K. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin’s price action remains on a bullish trajectory, with the ascending channel’s middle trendline acting as a strong support zone in recent months. This dynamic support has repeatedly held price declines, reflecting buyer confidence and a resurgence in demand. Following this support test, Bitcoin surged toward its all-time high of $108K, a key resistance region with concentrated supply and selling pressure. The asset is now consolidating within a tight range, bound by the channel’s middle trendline and the static $108K resistance. Given that liquidity grabs have already occurred above $108K and below $90K, a breakout appears imminent. If bullish momentum strengthens, reclaiming $108K could fuel a sharp rally driven by short liquidations and increased buying pressure toward $115K. The 4-Hour Chart In the lower timeframe, BTC’s buyers stepped in at the $90K support, preventing further declines. Following a liquidity sweep below $90K, Bitcoin surged toward the $108K resistance zone, where the ascending channel’s middle boundary aligns with its ATH, reinforcing this level as a major inflection point. The ongoing consolidation at $108K reflects a battle between buyers and sellers, making this region a pivotal price level. A breakout and consolidation above $108K could signal a sustained rally toward new ATHs. However, a rejection from this level might trigger a retracement toward the channel’s lower boundary at $98K. Sentiment Analysis By Shayan Bitcoin’s recent uptrend has traders closely watching whether it can break above its all-time high of $108K. The key factor in this potential breakout is whether the market can generate enough momentum to surpass this critical resistance level. A crucial on-chain indicator, the funding rates metric, has shown a bearish divergence. While Bitcoin’s price has surged toward ATH, funding rates have declined, suggesting weak demand in perpetual markets. This divergence indicates that bullish momentum may not be strong enough to support a breakout. For Bitcoin to decisively breach $108K, the funding rates must rise further, signaling an increase in optimism and a greater influx of long positions. Without this market-wide enthusiasm, the resistance at $108K could hold, leading to potential consolidation or a temporary rejection.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up just over 0.50%, trading around $104,700 as markets wait for a catalyst to spark a bull run. A rally could push BTC beyond its all-time high, potentially past $110,000. El Salvador Amends Bitcoin Law El Salvador has amended its Bitcoin law to end mandatory BTC payments for merchants. The change is due to conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a $1.4 billion loan to improve the country’s economy. El Salvador was the first country in the world to give BTC legal tender status. The initiative was championed by the country’s president, Nayib Bukele. However, the move came under criticism after it made it mandatory for businesses to accept BTC . This was due to the asset’s volatility and a limited understanding of digital assets among the local population. The legislative change addresses these concerns by allowing local businesses to choose whether to accept BTC . The government has also agreed to no longer accept BTC for tax payments and reduce its involvement in Bitcoin-related activities, including the Chivo wallet app. The changes were crucial in securing the IMF loan to stabilize the country’s economy. Bitcoin (BTC) Won’t Be Included In EU Reserve Assets ECB President Christine Lagarde has said that BTC will not be included in the EU’s list of reserve assets. The comments come after US President Donald Trump announced plans to add BTC to the country’s reserves. Ales Michl, the governor of the Czech Republic’s central bank, had urged the ECB’s General Council to consider adding BTC to the country’s reserved assets. However, Lagarde dismissed the suggestions, stating, “I am confident that Bitcoins won't enter the reserves of any of the central banks of the General Council.” Lagarde added that assets that could be considered for addition to a country’s reserves must have liquidity and security. According to Lagarde, this ruled out Bitcoin. She added that BTC can also be used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activities and cannot be viewed as a safe addition to the EU’s reserved assets. “I had a good conversation with my colleague from the Czech Republic, and I leave it to him to make whatever announcement he wants to make, but I'm confident that he's convinced, as we all are, of the necessity to have liquid, secure, and safe reserves.” USDT To Be Integrated Into Bitcoin Lightning Tether’s USDT stablecoin is being integrated into the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The partnership was announced by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark at the Bitcoin-focused Plan B conference in San Salvador, El Salvador. CEO of Tether Paolo Ardoino stated, “By enabling USDt on the Lightning Network, we are not only reinforcing Bitcoin’s foundational principles of decentralization and security but also creating practical solutions for remittances, payments, and other financial applications that demand both speed and reliability.” According to Stark, the integration will allow merchants accepting BTC over the Lightning Network to add USDT as a payment option using the same infrastructure. “Today marks a new era for stablecoins. Bringing USDt to Bitcoin combines the security and decentralization of Bitcoin with the speed and scalability of Lightning. Millions of people will now be able to use the most open, secure blockchain to send dollars globally. It all comes back to Bitcoin.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $105,000 as markets await a decisive catalyst to influence price action. Markets have been sluggish thanks to uncertainty driven by President Donald Trump’s tariff threats and the Fed leaving interest rates unchanged. The US President has threatened to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS nations, adding that a 25% tariff against Canada and Mexico will go into effect on Saturday. Trump has also threatened to impose a 10% tariff on China. These developments could significantly disrupt global trade and have soured risk appetite. BTC has encountered significant volatility and bearish sentiment since the weekend but has recovered admirably over the past few sessions. Thursday saw BTC drop to an intraday low of $101,296 and rise to an intraday high of $106,903 before settling at $104,004. Buyers retained control on Friday as BTC rose to an intraday high of $107,038. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $104,874, rising nearly 1%. However, sentiment changed over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal drop on Saturday before falling over 2% on Sunday to end the weekend at $102,655. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Monday as BTC plummeted to an intraday low of $97,766. The price recovered from this level to reclaim $100,000, ultimately settling at $102,064, registering a drop of 0.58%. Sellers retained control on Tuesday after thwarting an attempted recovery. As a result, BTC fell 0.69% and settled at $101,362. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday, preventing a drop below $100,000. As a result, BTC registered an increase of 2.27% and settled at $103,666. BTC surged to an intraday high of $106,332 on Thursday but lost momentum after reaching this level, falling to $104,559. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers look to decisively push the price above $105,000. BTC is facing resistance around $106,000. A break above this level could send it to a new all-time high. However, if BTC fails to push above $105,000, it could indicate bulls are exhausted. As such, BTC could slip below $100,000 and drop as low as $90,000. The RSI is above the neutral zone, indicating a slight advantage to the bulls.

The project aims to raise up to $200 million to fund a for-profit think tank named the Musk Institute, as revealed by Musk in a recent interview with Fortune. Growing Trend of Memecoin Launches This move positions Errol Musk as the latest high-profile figure to tap into the growing trend of celebrity-backed meme tokens, a sector that has seen an uptick in interest following the launch of several high-profile coins earlier this year. The surge in memecoin popularity can be traced back to the January launches of Donald Trump’s “Official Trump” (TRUMP) token and the “Official Melania” (MELANIA) token, both of which debuted on the Solana blockchain. These celebrity-endorsed memecoins sparked retail investor enthusiasm, fueling speculation that others, including Errol Musk, might follow suit with their own digital assets. Errol Musk Aims to Raise Funds for Think Tank The “Musk It” token was quietly launched on December 12, 2024, by a Middle Eastern cryptocurrency company. However, despite the prominent Musk name, the token has struggled to gain momentum. As of 7:58 am UTC on January 30, 2025, the token has lost more than 52% of its initial value, now trading at just $0.02, with a market capitalization of $25 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Errol Musk clarified that his son, Elon Musk, has no involvement with the “Musk It” token project. This absence of direct endorsement from the high-profile Tesla and SpaceX CEO could be a factor hindering the token’s success, despite the family name carrying considerable weight in the crypto and tech communities. Memecoin tokens often thrive on celebrity backing , and without Elon’s seal of approval, “Musk It” may face significant challenges in capturing the public’s attention. While the “Musk It” token’s performance may leave much to be desired, the broader memecoin market still holds appeal for traders who can stomach its volatility. Notably, some savvy investors have capitalized on these digital assets’ erratic price movements.

As the market fluctuations continue, traders turn to PropiChain (PCHAIN) as a strategic hedge against volatility. PropiChain, a sub-$1 presale token, is near its all-time low. This offers investors an attractive entry point. The project has already raised over $2 million during its presale token, demonstrating its ability to outperform Ripple and Ethereum in 2025. Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen Sells XRP Tokens The action taken by the Ripple Chairman, Chris Larsen, could add selling pressure to XRP. Larsen has sold roughly $116 million in XRP in 2025 so far after a long holding period. The sale puts pressure on Ripple after XRP spent years under-performing. The sale indicates that Larsen is capitalizing on XRP’s recent bullish momentum. Some traders believe that the Ripple Chairman’s actions mark the top. XRP , the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, is down 4% in the past week. XRP and Ethereum have lost ground this week although leading altcoins have suffered more losses. PropiChain is a Good Hedge Against Altcoin Volatility PropiChain has been tipped to be one of the best hedges against volatility. This is mainly because PCHAIN is near its all-time low, presenting an exciting opportunity for investors. It will also perform better than Ripple and Ethereum due to growing interest in the presale token. The project has already raised over $2 million, with more set to come after listing. As a tokenization platform, the altcoin supports fractional ownership. This tool allows users to buy portions of real estate, making it easy for retail traders to diversify their assets even with minimum capital. With AI at the heart of PCHAIN, the altcoin has practical use cases such as predictive market analysis. With AI-driven analysis, investors can make smart investment decisions. For example, PropiChain’s predictive market analysis would have alerted users that Jupiter (JUP) would make substantial gains after its acquired Moonshot. Thanks to this acquisition, JUP is up 35% this week. Additionally, AI is used in smart contract automation . This feature automates real estate transactions such as auto-leasing and lease renewals. This process reduces manual paperwork, simplifying the lives of landlords and investors. To keep the platform safe for users, PropiChain’s smart contracts have been audited by BlockAudit, one of the best security firms in the blockchain space. Furthermore, the project has automated valuation models, a tool for accurate property appraisals. This offers accurate, fair pricing for any property, allowing buyers and seller to close their real estate deals quickly. The metaverse also allows prospective buyers to view properties digitally using the metaverse. This reduces costs in property scouting. Can PCHAIN Outperform Ripple and Ethereum? An analyst claims that PCHAIN could be a better investment bet than Ripple and Ethereum. The emerging altcoin is up 200% during the first two stages of its ongoing token presale. On the other hand, Ripple and Ethereum are suffering losses as the market loses momentum. PCHAIN is tipped to mirror Ethereum’s 2020 – 21 rally when its price surged from $122 in February 2020 to an all-time high of $4,891 in October 2021. Investors’ Appetite for PropiChain Rises Investors are betting big on PropiChain because it is undervalued at $0.01. The altcoin has raised over $2 million in its ongoing fundraising round, highlighting growing investor confidence in PropiChain. The project has been listed on CoinMarketCap. This has given it extra exposure, a key factor in attracting new investors. The sub-$1 altcoin is tipped to grow by 35,000% in 2025 thanks to its low entry price, growing community, and AI-driven tools that simplify real estate activities such as buying, selling, or investing properties. With investors’ appetite rising, this is the best time to scoop the PCHAIN token for cheap during its ongoing presale. Join PropiChain’s token presale and convert $1K into $350K.

Mantra ( OM ) coin jumped to a record high of $5.92 as we predicted . It climbed 45% in January, reaching a peak of $5.9232 and bringing its market capitalization to over $5.3 billion. The token has now risen nearly 40,000% from its lowest point in 2023. Mantra’s surge in January was mostly due to its huge partnership with DAMAC , one of Dubai’s largest real estate companies. Under the agreement, DAMAC will tokenize $1 billion worth of its real estate holdings. A successful implementation of this project could lead to similar deals in the real estate sector, which is expected to see significant tokenization growth. Some analysts estimate that the real estate tokenization market could reach $3.2 trillion by 2030. The financial services industry is another sector poised for tokenization. Tokenized funds such as BlackRock’s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s FOBXX have already attracted nearly $1 billion in assets.

This move could unlock a massive opportunity, as global stock markets have a total capitalization of $115 trillion, with the bond market even larger. As tokenization expands, Mantra is well-positioned to benefit, with its MantraChain aiming to become the leading dedicated layer-1 network for the sector. Mantra’s price surge also coincided with a sharp increase in futures open interest. Data shows that open interest in OM futures reached an all-time high of $450 million on Thursday. OM futures open interest | Source: CoinGlass Mantra price analysis Mantra price chart | Source: crypto.news The OM token has experienced a meteoric rise over the past few years, climbing from near zero to almost $6. Between November and January, it formed a bullish pennant pattern, a widely recognized continuation signal, featuring a long vertical rally followed by a symmetrical triangle. Mantra has now broken above the upper boundary of the pennant. Additionally, the Average Directional Index has surged to 30, its highest level since December. An ADX reading above 25 indicates strong momentum in an asset. Therefore, Mantra will likely pull back to $4.50, the upper boundary of the pennant, before resuming its uptrend. This break-and-retest pattern is a commonly observed continuation setup. In the long term, Mantra’s price could rise to $10.

While RLUSD’s rapid growth signals strong market adoption, discussions around the first 32,569 lost XRP ledgers continue to spark debate about transparency and historical record-keeping. Ripple’s executives have addressed both topics, emphasizing the company’s commitment to regulatory compliance and network security. However, questions remain as Ripple navigates its role in the evolving crypto landscape. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Surpasses $100 Million Market Cap in Record Time Ripple’s foray into the stablecoin market has already begun making waves, with Ripple USD (RLUSD) surpassing $100 million in market capitalization just over a month after its launch. The rapid milestone was announced by Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple , who emphasized the asset’s over-reserved status, meaning Ripple holds more collateral than the circulating supply of RLUSD. According to McDonald, Ripple’s reserves currently exceed the total supply of RLUSD by $6 million, reinforcing the company’s commitment to financial security and transparency in the stablecoin space. The achievement comes as Ripple seeks to establish itself as a major player in the stablecoin ecosystem, competing against giants like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USD Coin (USDC). Ripple launched RLUSD with a clear focus on regulatory compliance, security, and interoperability. Given Ripple’s strong presence in the payments sector and its longstanding relationships with financial institutions, the stablecoin was expected to gain traction quickly. However, hitting the $100 million mark within a month is a significant feat, signaling strong early adoption. By comparison, stablecoins such as Paxos (USDP) and TrueUSD (TUSD), which have been around for years, currently hold market caps of around $500 million and $2 billion, respectively. While RLUSD has gained momentum, it still has a long way to go before catching up to USDT ($140 billion market cap) and USDC ($53 billion market cap)—the two dominant stablecoins that control the majority of the sector’s liquidity. Monica Long, Ripple’s President, recently hinted at RLUSD's expanding ecosystem, stating that the stablecoin would soon be listed on more platforms, further increasing its accessibility and utility. Wider exchange support and deeper integration into Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution could position RLUSD as a strong competitor in cross-border payments and institutional finance. Ripple’s strong regulatory focus also sets it apart. In contrast to algorithmic stablecoins or those facing uncertainties around reserves, RLUSD is designed to provide full transparency and maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, backed by a reserve exceeding its issuance. Can RLUSD Compete with Tether and USDC? Despite RLUSD’s impressive early growth, it faces significant challenges. Tether remains the undisputed leader, with an entrenched market position, deep liquidity, and extensive adoption across both CeFi (centralized finance) and DeFi (decentralized finance). Similarly, USDC has secured a strong foothold, particularly in the US, due to its compliance-driven approach and backing from major financial institutions. Ripple’s ability to scale RLUSD beyond its initial growth phase will depend on several key factors: Exchange Adoption: Listings on major platforms such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken will be crucial for RLUSD’s long-term success. Institutional Demand: Ripple’s connections with banks and financial institutions could help drive corporate adoption of RLUSD for cross-border settlements. DeFi Integration: For RLUSD to compete with USDC and Tether, it must establish itself within the Ethereum, Solana, and other DeFi ecosystems. Regulatory Clarity: Ripple’s ongoing legal battles with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could impact RLUSD’s trajectory. Ripple’s ambition to reshape the stablecoin market is evident, and the early success of RLUSD suggests strong potential. However, the road ahead is not without hurdles. While surpassing $100 million in market cap is impressive, long-term viability depends on sustained demand, liquidity expansion, and institutional trust. If Ripple successfully integrates RLUSD into its global payment network and secures key regulatory approvals, it could position itself as a viable alternative to USDC and USDT. For now, RLUSD is in its infancy, but its rapid growth signals that Ripple is serious about making a lasting impact in the stablecoin arena. The XRP Missing Ledgers Debate: Transparency Concern or Just Another Bitcoin vs. XRP Battle? The debate over XRP’s missing ledgers refuses to fade into obscurity. The first 32,569 ledgers of the XRP Ledger are gone, erased from history with no known backup. While Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz insists that all previous accounts are accounted for in ledger 32,570, skepticism persists, particularly from Bitcoin maximalists who argue that XRP’s lack of a complete historical record is a serious transparency issue. This controversy is nothing new, but it raises critical questions about XRP’s legitimacy, its premined supply, and Ripple’s broader ambitions—especially its push to position XRP as a US reserve asset. In XRP’s early days, a mishap occurred that resulted in the permanent loss of the first batch of ledgers. No backup. No chance of recovery. Those transactions, those records? Gone. Unlike Bitcoin, where a complete historical record is necessary to verify its unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), XRP uses a different approach. Each new ledger contains a summarized state of the previous one, making it unnecessary to go back and reconstruct earlier data. Schwartz reassured the community that ledger 32,570 still reflects all previous accounts and balances. In other words, functionally, nothing was lost—just the granular transaction details from XRP’s infancy. Bitcoin proponents claim that their blockchain’s full transaction history is a cornerstone of financial transparency and decentralization. Every satoshi can be traced back to its original mining event, reinforcing Bitcoin’s trustless nature. XRP’s missing ledgers, they argue, cast a shadow over the network’s credibility, especially given the controversy surrounding its premined supply and Ripple’s control over billions of tokens. Ripple, on the other hand, argues that this is a non-issue. According to Schwartz, in XRP’s early days, there was no expectation that the ledger would become the definitive XRP record. Had Ripple reset the ledger, they would have lost even more history, rendering a reset pointless. But that explanation has done little to silence critics who see the missing ledgers as part of a broader pattern of opaqueness. Ripple’s Control and XRP’s Future Transparency concerns are not new for Ripple. The company has faced SEC scrutiny, lawsuits, and accusations of centralized control over XRP’s supply. While Ripple maintains that it does not control the XRP Ledger, it holds a significant amount of XRP in escrow, fueling concerns about supply manipulation. With Ripple pushing XRP as a potential US reserve asset, the missing ledgers controversy has gained renewed attention. Critics argue that if XRP is to be a global financial tool, its historical record should be unimpeachable. From a technical perspective, no—the XRP Ledger functions exactly as it should. The missing ledgers do not impact its security, its ability to settle transactions, or its decentralization mechanism. From a perception standpoint, however, the debate lingers. Transparency matters in crypto, and Bitcoin maximalists are unlikely to let go of the missing ledgers argument any time soon. For XRP, the real question is whether adoption and institutional integration will overshadow these lingering concerns. As Ripple continues to build partnerships with banks, financial firms, and payment providers, the market—not online debates—will ultimately determine XRP’s future.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,XRP|MARKET|WALLET|USDT|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-31 14:00:00

The simulation, which was conducted on a ZKsync test network, is a sign of renewed interest in blockchain technology among traditional financial institutions. This isn’t UBS’ first experiment with blockchain. The bank previously launched a tokenized money market investment fund , uMint, which is also built on Ethereum. UBS’ Key4 Gold is one of the bank's offerings that lets its Swiss clients purchase a direct claim to physical gold. “It allows for fractional gold investments with real-time pricing, deep liquidity, secure physical storage, and optional physical delivery,” the team said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. The project already exists on the bank's private blockchain, the UBS Gold Network, but the team was looking for ways to scale its project while preserving its privacy. “They came to the conclusion that only zero-knowledge made sense for them, and so they wanted to really put this in practice for a product that they already have live and what this could look like if they use the validium instead,” Pearl Imbach, a Senior Business Development Manager at Matter Labs, the main developer firm behind ZKsync, told CoinDesk in an interview. ZKsync is a zero-knowledge rollup, a type of layer 2 scaling system that aims to increase the speed of blockchain transactions and reduce their fees, by using zero-knowledge cryptography . A validum is a different type of layer-2 , similar to that of a rollup, but stores the data of those transactions off-chain. The test transaction may signal that UBS could be looking more closely at using layer-2 technologies to power some of its activities. However, the bank didn't say whether they would come out with their own layer-2, and Matter Labs' Imbach told CoinDesk that a rollup might not be the right fit for them. “Is this the right product [for UBS]? Perhaps not, but it is something we're just talking openly about, and thinking about what could actually be a good use case for them,” Imbach told CoinDesk. This isn't the first time a banking giant has used ZKsync's technology for its own products. Deutsche Bank said in December that it was also planning to build a layer-2 with ZKsync’s technology, indicating how blockchain technology can co-exist or even make traditional financial institutes' products work better. “What we are offering now, with privacy on top [of the blockchain] is something that is super interesting, and we're doing more and more of these use cases now,” Imbach told CoinDesk.

The Coin’s Future Price, According To Expert Opinion One of the prominent members of the crypto community, Edward Farina, thinks that after the litigation is settled, the token’s price would rise. Farina predicted that once investors had faith in the initiative again, XRP’s market value would soar. He underlined that since it would give institutional investors clarity and security, the resolution of the SEC case would probably lead to a wider adoption of the crypto asset. Unfortunately, 95% of $XRP holders are likely to sell at $10, missing out on the true long-term gains. Many have sold at $0.80, settling for far less. Don’t make the same mistake by rushing into devaluated “stablecoins”. Make sure you’re locked in for the perpetual run. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) November 25, 2024 A push to the $10 barrier would require over 200% surge from present levels, since XRP is now trading at $3.12. Such an increase is still within the realm of possibility for the altcoin, given its enormous 400% increase from November 5 to December 3 on the heels of the excitement surrounding Donald Trump‘s recent election win.

US PCE Inflation Comes in At 2.6% The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge US PCE data on January 31. The annual PCE comes at 2.6%, as expected, but up from 2.4% last month. Also, the month-over-month inflation rose 0.3% after a 0.1% increase in the previous month. The annual core US PCE inflation jumps to 2.8%, in line with market expectations and the same as in the earlier month. The monthly core PCE comes in at 0.2%, up from 0.1% last month. US Fed Takes Rate Cuts Off Table The Federal Reserve paused interest rates on Wednesday, triggering an upside momentum in Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the FOMC is in no hurry to cut rates again, which got harsh comments from US President Donald Trump as he plans to push for rate cuts. Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she wants to see additional progress on inflation before the central bank lowers interest rates further. CME FedWatch tool shows an 84% probability for the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged in the next FOMC meeting in March amid inflation data, increasing uncertainty in the markets. Bitcoin Price Drops BTC price drops slightly by 0.5% after the PCE inflation data, with the price currently trading at $104,594. The 24-hour low and high are $103,912 and $106,418, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has decreased by 25% in the last 24 hours, indicating a decline in interest among traders amid uncertainty. US dollar index ( DXY ) turns volatile and moves 0.43% high to 108.26 after PCE inflation data. Moreover, the US 10-year Treasury yield also slightly increased to 4.523%. Notably, Bitcoin price moves in the opposite direction to DXY and Treasury yield, but uncertainty has kept trades cautious about the market direction.

Despite the slowdown, SHIB has gained over 100% in the past year. Discover why SHIB can reach the long-anticipated $0.01 mark after a massive 7,200% token burn. This has sparked speculation about further upside. Investors are now watching whether SHIB can reach highs. Can Shiba Inu Price Hit $0.01 After Massive 7,200% Burn? Shiba Inu price is gaining momentum as its burn rate skyrocketed by 7,247% in the past 24 hours. The surge removed over 1 billion SHIB tokens from circulation, sparking renewed bullish sentiment in the market. This reduction in supply has fueled optimism among investors anticipating a price breakout. Market dynamics suggest increased interest in SHIB as traders react to the declining token availability. With growing burn activity, analysts speculate on a potential rally amid improving crypto market conditions. Shibburn Why Could SHIB Price See More Surge Ahead? Shiba Inu price gains momentum as Bitcoin hovers around $103K, approaching its all-time high of $108K. Despite market corrections, BTC and ETH’s rally fuels optimism for broader crypto gains. The rising value of Ethereum, Solana, and XRP creates favorable conditions for SHIB’s price surge. The token aims for the elusive $0.01 mark, a significant milestone. Meme coin interest grows, with Dogecoin leading and new tokens like TRUMP, PENGU, and AI16Z gaining traction. Shibarium’s expansion and ETH-based meme coins could further boost SHIB’s rally. Shiba Inu Holds Key Support Zone Crypto analysts highlight that the Shiba Inu price is maintaining its position within the crucial $0.000018 – $0.000020 range. Market experts suggest prolonged consolidation in this zone could lead to a significant price surge. Analysts predict that the longer SHIB stabilizes at this level, the more explosive its breakout could be, potentially fueling an aggressive upward momentum. Will SHIB Price Recover Above $0.00002 This Weekend? As Friday, the SHIB price hovered at $0.00001897, marking a 1.50% increase in the last 24 hours. The price has been consolidating near the $0.00001900 level, showing slight bullish momentum. The price faces immediate resistance at $0.00002. If the Shiba Inu price prediction breaks above this level, it could rally toward the next resistance at $0.000025. A successful breakout above this zone may drive the price toward the $0.00003000 level. On the downside, the nearest support is around $0.000015. A drop below this level could trigger further selling pressure, potentially pushing SHIB lower. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 53, suggesting neutral market conditions. A move above 60 could confirm stronger buying momentum. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) is at 0.07, indicating mild capital inflows into SHIB. Shiba Inu Price Chart: TradingView Shiba Inu price outlook remains bullish as burn rates rise and market conditions improve. If momentum sustains, SHIB could challenge key resistance levels and push toward its long-awaited $0.01 target.

In addition, he also shed light on his Bitcoin holdings, which have triggered massive discussions in the broader cryptocurrency market today. In addition, this revelation also comes as ETH price recorded a surge of over 4%. Ethereum Co-founder Vitalik Buterin Reveals Bitcoin Holdings Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently responded to a post by crypto analyst Udi Wertheimer, who argued that holding at least 10% Bitcoin is a must for any crypto investor. Buterin, however, countered this notion by stating, “I hold less than 10% in BTC. But I also hold less than 10% in anything that’s not ETH.” This statement highlights his heavy reliance on Ethereum, reinforcing his confidence in the network he co-founded. Meanwhile, his disclosure suggests a strategy focused on Ethereum while maintaining minimal exposure to other cryptocurrencies. The revelation has sparked debates over whether industry leaders should diversify their holdings or stay committed to their primary blockchain projects. Bitcoin Vs Ethereum Debate The discussion gained momentum when another crypto influencer, DonAlt, mirrored Wertheimer’s statement but flipped the argument in favor of Ethereum. He stated that investors should allocate at least 10% to ETH, ideally making it 70% of their portfolio. This counterargument has fueled the ongoing rivalry between Bitcoin and Ethereum supporters, as both camps continue to advocate for their preferred asset. Ethereum has long positioned itself as a blockchain with broader utility, offering smart contracts, DeFi applications, and NFT capabilities. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains the dominant store of value and a hedge against inflation. Notably, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki also labeled BTC as a safe haven while predicting the biggest market crash in history. However, Buterin’s stance indicates his confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential, despite Bitcoin’s undisputed dominance in market capitalization. Ethereum Price Surges Amid Vitalik Buterin’s Comment Following Vitalik Buterin’s revelation, ETH price today surged more than 4% and exchanged hands at $3,357. The token saw intraday top and bottom of $3,358.79 and $3,214.94, reflecting the volatile scenario in the market. In addition, analysts attribute this ETH price uptick to large Ethereum whale accumulation trends . According to reports, the Ether whales have bagged 100,000 ETH during a recent price dip. Such strategic purchases often trigger positive sentiment, driving further interest from institutional and retail investors alike. Meanwhile, with Ethereum’s network upgrades and increasing adoption, the asset continues to attract strong backing. Vitalik Buterin’s near-exclusive focus on ETH only strengthens the narrative that Ethereum could have more room for growth compared to other crypto assets.

MELANIA has shed 8.10% in the last year, down from the previous price of $2.32 to the present price of $2.15. At the same time, PEPETO raised over $4 million in investments during the presale so that investors could see the company as more or less sustainable in the long term. Melania Coin Faces Continued Downturn MELANIA, which ended last week at $280.90 per share, recorded its lowest value, sliding in its market capitalization by 8.44 % to $373.14 Million. However, the trading volume has risen by 12.67%, and now it is $91,900,000. The two trends of falling prices coupled with the increasing volume show active trading and possibly instability amongst traders. Source: CoinMarketCap The circulating supply remains at 173.31 million out of nearly one billion tokens to its holders. Its fully diluted valuation is $2.16 billion, meaning the company has the potential to have its market cap in billions if all of these tokens are floated in the market. However, its sustainability has often been questioned because fluctuations in the market have a negative impact on investors.

This approach helps prevent excessive price fluctuations and supports a stable market. The remaining 7.5% is reserved for development, allowing the team to implement technical improvements. This fund ensures that #PEPETO can evolve in response to market trends. PEPETO aims to maintain investor confidence and long-term viability with a strong foundation and strategic distribution.

DeepSeek arrived at the scene with a bang, indicating that it can do everything ChatGPT does but is faster and cheaper, which put into question the need for highly powerful chips from giants like Nvidia. Aside from the market-wide crash in stocks, including NVDA’s double-digit dump, the news sent shockwaves across crypto as well. BTC stood around $105,000 ahead of the Monday morning Asian trading session but slumped in hours by several grand to a multi-week low of under $98,000. The altcoins followed suit, but this otherwise violent correction didn’t last long. By Tuesday morning, the asset had reclaimed the coveted $100,000 mark despite another brief slip below it. The markets calmed for the next few days or so in anticipation of the first FOMC meeting of the year and the first under Trump. Once that took place and it became known that the US central bank will not change the key interest rates, BTC headed south immediately by $1,500. However, it bounced off on Thursday and spiked to $106,500 where it faced another reaction. After another correction to $104,000 earlier today, bitcoin’s price movements have calmed, and the asset stands at around $105,000 as of press time.

CBOE Restarts US Solana ETF Race With Filings for 4 Asset Managers . The seemingly more favorable regulatory environment in the US toward the crypto industry has propelled many asset managers to submit filings for locally-based digital asset ETFs. Solana is among the leaders, as CBOE filed applications for SOL ETFs from four leading asset managers. Bitcoin Price Drops by $1K as US Federal Reserve Maintains Interest Rates . BTC’s aforementioned drop from $103,000 to $101,500 after the US Federal Reserve’s move to keep the interest rates as is was short-lived. Nevertheless, the uncertainty about the US economy, inflation state, and future Fed decisions remains with Trump at the helm. 5 Reasons to Be Bullish on Ethereum (ETH) Despite January Drop . ETH is among the most underwhelming performers during this bull cycle, with its price failing to come anywhere near its 2021 all-time high of over $4,800.

As a result, the digital asset provided a 47.2% return over the course of the year. Those results aren’t bad, by any stretch of the imagination — but they are relatively lackluster when compared to notable peers and rivals such as Solana ( SOL ), which secured a 77.03% gain in the same period. By press time on January 31, the price of Cardano was $0.97124. Since the start of 2025, ADA has seen an 11.56% surge in price — although it has struggled to reclaim the $1 mark since January 20. ADA price year-to-date (YTD) chart. Source: Finbold However, the choppy price action seen as of late might be coming to an end — as one noted technical analyst has pointed out a chart pattern that suggests Cardano prices could experience a significant shift in the near term. Crypto researcher anticipates sharp change in ADA price Since the beginning of December, Cardano has been consolidating within a symmetrical triangle chart pattern, as shared by renowned cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez in a January 31 post on social media platform X . The symmetrical triangle pattern consists of two converging trendlines. To ascertain a price target, traders take the height of the triangle at its beginning and add it to a hypothetical breakout point. Per the chart, at present, this would imply a 40% price move. #Cardano $ADA is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle, setting up for a breakout that could trigger a 40% price move! pic.twitter.com/7HAgD8UhXs — Ali (@ali_charts) January 31, 2025 Here’s where things get a tad more complicated — unlike most other chart patterns , a symmetrical triangle is neither immanently bullish nor bearish. Martinez chose his words correctly, although some might miss the implication — the aforementioned 40% price move could be in either direction. A 40% surge to the upside would bring the price of ADA up to roughly $1.35974, a mark last seen in mid-December of 2021. Conversely, a 40% move to the downside would see Cardano changing hands at a price of just $0.58274 — effectively erasing all of the gains that the cryptocurrency has seen since February of 2024. As attention-grabbing as Martinez’s chart might be, readers would do well to remember that nothing happens in a vacuum — and while technical analysis can provide a piece of the puzzle, on its own, it generally isn’t enough to draw a definitive conclusion.

The proposed Purpose Ripple ETF aims to provide investors with long-term exposure to XRP ( XRP ) and an opportunity to benefit from the asset’s capital appreciation, according to an announcment Purpose Investments submitted the preliminary prospectus to Canadian securities regulators. The filing comes shortly after the firm also applied for the listing of a spot Solana ( SOL ) spot ETF. Som Seif, chief executive officer of Purpose Investments, noted that XRP’s continued adoption could drive demand for a spot investment product. “As XRP sees increasing adoption and institutional interest, we believe an ETF can offer investors a transparent and familiar way to access it within a regulated framework,” he noted.

There have been several applications for an XRP exchange-traded fund in the United States, with recent regulatory shifts encouraging issuers to push forward.

Other top cryptocurrencies attracting spot ETF applications include Solana, Litecoin, and Dogecoin.

Purpose Investments launched the world’s first Bitcoin ETF after securing approval from the Ontario Securities in February 2021. Meanwhile, United States-based asset managers had to wait until January 2024 for approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Notably, the Trust offers investors the opportunity to gain exposure to DOGE. Grayscale believes that DOGE has transitioned from a memecoin of a Shiba Inu to a tool for global financial inclusion, grassroots activism, and a viable means of payment. “Due to its widespread accessibility, affordability, and rapid transaction speeds, DOGE has garnered significant adoption worldwide,” it noted. Grayscale’s Head of Product & Research, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary emphasized that Dogecoin has become a powerful tool for improving financial accessibility. He noted that as a faster, cheaper, and more scalable version of Bitcoin, it helps underserved groups engage with the financial system. “Grayscale Dogecoin Trust offers investors exposure to an asset that is positioned to help fulfill Bitcoin’s originally intended use case and its egalitarian ethos.” The Trust is now open for daily subscriptions by eligible individual and institutional accredited investors. It works like Grayscale’s other single-asset investment trusts and is entirely invested in the Dogecoin token. Notably, Grayscale is also working to list a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) on U.S. stock exchanges. Recently, the firm filed with the SEC to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF. The launch of this trust comes shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump took office, where he promised to support the cryptocurrency industry and created a new organization called “D.O.G.E.”",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,DOGE|BUSINESS|SHIB|BTC|RESEARCH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 15:25:59

Other investments contributed $1 billion. According to the company's latest quarterly attestation signed by accounting firm BDO Italy, the group's stablecoin issuer arms Tether International Limited and Tether Limited disclosed $143.7 billion of assets in reserve against $136.6 billion in liabilities, adding up to $7 billion of excess reserves backing its stablecoins. Treasury bills in the reserve rose to $94.5 billion.

Kuna, Ukraine’s oldest crypto exchange, shut down just days after authorities quietly blocked access to its platform without offering any explanation. The news came from Kuna’s founder and CEO, Michael Chobanian, who said in Telegram posts that he wasn’t informed by authorities and only found out about the ban when users started reporting the issue. The restriction follows an order issued by Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection. The order directs Ukrainian’s internet service providers to block access to Kuna’s domain as well as its subdomains. The directive cites a decision by the Shevchenkivskyi District Court of Kyiv and a request from Ukraine’s Bureau of Economic Security, though it doesn’t specify what the case against Kuna is about. The order states that the restriction will remain in effect until martial law in Ukraine is lifted. Founded in 2014, Kuna became one of Ukraine’s well-known platforms to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Over the years, it played a key role in facilitating crypto adoption in the country. For instance, in early 2022, Kuna partnered with Ukraine’s Ministry of Digital Transformation and created a special dedicated Crypto Fund for Ukraine which accumulated over $100 million worth of crypto donations to support the Ukrainian army. You might also like: Binance recommends P2P as Ukraine suspends fiat deposits on exchanges In a Telegram post on Jan. 24, Chobanian said that most internet providers in Ukraine had already enforced the block. “What we know for now: most providers have already complied with the SSSCIP requirement, which means it’s only a matter of time before the remaining telecom operators follow suit.” He also pointed out that neither he nor anyone from Kuna was invited to court for the decision. “We were not called to court, as you can imagine, and we learned about the blocking from users in Ukraine,” Chobanian wrote. Despite the restriction, he reassured users that Kuna’s infrastructure is hosted on cloud servers in Europe, meaning that only users inside Ukraine are affected. While it’s still unclear why Kuna was banned, Chobanian made another post on Jan. 30 announcing the exchange’s closure and telling users they have two months to withdraw their funds. He also made it clear that the ban came after he failed to pay kickbacks to a Ukrainian law enforcement agency that was desperate to find money “at any costs” to fund the country’s economy. “Unfortunately, I didn’t manage to meet with all the [law enforcement] agencies. I’m familiar with all the law enforcement officers in Ukraine, except for the Economic Security Bureau of Ukraine. Well, in our country, it’s the usual thing for law enforcement agencies to get to know through raids, as a rule. But since I’m not in Ukraine, and it’s extremely difficult to raid a virtual thing, that’s why they blocked the domain.” Michael Chobanian According to Ukrainian news outlets , the Economic Security Bureau of Ukraine is investigating Kuna for alleged tax evasion. Officials reportedly claim a forensic audit confirmed “intentional tax evasion,” leading to a court decision to block the platform. A law enforcement source told local media that Ukraine’s potential losses amount to around 50 million hryvnia (approximately $1.3 million) due to the tax evasion. Now, Chobanian says he wants to focus on symbiocracy, a government model where people manage themselves while considering all of Earth’s interconnected systems, using artificial intelligence and nature. He’s also shifting his attention to AI and “public social activity.” Because of this change in priorities, he announced that as of Jan. 30, Kuna has shut down all of its commercial operations. Crypto.news reached out to the Kuna team multiple times but didn’t get a response. Still, despite the ban, the Kuna founder remains optimistic, urging the community to focus on global trends and pointing to the growing interest in Bitcoin from the Trump administration. “Crypto enthusiasts in Ukraine don’t need to be told how to use crypto freely, so we are watching the crypto revolution in the U.S., Bitcoin being added to foreign exchange reserves, and the price of the TRUMP memecoin.” Michael Chobanian Back in August 2024, Chobanian went off on Ukraine’s central bank, saying the National Bank of Ukraine had basically “killed” the local crypto market, pushing him to turn his focus to Europe. He called the state of Ukraine’s crypto scene a disaster and blamed it on the bank’s strict restrictions on hryvnia-based crypto transactions.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/stablecoin-market-breaks-record-by-reaching-200-billion-is-it-a-sign-of-a-rise-here-are-the-details/,"The stablecoin market cap has reached a record high of over $200 billion, according to CryptoQuant, signaling potential bullish momentum for the broader cryptocurrency sector. Stablecoin Market Surpasses $200 Billion, Raising Crypto Rally Expectations Stablecoins (digital assets pegged to traditional currencies like the US dollar) serve as a crucial source of liquidity for crypto markets, allowing investors to move their funds efficiently between different assets. The stablecoin market has grown by $37 billion since early November, when Donald Trump won the US election, CryptoQuant reported. The firm suggests that this liquidity expansion could trigger the next push for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “The next rally for Bitcoin and crypto prices could be around the corner as stablecoin liquidity begins to expand again,” CryptoQuant analysts wrote. Tether and USDC Dominate the Stablecoin Market The two largest stablecoins, Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), continue to drive market growth: Tether (USDT) remains the dominant force with a market cap of $139 billion, up 15% since November. USD Coin (USDC) grew at a rapid pace of 48%, reaching a market value of $52.5 billion. USDT’s 30-day liquidity change turned slightly positive after shrinking by 2% earlier this year. Meanwhile, USDC’s liquidity increased by 20%, its fastest growth rate in a year. The expanding stablecoin supply comes alongside a strong rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and the overall crypto market: The price of Bitcoin has increased by over 50% in recent months. According to TradingView's Total market cap metric, total crypto market capitalization has increased from $2.2 trillion to $3.5 trillion. Analysts view the surge in stablecoin supply as a bullish signal indicating growing investor demand and fresh capital entering the crypto market. As liquidity expands and institutional interest accelerates, the next major crypto rally could be just around the corner. *This is not investment advice.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 768,800 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) could hit massive new all-time highs if the current bull market extends beyond what many are predicting. “I think that there’s a significant chance that this cycle will be longer and go higher than everybody expects. We’ve had the longest bear market on altcoins. Why not have the longest, final bull market on them? Bitcoin to $500,000 and Ethereum to $20,000. Sign me up.” The trader says the cycle peak could arrive as late as 2027 and that Bitcoin may become less volatile as it continues upward. “I don’t think we’ll have many 30% corrections on Bitcoin during this cycle. The markets become larger, through which a lot more liquidity is added and Bitcoin becomes more ‘boring.’ Just a gradual upward pace. Either Bitcoin peaks in Q4 2025 or somewhere beginning 2027.” Bitcoin is trading for $104,600 at time of writing, flat on the day. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $3,268 at time of writing, up 4.1% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the trader says several altcoins may soon follow the lead of layer-1 blockchain network Sui ( SUI ) and start breaking out. He says bullish divergence is starting to appear on the three-day charts against Bitcoin for several alts, including Optimism ( OP ), Wormhole ( W ) and Omni Network ( OMNI ). A bullish divergence, which suggests price will start to increase, occurs when the price of assets records lower lows while indicators, such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum oscillator indicator, are witnessing higher lows. “The markets start to signal massive signals that utility coins and ETH ecosystem is the next one to thrive. Why? SUI marked strong bullish divergences on HTF (high timeframe) levels at the lows resulting in 200% and 500% moves against Bitcoin. The same can now be seen on OP, W, OMNI and more.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Sui is trading for $4.15 at the of writing, up 8.6% in the last 24 hours, while OP is trading for $1.45 down about 1% on the day.

As the broader market experiences shifting sentiment, ADA remains in a tight consolidation phase, leaving traders eager for its next move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Outflows Signal Bullish Strength As Demand Remains High At $100K – What This Means However, market conditions have improved, and bullish sentiment is returning as Bitcoin flirts with a potential rally. With BTC leading the way, analysts believe altcoins like ADA could soon follow, setting the stage for a major breakout. Top crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Cardano is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern. This formation typically signals an upcoming breakout, though the direction remains uncertain. If ADA breaks above key resistance, a strong rally could follow. However, failure to hold support could result in further downside movement. As the crypto market turns bullish, all eyes are on ADA’s price action to determine whether it can finally reclaim the $1 level and start a new uptrend. The coming days will be crucial in deciding whether Cardano can break out of its consolidation phase and join the broader market rally. Cardano Consolidates After 25% Drop Cardano (ADA) has been under significant selling pressure since mid-January, experiencing a steep decline of over 25%. Market volatility has kept ADA trading below the $1 mark, a psychological level that has become a key battleground for bulls and bears. However, analysts are now calling for a recovery as altcoins begin to regain strength, signaling a potential turnaround for Cardano. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Cardano is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern, a formation often preceding a large breakout. According to Martinez, a decisive breakout from this pattern could trigger a 40% price move, bringing renewed momentum to ADA. If Cardano reclaims the $1 level and continues to push higher, buying pressure will increase, potentially driving ADA toward multi-year highs. A successful breakout would confirm strong demand and signal the start of a new bullish phase for the altcoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Setting For A Massive Leg Higher – Analyst Sees Bullish Consolidation Above Key Level With Bitcoin leading the market upward and altcoins showing strength, ADA could be on the verge of a significant rally. The coming days will be crucial as investors watch whether Cardano can break out of consolidation and join the broader market surge. ADA Struggles Below $1 Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.95 after failing to reclaim the $1 mark, a critical resistance level. The price has not closed above $1 since January 21, reinforcing it as a major hurdle for bulls. If ADA is to start a rally, buyers must push the price above $1 and hold it as support. This would confirm a trend shift and potentially trigger a move toward the $1.15 level, which has kept ADA suppressed for weeks. A breakout above this range could pave the way for strong bullish momentum and a rally into multi-month highs. However, risks remain. If ADA fails to hold above $0.90, selling pressure could intensify, leading to a deeper correction and prolonged consolidation before another breakout attempt. Losing this key support level could send ADA back to lower demand zones, delaying any significant upside moves.

This new token aims to raise up to $200 million, which will be directed toward supporting the Musk Institute, a for-profit think tank. However, the token has not gained significant traction since its quiet launch in December 2024, losing over 52% of its value. Despite the connection to the Musk name, experts such as Anndy Lian believe the project may struggle without Elon’s endorsement, pointing out that it lacks the personal stamp of the more successful Trump family memecoins. Investors continue to be drawn to memecoins due to their speculative nature, seeing them as “lottery tickets” in the crypto world. Lian suggests that the popularity of such tokens goes beyond the Trump family and reflects a broader desire for high-reward investments in crypto. Despite their lack of inherent utility, some traders manage to profit from the volatility of these assets. For instance, one trader turned a $27 investment into $52 million by capitalizing on the Pepe memecoin rally, holding the investment for over 600 days. The continued interest in memecoins indicates a speculative trend in the crypto market, where investors chase after the next big opportunity, hoping for massive returns. While Errol Musk’s project may struggle without his son’s involvement, it still plays into the broader memecoin craze fueled by high-risk, high-reward potential.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-31 15:33:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Institutional giants like BlackRock and Robinhood are betting on Real World Asset tokenization, with MANTRA emerging as a key player poised for significant growth. The next big institutional move? Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization is rapidly becoming a focal point for major financial players. Companies like BlackRock, Robinhood, Grayscale, and McKinsey are pushing for a future where traditional assets are brought on-chain. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has stated, “The next generation for markets will be the tokenization of securities.” Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev has also highlighted how tokenization could revolutionize private market investing. Leading crypto analysts, including Pentoshi, believe that RWA tokenization will reach a trillion-dollar market size before 2030. As institutions make their move, MANTRA (OM) is emerging as a key player in the RWA space. Despite the volatility in the crypto market, OM continues to perform strongly, driven by real-world adoption and strategic partnerships. While the broader crypto market has experienced fluctuations, OM has held its ground and continues to rise. Unlike many tokens that rely on speculation and hype, MANTRA’s growth is underpinned by tangible adoption and significant institutional support. DAMAC-MANTRA $1b tokenization deal: This partnership came just days after DAMAC announced a massive $20b partnership with Trump for U.S. data centers, underscoring the strong institutional momentum behind tokenization. Technical analysis: Bullish momentum ahead? OM’s price action is showing clear signs of an uptrend, supported by several technical indicators: Descending trendline broken: OM recently broke above a major trendline, suggesting further gains are on the horizon. Holding key support: Despite market dips, OM has consistently stayed above strong support levels, showing resilience. Uptrend confirmed: The recent price surge confirms that bullish momentum is intact. Price targets: How high can OM go? At $4.75, OM still has significant room to grow. Short-term target: A price of $10+ is realistic based on the performance of similar altcoins in the market. Mid-term projection (end of 2025): A target of $20 is possible, as many institutional-grade altcoins are reaching market caps above $20b. With OM currently at a $4.5b market cap, it is within reach, with the potential for more. MANTRA is strongly positioned in the rapidly growing RWA market, supported by significant partnerships, institutional backing, and a bullish price chart. As traditional financial players continue to bring assets on-chain, MANTRA’s infrastructure positions it as a key player in this transition. With the RWA market expected to reach trillions and major institutions investing heavily, OM’s breakout may be just beginning. A move above $10 soon? Very likely. A target of $20 by 2025?

Among the most exciting and profitable avenues is the growing sector of meme coins, known for their viral appeal and massive community involvement. As more meme coins continue to emerge, it can be overwhelming to choose which ones are truly worth your attention. Enter Arctic Pablo (APC), an innovative meme coin that’s turning heads with its unique theme and creative presale strategy. This project stands out in a crowded space by offering more than just a fun community; it promises an exciting journey through uncharted territories and mysterious locations. But Arctic Pablo isn’t alone in its mission to captivate crypto enthusiasts. Alongside it, well-known coins like Shiba Inu and Pudgy Penguins are making waves with fresh updates and community-driven initiatives. Shiba Inu continues to expand its influence within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, while Pudgy Penguins is elevating its NFT presence, strengthening its community bonds. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo, Shiba Inu, and Pudgy Penguins.

As each presale phase advances, Arctic Pablo’s value continues to grow, making it a prime investment for those looking to get in early. But the story doesn’t end there — the coin’s deflationary model ensures that as tokens are burned throughout the presale process, the scarcity of the token increases, boosting its long-term potential. Investors can enjoy both the thrill of the journey and the financial rewards, making Arctic Pablo a standout in the crowded meme coin market as Best Meme Coin to Join Today Arctic Pablo Presale: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity The presale for Arctic Pablo has entered a crucial phase with the project now at Glacier Grove, its 7th location. In a surprising twist, Arctic Pablo finished exploring the previous location, El-Dorado, in less than four days — exceeding all expectations and advancing ahead of schedule. As it enters Glacier Grove, the coin is priced at just $0.000043 per token, offering a massive opportunity for early investors to secure their stake at a low entry point. With over $675,000 already raised, Arctic Pablo is on track for massive growth as it continues its journey through the presale. As the price of APC is expected to increase with every new phase, now is the time to act before the token reaches its final presale price of $0.0008. When Arctic Pablo launches, the price will soar to $0.008, giving early investors the potential for an incredible 18,546% ROI. As each location unlocks, the excitement only grows. Don’t miss out on the chance to join this thrilling adventure at such a low price — the presale is a unique opportunity that won’t last forever. Shiba Inu: A Meme Coin with a Vision for the Future Shiba Inu, one of the most iconic meme coins, continues to evolve and expand its ecosystem. Known for its massive, loyal community, Shiba Inu is no longer just a meme coin. It has set its sights on becoming a significant player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With the upcoming release of its ShibaSwap platform, users can expect a full suite of DeFi services, including staking, yield farming, and liquidity pools. These moves are designed to give Shiba Inu holders more ways to engage with the token beyond simple transactions. Shiba Inu is also continuing to expand its partnerships and integrations across multiple blockchain platforms, which strengthens its position in the broader crypto ecosystem. By focusing on utility and expanding its offerings, Shiba Inu is positioning itself as a meme coin that has the potential for long-term growth and success in the crypto market. Pudgy Penguins: A Growing NFT and Meme Coin Hybrid Pudgy Penguins is another meme coin gaining traction in the crypto world, but it’s setting itself apart with a strong focus on the NFT space. The project’s unique blend of meme coin appeal and NFTs has helped it carve out a distinct identity, attracting a loyal community of supporters. Pudgy Penguins has recently made headlines for its partnerships within the NFT marketplace, and its NFTs are increasingly being seen as valuable digital assets. But the project isn’t just about cute penguins; it’s about building a strong, engaged community that thrives on creativity and collaboration. The Pudgy Penguins team is also working on expanding their brand through new merchandise, exclusive events, and other creative ventures, further strengthening the value proposition for holders.

Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that as the price soared, long-term holders, whales, and investors saw this as a perfect sell-off opportunity and began selling their VIRTUAL tokens. Source: Coinglas On-chain metrics inflows/outflows revealed that exchanges across the cryptocurrency landscape have witnessed an inflow of a massive $13.5 million worth of VIRTUAL tokens. This inflow suggests a potential sell-off by investors amid the massive upside rally, which could lead to sell-off pressure and a further price drop. However, VIRTUAL witnessed a price decline and experienced selling pressure. Current Price Momentum The asset is trading near $2.15 and is currently holding only a 1.85% gain in the past 24 hours. At one point today, this gain was over 50%. During the same period, due to heavy participation from investors and traders, VIRTUAL’s trading volume surged by 280%, indicating huge participation.

The criminals, who carried out a series of violent actions against a Manchester resident, received varying prison terms for their repeated offenses. According to the Warrington Guardian, the gang began targeting the victim in January 2023. In the first incident, Scott Armstrong, one of the seven, threatened the victim at his home and successfully extorted an undisclosed amount of cryptocurrency. A month later, another member, David Povey, arrived armed with a weapon and demanded more digital assets. The victim complied, hoping to end the ordeal, but the attacks continued.

In one instance, two individuals, Gary Edwards and Kane Godiff, abducted the victim, transported him to a separate location, tied him up, and threatened to kill him if he did not surrender more cryptocurrency. The situation reached its peak on November 30, 2023, when Edwards kidnapped the victim again and made further threats on his life. This time, an anonymous caller, likely a witness, tipped off the police on December 2. Upon arrival, the police noted that one Karl Johnson tried to escape the scene. Law enforcement found the victim restrained, with multiple burn marks and injuries from several weapons. Police also found a gun, live rounds, ropes, machetes, and knives on the premises. “Can you take me with you?” the victim reportedly told police when he was rescued. The criminals stole a total of £100,000 ($124,000) in cryptocurrency. However, it remains unclear which specific digital assets were taken or whether the attackers attempted to launder the funds to conceal their crimes.

With so many financial behemoths presenting ETF applications to regulatory authorities, Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are among the most appealing choices now on the market. While speculation about the next crypto ETF continues, Remittix (RTX) keeps creating waves in the crypto payment area with its impressive PayFi platform, which could reshape the whole sector. Keep reading to learn more. Dogecoin Starts The Week With A Bearish Momentum The Dogecoin price recently dropped as selling pressure rose following a sharp rejection at the $0.42 resistance. Following an 8% intraday rise, Dogecoin is currently resting at the $0.32 support and has total weekly losses almost equal 13%. With almost $3.7 billion worth of DOGE exchanged across exchanges in the past 24 hours, Dogecoin's volume increased by over 160%, as short orders stacked up. Even with the present downturn, holders are optimistic since Dogecoin is still a possible leader given its great popularity in the crypto industry. Especially considering that it is a relevant meme coin ETF. Renowned expert Ali Martinez forecasts a significant 4,101% increase for Dogecoin should DOGE ETFs be approved, hence driving its price to a double-digit valuation. More conservative projections, meantime, point to money aimed at the $1 level as the next important turning point. Meanwhile, more conservative estimates are currency targeting the $1 level as the next critical milestone. Solana Dips Below $230 Before A Bounce Follows Solana is also feeling major volatility since its down momentum from the past weekend was carried over. Solana is currently trading at $233 after an 8.5% drop over the past 24 hours. The token hit the $222 bottom momentarily, but this is where buyers intervened, punishing late shorters and returning the price above $230. Regarding the Solana ETF, uncertainty remains since the SEC turned down the first applications from VanEck and BitWise among other fund managers. Conversely, some analysts think Solana ETFs may see the light by the end of this year with Donald Trump advocating a pro-crypto legislative overhaul and changes in leadership. Why Remittix Is Taking Over The Headlines In January Remittix (RTX) is reinventing global payments and providing quick and reasonably priced cross-border solutions. From their 2017 worth of roughly $150 trillion to $250 trillion, cross-border payments are expected to have increased by 2027. Remittix is acquiring market share in this huge sector and creating a seamless and efficient solution for worldwide transactions by combining the strength of blockchain technology with traditional banking infrastructure. Remittix lets users quickly swap more than forty top crypto coins for fiat money. These then might be transferred immediately to any bank account anywhere. Remittix is unique in simplicity. Unaware that it started as a cryptocurrency payment, recipients get a regular bank transfer. Its innovative elements let customers manage their money entirely under control and flexibility. Remittix is the better alternative to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise as a link between crypto and FIAT; crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Remittixguarantees accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and more than 30 fiat currencies, therefore simplifying world business with its wide selection of choices. Thanks to Remittix's Pay API, companies may now accept client bitcoin payments and handle fiat transactions to a designated bank account. Furthermore notable is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and clarity over high costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. Remittix is a game-changer in the payments sector where dubious methods sadly are all too widespread as this method ensures that the whole amount transmitted reaches the recipient. At $0.0479 in its presale, the RTX token has a strong investing value. Forecasts show notable increase; demand for creative cross-border payment solutions is driving a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 5,000% gains following launch.

Amidst a rapid increase in institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, the market is abuzz with activity. Many financial giants are submitting ETF applications to regulatory bodies, and Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are currently among the most enticing options available. While there is plenty of talk about the next crypto ETF, Remittix (RTX) is making significant waves in the crypto payment space with its groundbreaking PayFi platform, which has the potential to transform the entire industry. Read on to find out more. Dogecoin Kicks Off The Week With Bearish Trends Dogecoin's price recently declined due to increased selling pressure after it faced a strong rejection at the $0.42 resistance level. Following an 8% rise in a single day, Dogecoin now sits at the $0.32 support level, with nearly 13% losses over the past week. With about $3.7 billion worth of DOGE being traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours, Dogecoin's trading volume surged by more than 160%, driven by a surge in short orders. Despite the current downturn, investors remain hopeful as Dogecoin continues to be a prominent player in the crypto market, especially as a potential meme coin ETF. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez predicts a massive 4,101% increase for Dogecoin if DOGE ETFs receive approval, potentially pushing its price to double digits. More cautious projections, in the meantime, are eyeing the $1 mark as the next significant milestone. Solana Falls Below $230 Before A Rebound Solana is experiencing significant volatility, continuing its downward trend from the weekend. Currently, Solana is trading at $233 after an 8.5% decrease in the last 24 hours. The token briefly touched $222, but buyers stepped in, punishing late shorters and driving the price back above $230. When it comes to the Solana ETF, uncertainty lingers as the SEC has rejected initial applications from VanEck and BitWise along with other fund managers. On the other hand, some analysts believe Solana ETFs might get the green light by the end of the year, especially with Donald Trump pushing for pro-crypto legislative changes and shifts in leadership. What's Making Remittix The Talk Of The Town In January Remittix (RTX) is revolutionizing global payments, offering fast and affordable cross-border solutions. Cross-border payments, valued around $150 trillion in 2017, are anticipated to rise to $250 trillion by 2027.

While Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) dominate the market, this new token offers a rare chance to experience exponential returns. A Strong Start for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Within minutes of its presale launch, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million, solidifying its position as a standout in 2025. Capped at 100 billion tokens, ensuring limited supply and creating sustained demand. Exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , early investors have a unique opportunity to secure this high-potential token before prices climb further. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stands Against Major Cryptos Cardano (ADA, $0.30): Cardano has built a reputation for steady development but lacks the momentum seen in new projects like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN, which promises faster adoption and potentially higher value growth. SEI ($0.12): SEI shows promise in the DeFi space but has struggled with slower adoption rates. THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers a faster trajectory, making it an appealing choice for investors seeking transformative opportunities. Polkadot (DOT, $4.22): Polkadot was once a symbol of early-stage explosive growth, but its momentum has slowed. THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN reflects the early potential that once made DOT a hit, presenting a new opportunity for substantial rewards. Why You Should Act Now Analysts predict that THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN could deliver exponential value, with returns reaching up to 100,000%. Its limited availability, deflationary model, and strong early performance set it apart as a top investment for 2025.

In a live broadcast, Hoskinson shared his frustration with the creation of a meme token in his name, which quickly gained traction and was traded heavily in the crypto market. Hoskinson explained that during a demonstration, he inadvertently exposed his backup wallet and, unfortunately, the crypto community saw this as an opportunity to send him tokens. One of those tokens, the “Charles” token, became particularly popular, with its market value skyrocketing in a single day. In total, Hoskinson found himself holding a staggering 900 billion of these tokens, which he deemed worthless due to the lack of liquidity. Instead of ignoring the situation, he decided to take matters into his own hands and burn the entire supply of the token. Using a script developed with the help of his team, he transferred all the tokens to a burner address, effectively destroying them. The burn transaction was completed live on the stream, with Hoskinson humorously acknowledging that he had just wiped out $80 million in book value. He remarked that it cost him just 1.42 ADA to destroy the tokens and that it was his way of demonstrating his incorruptibility, stating that he would never try to profit from the situation. https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1zqKVYdZXQZxB Hoskinson’s bold move was a statement against the unpredictable and often chaotic nature of the cryptocurrency space, as well as a reminder to the community that certain actions, like creating unsolicited tokens come with consequences. The Cardano founder wrapped up the broadcast with a message: “Don’t do that again.”",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ADA|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 16:01:53

This new coin could offer similar potential,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/imagine-if-you-had-put-1000-into-dogecoin-five-years-ago-this-new-coin-could-offer-similar-potential,"Just 5 years ago, the world’s biggest meme coin was trading for fractions of a cent. Now Dogecoin is worth around $0.34. That’s life-changing gains - but how much exactly? And where is the next big meme coin opportunity? How Much Would $1000 In 2020 Dogecoin Be Worth Today? Dogecoin turned nine last month, but if you’d invested $1000 in it just five years ago, your Doge would be worth approximately $2.3M now. That’s around a 230,000% increase. Many crypto holders believe that Doge has room to grow, with some predicting Doge to $10. That’s an ambitious target given the size of the coin. Especially since that would put Dogecoin at a market cap of $1.47 Trillion - almost half the market cap of the entire cryptocurrency industry. Still, let's consider, what could trigger such a catapult in value? If Dogecoin gets integrated into X, or even accepted as a form of payment by the US government (Thanks to Elon Musk’s involvement in the D.O.G.E) then this could push the price much higher. Today Bitwise also announced their filing for a Dogecoin ETF, so this could also help the price. Also, as crypto and bitcoin go much higher, it's possible that retail buyers will pile into DOGE again. Last bull run, that alone pushed the currency to double what it is worth now. But even if this all comes true and pushes the price of Dogecoin to $10, how much profit would you be making from the current price? Buying $1000 at today’s prices would result in a profit of around $28,000. This is a fantastic gain but it does rely on Dogecoin growing exponentially. If the coin simply repeats history (and goes to $0.72) then buyers would be looking at a profit of $1000 on top of their initial. Could Cuto Be The New Doge? There are many reasons for Doge’s long-term success, but one thing the coin has done really wellis to establish itself as a coin for the people. Those hoping to find similar potential to DOGE from 5 years ago, should consider a new meme and utility coin called Cutoshi. Cutoshi is inspired by the meme of the Chinese Lucky Cat, and also by the financial autonomy principles of Satoshi Nakamoto. Because of this dual focus, Cutoshi has the potential to unite people through fun and then retain them by giving them easy access to crypto and web3. That’s because Cutoshi is building a P2P dex to make on-chain trading easier, fun, and more private. And they are also going to offer a learning academy to help people who want to know more about the potential of DeFi. And many strategic partnerships are in the works. Cutoshi is currently in the fourth stage of the presale. Therefore it’s a bit like getting in on Doge in 2015, before the hype had grown to the level it is at now. Cutoshi is new but it already has a lot of community support, with over $1.65M raised already, and lots of artists and creators engaging with the coin. While it’s difficult to know exactly how big the project will go, the potential is there, especially since the coin is so new. CUTO currently has a market cap of around just $13.6M, so there is a lot of room to grow. If Cutoshi does even half as well as DOGE, then in the long run a $1000 investment would be worth around a million dollars.

Accordingly, Canadian asset management company Purpose Investments is preparing to launch the world's first Ripple (XRP) spot ETF. At this point, the company reported that it has filed a preliminary prospectus for its XRP ETF with Canadian securities regulators. The company stated that the aim of the Ripple ETF is to invest a significant portion of its assets in long-term XRP holdings and provide long-term capital growth opportunities to holders of ETF Units. Som Seif, founder and CEO of Purpose Investments, said the following about the application: “At Purpose, we are steadfast in our commitment to innovation and bridging the gap between traditional and decentralized finance. As XRP adoption and institutional interest grows, we believe an ETF could offer investors a transparent and familiar way to access it within a regulated framework. “This launch represents another important step in our efforts to be the leading and most trusted partner for investors by enabling investors to understand, access and invest in these assets with confidence, enabling them to reap the benefits of crypto and digital assets.” Purpose Investments previously launched the world's first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. *This is not investment advice.

Is This a Dead Cat Bounce?,https://coingape.com/markets/pepe-coin-price-bounces-back-30-is-this-a-dead-cat-bounce/,"Pepe coin price has risen by 30% for three consecutive days. This rebound coincided with more upside of Bitcoin, which rose above $105,000 after the Federal Reserve interest rate decision. While some analysts expect that Pepe will keep rising, there is a risk that this may be a dead cat bounce. Pepe Coin Price is Rising, But This May Be a Dead Cat Bounce Pepe, the third-biggest meme coin, has bounced back after bottoming at $0.00001132 earlier this week. Still, the coin remains about 50% below its highest point in 2024. There is also a risk that the ongoing recovery is part of a dead cat bounce (DCB). A DCB is when a falling asset stages a brief comeback and then resumes the downward trend. It is commonly known as bull trap and is common during a bear market. The risk that this is a dead cat bounce is also because the coin has formed a series of higher lows and lower lows. Therefore, a dead cat bounce will be invalidated if the Pepe coin price rises above the 50-day moving average and the upper side of the falling channel. A break above these levels will point to more Pepe price gains, potentially to the all-time high of $0.00002830, about 100% above the current level. That bullish view is justified by the fact that the coin has formed what looks like a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart. On the other hand, a drop below the key support at $0.00001132 will validate the view that the ongoing recovery is part of a dead cat bounce. It will also invalidate the bullish flag view and point to more downside to the support at $0.0000060, its lowest point in 2024. Pepe Coin Price Analyst Sees Pepe Price Surging to $0.000032 A potential catalyst for the Pepe coin price is that some analysts are optimistic that it will jump soon. In an X post , one analyst cited the bullish flag pattern mentioned above. He predicted that it will soar to $0.000032, up by 125% from the current level. His view is that the token’s lowest level this week marked a bottom. Further, the value of Pepe and the futures open interest are diverging. The interest has remained steady, while the price has fallen, a potential bullish sign. Pepe Open Interest Another reason for a Pepe price forecast is that there are emerging signs that whales are accumulating the coin. Whale purchases are often bullish for a coin since these are highly sophisticated investors. The post Pepe Coin Price Bounces Back 30%.

Ethereum ( ETH ) price has struggled for upside momentum as Bitcoin (BTC) hit new all-time high above $108k. However, Trump-backed World Liberty Financial has emerged as one of the top buyers of Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market capitalization. After purchasing $47 million worth of Ethereum on Trump’s inauguration day, the decentralized finance project has now acquired an additional $10 million in two separate transactions. The latest purchase, made on January 31, saw World Liberty Financial spend 10 million USDT to acquire 2,972 Ethereum.

These include $225 million in ETH, $68 million in wrapped Bitcoin, and nearly $66 million in staked Ethereum. Ethereum price has gained by approximately 4.6% in the past 24 hours, trading to an intraday high of $3,420 on major crypto exchanges. However, despite the purchases, ETH remains largely stagnated below $4,000, having retreated from this level in mid-December 2024.

This increase has historically preceded price rallies. When the liquidity impulse grows, a rally usually follows. USDT’s 30D market cap just turned positive (after contracting -2%), while USDC is surging 20%—its fastest pace in a year. If stablecoin momentum continues, higher prices may be next. pic.twitter.com/fD8sQkKSKM — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 30, 2025 According to data from CryptoQuant , stablecoin liquidity has increased since the U.S. presidential election, with major stablecoins like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC leading the expansion. Market Cap Hits Record High Amid Growing Liquidity The total value of USD-denominated stablecoins reached an all-time high of $200 billion last week. Since then, it has grown further to $204 billion, representing an increase of $37 billion since November 4. CryptoQuant reports that this surge in stablecoin liquidity reflects growing investor confidence, which has historically catalyzed crypto market upswings. The expansion has been primarily driven by Tether’s USDT, the dominant stablecoin in the market. However, USDC, which had been losing market share, is now regaining traction. A growing stablecoin supply often indicates increased buying power for traders, fueling demand for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Another key indicator of market liquidity , according to CryptoQuant, is the volume of stablecoins held on centralized exchanges. The total value of USDT on these platforms has risen from $30.5 billion on November 4 to $43 billion, an increase of about 41% ($12.5 billion). More stablecoins on exchanges show that traders have large amounts of capital on hand to deploy into crypto assets. Such liquidity inflows have often preceded major price rallies, as traders convert stablecoins into volatile assets to seek gains. USDT and USDC Lead the Stablecoin Expansion Stablecoin liquidity impulse, measured as the 30-day percentage change in market capitalization, has turned positive. CryptoQuant analysts suggest this may signal an upward move in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. USDT’s liquidity impulse had been contracting by 2% at the beginning of 2024 but has now turned slightly positive, hinting at an uptick in crypto demand. Meanwhile, USDC’s liquidity impulse has expanded by 20%, the fastest growth rate in at least a year. Tether’s USDT remains the dominant player, with its market capitalization reaching $139 billion, increasing by $19 billion (15%) since November 4. Meanwhile, USDC has experienced a strong comeback, increasing by $17 billion (48%) over the same period to reach a market cap of $52.5 billion. The increase in liquidity and trading capital has historically coincided with crypto market rallies. If past trends continue, an expanding stablecoin supply may contribute to increased market activity in Bitcoin and other digital assets .

Grayscale argues that DOGE has evolved from a simple memecoin featuring a Shiba Inu dog into a legitimate financial instrument. “Grayscale believes that DOGE has evolved from a memecoin into a vehicle for global financial inclusion, grassroots activism, and viable payment,” the company said in a statement. The firm cited DOGE’s accessibility, affordability, and high transaction speeds as factors contributing to its global adoption. Originally founded as a joke in 2013, DOGE runs on the Dogecoin network, which was forked from Litecoin, a derivative of Bitcoin. Related News: Analytics Firm Warns For Bitcoin: “If Bitcoin Hits ATH and Altcoins Follow the Bull...” Grayscale’s move comes as DOGE gained momentum following the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under US President Donald Trump. The White House unit, led by Tesla CEO and longtime DOGE supporter Elon Musk, is reportedly exploring blockchain-based federal systems. Potential applications include tracking government spending, managing infrastructure and facilitating payments, but discussions are still in the early stages. The Dogecoin Trust launch comes amid growing interest in a potential DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF). Earlier this week, crypto asset manager Bitwise filed an S-1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a spot Dogecoin ETF. Osprey Funds and Rex Shares have also filed similar proposals. So could a Dogecoin ETF launch in 2024? “I think everything is on the table under the new management,” said ETF Store President Nate Geraci. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas echoed this sentiment, saying, “Today’s humor is tomorrow’s ETF.” *This is not investment advice.

The developers announced that the new deadline for completing the verification process will be February 28. This marks the third time the deadline has been extended. The developers noted that the extension will allow as many pioneers as possible to conduct the KYC process and migrate their tokens to the mainnet. Pioneers who do not complete the process by February 28 will only be able to migrate tokens mined in the past six months, forfeiting the rest. The developers noted that the KYC delay will not affect migration to the Open Network or the mainnet. They still expect the transition from the enclosed mainnet to the public mainnet to occur in the first quarter.

Pi Network is a cryptocurrency project that aims to improve upon existing digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ). It offers an easy-to-use interface that enables users to mine Pi coins, which they will be able to convert into fiat currency after the mainnet launch. The project also hopes to gain acceptance among retailers and e-commerce platforms worldwide. Technicals point to more Pi Network price downside PI Network chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart indicates that Pi coin remains at risk of further declines. The price has fallen below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling that bears remain in control. The coin has also formed a bearish pennant pattern, a historically negative technical indicator. Additionally, Pi has dropped below a key support level at $43.21, its lowest swing point in November and December last year. It has also moved below the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Given these factors, the coin is likely to continue declining, with sellers targeting last year’s low of $29.35, representing a 32% drop from current levels. A move above the key resistance at $50 would invalidate the bearish outlook. Editor’s note: The Pi coin offered by HTX and is not affiliated by the main Pi project.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF filing fuels $1 speculation, while Panshibi emerges as the next viral meme coin. Table of Contents Can Dogecoin reach $1 with the Bitwise ETF filing? Panshibi: A fun and rewarding meme coin Dogecoin has always been the underdog that somehow keeps surprising everyone. Now, with Bitwise filing for a Dogecoin ETF, people are asking the big question: could this finally push DOGE to $1? It’s not just hype; a crypto ETF can bring in serious investors who wouldn’t normally touch meme coins. Meanwhile, a new player named Panshibi (SHIBI) is making waves in the crypto community. Panshibi offers a new and engaging experience that goes beyond typical crypto investments. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, investors are closely monitoring these developments, particularly those interested in top altcoins and Doge price prediction. Can Dogecoin reach $1 with the Bitwise ETF filing? Dogecoin is currently priced at $0.3241, which is about three times less than the $1 many of its holders hope for. Despite being the top meme coin with a market cap of over $48 billion, the Dogecoin price took a hit this week due to a dip in the crypto market. The coin dropped by 9.7% this week, delaying its rise above the $0.4 mark, which it briefly reached on January 18. However, Dogecoin has grown by over 317% in the last year, showing strong growth overall. Many are still hopeful, especially with Bitwise’s recent filing for a DOGE ETF, which suggests growing mainstream interest in Dogecoin. Although Dogecoin could see a boost from wider mainstream adoption if the DOGE ETF is approved, it’s uncertain whether reaching $1 is realistic in the near future. Achieving this would require a significant surge in buying interest and overall growth in the cryptocurrency market. Dogecoin recently moved above its 50-day EMA, a key indicator for traders, showing potential for more growth. It’s also known for being used in fast and affordable payments, with upgrades like Hydra aiming to make transactions even quicker and cheaper. Despite its growth, Dogecoin faces challenges. The project price is mainly driven by speculation, and it doesn’t have many real-world uses outside of its community. For Dogecoin to break $2, the token would need to be used in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi). As for the DOGE price prediction, experts are divided, but many see its future as tied to wider adoption and use.

This stability could attract serious investors who have seen meme coins rise and fall, and reduce the risk of sudden sell-offs. Right now, Panshibi is in its presale phase, giving early investors a chance to buy at a low price. The project plans to distribute 60% of its total supply (1.2 billion tokens) during presale, ensuring fair access. Once the presale ends, control of the token will be fully handed over to the community. The presale is moving fast, with a pricing model that rewards early buyers. Investors also get access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club, which offers perks like giveaways and early access to future projects. Panshibi aims to mix fun with real accountability. Its 60-day presale is split into multiple phases, starting at $0.002 per token and is now currently at the second stage of presale at $0.003. The project raised $45,000 on its first day and has already passed $250,000 in a few days. If Panshibi continues to grow, the token could become one of the top altcoins in the meme coin market.

As uncertainty grows, investors are increasingly turning to altcoins to diversify portfolios and capitalize on potential growth opportunities. Against this backdrop, Finbold analyzed market trends and consulted ChatGPT-4o , which identified two altcoins with strong growth potential in the current market landscape. Solana (SOL) Solana ( SOL ) continues to be a dominant player in the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) and trading ecosystem, making it an attractive investment for traders and institutional investors. With its retail-first approach, low transaction fees, and high-speed execution, Solana has captured 50% of the decentralized exchange ( DEX ) market share, according to the OKX State of DEXs 2025 report . Solana’s dominance in DEX and meme coin trading gained widespread attention when Donald Trump’s meme coin launch ignited a market frenzy just days before his inauguration, propelling SOL to a record high of $295. Looking ahead, a combination of macroeconomic developments and ecosystem expansion could significantly shape Solana’s trajectory. The potential approval of a spot Solana exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) stands out as a key catalyst that could attract institutional liquidity and further legitimize Solana as a mainstream investment asset. Bitwise, VanEck, and 21Shares have all filed for Solana ETFs through the Cboe BZX Exchange, a move that, if approved, would position Solana alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) in traditional financial markets. From a tech nical point of view, Solana’s current market structure suggests an ongoing uptrend, with analysts eyeing a potential 100% surge if support levels hold. SOL one-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the press time, SOL is trading at $238.29, down 1.7% in the last 24 hours. However, on the monthly chart, SOL remains up 25%, signaling sustained bullish momentum despite short-term fluctuations. With growing institutional interest and dominance in DEX trading, Solana remains a compelling buy for traders looking to capitalize on its long-term potential. Jito (JTO) Solana-based liquid staking protocol Jito ( JTO ) has secured a spot in Grayscale Research’s ‘Top 20’ list of tokens for Q1 2025, citing its strong market position and growth potential. Jito’s total value locked (TVL) has climbed to $3.837 billion, indicating increased capital inflows, while data from Token Terminal shows the protocol has generated over $280 million in fees, a sign of rising network activity. JTO one-day price chart. Source: Finbold Technical analysis also paints a bullish picture, with Jito hitting a $1 billion market cap , in line with projections from Finbold. Currently trading at $3.47 and posting a 2.7% gain over the past 24 hours, JTO presents a compelling investment opportunity for long-term growth in 2025. With robust fundamentals, growing institutional support, and expanding ecosystems, these assets are well-positioned for exponential growth, making them valuable additions to a diversified cryptocurrency portfolio.

Reports indicate that WLFI recently purchased 2,971.45 ETH, valued at approximately $9.97 million, bringing its total Ethereum holdings to over 70,157 ETH. The organization has been steadily acquiring ETH since January 15, with consistent daily purchases. World Liberty Financial Continues Large-Scale Ethereum Purchases World Liberty Financial’s latest purchase of $10 million in Ethereum has increased its holdings to 70,157 ETH, worth approximately $235 million. The project’s aggressive accumulation strategy has contributed to growing market interest in Ethereum. Data from SpotOnChain shows that WLFI has been buying ETH daily, adding pressure to the market supply. The project’s total crypto assets now exceed $388 million, with Ethereum representing a significant portion of its portfolio. Donald Trump’s WLF has been on a spree of accumulating cryptocurrencies, with a recent CoinGape report highlighting its $109.1 million investment in six digital assets. The WLF allocated $71.5 million to Ethereum, acquiring 21,425 ETH at an average price of $3,337, alongside purchases of WBTC, TRX, AAVE, LINK, and ENA. This aggressive accumulation strategy has fueled market activity, driving price surges across multiple tokens. Ethereum Breaks Key Downtrend, Signals Bullish Momentum Notably, Ethereum has recently broken above a key descending trendline, which has acted as resistance for months. This breakout follows multiple failed attempts, indicating a shift in market sentiment. Analysts suggest that if ETH maintains its position above the resistance-turned-support zone, further price gains could follow. A chart shared by analyst Lark Davis highlights Ethereum’s breakout, supported by increased volume. The analyst pointed out that February has historically been a strong month for ETH, suggesting that the current price action could lead to sustained bullish momentum. Source: X Analysts Predict ETH Price Could Reach $4,000 Market experts anticipate that Ethereum could rally toward $4,500 in the coming weeks. Ted Pillows noted that ETH has entered an expansion phase after consolidating between $3,100 and $3,250. If ETH price secures a daily close above $3,344, analysts expect a move toward the $4,000–$4,500 range. On-chain data also shows that World Liberty Financial’s continued buying pressure has helped stabilize ETH price, reinforcing bullish market sentiment. Analysts believe that as WLFI maintains its aggressive ETH accumulation, the asset could see further upward momentum. Despite the bullish outlook, some analysts warn of a potential short-term correction. The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a key indicator of market sentiment, has dropped below the 160-day moving average. Historically, this metric has signaled market downturns, with previous instances leading to corrections of up to 40%. Source: X Moreover, the recent World Liberty Financial purchases have led to speculations of ETH becoming part of the U.S. national digital reserves, further fueling bullish sentiment. Analysts predict that if Ethereum secures a spot in the reserve, its price could skyrocket to $10,000 and beyond. At press time, Ethereum (ETH) price is $3,395, marking a 4% increase over the past 24 hours. The price action shows a significant upward trend, with ETH surging from $3,263 earlier in the day to a peak of $3,394.

The company, which issues the largest stablecoin, USDT, generated $6 billion in profit in the last quarter of the year. Tether’s total assets stood at $143.7 billion, with excess reserves growing to $7 billion. The company’s latest financial attestation, verified by accounting firm BDO Italy, revealed that a large portion of the profits came from U.S. Treasuries and unrealized gains on Bitcoin and gold holdings. Tether also increased its Bitcoin holdings to nearly 84,000 BTC by the end of 2024. Bitcoin and Gold Drive Tether’s Profits Stablecoin issuer Tether has reported that its $13 billion profit came from multiple sources, with Bitcoin and gold appreciation playing a key role. Around $5 billion of the total profit resulted from the rising value of these assets. The remaining $7 billion came from returns on U.S. Treasuries and repurchase agreements. The company increased its Bitcoin holdings in Q4 2024, marking its first such move since March. By the end of the year, Tether held around 84,000 BTC, worth approximately $7.8 billion. The firm’s U.S. Treasury holdings also rose to $94.5 billion, reinforcing its asset reserves. USDT Issuance and Growing Market Presence Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, saw significant issuance in 2024, with $45 billion issued throughout the year. In the fourth quarter alone, the company issued $23 billion in new USDT tokens. The total market capitalization of USDT reached $140 billion, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. USDT remains a crucial part of the crypto market, particularly in emerging economies. Tether reported that its stablecoin now has 400 million users worldwide, with most adoption occurring in developing regions. The company continues to expand USDT’s role in payments, remittances, and savings. Regulatory Challenges and European Market Restrictions Despite its growth, Stablecoin issuer Tether faces regulatory hurdles, particularly in Europe. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations have led to the delisting of USDT from several exchanges. Crypto.com recently announced it would remove USDT and nine other tokens from its European platform by January 31, 2025. MiCA regulations require stablecoins to have an e-money license to operate in the European Economic Area (EEA). Tether has not received such authorization, leading to increased scrutiny. Several other exchanges, including Coinbase, delisted USDT in 2024 for similar reasons. Users on affected platforms have until March 31, 2025, to convert USDT into MiCA-compliant assets. Tether’s Plans and Expansion into New Sectors The USDT issuer continues to expand beyond stablecoins, with plans to enter new industries in 2025. The company announced upcoming projects in artificial intelligence, telecommunications, and financial services. Tether also aims to enhance crypto payments and remittances by integrating USDT with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network . Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino emphasized the company’s focus on innovation, stating, “Our goal is to offer practical solutions for remittances, payments, and other financial applications that demand both speed and reliability.” The integration with the Lightning Network is expected to improve USDT transaction speed and lower fees, benefiting global users. Concurrently, as per earlier reports, as part of its expansion strategy, Tether recently announced plans to move its headquarters to El Salvador.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao believes the European Union needs Bitcoin, contradicting Christine Lagarde’s assertion that the EU will never include it in its reserve. CZ’s Bitcoin Endorsement Ignites Hope In a recent X post , Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao, also known as “CZ,” stated, “EU needs Bitcoin.” His words sparked widespread attention as it followed ECB President Christine Lagarde’s controversial decision on the BTC reserve. In response to CZ’s comments, many pointed out the importance of the European Union including the crypto asset in its reserve. According to crypto proponents including CZ, Bitcoin is a necessity for the EU, and not a choice. Embracing the Future: Why the EU Needs BTC While the ECB disregards Bitcoin as a secure asset, industry experts see the asset as the future of finance. Donald Trump intends to turn his country into a “Bitcoin superpower” and a crypto capital . Corroborating CZ’s bold statement, experts highlighted BTC’s potential in a world facing the devaluation of the traditional finance system. As inflation surges and central banks exert unprecedented control, the fiat system is crumbling. While this creates havoc, experts see Bitcoin as the only solution. Crypto enthusiasts have fired back at Lagarde’s assertion that the asset isn’t secure, pointing out that BTC has never been hacked. They argue that Bitcoin boasts the most secure computer code ever written. This bold statement is grounded in its robust security architecture, which leverages its decentralized design, advanced cryptography, and the most secure blockchain infrastructure. This signifies that Changpeng Zhao’s endorsement of Bitcoin is echoed by the entire cryptocurrency community. Will ECB Reconsider Its Skeptical Approach? In a recent development, ECB President Christine Lagarde expressed her opposition to the adoption of a BTC reserve. She asserted that the EU would never acquire the cryptocurrency to diversify its national reserve. According to Lagarde, BTC falls short of the required standards for liquidity, security, and safety. However, the ECB’s skeptical view on the digital currency has drawn criticism, with many urging the central bank to reconsider its approach. Criticizing Lagarde’s decision, Pierre Rochard, VP of Research at Riot Platforms, stated, “ECB needs a new president who understands bitcoin.” Crypto advocates believe that once the US successfully adopts Bitcoin as a reserve asset, the rest of the world, including Europe, will recognize its importance and follow suit. Changpeng Zhao’s bold claim has further sparked optimism on Bitcoin’s potential global recognition.

Table of Contents Ethereum draws closer to bullish season, Miles Deutscher says Ali Martinez projects a $15 price turn for Dogecoin amid ETF filing Massive bullish breakout for Elluminex DeFi hub on TON Network Conclusion While the crypto market is generally struggling with a notable downtrend, price charts of some popular altcoins are showing bullish prospects. For instance, Ethereum investors are getting ready for the potential growth of the token as February draws closer, empirically the best month for an Ethereum rally. On the other hand, Dogecoin is set to rally amid news of Bitwise Dogecoin ETF filing. Meanwhile, the Elluminex (ELX) project is making significant inroads into the crypto industry with smart use cases on the TON blockchain. So far, thousands of investors have bought the presale as the project’s economic trajectory is set to reach huge value growth by the end of Q1. You might also like: Ethereum’s 2017 run was legendary; Elluminex aims to be next Ethereum draws closer to bullish season, Miles Deutscher says Ethereum may be struggling to record a significant rally, but empirical stats show the token may be approaching its most bullish month in history. As crypto analyst Miles Deutscher highlighted, the Ethereum token has recorded significant growth in February, with 8 of the last 9 February months seeing a bullish trajectory. Also, market stats show that Ethereum’s market volume has seen a significant uptrend in daily percentage growth, suggesting a growing momentum from investors. Looking at the stats, Ethereum will likely record another bullish February, making it a good investment option. Technical analysis from Tradingview shows that the Ethereum price is above the 50-day and 200-day EMA, with over 20 indicators flashing buy signals. The Ethereum market sentiment is bullish as it moves to break through the $2500 major resistance zone. A breakthrough might see Ether retest the $4000 mark, which it tested in December. Ali Martinez projects a $15 price turn for Dogecoin amid ETF filing A crypto analyst, Ali_Charts, is confident that Dogecoin’s ETF will see the meme coin reach a price value of $15. He made this known in an X post in response to the news of a Bitwise Dogecoin ETF filling. According to sources, Bitwise and Rex Osprey have separately filed for Dogecoin ETF within the past two days, raising significant bullish prospects for the token. According to the market chart, Dogecoin’s price is bullish, gaining 8% within the past month. With news of potential ETF, Dogecoin will likely surge towards the ATH of $0.73, which has stood since May 2021. Popular crypto analyst John Squire thinks that the Dogecoin crypto price can hit $2. While John believes that meme coins have what it takes to witness massive growth, the forecaster questions the sustainability of such growth. Meanwhile, Dogecoin technical indicators are green, and the Fear and Greed index is 75 (Greed). Once it breaks through the $0.40, it could target new heights. Massive bullish breakout for Elluminex DeFi hub on TON Network Elluminex is introducing a DeFi solution that will propel the TON Network to become a key player in the DeFi industry. The TON blockchain lacks a bridge protocol that will allow its users to trade assets across multiple blockchains. This has isolated the over 950+ million TON users to just within the blockchain. With Elluminex, TON users can trade, stake, bridge, and track their portfolios across multiple blockchains. Elluminex is bringing a DeFi solution similar to the one that Uniswap brought on the Ethereum blockchain, and PancakeSwap brought to Binance Smart Chain. The DEX is optimized to handle the millions of transactions that will be executed on the TON Network.

On Thursday, the Czech National Bank (CNB) said it would start analyzing the prospects of introducing additional asset classes to its reserve, and many indicated that BTC was among those. Czech Central Bank Ready to Hodl Bitcoin “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for Bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people,” Michl said . He acknowledged the move is unconventional and not without risks. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle, or the pioneer,” the central bank chief said. “I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say. I like profitability.” But he iterated that the point of adding Bitcoin is not to go whole-hog, the way El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele has, for example. Instead, the move would be a modest one to diversify the Czech bank’s holdings. “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value… But I’m saying that my goal is to diversify the portfolio, so if bitcoin is good, then let’s have it.” Speaking to a CNN international affiliate earlier in the month, Michl mentioned the bank was looking into acquiring “a few Bitcoin.” Sen.

Tether, the issuer of crypto’s biggest stablecoin ( USDT ), generated $13 billion in profits last year amid soaring digital asset adoption and a new all-time high in U.S. Treasury Bills held as reserves for its token. On Friday, Jan 31, the company’s quarterly attestation provided by independent accounting firm BDO Italia showed $94.5 billion worth of T-Bills, a new record. Tether generated $7 billion in profits from its U.S. Treasury holdings and another $5 billion in unrealized earnings from Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold investments. Late last year, Tether increased its Bitcoin holdings to approximately 84,000 Bitcoin, valued at nearly $8 billion. This marked its first Bitcoin purchase since March.

On Jan. 31, Cronos Labs announced that LayerZero ( ZRO ) was now live on the Cronos’ ( CRO ) EVM-compatible and zero-knowledge proofs mainnets. This integration allows developers on Cronos to build bridges connecting to more than 115 blockchains, including Ethereum and Solana. Cronos EVM users can now transfer assets between the Cosmos SDK-powered chain and multiple EVM-compatible chains. The platform is also interoperable with the Solana ecosystem.

Aptos’ native token, APT, is up on the news , surging by 5.5% in the past 24 hours. The 38th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $7.91 at time of writing. Coinbase, the top US crypto exchange, has already added Aptos-native USDC to its listing roadmap. In November, Aptos first announced that it planned to integrate USDC, as well as the fintech giant Stripe’s payment services. Stripe will provide a fiat on-ramp for the Aptos network. The payments firm reemerged in the crypto sector in October when it rolled out support for USDC settlements. It had previously enabled payments made using Bitcoin ( BTC ) until 2018, when the firm discontinued its support, citing BTC’s lack of utility as a payments rail. Native USDC stablecoins are officially issued by Circle and are redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. USDC is the second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of more than $53 billion, second only to Tether’s USDT, which has a market cap of nearly $140 billion. Despite its gains in the past day, APT remains down by more than 5% in the past seven days and more than 10% in the past month.

XRP accelerates global payments with fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Solana powers Web3 innovation with blazing speed and scalability. Hedera improves enterprise adoption with sustainability and cutting-edge governance. Meanwhile, there’s also PlutoChain , a new project that could redefine Bitcoin’s potential with Layer-2 scalability and smart contract integration. We’ll look at each project’s strengths and what makes them stand out. Ripple (XRP) Is Still the Go-To Choice for Fast, Affordable Cross-Border Transactions XRP is trading at roughly $3.14, with a market cap of approximately $177 billion and a circulating supply of 57.56 billion tokens. Over the past 24 hours, XRP’s price has dipped by around 5%, which brings it closer to the $3 threshold. The XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange continues to show impressive growth in Total Value Locked (TVL). By June 2024, AMMs on the XRP Ledger surpassed 15.6 million XRP in TVL. Currently, XRP’s RSI sits at 50, which means market conditions are neutral. The SEC’s appeal of the XRP court ruling has introduced some uncertainty to the market, but Ripple remains undeterred. Ripple has also rolled out RLUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, and is making strides toward going public. Meanwhile, the growing number of exchange listings is improving XRP’s accessibility for traders and institutions. Analysts are optimistic. For instance, CryptoBull forecasts that XRP could reach $13 in the near future. Solana (SOL) Is the High-Performance Blockchain for Web3 Innovation Solana (SOL) is trading at around $269.38, with a market cap of approximately $131 billion. Over the past 24 hours, its price has jumped by 7.2%, contributing to an impressive 22.1% gain for the week. With a 24-hour trading volume of $11.38 billion, Solana is seeing strong market interest. The RSI is at 56, which means SOL is in the neutral zone. Institutional interest in Solana is growing rapidly, with major firms like VanEck filing for the first U.S. spot ETF linked to Solana and 21Shares pursuing approval for a Solana-based ETF. On the innovation side, Solana is fostering developer collaboration through its 2024 Hacker Houses, which takes place in global hubs like New York, Dubai, London, and Bengaluru. To tackle scalability challenges, Solana introduced Fire Dancer, a new validator client capable of handling 80,000 transactions per second (TPS) during testing. Analyst Armando Pantoja is optimistic about Solana’s future and predicts it could reach $1,000 by mid-2025. He highlights a recent 35% price surge, a breakout from a key technical pattern, and strong indicators backing the bullish outlook. Hedera (HBAR) Is the Sustainable Blockchain for Enterprise-Grade Applications As of January 24, 2025, Hedera (HBAR) is trading at around $0.3423, with a market cap of approximately $13.1 billion. Over the past 24 hours, its price has climbed 5.6%, adding to a 7.7% gain over the week. The RSI is at 42 right now, which puts HBAR in oversold territory. Last year, Canary Capital Group took a big step by filing for an HBAR exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. SEC. If approved, this ETF would provide investors with direct exposure to HBAR. Hedera’s Global Governing Council has allocated 4.86 billion HBAR — worth roughly $408 million — to accelerate ecosystem growth and strengthen decentralized governance. On top of that, Hedera is forging key partnerships to enhance its capabilities. Collaborations with major players like Nvidia and Chainlink are focused on integrating artificial intelligence and advanced data oracle solutions. Crypto analyst Bobby A has a bullish outlook on HBAR, pointing to a developing bull flag pattern. He predicts the token could hit its 4.236 Fibonacci extension level at $2.30, signaling significant upside potential. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Is a Layer-2 Solution That Could Give Bitcoin a Major Upgrade and Expand Its Influence Bitcoin faces persistent challenges like slow transactions, high fees, and network congestion. That’s where PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could come in. As a hybrid Layer-2 solution, it has the potential to tackle these challenges while staying true to Bitcoin’s core principles. PlutoChain could address one of Bitcoin’s biggest bottlenecks – its 10-minute block time. PlutoChain could offer block times of just 2 seconds, which rivals the speed of heavy hitters like Ethereum and Solana. Beyond speed, PlutoChain adds smart contract functionality, which could take Bitcoin beyond being a store of value but a platform for DeFi, NFTs, and even AI-powered applications. PlutoChain could also bridge the gap between Ethereum and Bitcoin with EVM compatibility , which could make it a breeze for developers to migrate their Ethereum-based projects into Bitcoin’s ecosystem. During testing, PlutoChain processed a whopping 43,200 transactions daily without a hitch. Security is another top priority — PlutoChain has undergone thorough audits by SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . It also performs regular code reviews and stress tests. PlutoChain’s governance model gives users the power to shape its future, whether it’s proposing upgrades, voting on partnerships, or suggesting new features. The Bottom Line XRP, Solana, Hedera, and PlutoChain each bring unique strengths to the table. XRP excels in cross-border payments with speed and affordability, while Solana leads in Web3 innovation through scalability and high performance. However, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might stand out as a hybrid Layer-2 solution that could bridge Bitcoin’s limitations and potentially bring new opportunities for the entire ecosystem. – – – This article is not financial advice.

Canadian Asset Manager Joins XRP Race Veteran Toronto-based asset management firm overseeing over $23 billion in assets has become the latest participant to jump on the spot XRP ETF race. Purpose Investments has filed a preliminary prospectus with Canadian securities regulators for the proposed Purpose Ripple exchange-traded fund. Purpose was arguably the first asset manager to introduce spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which debuted on the Toronto Stock Exchange in February and April 2021, respectively. Although XRP ETPs are already trading around the world, the company plans to follow its Bitcoin and Ethereum achievements by offering the world’s first spot XRP ETFs, as per the statement on Thursday. Purpose Investments founder and CEO Som Seif highlighted the increasing institutional appetite in XRP as a rationale for the ETF. “As XRP sees increasing adoption and institutional interest, we believe an ETF can offer investors a transparent and familiar way to access it within a regulated framework,” Seif opined. The Purpose Ripple ETF aims to invest all of its assets in long-term holdings of Ripple-promoted XRP and to provide holders of ETF Units with the opportunity for long-term capital appreciation without the hassle of holding the cryptocurrency directly. Canada vs. US The announcement came shortly after NYSE Arca submitted a 19b-4 filing to convert Grayscale’s XRP Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund, with Coinbase Custody as the custodian and BNY Mellon Asset Servicing acting as the transfer agency. Other asset managers, including WisdomTree , Canary Capital , 21Shares , and Bitwise , have also filed paperwork with the SEC to introduce spot XRP ETFs, pending regulatory approval. Financial services giant JPMorgan estimated an approved spot XRP ETF could attract up to $8 billion in net assets over the first year — a prediction Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said was a “pretty reasonable guess.” While the U.S.-based asset managers were the first to submit applications, Canada’s securities regulator generally greenlights crypto ETFs considerably faster compared to the U.S. SEC. Meanwhile, asset managers have also filed for spot Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and even Official Trump memecoin (TRUMP), with pundits saying issuers are testing what crypto products will be given the regulatory nod under the new pro-crypto Donald Trump-era SEC.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,XRP|BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-31 18:02:28

As per a statement, the regulator issued accelerated approval to Bitwise’s Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF just over a month after greenlighting similar products filed by Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. SEC Fast-Tracks Bitwise’s Bitcoin And Ethereum ETF The NYSE Arca officially filed to list and trade shares of Bitwise’s dual spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund on Nov. 26, 2024. The filing was published in the Federal Register on December 16, 2024, with an updated filing submitted last week. The investment vehicle aims to expose investors to Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ethereum in a single fund, weighted according to each crypto’s relative market capitalization — currently comprising 83% BTC and 17% ETH. The SEC approved the Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF on an “accelerated basis” after finding that the proposal bears similarities to spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETP proposals greenlighted in the past. “In particular, the Commission finds that the Proposal is consistent with Section 6 (b) (5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Exchange’s rules be designed to ‘prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and, ‘in general, to protect investors and the public interest,” the SEC notice adds. The Bitwise dual Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF will calculate the market cap of the two assets by multiplying the pricing benchmarks by their current circulating supplies, according to the filing. Notably, the fund’s net asset value will be calculated daily at 4:00 p.m. ET using price benchmarks that aggregate real-time trade data from leading crypto exchanges. The SEC’s approval signals a wider acceptance of digital assets under the new Donald Trump administration’s more industry-friendly position. “They approved in 45 days vs waiting 240 days. I really want to interpret this as a sign the new SEC will be faster, but no way to know really,” Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas observed in a post on X. While Bitwise’s combined Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF has cleared its first SEC hurdle, it still needs the agency’s approval of its S-1 registration statement before trading can officially start. More Crypto ETF Approvals More Likely Under New SEC Leadership Balchunas, meanwhile, believes a Litecoin ETF is next in line for SEC’s consideration. Regulatory uncertainty continues to cast doubt over the potential approval of Solana and XRP ETFs. Nonetheless, the SEC’s new leadership could create more favorable conditions for more crypto ETF approvals. On Jan. 30, Bitwise suggested that the current bull market could run into 2026 and beyond “with Washington embracing digital assets like never before.” “The path to full mainstream crypto adoption is clearer than ever,” it postulated.",Bitcoin|Ethereum|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-31 18:07:30

While Sui (SUI) is priced at $3.81 and showing Sui Bearish Trends, Remittix (RTX) is reaching new all-time highs with over $9,528,281.19 raised so far. Investors are comparing the two to see which might keep climbing or which might recover if the market shifts. Below is a closer look at why Sui (SUI) is under pressure and how Remittix (RTX) keeps setting daily records. Sui (SUI): A Promising Tech Facing a Slowdown Many believed Sui (SUI) would reshape the blockchain landscape with its novel object-centric data model and quick transactions. The network uses horizontal scaling and parallelized execution, letting developers build advanced dApps. At the same time, Sui (SUI) tries to lower barriers for users by offering zkLogin and other tools that simplify interactions. However, recent data suggests Sui Bearish Trends might continue if the token’s price fails to gain fresh momentum. Some watchers blame a dip in user enthusiasm or slower-than-expected adoption of new features like Sui Wallet. Others argue that Sui (SUI) remains a strong contender, but is overshadowed by coins with flashier marketing. Sui (SUI) Under Pressure The negative sentiment around Sui (SUI) isn’t guaranteed doom, but it does signal caution among traders. Some large holders appear to be reducing positions, possibly bracing for further drops if the hype doesn’t return soon. Even so, hardcore fans of Sui (SUI) insist that the token’s advanced architecture sets it apart, meaning its price could bounce back if a wave of new apps launches on the chain. Whether Sui (SUI) can reverse these Sui Bearish Trends soon might hinge on the network’s ability to attract more developers and everyday users. Remittix (RTX): Setting All-Time Highs Meanwhile, a fresh altcoin called Remittix (RTX) is stealing the show by breaking new all-time highs daily. With a price set to jump from $0.0456 to $0.0479, the project has sold 415,526,867.49 tokens and raised over $9,528,281.19. Backers say Remittix (RTX) focuses on cross-border payments in a practical way, letting people convert crypto into fiat around the world. Because it addresses a real-world challenge, Remittix has drawn buyers looking for a more predictable use case than pure speculation. Critics caution that many new tokens fizzle out if they don’t deliver, but so far, the team’s progress keeps fueling price gains. Potential Future for Sui and Remittix A few scenarios could play out in the near term. If Sui (SUI) pulls in developers who roll out must-have apps, the token might shake off the Sui Bearish Trends and bounce back. If adoption remains slow, though, more holders may jump ship for coins like Remittix (RTX) or other emerging projects. As for Remittix (RTX), it must show people that its payment solutions truly make cross-border remittances faster and cheaper. If it does, analysts say the token’s run might just be starting. A stumble, however, could send price gains tumbling as fast as they rose. Conclusion Right now, Sui (SUI) finds itself in a slump while Remittix (RTX) revels in a series of daily record highs. Whether Sui (SUI) can overcome Sui Bearish Trends might depend on fresh developer interest and real-world adoption of its tech. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is riding a wave of enthusiasm over cross-border payments, giving it a strong edge among new tokens. Both coins have compelling stories: Sui (SUI) with its next-gen blockchain model and Remittix (RTX) with its PayFi ambitions. As always, crypto investors must stay watchful; either token could reverse fortunes if market sentiment flips.

Sui (SUI) is currently valued at $3.81, displaying Sui Bearish Trends, while Remittix (RTX) continues to achieve unprecedented highs, having raised over $9,528,281.19 so far. Investors are weighing their options to determine which token might continue its ascent or rebound if market dynamics change. Here’s a detailed look at why Sui (SUI) is struggling and how Remittix (RTX) is consistently setting new benchmarks. Sui (SUI): Innovative Tech Experiencing a Decline Sui (SUI) was anticipated to revolutionize the blockchain space with its unique object-centric data model and rapid transaction capabilities. Its network features horizontal scaling and parallel execution, providing a platform for developers to create sophisticated dApps. Sui (SUI) also aims to lower entry barriers by integrating zkLogin and other user-friendly tools. However, recent metrics indicate that Sui Bearish Trends could persist unless the token finds renewed traction. Some analysts point to waning user interest or slower uptake of new features like Sui Wallet. Others believe Sui (SUI) still holds potential but is overshadowed by better-promoted competitors. Sui (SUI) Facing Challenges The negative outlook for Sui (SUI) doesn’t spell disaster, but it does prompt caution among traders. Some major stakeholders seem to be offloading shares, possibly preparing for further declines if excitement doesn’t reignite soon. Nevertheless, loyal supporters of Sui (SUI) argue that the token’s cutting-edge framework distinguishes it, suggesting a price rebound could occur if a surge of new applications emerges on the platform. The key to reversing these Sui Bearish Trends might lie in the network attracting more developers and regular users. Remittix (RTX): Achieving Unprecedented Highs In contrast, Remittix (RTX) is making headlines by setting new all-time highs each day. With its price set to increase from $0.0456 to $0.0479, the project has sold 415,526,867.49 tokens, raising over $9,528,281.19. Advocates say Remittix (RTX) offers a practical solution for cross-border payments, enabling global crypto-to-fiat conversions. This focus on addressing a tangible issue has attracted investors seeking a more reliable use case than mere speculation. Skeptics warn that many new tokens fail if they don’t deliver on promises, but so far, the team’s achievements continue to drive price increases. Possible Outlook for Sui and Remittix Several outcomes could unfold soon. If Sui (SUI) attracts developers who launch essential apps, the token might overcome the Sui Bearish Trends and recover. However, if growth remains sluggish, more investors might switch to coins like Remittix (RTX) or other emerging projects. For Remittix (RTX), it must prove that its financial solutions genuinely make cross-border transactions quicker and more affordable. Success in this area could mean the token’s rally is just beginning. A failure, however, might lead to rapid declines just as swiftly. Conclusion At the moment, Sui (SUI) is caught in a downturn while Remittix (RTX) enjoys a streak of daily record-setting highs. Whether Sui (SUI) can overcome Sui Bearish Trends may depend on renewed developer engagement and the real-world adoption of its technology. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is buoyed by enthusiasm for cross-border payments, giving it an advantage among new tokens. Both tokens present intriguing narratives: Sui (SUI) with its next-generation blockchain model and Remittix (RTX) with its PayFi goals. As always, crypto investors must stay vigilant; either token could change course if market sentiment shifts.

Notably, the right offering provides existing shareholders the opportunity to purchase additional ordinary shares at a discounted price of $0.50 per share, as per the announcement. Shareholders of record as of January 24, 2025, received one transferable right for each share they held. These rights can be exercised to purchase one new ordinary share at the subscription price. Shareholders who fully exercise their basic subscription rights will have the opportunity to subscribe to additional shares that remain unsubscribed. This allows interested investors to potentially increase their stake in the company. However, shareholders who sell any of their rights will forfeit their eligibility for the oversubscription privilege. The rights are currently trading on the NYSE American under the symbol “GNS RT” and will continue to trade until February 13, 2025. The Company plans to use 100% of the net proceeds of the Rights Offering to purchase Bitcoin for its Bitcoin Treasury. The Company anticipates that, in the event that the Rights Offering is fully subscribed, the proceeds will be up to $33 million. The company also aims to secure additional loan financing of up to $22 million, potentially increasing its Bitcoin holdings from approximately $45 million to $100 million.

According to the latest CryptoQuant Weekly Crypto report, liquidity conditions in the crypto market, as measured by the total value of stablecoins in circulation, have improved significantly since the U.S. presidential election. Analysts note that historically, increased liquidity via stablecoins has been linked to sustained increases in cryptocurrency prices. “Historically, increased liquidity through stablecoins has been associated with sustained gains in crypto markets,” CryptoQuant analysts wrote. Related News: Grayscale, the World's Largest Digital Asset Manager, Makes an Exciting Dogecoin (DOGE) Announcement Data from the report shows that the total market capitalization of stablecoins recently reached an all-time high of $204 billion. This is an increase of $37 billion since November 4, 2024, when Donald Trump won the US presidential election. The primary driver of this growth has been Tether’s USDT, although Circle’s USDC stablecoin has also shown renewed momentum. CryptoQuant data reveals that USDT deposits on centralized exchanges have surged 41%, from $30.5 billion on November 4, 2024, to $43 billion today. “The aggregate value of stablecoins is a significant source of liquidity for trading on exchanges, and its expansion is generally associated with higher crypto prices,” the report said. *This is not investment advice.

Among the standout projects, FXGuys ($FXG) is emerging as a leader in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and proprietary trading arenas. Along with other promising altcoins like GALA, IOTX, and JASMY, these tokens show immense potential for delivering significant returns. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE 1. FXGuys: Transforming DeFi and Proprietary Trading Leading the charge is FX Guys ($FXG), which has already amassed over $2.6 million during its Stage 2 presale at a price of $0.04 per token. FXGuys is reshaping the PropFi landscape with cutting-edge features designed for both traders and investors. These include: Staking Benefits: $FXG holders have the opportunity to stake their tokens and earn a 20% profit share from the broker's trading volume. This setup not only enhances passive income but also aligns with the community's long-term objectives. Prop Trading Funding Initiative: FXGuys provides retail traders access to accounts funded with up to $500,000. Traders who succeed retain 80% of their profits, fostering a trader-centric environment. Trade2Earn Incentives: Each trade conducted on the FXGuys platform generates $FXG tokens, encouraging trading activity and supporting ecosystem expansion. FXGuys also distinguishes itself as a broker-backed crypto prop firm, offering a bespoke trading platform, FXGuys Trader, and compatibility with platforms like MT5 and cTrader. With no buy or sell tax and decentralized trading that requires no KYC, FXGuys is undoubtedly among the leading defi coins to keep an eye on in 2025. 2. GALA: The Gaming Ecosystem Leader GALA is continuing to reinforce its status within the blockchain gaming industry. The token supports an array of play-to-earn games and serves as a utility for in-game purchases and rewards. As the blockchain gaming sector expands, GALA’s ecosystem-driven growth positions it as a strong candidate for noteworthy gains. 3. IOTX: Facilitating IoT and Blockchain Convergence IOTX is gaining recognition as a frontrunner in integrating IoT devices with blockchain systems as the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to grow. Its decentralized platform offers enhanced security, scalability, and interoperability, making it a project with great promise for Q1 2025. 4. JASMY: Championing Data Sovereignty JASMY enables users to maintain control over their data while monetizing it on a secure, decentralized platform. With data privacy becoming a major global issue, JASMY’s focus on data sovereignty sets it up for potential growth in 2025. 5. ENJ: Driving the NFT Movement ENJ is the backbone of Enjin, a prominent NFT ecosystem that allows gamers and developers to create, manage, and trade digital assets. With the enduring popularity of NFTs, ENJ remains a reliable choice for investors interested in this sector. 6. AURORA: Enhancing Ethereum's Scalability Aurora utilizes Ethereum's power while tackling scalability challenges through its high-efficiency protocol. With a rising demand for cost-effective and efficient blockchain solutions, Aurora shows strong growth potential. 7. DYM: Revolutionizing Data Transfer DYM is transforming the way data is shared and monetized through blockchain technology. Its secure and transparent method makes it a compelling option for industries heavily dependent on data exchange. Why FXGuys Stands Out While all the altcoins listed have considerable potential, FXGuys ($FXG) shines due to its unique value proposition and broad benefits. The prop trading funding program and decentralized trading features cultivate a profitable ecosystem for traders and investors. FXGuys’ dedication to instant funding and support for both fiat and crypto deposits further enhances its attractiveness. With the presale already gaining significant traction, FXGuys is poised to be a transformative force in both the DeFi and proprietary trading sectors. Whether you’re a strategic prop trader or a long-term investor, $FXG presents a promising opportunity to capitalize on the next major wave in cryptocurrency. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Conclusion Spotting altcoins with high potential early on can yield substantial benefits as the cryptocurrency market evolves. With groundbreaking projects like FXGuys, GALA, and JASMY leading the charge, Q1 2025 looks to be an exhilarating period for investors.

To review, President Trump on Thursday promised to impose 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada beginning Saturday Feb. 1. Having rallied over $106,000 prior to that news, bitcoin (BTC) quickly reversed 2% lower to around the $104,000 level. U.S. stocks gave up a chunk of earlier gains, though still finished the session in the green. Friday then brought a report from Reuters suggesting the tariffs would be delayed until March 1 as a process was put in place to allow countries to seek exemptions for certain exports. The White House, though, called that report ""false,"" with Trump's Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt minutes ago telling reporters the tariffs — including a 10% levy on China — will go into effect tomorrow. Similar to Thursday, bitcoin earlier had climbed above $106,000 and seemed set on a challenge of a new record above $109,000. The tariff news, however, once again sent prices careening lower, with bitcoin trading just below $103,000 at press time, down 2.3% over the past 24 hours.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. While DOGE and SHIB may struggle to replicate their 2021 gains, Lightchain AI emerges as a promising alternative. Table of Contents Hype around Dogecoin and Shiba Inu fading Lightchain AI gets attention Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) captured the hearts of crypto enthusiasts during their meteoric rise in 2021, creating massive returns for early adopters. However, relying on a repeat of that phenomenon in today’s market is risky. The days of meme coin hype dominating the market are giving way to projects focused on innovation and utility. Among the tokens that are grabbing attention for their potential is Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI’s presale has raised $13.5 million, with its tokens priced at $0.00525. It has emerged as a strong contender for investors looking to move beyond speculative assets. Hype around Dogecoin and Shiba Inu fading The enthusiasm surrounding meme-based cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu appears to be diminishing. Recent analyses suggest that the initial excitement propelling these tokens is waning, leading to notable declines in their trading volumes and market valuations. For instance, Dogecoin’s trading volume decreased by 29% over the past week, settling at approximately $1.9 billion. Similarly, Shiba Inu experienced a near 10% price drop in the same timeframe. This decline is attributed to a lack of substantial utility and overreliance on social media-driven hype. Consequently, investors are increasingly diverting their attention to cryptocurrencies with more robust fundamentals and practical applications. You might also like: $0.005 altcoin touted to replace Cardano and Ethereum in portfolios Lightchain AI gets attention Lightchain AI is redefining the blockchain space by integrating artificial intelligence into its ecosystem. Lightchain AI’s roadmap outlines phases from prototype development to global adoption, aiming to revolutionize decentralized AI applications. Notably, its Memecoin Launchpad will empower creators to design, launch, and monetize meme-driven projects, fostering innovation within the ecosystem. Additionally, Lightchain AI will address the critical challenge of scalability with its advanced architecture, enabling efficient AI computations without compromising security or privacy. Its developer-friendly tools further enhance its appeal, allowing businesses to build applications on a secure and scalable blockchain. Conclusion While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu continue to rely on their meme appeal, Lightchain AI offers a fresh perspective with a focus on real-world utility and transformative technology. Its presale success is a testament to the growing interest in projects that combine blockchain with artificial intelligence.

While many are focused on established cryptocurrencies, a new project is quietly attracting serious investor attention— Lightchain AI . Currently priced at $0.005625 during its presale, Lightchain AI has already raised $14million, signaling a strong influx of early buyers positioning themselves for massive potential returns. But what makes this project so attractive, and why are early investors making their move now? Why Lightchain AI Is Gaining Momentum Unlike speculative meme coins or short-lived hype-driven projects, Lightchain AI is built with a clear vision for long-term growth. It stands out by offering a secure, efficient, and scalable blockchain framework, making it a top contender in the race for next-generation decentralized technology. One of its most appealing features is its strong governance model , which ensures that decisions are made by token holders rather than centralized entities. This decentralization enhances trust and transparency, allowing investors to feel confident that the platform will evolve in a way that benefits the entire community. Another key attraction is Lightchain AI’s cross-chain compatibility , allowing seamless integration with multiple blockchain ecosystems. This adaptability ensures that it remains relevant and widely adopted, even as the broader crypto market continues to evolve. Why Early Investors Are Jumping In Now Smart investors understand that getting in early on a promising crypto project can unlock exponential returns. Lightchain AI’s rapidly growing presale demonstrates strong demand, attracting attention from whales and institutional players eager to capitalize on its potential. One key reason behind this interest is Lightchain AI’s robust security and decentralization. Its secure, trustless blockchain ecosystem addresses many risks associated with centralized platforms, offering a safer investment opportunity. This foundation enhances investor confidence and positions the project as a reliable option in the crypto market. Additionally, Lightchain AI is built for long-term scalability and widespread adoption. Its infrastructure is designed to handle large-scale growth, making it a future-ready solution. With these advantages, Lightchain AI stands out as a high-growth crypto investment opportunity. Decentralized Governance as a Catalyst Lightchain AI sets itself apart with its community-driven governance model, prioritizing inclusivity over centralized control. Unlike Solana, which focuses on developer-centric tools, Lightchain AI allows token holders to directly shape the platform’s future. Through its decentralized framework, users can vote on key decisions, such as network updates, partnerships, and the overall direction of the ecosystem. The platform uses quadratic voting to ensure fairness, amplifying the influence of smaller stakeholders while discouraging centralized dominance. This approach encourages balanced decision-making and creates a more equitable environment for all participants. Token holders play an active role in shaping the platform’s evolution, fostering a sense of collective ownership. Additionally, community initiatives like developer grants and AI projects are funded through governance mechanisms. This not only drives innovation but also ensures the platform aligns with the goals of its diverse user base.

39744299,https://nulltx.com/?p=142544,1738350025,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Hedera Price Prediction: Will HBAR Surge to $7 With Expanding DeFi and NFT Applications?,https://nulltx.com/the-hedera-price-prediction-will-hbar-surge-to-7-with-expanding-defi-and-nft-applications/,"Hedera (HBAR) remains among the leading assets in the market, with predictions of reaching the $7 mark while its DeFi and NFT apps expand – a thing we’ll check out in the following This is where PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might step in with its Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, as it already processes 43,200 testnet transactions daily and could integrate Ethereum-based projects. PlutoChain could be an interesting project to keep a close eye on in the following weeks. Let’s check them both out! Can We Expect Hedera to Hit $7 Any Time Soon? As of January 28, 2025, Hedera (HBAR) is trading around $0.317, showing a slight increase of 0.047% from the previous day. Throughout the day, the price has fluctuated between a low of $0.302 and a high of $0.320. Technical analysis indicates that HBAR has been trading within a stable range over the past week, with support levels around $0.30 and resistance near $0.34. Recently, many analysts gave their predictions for HBAR – Changelly predicts an average price somewhere around $0.0717 for 2025 which suggests a 49.7% growth. Also, CoinCodex gives us a broader range, expecting it to trade between $0.305733 and $1.091756 in 2025 which records potential for a 240.38% return. While these predictions suggest that while $7 may be an ambitious target for this cycle, Hedera’s growing DeFi and NFT capabilities could push its price to more bullish territory over time. How PlutoChain’s Smart Contracts and Layer-2 Tech Could Upgrade Bitcoin’s Potential PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could capture early adopter attention with its potential to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities by integrating DeFi, NFTs, and AI-powered applications into its network. By merging these elements, it could become an advanced option for users and developers that seek innovation. One of its best features is its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) – the bridge between Ethereum and Bitcoin could allow developers to connect Ethereum-based projects such as DeFi, NFTs, and AI. It could expand Bitcoin’s usage in ways where it usually falls short – some simple tools could make development more accessible and draw in both users and creators. On the technical side, PlutoChain has an amazing ability to process 43,200 transactions per day and achieve block times as fast as 2 seconds. As we’ve mentioned, this speed could mark a significant improvement over Bitcoin’s standard 10-minute block time and could offer the scalability and efficiency required for modern blockchain applications. PlutoChain’s credibility could be further reinforced by successful audits from firms such as SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , which help ensure a secure infrastructure capable of handling high-speed processing. The project also focuses on decentralization by letting the community make decisions about upgrades, partnerships, and features. While it’s looking for speed, scalability, and accessibility, PlutoChain could address Bitcoin’s biggest problems. The Verdict Hedera’s potential to reach $7 this cycle is powered by its expanding role in DeFi and NFT applications, strong partnerships, and growing interest in its innovative blockchain tech. On the opposite side, PlutoChain may attract attention from whales because of its advanced Layer-2 technology, which is trying to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities by potentially integrating DeFi, NFTs, and a robust governance framework. Also, it may add smart contracts and AI features to Bitcoin’s toolkit – and all that while keeping things safe. ——- Please keep in mind that this article is not financial advice.

The Chainlink (LINK) surge has reached notable milestones, achieving $4.7 million in transactions and 770,000 LINK tokens being removed from exchanges, elevating its value to $24. Web3 technology receives a significant boost as Kaia partners with Fireblocks, introducing top-tier security to 250 million users on platforms such as KakaoTalk and LINE. Additionally, e-commerce is transitioning towards decentralization faster than predicted, with platforms like Web3Bay (3BAY) enhancing online shopping to be more effective, secure, and profitable. With a presale price of $0.004562625, the 3BAY token is set to escalate to $0.1959 at its launch, promising early backers a 4,200% ROI. Chainlink (LINK) Surges: $4.7M Indicates $35 Target Ahead Chainlink’s price has reached $24 after substantial market activities, including $4.7 million in acquisitions and 770,000 LINK tokens being withdrawn from exchanges. This significant Chainlink surge reflects growing investor trust, particularly as LINK’s technology now supports numerous decentralized applications. Securing over $8 trillion through its oracle services so far, Chainlink remains pivotal in decentralized finance (DeFi). Market experts now predict that the ongoing Chainlink surge could potentially raise LINK’s price to $35, assuming consistent network growth and expanded utility in the DeFi sector. Kaia & Fireblocks Forge a Safer Web3 Technology Future Kaia’s strategic choice to incorporate Fireblocks into its blockchain network might redefine institutional engagement with Web3 technology. Fireblocks introduces robust protection to Kaia’s decentralized apps, safeguarding users against cyber threats with technologies such as Multi-Party Computation wallets and secure key management. Servicing more than 250 million users through platforms like KakaoTalk and LINE, Kaia’s integration with Fireblocks makes a tangible difference. By integrating Fireblocks’ cutting-edge security with Kaia’s Layer 1 blockchain, institutional stakeholders can now securely manage assets while complying with international standards. Exploring Web3Bay’s Technical Setup & Its $1 Presale Success Often called Amazon’s biggest threat, Web3Bay has now surpassed $1000,000 in fundraising, with all three presale rounds completely subscribed. Investors worldwide hold over 260 million 3BAY tokens, indicating a rapid shift towards fully decentralized online shopping, led by emerging leaders like Web3Bay. Web3Bay’s web3 blockchain technology guarantees transactions that are not only secure and quick but also fully transparent. The platform is driven by smart contracts, which automate crucial functions such as staking, governance voting, and handling transactions, all without the need for middlemen. Furthermore, Web3Bay utilizes decentralized storage through IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), enhancing data security by distributing files across its network. This approach mitigates risks typical of centralized storage, such as data breaches or losses. Its compatibility with multiple chains enables transactions across major networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain, and integrations with wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet enhance user convenience. With increasing recognition of its technical benefits, Web3Bay’s presale is accelerating. Currently, in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.004562625, and with each stage, the price climbs. By launch, when the token reaches $0.1959, early Stage 4 investors will see a 4,200% return on investment. Last Say These initiatives are showcasing blockchain’s capacity to address genuine challenges within finance, web3 blockchain technology , and e-commerce—and the attention is growing. Chainlink secures over $8 trillion in assets through its oracle services, cementing its status as a foundational component of web3 blockchain technology. With the LINK price now at $24, experts suggest that $35 might be the next target, assuming its utility and adoption continue to expand. Kaia is enhancing real-world applications of its Layer-1 blockchain, providing safer management of digital assets for 250 million users. The integration with Fireblocks is elevating security to an institutional level and promoting Web3 technology adoption. Lastly, Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by decentralizing the online shopping experience. The platform has raised $1 million so far in its active presale, selling out three stages with demand still surging. Priced at $0.004562625 in Stage 4, the 3BAY token is quickly being snapped up as investors aim to capitalize on impending price increases.

However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is emerging as a potential game-changer, with analysts predicting a breakout of up to 50,000%. What Makes THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Stand Out? 1. Limited Supply for Maximum Value: With a total supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN leverages a deflationary model to ensure scarcity and drive demand. This gives it a major edge over tokens like Solana (SOL) and Kaspa (KAS), which have higher supply and more gradual demand growth. 2. Exclusive Sale Platform: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is only available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN , adding an exclusive appeal that many competitors lack. Unlike Solana or Optimism (OP), which are widely traded, this controlled distribution creates a sense of urgency for early investors. 3. Early-Stage Momentum: Raising $1 million within minutes, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already proven its market appeal. With predictions of a 50,000% increase, it’s capturing attention as a high-potential token for investors seeking exponential returns. How It Stacks Up Against the Competition Solana (SOL, $25.01): Known for speed and scalability, but it lacks the exclusive presale advantage and early momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Kaspa (KAS, $0.12): A rising star in blockchain, yet its growth doesn’t match the explosive potential seen in this new token. Optimism (OP, $1.72): A solid project for scalability, but it’s overshadowed by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s unique market positioning. Act Now Before It’s Too Late Analysts are calling THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN one of the most promising tokens for 2025, with unparalleled growth potential.

The crypto exchange will delist the $140 billion U.S. dollar stablecoin Tether ( USDT ) by March 31, due to new regulations established by the European Union. News of this decision first surfaced last May when the platform was reportedly “actively reviewing” a potential USDT suspension in Europe, citing rules from the bloc’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation framework. In an email to clients, Kraken confirmed that it will delist USDT, Tether’s euro stablecoin, PayPal’s PYUSD, UST, and TUSD for users in the European Economic Area.

With a 0.79% price increase over the last week and a 6-month gain of over 9%, ETH is building momentum. The RSI at 67.7 hints it’s nearing overbought territory, suggesting potential upward movement. If ETH breaks the $3584 resistance, it could aim for the next level at $3890. The 10-day SMA at $3243 is above the 100-day SMA of $3167, indicating bullish trends. Stochastic levels near 88 back the momentum. Ethereum seems poised to continue rising, potentially offering substantial gains if it maintains the current trajectory. Keep an eye on those resistance and support levels for clues. Conclusion While established coins like ETH may offer steady growth, Catzilla stands out with its aim to bring financial freedom to all.

In a new video update, the host of InvestAnswers tells his 560,000 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin could potentially increase more than 66% from its current value as those who have held their BTC for 155 days or longer are about 70% done selling. Amid the decline in selling pressure, he says that if Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy and the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) purchased an additional $82 million worth of BTC combined the flagship digital asset could hit $175,000 per coin. “The question I had is, What would it take, how much money would it take to get to $175,000? Well, if Saylor spends another $40 billion, and the ETFs spend another $40 billion, call it $82 billion, the increase in Bitcoin’s market cap will be, based on the multiplier, $1.34 trillion, which would take the total Bitcoin market cap to $3.44 trillion, which, divided by 19.7 million Bitcoin will be $175,000… I still do believe the American ETFs will do at least $40 billion, and I think Saylor will do at least $40 billion. So that’s coming… Just these two players alone, if they continue to do what they did last year, and the selling is the same level of selling we have now, which I don’t think they’ll repeat, it’ll be less because they’re 70% done, I think it’s theoretically possible get to $175,000.” Bitcoin is trading for $105,054 at time of writing. ?

The announcement came as Tether came up during the confirmation hearing for Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Commerce. Presidential candidate Howard Lutnick, chairman of Cantor Fitzgerald LP, a major banking partner of Tether, disclosed during the hearing that Cantor Fitzgerald holds a convertible bond with Tether and suggested that dollar-denominated stablecoins should be subject to regulation. Tether has long faced criticism for its lack of audited financial statements, relying instead on third-party attestations from BDO published quarterly. These attestations provide only a snapshot of the firm’s finances rather than a full audit, raising concerns among regulators and market watchdogs. Related News: This Could Be the Source of the Next Big Rally in Bitcoin and Altcoins Despite its limited disclosure practices, Tether’s $13 billion in profits rivals Wall Street’s big investment banks. Goldman Sachs, for example, had $14.3 billion in net income on $53.5 billion in revenue last year. But Tether’s much smaller workforce makes its profitability particularly notable. The transparency of Tether’s reserves has been a hot topic as regulators have questioned the firm’s ability to handle large-scale buybacks during market downturns. The firm claims to have more than $7 billion in excess reserves and recently increased its exposure to U.S. Treasury bonds, bringing its total assets to $113 billion. Demand for Tether’s USDT stablecoin has soared, pushing its market value above $143 billion. Tether has further solidified its dominance in the stablecoin sector by issuing over $23 billion worth of USDT in the last quarter of 2024. *This is not investment advice.

Its performance and small capex have caused a seismic shift in the global AI race, plummeting US tech stocks. In particular, NVIDIA ($NVDA) is down 15% since DeepSeek R1’s launch. The Chiene AI lab has also caused significant volatility in the crypto market, with prices initially correcting in correlation with the US tech equities. However, experts anticipate that the intensifying AI race will be beneficial for the crypto market in the long run, particularly for the AI agent coins. Tech-savvy crypto investors are already using DeepSeek R1 to hunt for market alpha. To test the new AI model, we asked the best candidates for the next 100x crypto and received some interesting responses. DeepSeek’s Next 100x Cryptos DeepSeek considered innovative technology, strong use case, developer and community support, partnerships and adoption, market timing, regulatory compliance and market capitalization while picking its candidates for the next 100x crypto. Here are DeepSeek’s picks. Optimism ($OP) Ethereum layer-2 token Optimism turned out to be the Chinese AI’s top pick, a surprising selection considering it has underperformed other altcoins during this bull run. Regarding Optimism, DeepSeek claims “Optimism is a strong contender in the Layer 2 space, and its focus on scalability, ecosystem growth, and community governance makes it a project worth watching.” Despite $OP’s underperformance, it could be an attractive investment in the coming months. Smart money investors may view it as a beta play on Ethereum, which would bode well for its upside potential. For instance, MN Trading’s Michael van de Poppe is bullish on Optimism, citing the formation of a bullish divergence on its higher timeframe chart. However, it is unlikely OP could be the next 100x crypto, considering it already has a market capitalization of just under $2 billion. Render ($RENDER) DeepSeek picked another large-cap asset, Render (RNDR), as one of its top candidates for the next 100x crypto. Render is the leading provider of decentralized GPU-based rendering solutions, which is one of the key reasons why the new AI model is bullish on it. Indeed, smart money investors are bullish on Render as well — being a global marketplace of GPU computing power, the project has strong demand and could be one of the best long-term investments. Experts believe Render could reach a $30 billion market cap in the long run, which would mean 10x returns for new buyers. However, it is still unlikely that a $3 billion asset could be the next 100x crypto. Meme Index (MEMEX) We asked DeepSeek to consider low-cap crypto assets, considering they may have a better chance of delivering 100x returns. The AI picked several innovative projects with high upside potential. For instance, it picked Meme Index (MEMEX) , considering it is the first decentralized index fund for meme coins. The project allows MEMEX holders to tap into the broader meme coin market while spreading the risk. It will soon launch four baskets — Titan, Moonshot, Midcap and Frenzy — each with a different risk-reward ratio and designed for a wide variety of investors. Considering only MEMEX holders get to invest in the baskets, it is no surprise why the new meme coin is in high demand. Moreover, holders will get to vote on which tokens to include in each basket, which means they could potentially benefit from coins they otherwise would have missed out on. Besides DeepSeek, prominent crypto influencers are also bullish on MEMEX, with many now considering it the next 100x crypto. After all, it is a low-cap crypto that is still in the early stages of its presale .",More News,EN,0,0,ZRX|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|OP,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-01-31 19:21:11

Its impressive performance and minimal capital expenditure have created a major disruption in the worldwide AI competition, leading to a drop in US tech stocks. Notably, NVIDIA ($NVDA) has experienced a 15% decline following the release of DeepSeek R1. Moreover, the Chiene AI lab has introduced considerable fluctuations in the crypto market, initially causing prices to correct in tandem with US tech stocks. Despite this, specialists foresee that the growing AI race will eventually benefit the crypto market, particularly for AI-related coins. Tech-savvy crypto investors are already leveraging DeepSeek R1 to seek out market advantages. We put the new AI model to the test by asking for the best prospects for the next 100x cryptocurrency and received some intriguing answers. DeepSeek’s Picks for the Next 100x Cryptocurrencies When selecting its candidates for the next 100x cryptocurrency, DeepSeek evaluated factors such as cutting-edge technology, robust use cases, developer and community backing, partnerships and adoption, market timing, regulatory compliance, and market capitalization. Here are DeepSeek's selections. Optimism ($OP) The Ethereum layer-2 token Optimism emerged as the top choice by the Chinese AI, a surprising pick given its poor performance relative to other altcoins during this bullish phase. DeepSeek states, “Optimism is a formidable player in the Layer 2 arena, with its emphasis on scalability, ecosystem expansion, and community governance making it a project worth monitoring.” Even though $OP hasn’t performed well, it could become an attractive investment in the months ahead. Savvy investors might see it as a bet on Ethereum, potentially boosting its future gains. For example, Michael van de Poppe from MN Trading is optimistic about Optimism, pointing out a bullish divergence forming on its higher timeframe chart. However, given its existing market cap just shy of $2 billion, OP is unlikely to be the next 100x crypto. Render ($RENDER) Render (RNDR), another large-cap asset, was selected by DeepSeek as a leading contender for the next 100x cryptocurrency. Render stands out as the foremost provider of decentralized GPU-based rendering solutions, which is a major factor in the new AI model's positive outlook. Investors are optimistic about Render too, as it acts as a global marketplace for GPU computing power, attracting strong demand and potentially making it a great long-term investment. Experts predict that Render could achieve a $30 billion market cap over time, translating to 10x returns for new investors. Nonetheless, a $3 billion asset is still unlikely to become the next 100x crypto. Meme Index (MEMEX) We asked DeepSeek to focus on low-cap crypto assets, considering they might have a better shot at achieving 100x returns. The AI identified several innovative projects with high potential upside. Among them was Meme Index (MEMEX) , noted for being the first decentralized index fund for meme coins. This project enables MEMEX holders to access the broader meme coin market while diversifying their risk. It plans to launch four baskets — Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Frenzy — each tailored for different risk-reward ratios and targeted at a diverse range of investors. Given that only MEMEX holders can invest in these baskets, it's easy to see why there's high demand for this new meme coin. Additionally, holders have the opportunity to vote on which tokens to include in each basket, potentially benefiting from coins they might have otherwise overlooked. Beyond DeepSeek, well-known crypto influencers are also optimistic about MEMEX, with many now viewing it as the next 100x crypto. After all, it's a low-cap crypto still in the early stages of its presale .",More News,EN,0,0,ZRX|MARKET|BUSINESS|OP|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitzo', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitzo,2025-01-31 19:21:11

The rise in interest in $FXG stems from the asset’s more pleasant projection in contrast with that of these top altcoins, which has led to the conclusion that it could be the best crypto to buy this month. Here, we will spotlight $FXG’s projections and why investors in TRX and ADA are interested in the new ICO coin! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Long Traders Suffer as Solana Drives Altcoin Liquidation Solana’s recent token price drop has brought its total liquidation to $14.98 million over the weekend. Long traders bore the brunt of this unfortunate event that hit SOL. According to CoinGlass data , Solana’s long traders lost approximately $11.40 million to the liquidation, while short traders lost $3.57 million. SOL’s liquidation record shows that the asset outpaced every other altcoin in this regard, casting a shadow over Solana. Meanwhile, FXGuys’ $FXG is becoming more popular among TRX and ADA investors and is starting to capture the interest of SOL investors. SOL has been down 1% in the last seven days, bringing its value to $238 . Experts have predicted that SOL’s downtrend might get worse from here, and the Solana coin price might drop below $150 in February 2025. Investors in Top Altcoins Set Eyes on FXGuys as the Prop Firm Gains Popularity Investors in top altcoins like TRX and ADA have shifted their gaze to FXGuys, an emerging prop firm, as it presents an opportunity to make good money this cycle. As a new-generation prop firm, FXGuys will equip crypto traders with the necessary tools to scale up their trading careers and get better results. Through its trader development programs, traders can access trading capital, join communities of experts, earn rewards, and participate in training programs to hone their skills. The best part is that anyone can use the FXGuys platform without geographical limitations because of its no-KYC policy. The FX Guys Trader Funding Program will support skilled traders with up to $500,000 in trading capital. Beneficiaries will keep 80% of the profits realized, leaving the FXGuys platform with the remaining 20%. This arrangement shows the platform’s focus on helping users realize their financial goals quickly. In addition, traders will benefit from the platform’s Trade2Earn incentive scheme. This program rewards traders with $FXG tokens for every trade, whether it is a win or a loss. $FXG holders may also stake their assets and earn up to a 20% APY. So, if you are a trader and an $FXG holder, at least three sources of revenue are available on FXGuys. This has made the platform popular among investors in top altcoins like TRX, ADA, and SOL. TRON Eyes a Breakout After Gaining Stability Traders wonder if TRON’s TRX is preparing for a breakout or if its current trajectory will hold as the asset stabilizes. CryptoQuant’s Joao Wedson recently shared his opinion on TRON using the asset’s Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). Joao believes that TRON could still experience significant growth, pointing at the asset’s CAGR data, which is at the intermediate level. When the asset’s CAGR was at this level in 2021, TRX recorded an explosive price surge as its adoption rate spiked and market conditions strengthened. With TRX now stable, Wedson is betting on a possible high growth rate, but not before $FXG grabs investor interest. This interest could be associated with TRX’s stagnant performance at a modest 0.21% weekly gain, leaving its price at $0.24 . Cardano’s ADA is Stuck Under $1.13: Can Bulls Trigger a Rebound? Since sliding below $1.13, Cardano’s ADA has repeatedly failed to execute a successful breakout above this price level. Following two failed attempts this month, ADA remains underwater in spite of a generally bullish market. Yet, optimistic long-term holders continue to hold their ADA tokens, hoping the tide turns in the foreseeable future. This decision has lent stability to the Cardano coin price in recent times, but it remains to be seen how long it will last. However, the question on everyone’s mind remains whether the bulls’ returns will help ADA rise again. In the meantime, ADA investors are looking into a new presale token, $FXG. Cardano’s ADA, on the other hand, tanked 12.56% this week to $0.90. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG is Seen as the Best Crypto to Buy: Here’s Why! As TRX, SOL, and ADA struggle, $FXG has emerged as a saving grace to investors looking to secure massive profits in February 2025. While these top altcoins dip, $FXG gears up for a meteoric price surge. Currently in Stage 2 of its public presale, selling for $0.04, the ICO coin can be bought at a discount for massive gains after its exchange listing.

According to a press release , the Istanbul 22nd Regional Court of Justice has decided to maintain Ozer’s detention on fraud charges. However, his attorney, Sevgi Eraslan, stated that the court dropped the organized crime charges. Details of Thodex Founder Court Case Thodex, once a major cryptocurrency exchange in Turkey, collapsed in 2021, leading to a large investigation into fraud claims. The founder, Ozer, vanished just before the exchange closed, leaving thousands of users unable to access their money. In 2022, he was caught in Albania after being declared a fugitive and sent to Turkey to face charges. Authorities accused Ozer of defrauding investors, laundering money, and running a criminal group. Faruk has been on the wanted list for defrauding over 400,000 users on its platform. Many argued that he should be charged with three counts, punishable with a maximum sentence of 40,562 years collectively with other suspects. Meanwhile, Ozer was sentenced to 11,196 years in prison in 2023. Recall that the exchange woes started with a Dogecoin (DOGE) rewards campaign. Ozer remains in custody while facing fraud charges. However, dropping the more serious organized crime charges is a small win for him. Ozer’s lawyers plan to seek more leniency in the upcoming hearings, hoping to achieve his release. As the case develops, the collapse of Thodex continues to raise concerns about the safety and regulation of digital asset platforms. Global Authorities Step Up Crypto Fraud Crackdowns Ozer’s case highlights an alarming trend in the cryptocurrency sector as fraud schemes proliferate globally. Authorities across jurisdictions are ramping up efforts to combat such activities. On January 5, Vietnam police apprehended four individuals involved in a crypto mining scam that defrauded over 200 victims of roughly $157,300. Meanwhile, in the United States, the Springfield, Massachusetts, police department issued a warning about the rise of cryptocurrency ATM scams, where victims are instructed to deposit funds into machines to transfer money to scammers. Furthermore, Blockchain security PeckShield recently reported that cryptocurrency-related scams and hacks resulted in losses exceeding $3 billion in 2024, marketing a 15% increase from the previous year. Investors Urged to Exercise Caution Ozer’s case underscores the need for heightened vigilance in the cryptocurrency space. Promises of extraordinary returns should serve as a warning sign for potential investors. As regulators and law enforcement agencies intensify their efforts to weed out bad actors, individual investors are heavily responsible for conducting thorough research and avoiding too-good-to-be-true schemes.

DOGE 24x Surge Potential Amid Price Fluctuations Dogecoin’s token price has dropped more than 12% in the last week, but its price fluctuation hasn’t been steady. Before a negative trend drove the token price below the $0.39 level, DOGE ranged between $0.38 and $0.43. Before falling further lower to $0.33, the altcoin kept bouncing between $0.41 and $0.39. The price dropped to about $0.34 after a brief bullish comeback that brought it back to $0.35. Despite these fluctuations, Dogecoin has seen a notable 8% token price growth over the past month, indicating durable performance. Community attitude toward Dogecoin remains strong, with many investors enthusiastic about the probability of DOGE reclaiming ATH of $0.73 shortly. Currently more than 51% below its ATH, many foresee possibilities for a rally in the coming months. While Dogecoin boasts an astounding market cap of $52.94 billion, $FXG presents a more enticing opportunity for investors seeking exponential growth.

The world's oldest cryptocurrency retreated to multi-day lows on Monday, mirroring a sharp drop in U.S. tech stocks catalyzed by the sudden emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. BTC has dropped below the $100K on the day. However, the downturn did not last long, and the cryptocurrency soon reclaimed the $100K threshold, and has continued to trade over the mark at the time of writing. On Wednesday, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) initially dipped a little after the Federal Reserve decided to keep rates steady, but the cryptocurrency recovered soon after. ""Initial fears about DeepSeek presented a buying opportunity for crypto as the industry isn't in direct confrontation with the Chinese AI firm. Instead, founders of crypto projects that use AI can integrate DeepSeek's open-sourced model into their projects for more efficiency and enhanced innovations,"" said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. We remain optimistic for Bitcoin in the long term, as policies are shaping up to be very beneficial for the crypto industry's growth in the US and abroad, Ruck added. The cryptocurrency has also been benefiting from Donald Trump's return to the White House. BTC had reached an all-time high of $109.3K on January 20, just before Trump's inauguration ceremony. On January 23, Trump signed an executive order to create a so-called crypto working group to advise his team on industry-related policies. On Thursday, hedge fund Elliott in an investor letter said, President Trump is inflating a crypto bubble that could cause havoc when it busts, according to a report in The Financial Times. Trump’s extraordinary embrace of cryptocurrencies could fuel a speculative mania that would cause havoc when crypto prices collapse, the letter added. ""Despite Bitcoin-friendly pledges, the administration's approach seems more diversified, likely incorporating stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies rather than focusing solely on Bitcoin,"" Seeking Alpha analyst Mike Fay said. Notable News CNBC's Jim Cramer urged investors earlier in the week to own Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rather than betting on Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure. Trump’s executive order on digital assets is a positive for the crypto world, but “it remains to be seen how recommendations differ from existing bills,” including those that have pending court cases, said Alex Saunders, head of quantitative macro strategy at Citi Research, in a note. Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has brought back blockchain staking offerings for U.S. customers. Crypto asset manager Grayscale launched an exchange-traded fund offering investors exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners. Mizuho Securities analyst Dan Dolev upgraded Coinbase Global ( COIN ) shares to Neutral from Underperform on Wednesday on the expectation the crypto exchange will benefit from further gains in the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Investment firm D.E.Shaw has taken a stake in Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) and may push for changes at the Bitcoin miner. CME Group ( CME ) will introduce options on Bitcoin Friday futures on Feb. 24, pending regulatory review, the company said on Wednesday. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) has proposed an offering of 2.5M shares of its Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has approved part of an application by Bitwise Asset Management for a combined Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ether ( ETH-USD ) exchange-traded fund. Moves of other cryptocurrencies Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) fell 2.9% to $102.3K as at 2:30 pm on Friday, after the White House said Trump's proposed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% tariff on China will go into effect on Saturday. Ether ( ETH-USD ) was up 1.7% to $3.3K, while DOGE ( DOGE-USD ) down 1.7% to $0.33.

His comments come as ETH rises more than 3%, reigniting discussions on optimal cryptocurrency portfolio allocation. The debate was sparked by crypto analyst Udi Wertheimer, who stated that serious crypto investors should allocate at least 10% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, ideally closer to 70%. Buterin, however, took a different stance, stating that he holds less than 10% in BTC and less than 10% in any asset that is not ETH. His comments reinforce an Ethereum-first investment strategy while maintaining minimal exposure to other cryptocurrencies. I'm under 10% in BTC But then again I'm under 10% in anything that's not ETH — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 31, 2025 Buterin’s stance has ignited debate within the crypto community, with some applauding his Ethereum-first strategy while others argue for a more diversified approach. A look at Vitalik Buterin’s portfolio A deeper dive into Buterin’s portfolio shows that ETH makes up the overwhelming majority of his holdings, valued at over $794 million. He also holds AETHWETH at $9.53 million, WETH at $869,66, and KNC at $442,67, alongside smaller allocations in MOODENG, WHITE, and EBULL—suggesting some degree of diversification within Ethereum-based assets. Vitalik Buterin’s portfolio. Source: Arkham His stablecoin exposure, including USDC at $87,120, indicates some level of liquidity management, though it remains a minor fraction of his total holdings alongside other tokens. Ethereum’s bullish momentum: A rally in sight? Buterin’s portfolio disclosure coincides with Ethereum’s bullish price action, with technical indicators signaling a potential rally to new all-time highs. According to market analyst TedPillows, Ethereum has entered a short-term expansion phase following a period of accumulation and manipulation, setting the stage for a major breakout. The momentum is also fueled by institutional accumulation, with Trump’s World Liberty Financial acquiring over $420 million in digital assets, including $210 million in Ethereum, as reported by Finbold. With major players investing heavily in ETH, the market is watching closely to see whether Ethereum’s growing adoption will translate into sustained long-term gains.

The DEX introduces the new version as the most customizable and less costly one. Through modular plugins called “hooks,” the platform revolutionizes the protocol and transforms it into a developer platform with limitless customization capabilities. With 150+ customizable hooks, the platform introduces features like dynamic fees and automated liquidity management. It enables faster development and deeper liquidity, driving innovation and experimentation in DeFi. Notably, the platform reduces pool creation costs by up to 99.99% compared to previous versions. Uniswap, the top crypto exchange , posted on X, “Pools on v4 are expected to be 99.99% cheaper to create, and swappers can expect significant savings on multi-hop swaps.” Version 4 Built on Transparency and Security Significantly, the Uniswap crypto exchange team has assured that the v4 is developed as the “most audited codebases ever deployed onchain.” As per records, the team has tested the version’s security through nine audits and a $2.35M security competition with over 500 participants. In addition, the largest bug bounty program ensured the protocol’s security and integrity. Neither in the competition nor in the bug bounty program was a single critical bug found. UNI Trades in Red Despite Uniswap V4 Launch Despite Uniswap v4 release, the UNI price is in a negative zone, currently at $12.03.

In a new press release, the investment giant says it is creating the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust as it believes DOGE has matured from a simple memecoin into a legitimate global financial tool. As stated by Grayscale’s head of products and research, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, “Dogecoin has matured into a potentially powerful tool for promoting financial accessibility. We believe, as a faster, cheaper, and more scalable derivative of Bitcoin, Dogecoin is helping groups underserved by legacy financial infrastructure to participate in the financial system. Grayscale Dogecoin Trust offers investors exposure to an asset that is positioned to help fulfill Bitcoin’s originally intended use case and its egalitarian ethos.” According to the press release, the Dogecoin Trust will operate like any other one of the firm’s trusts and solely invest in DOGE, the native asset of the blockchain. Last December, it was unveiled that Grayscale launched two new trusts centered around liquid staking service Lido DAO ( LDO ) and layer-2 scaling solution Optimism ( OP ). Other crypto-based trusts offered by Grayscale include ones for payments altcoin XRP, layer-1 blockchain Avalanche ( AVAX ), stablecoin issuer Maker ( MKR ), machine learning marketplace Bittensor ( TAO ) as well as contract platform Sui Network ( SUI ). DOGE is trading for $0.338 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last day.

They break down the silos between blockchains, enabling asset transfers, increased liquidity, and greater innovation. By building bridges, developers empower users to move assets and data across multiple chains, unlocking new use cases and alleviating onboarding. Token development allows for customized economies with unique incentives, governance structures, and financial models catering to diverse user needs. Cross-chain interoperability fosters more connected blockchain ecosystems, reducing congestion on individual networks and enabling decentralized applications (dApps) to operate across multiple protocols. LayerZero , a pioneering cross-chain interoperability protocol, is now live on Cronos zkEVM and Cronos EVM. This includes mainnet and testnet networks, Cronos Labs and LayerZero announced. Following the integration, builders will be able to create bridges, develop tokens, and explore a wide range of cross-blockchain applications. When these applications materialize, they will link Cronos users to the aggregated liquidity of blockchains that LayerZero supports. These include Ethereum, Solana, and another 115+ L1 and L2 chains. This significant milestone is expected to be followed by a series of further integrations, considering that hundreds of apps using LayerZero can now offer Cronos users their services. This will alleviate access to cryptocurrency worth several billions of US dollars, held securely on Cronos. Users of Cronos EVM, the leading L1 blockchain on the Cosmos SDK, can now transfer their assets between the Cosmos SDK ecosystem, Solana, and numerous other EVM-compatible blockchains with ease. The ecosystem is interoperable with Cronos EVM via the Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Users will continue to benefit from the native Ethereum bridge, which around a dozen other Elastic Chains share. This is good news for Cronos zkEVM, the first Elastic Chain (L2) whose mainnet will launch after ZKSync Era. These users will also be able to execute quick cross-chain transfers with a large number of L1 and L2 blockchains. LayerZero Labs CEO Bryan Pellegrino expressed delight at LayerZero’s expansion to Cronos zkEVM in this historic development. He emphasized that connecting different types of blockchains is the essence of interoperability and is excited to see what will follow. Ken Timsit, Managing Director of Cronos Labs, also underscored the importance of cross-chain interoperability. He pointed out that it has been Cronos’s main priority since its inception. Cronos Labs is working on that priority cautiously yet determinedly in light of the significant liquidity and security challenges of the crypto industry fragmentation. Mr. Timsit anticipates that the integration with LayerZero will enable much greater connectivity between TradFi and crypto projects in 2025. The cutting-edge functionalities aren’t live for most end users because LayerZero is mainly a developer tool, and further announcements are expected. The official Cronos bridge portals will feature new cross-chain bridging options as third-party links at zkevm.cronos.org/bridge for Cronos zkEVM and cronos.org/bridge for Cronos EVM. These will include token bridging options such as new CRO / zkCRO between Cronos zkEVM and EVM, which will be enhanced in the next few weeks. In the meantime, Cronos Labs is prepared to support all developers who are interested in exploring the new functionalities. While invigorating, token bridging is not the only use case Cronos Labs wants to develop. The Web3 start-up accelerator is interested in supporting dApps using Layer Zero’s technology to grow tokenization of real-world assets, cross-chain prediction markets and lending protocols, liquid staking and restaking protocols, trading platforms for synthetic assets, and other DeFi applications that can use locked cross-chain collateral. Its ultimate goal is to help build a future where blockchains work together, driving mass adoption and making niches like real-world asset tokenization more efficient and intuitive.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRO|BLOCKCHAIN|ATOM|ETH|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-31 19:42:46

This statement contradicts claims made by Dogwifhat ( WIF ) token supporters “We have never had a deal with Dogwifhat, and our agency at the time only had one very preliminary conversation early last year,” a Sphere spokesperson told Decrypt. The spokesperson further clarified that there was never a plan for Dogwifhat to appear on the Exosphere and expressed concern that the venue’s name was being misused for deceptive purposes. it was the story of a dogwifhat, but a scammer took 600k from it and spend it on party and bitches instead of bidding bitcoin https://t.co/OIwOyqM7bA pic.twitter.com/greXycbis3 — Marusha (@mattomattik) January 31, 2025 The denial follows a now-deleted post from Dogwifhat’s official X account that stated, “Officially confirmed. Viva hat vegas,” accompanied by an artist’s rendering of the meme dog on the Sphere. A revised version of the post later removed the confirmation but retained the artwork, which featured a phone screen displaying “Q1 2025.” In March 2024, five organizers raised from WIF supporters to fund a Sphere advertisement, driving the token to an all-time high of $4.83.

Plans are reportedly underway to stretch stock market hours to near 24/7 trading, and while that sounds like a good idea for this author and other night owls glued to trading apps, it spells bad news for Bitcoin and potentially for the US economy. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which is the largest and most influential stock market in the world, wants to extend its hours from 4 a.m.–8 p.m. to a longer stretch of 1:30 a.m.–11:30 p.m. Already, in 2024, the SEC approved 24 Exchange (24X), a Bermuda-based group funded by billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen’s Point72 Ventures. They plan to offer nearly continuous trading for stocks, leaving just one hour of downtime each day for system updates. Overnight traders are already running the show Robinhood’s late-night trading spike on Monday during DeepSeek’s short-lived rise, which triggered the second-highest volume in the platform’s overnight session, second only to the US presidential election. For Robinhood, this isn’t new. They’ve been offering overnight trading for the past 18 months. But the fact that this session ranked so high shows how deep the appetite for around-the-clock trading is. Retail investors, once known for checking their portfolios during lunch breaks, are now trading Amazon and Tesla at midnight from their couches. We’re using trading apps as easily as we shop online. The pandemic helped create this behavior after our hero, Roaring Kitty (Keith Gill), showed us what was possible. When the world was locked down, we found trading stocks as entertaining as binge-watching Netflix. And then we found Kitty’s live streams, where he kept talking about the market in such a fun and effortlessly cool way that it just had to draw us in, especially the Gen Zs. So even after we got off work or school, many were stuck with after-hours trading, and Robinhood gave them the tools. But the overnight session from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. in New York also connects directly to Asia, where household investors love trading major US stocks during their daytime hours. Wall Street’s larger push for non-stop action Meanwhile, Charles Schwab has also jumped in, offering overnight trading to its most active clients. Schwab’s clients can now trade over 500 stocks and ETFs after hours, up from just 24 ETFs before. This is making Wall Street rethink everything. When does a trading day officially begin and end if markets are always open? What will the closing price of a stock mean when there’s no clear “end of the day”? Asset managers like BlackRock (who is actually also a Bitcoin whale) also worry about waking up to margin calls and overnight price swings. Historically, US stock markets stuck to traditional business hours. Even in the early days of informal trading in Manhattan coffee houses, there were clear opening and closing bells. But crypto never followed those rules. Bitcoin’s always-on trading environment changed the game forever. That’s why Wall Street’s move to non-stop trading will steal Bitcoin’s thunder. Investors who used to see Bitcoin as a 24/7 alternative might now choose Apple or Tesla instead. I mean quite frankly they’re way more stable. It feels much safer going to bed with TSLA or NVDA than BTC. It’d take a lot (like a full-blown financial crisis or a company filing for bankruptcy) for these stocks to lose 15% of their value overnight. Can we say the same about Bitcoin? The dollar already trades 24/7, and futures contracts tied to the S&P 500 are traded across global time zones, from Tokyo mornings to European afternoons. With stocks set to join the mix, Bitcoin’s exclusivity as a round-the-clock market is slipping away right before our very eyes. But there’s also a dark side to this. A non-stop market makes price swings inevitable. Global events hit instantly. Political chaos in Asia, a tech announcement in Silicon Valley, or some eccentric billionaire’s tweet at midnight can flip Bitcoin’s price in seconds. And things get wilder during weekends or late-night hours when there’s less trading volume. In a continuous trading world, there’s no time for markets to “digest” anything. Investors hit the panic button (or the buy button) right away, and prices across both stocks and Bitcoin could whiplash more than ever. Think about it: crypto traders love the flexibility of trading anytime, anywhere. But if stocks offer that same flexibility, some of these traders could switch sides. Retail investors who’ve grown accustomed to Bitcoin’s 24/7 lifestyle might test the waters in a round-the-clock stock market. And if they find it less nerve-wracking, Bitcoin could lose part of its fanbase. Implications for the US economy The proposed 24/7 trading could make US markets way more attractive to foreign investors. Think about someone in Tokyo or Dubai—traditional US market hours aren’t exactly convenient for them. Now, with round-the-clock access, they can jump in whenever they want. This could open the floodgates for foreign money pouring into US equities, making Wall Street an even bigger player in the global economy. But with that comes increased competition and, of course, higher stakes. That means if something like DeepSeek happens again and the market loses trillions of dollars again, it’ll be felt everywhere. And the crash will be much faster, and much bigger. Also, regulatory bodies like the SEC will have to work overtime too, making sure these markets are not being manipulated, which is going to get a lot harder as it goes on. Lower liquidity during off-hours is prime time for market manipulation. With fewer players in the game, it’s easier for bad actors to push prices around, creating opportunities for pump-and-dump schemes and all kinds of other shady behavior, which will spill over to the stock market as it gets more and more correlated to Bitcoin. Economic indicators used to be digested slowly. You’d get a report at 8:30 AM, and markets would adjust after the opening bell. But 24/7 trading? that could change. Now, news from any corner of the world could trigger immediate reactions in stocks, crypto, and even bonds at any hour. The markets won’t sleep, and neither will the traders trying to keep up. It’s actually could be a dystopia, and at that point, there ain’t no stopping it.",OP-ED|BTC|USD,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-31 19:45:04

Reuters reports that on Wednesday, lawmakers in El Salvador approved a bill to amend the nation’s Bitcoin law in compliance with a deal that the government struck with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In December, the government of El Salvador and a staff team from the IMF reached a deal for a $1.4 billion loan facility after agreeing that the Central American nation would allow businesses to decide whether they want to accept cryptocurrency payments. El Salvador intends to use the fund to support economic reforms. The IMF says the arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) will mitigate the country’s Bitcoin-related risks. “The potential risks of the Bitcoin project will be diminished significantly in line with Fund policies. Legal reforms will make acceptance of Bitcoin by the private sector voluntary. For the public sector, engagement in Bitcoin-related economic activities and transactions in and purchases of Bitcoin will be confined.” El Salvador’s congress, which is dominated by President Nayib Bukele’s New Ideas Party, approved the reform with 55 votes in favor and two against. The agreement is still subject to the approval of the IMF Executive Board and conditioned on EL Salvador’s fulfillment of the terms.

The suit, filed on January 30, alleges that every token created through Pump.fun constitutes an unregistered security, from which the platform has profited nearly $500 million in fees. Alleged Securities Violations and Investor Losses The lead plaintiff, Diego Aguilar, claims to have suffered financial losses trading three specific Pump.fun-created meme coins, FWOG, FRED, and GRIFFAIN. According to the filing , these tokens were aggressively marketed using meme culture and promises of exponential returns, enticing investors but ultimately leading to significant financial losses. FWOG, for instance, was promoted as having reached a $500 million market cap before its value dropped. “Pump.Fun’s core function is to work alongside influencers to co-issue and market unregistered securities. Inherent to its operations is a novel evolution in Ponzi and pump-and-dump schemes,” read the document. Although the platform does not directly create the tokens in question, the complaint argues that it facilitates and organizes their launch through automated tools, allowing users to create and sell digital assets within minutes. This, according to the suit, makes the company a “joint issuer” of all tokens launched on it. The case names U.K.-registered Baton Corporation, the alleged operator of Pump.fun, and three of its co-founders—Alon Cohen, Dylan Kerler, and Noah Tweedale—as defendants. The plaintiffs are seeking legal relief in the form of rescinding all token purchases, monetary damages for affected investors, and coverage of litigation costs. Criticism and Controversy This is not the first time the platform has faced legal action. Just two weeks earlier, on January 16, Burwick Law filed a separate class-action suit on behalf of investor Kendall Carnahan. That case also accused Baton Corporation and its executives of selling unregistered securities. Specifically, it targeted the PNUT token, a Solana-based meme coin inspired by Peanut the Squirrel that allegedly reached a market cap of $1 billion. The firm’s founder, Max Burwick, has been vocal in his criticism of such sites. On January 15, he publicly condemned them as “the ultimate evolution of multi-level marketing scams, preying on human desperation and the digital attention economy.” A day later, Burwick Law formally announced its legal campaign against the company, alleging that investors had fallen victim to meme coin rug pulls and misleading promises. Pump.fun also faced controversy following its November 2024 introduction of a livestream function to enhance user engagement. Some users quickly abused the feature to broadcast explicit and disturbing content. Following public backlash, the company was forced to shut down the livestream, leading to a marked drop in revenue.

In its predictions, which are based entirely on hypothetical situations, DeepSeek focused on bear scenarios, as it asked for the lowest levels to which assets could fall. According to an artificial intelligence model, Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, could fall from its current level to between $51,000 and $61,200 in 2025. DeepSeek based its scenario on previous bear markets and took into account some potential macroeconomic pressures. On the Ethereum side, DeepSeek thinks that the largest altcoin could drop to between $993 and $1,656 from its current price. The model added that Ethereum’s wide usage could cushion the decline. Related News: Tether, The World's Largest Stablecoin Company, Reveals How Much Total Profit It Made In 2024 Speaking of Dogecoin, DeepSeek wrote the most negative scenario for DOGE. According to the model, in a bear market, the price of DOGE could fall to $0.05 to $0.10. He attributed this prediction to the fact that speculative assets like DOGE experience heavier losses in bear markets. Finally, DeepSeek, which shared its lowest level predicted for XRP in 2025, predicted that the coin could decline to the $0.76 to $1.22 region if it encounters any legal obstacles. *This is not investment advice.

BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner is changing the GameFi landscape by partnering with OKX, allowing users to securely store and manage their NFTs. This integration bridges the gap between gaming and crypto, making it easier for players to engage with digital assets. Mysten Labs is also making strides in accessibility with Sui SMS, a feature that allows users to conduct blockchain transactions using simple text messages. This opens up the world of blockchain to those who may not have internet access or are unfamiliar with digital wallets. On the investment side, Polkadot (DOT) is showing promising signs of growth, with analysts predicting a significant price increase. While these innovations showcase the advancements of Web3, BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner stands out in the gaming industry with its unique blend of security, user-friendliness, and profitability. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner and OKX: A New Era of Play-to-Earn BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner is making a splash in the GameFi world through its recent integration with OKX. This partnership allows users to store and manage their TG Tap Miner NFTs directly within the OKX wallet, enhancing both accessibility and security for players. By connecting gaming with crypto asset management, BlockDAG is solidifying its place in the rapidly expanding play-to-earn ecosystem. This seamless integration with OKX makes it simple for TG Tap Miner players to access and trade their NFTs, encouraging wider adoption and participation. The involvement of a trusted platform like OKX adds credibility to BlockDAG’s ecosystem as play-to-earn gaming gains traction. This move is also in line with BlockDAG’s ongoing strategic expansion, which has already attracted significant interest. BlockDAG’s presale continues to break records, having raised over $187 million so far. The 27th batch is currently priced at $0.0248, representing an impressive 2,380% increase in value since the initial batch. With over 18.2 billion BDAG coins sold, there’s clear confidence in the project’s future. Miner sales have also been strong, with over 15,500 miners sold, generating over $6.2 million in revenue. TG Tap Miner is more than just another GameFi project; it’s leading the way in blockchain gaming by combining accessibility, security, and profitability. With BDAG’s impressive presale figures and growing mainstream adoption, BlockDAG is demonstrating the staying power of play-to-earn gaming and its potential to reshape how users interact with Web3. Sui SMS: Bringing Blockchain to Everyone Mysten Labs has introduced Sui SMS, a feature that allows users to conduct blockchain transactions through text messages. This aims to simplify blockchain interaction, making it accessible to those without internet access or who are less familiar with digital wallets. By sending a simple SMS, users can execute transactions on the Sui blockchain, increasing participation in decentralized finance. This approach addresses inclusivity concerns within the crypto space while also improving the overall user experience. As blockchain technology becomes more integrated into daily life, such initiatives are vital to ensure that its benefits reach a wider audience. Polkadot (DOT): Is a Bullish Reversal on the Horizon? Polkadot (DOT) recently ended a 55-day correction, stabilizing around $6, which coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. This suggests a potential bullish reversal, with a breakout above $6.31 possibly propelling DOT towards $7.34 and $8.22. Analysts are optimistic about DOT’s future, with price predictions for 2025 ranging from $15 to $35. This optimism is fueled by Polkadot’s interoperability and growing parachain ecosystem. However, it’s important to keep an eye on key support levels. A drop below $5.96 could invalidate the bullish outlook, potentially pushing DOT down to $5.19 or even $3.53. While Polkadot has strong fundamentals, external market factors could influence its price trajectory. Polkadot’s ability to hold key support levels and gain momentum will be crucial in determining its medium-term direction. Final Thoughts Projects like BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner, Sui SMS, and Polkadot showcase different approaches to accessibility, gaming, and investment growth within the blockchain space. TG Tap Miner’s integration with OKX strengthens its position in the GameFi sector by prioritizing security and user experience, setting it apart in the play-to-earn arena. Sui SMS focuses on simplifying transactions to make blockchain more inclusive. Meanwhile, Polkadot’s price action indicates potential gains for investors who closely monitor key support levels. Each of these initiatives contributes to the broader adoption of blockchain technology. TG Tap Miner’s unique combination of asset security and user engagement positions it as a leader in the exciting world of blockchain-powered gaming.

Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) is gaining attention from whales. As a hybrid Layer-2 solution, PlutoChain aims to enhance Bitcoin’s capabilities by introducing smart contracts and decentralized applications, potentially transforming Bitcoin into a more versatile platform. This development could bridge Ethereum’s adaptability with Bitcoin’s security, potentially making PlutoChain an interesting project to keep an eye on. Whale Sells Off a Huge Amount Of Pepe Coin: How Will This Impact Pepe Coin’s Price? Recently, significant whale sell-offs have shaken Pepe Coin’s market stability. Over 1.1 trillion PEPE tokens were offloaded, leading to a 17% price drop within 24 hours. One notable transaction involved a whale depositing 430 billion PEPE tokens, worth approximately $6.39 million, into Binance, intensifying the downward pressure. Another whale recently offloaded 500 billion PEPE tokens , valued at approximately $5.73 million, making an astronomical 17,026x return. The wallet known as “0xc25” bought 4.914 trillion PEPE tokens back in April 2023. These large-scale sell-offs have increased the number of PEPE tokens on exchanges by 1.31%, from 237.18 trillion to 240.28 trillion, creating a surplus in the market. The sudden influx of tokens has eroded recent gains, pushing prices below $0.000014 and raising concerns about PEPE’s ability to recover. Whales Eye PlutoChain – An Innovative Hybrid Layer-2 Solution Made for Bitcoin Bitcoin’s evolution may potentially enter an intriguing chapter with PlutoChain . As the first hybrid Layer-2 solution tailored for Bitcoin, PlutoChain could expand Bitcoin’s utility beyond being a store of value. It plans to introduce smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and innovations like DeFi, NFTs, and AI, possibly reshaping Bitcoin’s role in the blockchain ecosystem. Its groundbreaking approach that uses the Layer-2 solution offers an average 2-second block time compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time. This innovation alone could make Bitcoin more competitive with other faster projects like Solana and Cardano. Developers could gain seamless migration from Ethereum due to PlutoChain’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, potentially opening a bridge between Ethereum’s flexibility and Bitcoin’s security. With its governance system, PlutoChain embraces community-driven decision-making, potentially enabling its users to shape the protocol’s direction. This feature might ensure alignment with user needs and create a dynamic and adaptive ecosystem. The network has proven its readiness through impressive metrics, processing over 43,200 daily transactions on its testnet. Furthermore, independent audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi validate PlutoChain’s commitment to security. PlutoChain could also address Bitcoin’s underdeveloped DeFi market, where the Total Value Locked (TVL) remains only 0.13% of Bitcoin’s market cap, compared to Ethereum’s 10%. Final Words Pepe Coin could potentially face a steep 50% decline as whales sell off massive amounts, causing market instability and oversupply. Whales are shifting focus to projects with real utility, like PlutoChain ($PLUTO) . As the first hybrid Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, PlutoChain plans to introduce smart contracts, dApps, and faster block times, which could revolutionize its network Its EVM compatibility and community-driven governance could transform Bitcoin’s role in DeFi and blockchain innovation. —————— This article is not financial advice.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has bounced back to the $0.00002 price point, raising hopes within its community, although its long-term growth is still uncertain. Similarly, Polkadot (DOT) is on the verge of a bullish surge, catching the eye of technical traders with a potential rise to $17. Amid these well-known names, Web3Bay stands out, revolutionizing e-commerce through blockchain. Web3Bay: A Blockchain Revolution in E-Commerce! Imagine a place where online shopping isn’t controlled by big companies that charge high fees and collect your data. Enter Web3Bay—a blockchain-based marketplace changing how we think about e-commerce. Unlike traditional sites, Web3Bay lets buyers and sellers deal directly, cutting out the middleman, reducing fees, and securing data like never before. It’s smarter, quicker, and fairer e-commerce. The standout feature? The 3BAY token. It’s more than just payment; it’s your ticket to discounts, staking rewards, and a say in the platform’s future through its upcoming DAO. Plus, Web3Bay plans to add NFT marketplaces and cross-chain functions, making it a comprehensive solution for decentralized trading. Web3Bay’s token presale is making a splash, with over $1 million raised and more than 260 million tokens sold at just $0.004562 each. Early investors are looking at a potential 6,430% ROI, with a launch price projected at $0.1959. This isn’t just a chance to invest—it’s a step into a future reshaping global commerce. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Regains Key Price Point: Will It Maintain? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has reclaimed the $0.00002 level, a significant mark that has previously influenced the market. While this indicates some interest, the overall market trend remains wary. The recovery lacks strong trading volume, crucial for sustained growth and confidence. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show neutral to bearish conditions, pointing to a tepid response from traders. SHIB is still under key moving averages, which suggests it faces hurdles in maintaining a bullish pattern. Polkadot Approaching Potential Breakout: Will DOT Price Hit $17? Polkadot (DOT) is hinting at a possible breakout, catching the attention of traders with a bullish pennant pattern—a sign often pointing to continued gains. This pattern followed a notable rise from $3.75 to $10.68, with the price now hovering around $6.30. However, despite the positive outlook, DOT is facing challenges in maintaining momentum, evidenced by a 24-hour drop of 2.92% and a trading volume decrease of 37% to $169.94 million. This cautious mood among investors reflects a wait-and-see approach as they look for a breakout confirmation. The critical resistance for DOT sits at the $7.16 Fibonacci retracement. Surpassing this could see targets of $10.68 and potentially $17. But, a failure to break through might push the price below $6.00. The Money Flow Index (MFI), sitting at 32.54, shows some interest in buying but remains low, suggesting that the market is still wary. For those looking at DOT, a breakout could offer a promising chance, though patience is crucial during this period of uncertainty. Final Thoughts While Shiba Inu (SHIB) strives to find its footing and Polkadot (DOT) looks towards a breakout, Web3Bay is emerging as a compelling crypto choice. SHIB’s recovery is largely dependent on increased trading activity and interest, whereas DOT’s potential breakout is yet to be confirmed, linked closely with pivotal Fibonacci levels. Meanwhile, Web3Bay showcases significant strides with its innovative e-commerce platform, extensive development roadmap, and successful presale.Early backers of Web3Bay’s 3BAY token are poised for potentially massive returns, benefiting from a platform aimed at addressing real-world inefficiencies in e-commerce.

39746140,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=687444,1738353657,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Get Ready: XRP Set To Skyrocket To $4.39, Says Trading Guru",https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-skyrocket-4-39-trading-guru/,"Renowned technical analyst Peter Brandt stirred up the XRP community on January 30 by posting a daily price chart (XRP/USDT) suggesting a “bull flag” continuation pattern. Brandt, whose reputation in charting spans decades, highlighted $4.39541 as the upper price objective based on the current market structure. “Hey XRP_pill_poppers. To be clear: I could care less what XRP is going to do. If it goes up I want to be long. If it goes down I’ve never shorted it, but prefer to troll the poppers. No other way right now to define the chart other than a bull flag. Of course this could change,” Brandt remarked. XRP Bull Flag Formation From the analyst’s vantage point, XRP rallied sharply earlier in January, pushing above $2.6040 before topping near $3.2140. Once this peak formed, the market entered a brief pullback, creating a series of lower highs and lower lows—visualized by descending trendlines on Brandt’s chart. This consolidation resembles a textbook bull flag, a pattern typically interpreted as a pause in an ongoing uptrend. Brandt’s projected breakout could target the next prominent overhead region near $3.5487, with his ultimate bullish objective in the vicinity of $4.39541. These levels—shown by green lines on the chart—indicate possible resistance areas if XRP extends its rally upon confirming the flag’s upper boundary. Two moving averages are visible on Brandt’s chart: The 8-day moving average (green line) is currently hovering just above $3.00. It is helping to define short-term support levels. The 18-day moving average (orange line) is sloping upwards from below $2.70 and reinforces the broader uptrend in play. Meanwhile, the ADX reading of 17.05 suggests that the overall trend strength is moderate, leaving room for greater momentum if price breaks decisively from the flag. A 30-day Average True Range (ATR) value near 0.2135 underscores the daily volatility, which has risen compared to earlier phases but remains contained relative to some high-beta alternative coins. Brandt’s post sparked discussion among traders, including HTL-NL (@htltimor), who noted bullish confirmations using Wyckoff analysis. “Using Wyckoff, it looks good too. Of course, if $TC takes a dive, everything suffers, but it’s one of the better looking alt charts atm,” he stated. Brandt replied with approval, stating “Good confirmation from a good source.” According to the Wyckoff-based chart shared by HTL-NL, XRP has been tracing a series of classic phases—Beginning with the Automatic Rally (AR) after a Selling Climax (SC), followed by multiple Secondary Tests (ST), and culminating in what appears to be a Sign of Strength (SoS). The SoS label often marks the point at which demand decisively overcomes supply, with price pushing above a key resistance level and maintaining support above previously tested zones. This behavior is further supported by volume signatures that show interest resurging during rallies and diminishing on pullbacks. In Wyckoff terms, a successful SoS within a re-accumulation structure typically paves the way for continued upside. The blue line labeled “BUEC” (Back Up to Edge of the Creek) suggests XRP has already retested its last major resistance as support. Should it hold these levels and confirm the SoS, Wyckoff analysts would anticipate a drive toward higher targets, aligning with Brandt’s bullish flag projection. At press time, XRP traded at $3.09.

The broader crypto market showed stability as Grayscale launched its DOGE Trust on Friday. This move expands Grayscale’s suite of crypto investment products, raising speculation about Dogecoin’s potential to reach $1 soon. Will Grayscale’s Trust Send Dogecoin Price to $1? Dogecoin price saw increased attention after Grayscale introduced its Dogecoin Trust, broadening its crypto investment offerings. The move underscores DOGE’s shift from a memecoin to a potential financial asset. The launch follows growing interest in Dogecoin-related investment products. Bitwise recently filed for a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Market analysts suggest a spot DOGE ETF could be a major price catalyst. Grayscale also recently sought SEC approval to convert its XRP Trust into an ETF. The regulator’s stance on crypto ETFs remains a key market driver. Bitcoin ETFs initially triggered short-term dips but later contributed to long-term gains. Investors are now closely watching whether a Dogecoin ETF could follow a similar path.

A chart in the tweet shows the meme coins trading around $0.334, with technical indicators suggesting a potential breakout. Fibonacci retracement levels highlight key resistance zones while moving averages indicate a steady upward trend. Dogecoin has historically seen price surges driven by market sentiment and community enthusiasm. If bullish momentum continues, analysts believe the $1 target could become achievable in the coming months. DOGE Price Analysis DOGE price is at $0.32834, marking a 3.29% drop in the last 24- hours, as technical indicators signal mixed momentum. The meme coin faces strong resistance at $0.35 and support at $0.30, creating a tight trading range. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 45, hovering below the neutral 50 level. The MACD indicator shows weak bullish momentum, with the MACD line slightly above the signal line. The Dogecoin price prediction struggles to maintain upward momentum, with repeated rejections around $0.35. A breakout above this level could open the door to $0.40, while failure to hold $0.32 may expose $0.30 as the next major support. Dogecoin Price Chart: TradingView To sum up, the Dogecoin price path to $1 depends on market sentiment, ETF developments, and price momentum. A breakout above $0.35 could fuel gains, while rejection may keep DOGE in consolidation.

With its cross-chain compatibility, privacy features, and high staking rewards, 1Fuel is attracting massive investor attention. Could these early buyers know something the market hasn’t realized yet? As whispers of 100x growth potential for 1Fuel grow louder, it’s time to dive into what’s driving this strategic accumulation. Pepe’s (PEPE) tough start to the year continues Pepe is facing a rough start to the year, trading at $0.00001266 after a 36.26% drop in the past 30 Days. January has been particularly challenging, with the launch of TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins further disrupting its momentum. Despite strong expectations, Pepe’s Q4 2024 listings on Coinbase and Robinhood failed to trigger the explosive rally investors had hoped for. Instead, analysts are now adopting a cautious and bearish outlook and questioning its short-term potential. For Pepe to regain traction, it must break past the $0.00002 resistance level. However, the coin could slip further to $0.000011 if the downward pressure continues. While uncertainty looms, dedicated holders remain hopeful that Pepe can reclaim its place among the top-performing meme coins in 2025. Why Pepe Whales are Quietly Accumulating 1Fuel Standing out in a market flooded with new crypto projects requires more than hype. 1Fuel ($OFT) distinguishes itself by focusing on utility, innovation, and investor rewards. While some tokens, like Pepe, rose to fame through viral momentum, 1Fuel’s solid technological foundation offers tangible solutions for crypto users. One of 1Fuel's best features is its cross-chain compatibility—its ability to transact across various blockchains without leaving the wallet. This innovation eliminates the barriers to interoperability for all those managing multiple digital assets. Another area where 1Fuel excels is privacy. It features cold storage to safeguard assets offline and a privacy mixer to offer extra security and anonymity. These features make 1Fuel the smart option for crypto investors seeking security and privacy. However, 1Fuel is more than a utility; it offers users passive income. With staking rewards of up to 30%, users can earn while holding the tokens. 1Fuel provides a straightforward DEX wallet for both seasoned and new investors. The presale is operating smoothly; Investors hold over 160 million tokens, and prices jumped from $0.01 in stage one to $0.017 in stage three. Investors who got in early have reaped 70% returns on their investments. Analysts anticipate 500% gains in the presale and up to 100x once 1Fuel lists on major exchanges. For those looking to get in on the ground floor, buying now gets you an extra 20% bonus. 1Fuel is projected to post huge gains until December 2025. With real-world use cases, robust security, and cross-chain features, 1Fuel presents one of the most revolutionary investment opportunities in crypto this year. Grab the opportunity to be part of the next big thing in the market.

Crypto followers are noting significant interest in Ethereum as investors prepare for future growth, and Solana shows strong price performance with recent updates to its system. While major players like Ethereum and Solana are often in the spotlight, a notable development is happening with Web3Bay , featured in the top crypto presales of 2025. The 3BAY token presale is rapidly attracting attention, showing a 15% price increase with each phase and a potential 6430% ROI by its launch. With a finite supply of tokens and solid applications in decentralized e-commerce, early participants could see considerable advantages before Web3Bay fully launches. Such opportunities are fleeting. The Impact of Web3Bay’s Presale Web3Bay’s presale is a key player among the top crypto presales of 2025. As the price of 3BAY tokens rises 15% at every presale phase, time is essential for those aiming to maximize their investments. Early buyers are already witnessing significant gains, with an anticipated ROI of 6430% from the initial to the final presale price. This limited opportunity rewards those who act quickly and see the platform’s potential to transform decentralized e-commerce. The presale has collected over $1 million by January 2025, with over 260 million 3BAY tokens sold. These figures demonstrate the strong interest from an informed audience that sees the long-term benefits of Web3Bay’s ecosystem. Investors can acquire tokens at a reduced rate and enjoy a 5% discount on purchases made with 3BAY on the platform. As interest in Ethereum builds, Web3Bay presents a compelling alternative to capitalize on blockchain for real-world applications. What distinguishes Web3Bay is its scalability and future strategies. With plans for decentralized governance, NFT integration, and smooth crypto and fiat transactions, the platform is poised for sustainable expansion. Delaying could mean missing out on a transformative opportunity in e-commerce. Act now to secure your portion of 3BAY tokens before prices increase further. Ethereum’s Growing Interest from Investors Recently, there’s been a noticeable rise in Ethereum accumulation activity, with investors increasingly focusing on long-term gains. Ethereum’s roadmap for improved scalability, including layer-2 solutions and blob scaling, has sparked fresh optimism about its future growth. These enhancements are boosting investor confidence and affirming Ethereum’s status as a favored investment for future planning. The momentum behind Ethereum is also being propelled by its growing acceptance in institutional circles. Last year’s approval of nine Ether ETFs provided regulated pathways to ETH, drawing a wider audience to the cryptocurrency. With its price at $3,218.67, Ethereum continues to be a preferred choice for diversifying investment portfolios and leveraging growth within its ecosystem. This phase of accumulation reflects a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term prospects among its community. The Ongoing Rise of Solana (SOL) Solana’s rally has been making headlines with its consistent price increase, now at $251.28, alongside significant ecosystem enhancements. These upgrades are fortifying Solana’s infrastructure and fostering broader adoption among decentralized applications and NFT platforms. The rally gains further support from positive market sentiment, with forecasts of possible interest rate cuts in 2025 enhancing Solana’s attractiveness. As the crypto community keeps an eye on Ethereum’s accumulation, Solana offers a viable alternative with its high-performance capabilities, lower fees, and quicker transactions. The escalating interest in projects based on Solana and the potential introduction of Solana ETFs underscore its promising outlook. As SOL continues its upward trajectory, it offers an attractive prospect for those exploring opportunities beyond Ethereum, capitalizing on its innovative advances. Overview of Current Trends In 2025, both Ethereum and Solana are demonstrating robust activity. Ethereum’s accumulation is underpinned by confidence in its scalability initiatives and institutional backing, whereas Solana’s rally highlights its increasing adoption and robust position in the blockchain arena. Amid these established giants, the presale of Web3Bay stands out as a critical opportunity for early investors. The 3BAY token’s rapid price increase and a potential 6430% ROI make it one of the top crypto presales of 2025. With a limited number of tokens and innovative features like decentralized governance and crypto-enabled e-commerce, Web3Bay is set to transform its sector. Act quickly to acquire 3BAY tokens before the crypto presale concludes—a strategic move with substantial potential returns.

Citing a person familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that in recent weeks, Stanford Law School Professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried met with lawyers and other figures considered close to Trump to discuss a potential clemency for their son. Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted on charges stemming from the collapse of the FTX exchange, which he co-founded in 2019. He is currently serving a sentence of 25 years in prison. Trump has granted executive clemency to over 1,500 individuals charged or convicted of criminal offenses since his return to the White House this January. The president, who vowed to implement crypto reforms during his term, pardoned imprisoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who has gained strong support from the crypto industry and the libertarian movement. Bankman-Fried does not have the same level of support as Ulbricht’s but his lawyers have previously argued that his sentence was draconian since the customers of FTX have largely recovered the funds they initially lost. The report says former FTX executive Ryan Salame, who was sentenced to more than seven years in prison, is also seeking a pardon.

33767162,[object Object],1738357247,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ethereum Is About To Enter Its Most Bullish Month In History, Here’s What To Expect",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-most-bullish-month/,"Amid its underperformance, Ethereum is set to enter its most bullish month in history. This has sparked a positive sentiment among investors, who hope for a bullish reversal. Crypto analysts have also made bullish predictions for ETH based on the crypto’s historical performance in February. What To Expect As Ethereum Enters Its Most Bullish Month Cryptorank data indicates that investors can expect Ethereum to make significant gains as it enters its most bullish month in February. ETH has recorded positive monthly closes in February for the last six years. In fact, the crypto has only recorded a negative monthly close once, which was in 2020. Last year, Ethereum recorded a 46.7% gain in February, its second-highest monthly gain in 2024, behind the 47.4% gain it recorded in November. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that ETH’s average monthly gain in February is 34.4%. Based on this, the ETH price could rally to as high as $4,300 . Such a rally would be significant as it could pave the way to a new all-time high (ATH) for Ethereum, as crypto analysts like Ali Martinez have suggested. Martinez recently alluded to ETH’s bullish historical performance in February as one reason why this wasn’t the right time to give up on it. Crypto analyst Ted also made a bullish case for ETH heading into February. He predicted that the crypto could rally to as high as $4,500 next month and that a new all-time high for ETH by March is highly likely, especially if Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial keeps buying Ethereum. Interestingly, in another X post, the analyst also predicted that ETH could rally to between $9,000 and $10,000 in the next three to four months. Crypto analysts like Titan of Crypto and CrediBULL Crypto have also predicted that ETH can reach $10,000 in this market cycle. Ethereum’s Roadmap For 2025 In an X post, Titan of Crypto highlighted Ethereum’s 2025 roadmap while asserting that ETH is gearing up for a major move up this year. As part of the roadmap, he highlighted profit zones on his accompanying chart, in which investors should be looking to secure profits. The first take profit zone he highlighted is at $5,664.

Dogecoin is showing resilience in the crypto market, currently trading within a range of $0.3131 to $0.3800. Despite a recent weekly dip of over 8%, DOGE has seen a monthly rise of more than 6%. The coin’s RSI sits just above 54, hinting at a balanced market sentiment. If DOGE can break through the nearest resistance at $0.4244, it has the potential to climb towards the next level at $0.4913, representing a possible gain of nearly 30%. With a 6-month surge of almost 198%, Dogecoin enthusiasts remain optimistic about a bullish breakout in the coming altcoin season. Dogwifhat poised for a potential rebound amid market volatility Dogwifhat (WIF) is currently in a price range between $1.08 and $1.47. Despite recent declines, its potential for growth remains intriguing. With the nearest resistance level at $1.73, it’s close to breaking through for a possible rally. If it moves past this point, it could climb to the next resistance at $2.12, representing potential gains of over 40% from its lower range. The support levels of $0.95 and $0.55 indicate stable areas if the price dips lower. With a Relative Strength Index around 52, the coin’s momentum is neutral. While short-term trends show declines, Dogwifhat holds promise for a stronger performance in the altcoin season. Conclusion While established coins like DOGE and WIF show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero. Offering a potential 700% ROI during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it combines governance rights, rewards for participation, and staking for passive growth.

This settlement aligns with a lawsuit it filed against the venture outfit in June 2024, seeking $700 million in disputed investments. FTX Debtors and the K5 Global Settlement According to the announcement , both parties have agreed to work together to maximize recoveries for FTX stakeholders. The settlement update did not define whether FTX Debtors made any financial recoveries from K5 Global. However, FTX Exchange’s CEO, John Ray III, said the settlement is mutually beneficial, describing K5 as a bright spot in the crypto trading platform’s portfolio. K5 Global will actively use its resources to help the embattled firm recover more funds. The lawsuit filed by the FTX Debtors accused K5’s co-founder, Michael Kives, of using his political network to create a path for Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to siphon customer funds. As a former aid to Clinton’s Chief of Staff, Huma Abedin, Kives had the network that SBF coveted. The lawsuit at the time was filed as part of the extensive push to recover assets for the FTX creditors. Other High-Profile FTX Debtors Legal Cases As it is at the tail end of its bankruptcy proceedings, the embattled firm is resolving some of its high-profile cases with former industry partners. As reported earlier by CoinGape, LayerZero has confirmed a settlement with FTX over a deal it made with Alameda Research just before the estate’s collapse in 2022. The FTX Debtors sued LayerZero in 2023, seeking to claw back $86 million in a share-sell agreement with Alameda. Following the settlement, the protocol said it had written its $11.5 share deal to $0, hoping it could recoup some back with the bankruptcy proceedings. In November last year, the exchange filed to recoup $67 million from Anthony Scaramucci as part of its funds recuperation proceedings. Other settlement deals it has inked include those featuring the forfeited $70 million from Sam Trabucco, a former Alameda Research executive. The Creditor Repayments After a lengthy process, the trading platform kicked off claims distribution and reorganization plans . While the plan was designed to last many weeks, the exchange had earmarked $6.5 billion for claims repayment. Beyond the creditor repayments, FTX Exchange has inked several other deals to help ease its financial burden. One of these deals is the sale of FTX EU to Backpack , a deal that will involve the latter repaying all creditor claims in the region.

Experts say 1Fuel will be a game changer for crypto traders, as it will improve blockchain interoperability, making it the go-to platform for simple asset transfers across different networks. Due to this utility, 1Fuel’s OFT token is poised to quickly grow in prominence and value. The budding token could be the next boom, and investors project a 500% surge when it lists on exchanges. Shiba Inu (SHIB) falls further below $0.000020 critical support as the bears grow in strength Crypto bears are not looking to relinquish control of Shiba Inu (SHIB) anytime soon. In the last Month, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has dropped by 12.6% , bringing its total weekly loss to more than 6%. Shiba Inu now trades at $0.000018, a slight drop from its critical support level of $0.000020. Analysts forecast that if Shiba Inu (SHIB) fails to reverse this dip soon, it could further plunge towards $0.000010. Shiba Inu holders are weary of this possibility and are looking to hedge against losses. Many Shiba Inu investors are now diversifying to 1Fuel as the emerging altcoin is projected to grow over 500% by 2025. Pepe's (PEPE) struggles continue as meme hype fades Pepe (PEPE) is among the meme coins heavily leveraging meme hype and community support. However, the current market condition is demanding more than that to gain traction. This has left Pepe struggling since the new year. PEPE has dropped by 36.45% in the past month, plunging from the $0.00002825 all-time high it set in December 2024. PEPE trades at $0.000013 at present time, and a sustained bearish pressure could push it below $0.000010. This has sparked pessimism among some PEPE holders, and their panic selling could result in further price dips. Analysts say PEPE may reverse the current bearish run before 2025 runs out. However, many Pepe investors are shifting focus to 1Fuel as it offers a higher gain potential. Cross-chain utility and anonymity: Can 1Fuel be the next top crypto project? The 1Fuel project is set for a game-changing impact in DeFi. The crypto solution is coming with a one-click technology that will simplify asset transfers across different blockchains and reduce transaction fees. This will make the platform attractive to traders. Beyond eliminating complexities, 1Fuel will ensure users can conceal their details by utilizing a top-grade mixer technology that guarantees anonymity. 1Fuel will equally facilitate proper asset management by leveraging AI to provide market insights and offering offline storage options to enhance users’ control over their assets. The crypto project will also provide users the opportunity to earn passively by holding its utility token, OFT, or contributing to its liquidity pool. 1Fuel’s OFT token holders will earn up to 30% APY from staking and can get other tokenized incentives from active community engagement. 1Fuel’s presale has been generating lots of buzz as over $1.6 million has been raised in just a few days. Early birds have reaped over 70% gains so far and market experts predict a 500% surge before its official launch. With a low price of $0.017 per OFT, joining the 1Fuel presale now is a great opportunity to capitalize on its immense potential. Don’t miss out!

After years of fragmented approaches to regulation and legislation, we've reached a moment where clarity is both urgent and achievable. Blockchain Association's consensus-driven market structure principles , which represent the perspective of the leading companies in the industry, offer a framework for the path forward. The market structure principles that emerged from this collaborative effort reflect the maturation of the industry and the focus required to enact meaningful legislation and achieve smart regulation. The principles tackle twelve key areas – at their core is a recognition that consumer protection and innovation are complementary, not competing, priorities. We call for standardized disclosures and robust safeguards while ensuring businesses can innovate without undue burden. This balanced approach extends to custody, where we advocate protecting individuals' right to self-custody their assets while establishing clear frameworks for institutional custody solutions. A crucial element of our framework is the distinction between financial activities and other, varied applications of blockchain technology. Smart regulation must focus on genuine financial risks without stifling innovation in non-financial uses of this technology. This extends to the treatment of non-custodial software, services, and smart contracts, which shouldn't face the same regulatory requirements as traditional financial intermediaries when they don't custody user assets. The principles also address one of the industry's most pressing challenges: token classification. We need clear frameworks for distinguishing between securities, commodities, and other digital assets. This clarity is essential for compliance and growth, particularly as the market matures and new types of tokens emerge. Our framework recognizes the global nature of digital assets while emphasizing and strengthening U.S. competitiveness. We advocate for reducing friction in cross-border transactions while ensuring U.S. markets remain attractive for investment and innovation. This includes establishing a single secondary trading market to enhance liquidity and price discovery. Developer protections form another crucial pillar of Blockchain Association’s principles. Open-source software developers shouldn't face liability when independent actors misuse their code. This protection is essential for maintaining the innovation that drives our industry forward. Similarly, we emphasize the importance of network participation - protecting the ability of individuals and institutions to engage in activities like staking, voting, and peer-to-peer transactions on permissionless networks. This consensus we’ve achieved on these principles matters because it signals to Congress and regulators that the industry is and has been ready for common sense regulation. We're not asking for special treatment or regulatory carve-outs. Instead, we're proposing clear rules of the road that protect consumers, foster innovation, and ensure U.S. competitiveness in a rapidly evolving global market. But this window of opportunity won't remain open indefinitely. Market developments, election cycles, and global competition create urgency for action. The industry has demonstrated its readiness to engage constructively with policymakers. We've shown that we can find common ground on complex issues and that we're committed to responsible innovation.For our Congressional allies, regulators in Washington D.C., and those newly engaging with these issues, these principles demonstrate that the industry is ready for serious policy discussion. For industry participants, they represent a shared vision of responsible market structure. For everyone involved, they offer a path forward at a crucial moment for the future of digital assets in the United States. The work of enacting smart regulations and drafting and passing legislation remains ahead. But with clear principles, industry alignment, and growing policy sophistication on both sides, we have an unprecedented opportunity to get this right. We have precious few months to get this done, let's not let this moment pass.",Opinion,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-31 21:13:34

Although most major meme coins were in serious trouble early in January, several are witnessing price rallies. Shiba Inu gained lately following early January losses. Analyzerswonder, though, if the altcoin could reach $1 soon. Meanwhile, a new project called Remittix (RTX) is getting a lot of attention for being unique. Unlike memecoins, it has a unique use case and a very impressive presale token, RTX. This token, currently priced at $0.0479, has been predicted to hit $1 soon. Is $1 Possible For Shiba Inu? The ""Dogecoin Killer,"" Shiba Inu, holds great promise. Still, the token's target would remain far from reaching $1. With around 590 trillion tokens, Shiba Inu's pricing point of $1 would cause a larger market capitalization than the usual token. A number of elements make SHIB less likely to hit $1. Even with best attempts to burn tokens, the sheer volume of SHIB in circulation makes notable price increases difficult. Shiba remains a speculative asset even if ShibaSwap and other initiatives provide some capability. Furthermore, the frenzy around meme coins is erratic, and investor focus is moving toward tokens with practical applications. Under these constraints, traders and investors are looking at Remittix as a substitute since it offers special uses and long-term growth potential and likelihood of hitting $1 faster. Remittix Is Set To Hit $1 Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients' bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform's open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0479 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth, with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 5,000% gains after launch, as demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with high growth potential at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal the success of other top altcoins but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis, and evident market demand.

Unlike meme coins, it boasts a distinct use case and features an impressive presale token, RTX. Currently priced at $0.0479, predictions suggest that RTX may soon reach the $1 mark. Can Shiba Inu Reach $1? Dubbed the ""Dogecoin Killer,"" Shiba Inu shows significant potential, yet a $1 price target remains distant. With an estimated 590 trillion tokens in circulation, achieving a $1 valuation would result in an unprecedented market cap. Several factors make it challenging for SHIB to hit the $1 milestone. Even with rigorous token burn efforts, the massive supply of SHIB makes substantial price hikes unlikely. Although projects like ShibaSwap add some utility, Shiba remains largely speculative. Moreover, the hype surrounding meme coins is unpredictable, with investor interest shifting towards tokens offering real-world use cases. Given these limitations, traders and investors are increasingly eyeing Remittix as an alternative. It offers unique applications and a promising growth trajectory, with a higher likelihood of reaching $1 sooner. Remittix Aims For $1 Remittix (RTX) is transforming global payments by merging blockchain with traditional fiat transactions, delivering rapid and economical cross-border solutions.

Notably, the platform's transparent flat-fee structure offers cost savings and clarity compared to the steep charges and poor exchange rates typical of traditional banks. This ensures that the full transferred amount reaches the recipient, positioning Remittix as a transformative force in the payments sector, where opaque practices are unfortunately common.

Qubetics, Litecoin, and Arbitrum (ARB) have emerged as some of the most promising projects in the evolving blockchain space. Qubetics is redefining digital asset management with its feature-rich wallet and key partnerships in DeFi. Litecoin remains in the spotlight following ETF speculation, though its price volatility raises concerns. Meanwhile, Arbitrum is cementing itself as a dominant Ethereum Layer 2 solution, providing faster and cheaper transactions for decentralized applications. These three cryptos are among the best investments for February 2025 , offering strong growth potential across various blockchain sectors. Qubetics Wallet Transforms Crypto Trading with Key Integrations Crypto wallets are the gateway to blockchain interactions, allowing users to easily store, trade, and manage their assets. The Qubetics Wallet , a core part of the Qubetics ecosystem, is set to provide a seamless, secure, and efficient solution for crypto users across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms. A significant milestone for Qubetics is its integration with 1inch Network, one of the most advanced DeFi aggregators. This partnership ensures optimized trade execution, access to hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and superior liquidity. Additionally, Qubetics has teamed up with SWFT Blockchain, bringing cross-chain functionality that enables users to swap and manage assets seamlessly across multiple networks. Qubetics’ 19th presale stage continues to attract strong investor demand, with $TICS currently valued at $0.0606 and total funding reaching $11.5 million. Over 17,600 investors have secured 453 million tokens, with the final presale price set at $0.25. Experts predict that post-mainnet, $TICS could rise to $10–$15, solidifying Qubetics as one of the best crypto investments for February 2025. Litecoin Faces ETF Speculation and Market Uncertainty Litecoin (LTC) saw a brief surge of over 20% after a second Litecoin ETF application was submitted on January 25, 2025. However, the price quickly dropped back to $122, signaling weak market momentum. Analysts are concerned that Litecoin’s inability to sustain gains despite positive news could indicate further declines, with some predicting a 15% price drop in the near future. The long-term potential of Litecoin hinges on whether the ETF gets approved. If successful, institutional investment could drive another price spike. However, until then, many investors remain hesitant, shifting their focus to projects with stronger momentum. Arbitrum Strengthens Its Position as a Leading Layer 2 Network Arbitrum is rapidly emerging as one of Ethereum’s top Layer 2 scaling solutions, addressing high gas fees and slow transaction speeds. By utilizing off-chain rollups, Arbitrum provides decentralized applications a faster and more cost-effective experience. The ARB token is gaining traction as more DeFi platforms and blockchain games migrate to Arbitrum’s ecosystem. With Ethereum congestion remaining a major issue, demand for scalable solutions like Arbitrum is expected to grow, making ARB one of the best cryptos to invest in February 2025. Conclusion Qubetics, Litecoin, and Arbitrum each offer distinct advantages for investors looking to capitalize on blockchain innovations. Qubetics is leading crypto wallet advancements, securing major DeFi partnerships that enhance its ecosystem. Litecoin remains a speculative play, with potential upside if an ETF is approved but uncertainty in the short term. Meanwhile, Arbitrum is strengthening its role as a critical Layer 2 solution, providing scalability for Ethereum’s growing ecosystem. With February 2025 approaching, these three cryptocurrencies stand out as strong contenders for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to emerging blockchain opportunities.

Uniswap Labs, the entity behind the decentralized exchange Uniswap, announced that its fourth-generation protocol is now available for public access. The upgrade introduces improvements aimed at enhancing developer operability and on-chain liquidity. According to a blog post from the company, Uniswap v4 is live on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, OP Mainnet, Base, BNB Chain, Blast, World Chain, Avalanche, and Zora Network as of January 31. The firm had initially planned to roll out v4 last year. However, delays occurred due to extensive code audits to ensure security and multiple hackathons to stress test the protocol’s code. Also, the team audited v4’s code nine times and even issued a $15.5 million bug bounty to troubleshoot any lingering architecture concerns. You might also like: FBI nabs crypto wash trading scheme on Uniswap Two of the most significant upgrades in Uniswap v4 are the introduction of “hooks” and the singleton liquidity design. Hooks, in particular, drew attention when v4 was announced, as the upgrade promised to transform Uniswap into a developer-focused decentralized application. The Labs describe Hooks as blockchain contracts built to allow custom architecture for liquidity pools, on-chain swaps, and crypto fees. Hooks goes hand-in-hand with the singleton liquidity framework, which blends Uniswap liquidity into a single smart contract. Uniswap engineers said the new liquidity architecture should enable cheaper transactions and faster swaps to better the end-user experience. Over 150 hooks have already been developed, introducing everything from dynamic fees to automated liquidity management. By allowing developers to build and experiment directly on top of the protocol, hooks enable faster development cycles and stickier integrations.

Panshibi ($SHIBI) is catching the eye of investors eager to find the next viral meme sensation. At the same time, Dogecoin Crypto(DOGE) appears to be losing steam, prompting questions about its ability to hold onto its top position. Could a Binance Listing Ignite Panshibi’s Price Surge? Crypto analysts suggest that if Panshibi gets listed on Binance in February, it could experience a 20x price jump in a matter of weeks, mirroring the trends seen with previous meme coin listings. Historically, major exchange listings have often resulted in rapid price spikes, as observed with earlier meme coins. Panshibi’s presale has demonstrated strong interest, currently in Stage 2 with the price increasing to $0.003 per token. With 13 stages remaining before its official launch, early investors are positioning themselves for a potential price surge. This viral meme coin offers features like AI-driven rewards, Social-Fi engagement, and lucrative staking options, setting itself apart from conventional meme coins such as Dogecoin Crypto. Experts believe these attributes give Panshibi a competitive edge in the long run. Past data indicates that Binance listings can lead to substantial price hikes. When Shiba Inu was listed, its price saw a more than 1,000% increase, driven by a surge in retail interest within just days. Similarly, Pepe experienced an 800% rise following its debut on the exchange. Should Panshibi follow this pattern, the predicted 20x jump in February might just be the start of its ascent. Dogecoin Crypto Faces Challenges Amidst New Rivals Once the leading figure in the meme coin sector, Dogecoin Crypto is now finding it difficult to compete with newer, more innovative projects. Despite its large fanbase and initial success, Dogecoin Crypto is struggling to maintain its upward momentum. The emergence of newer meme coins offering real-world applications has intensified the pressure on Dogecoin Crypto. Without introducing new features, many investors are shifting their focus to more promising alternatives. Moreover, Dogecoin Crypto is grappling with centralization issues, raising questions about its legitimacy as some speculate: Is it a scam? A small number of wallets hold a significant portion of its total supply. Reports indicate that nearly 50% of Dogecoin's supply is controlled by the top 20 wallets, sparking concerns over potential price manipulation and its sustainability in the long term. Additionally, institutional interest in Dogecoin Crypto has waned, with major investors gravitating towards meme coins that offer better staking rewards and DeFi capabilities, areas where Panshibi is making strides. As of January 29, 2025, Dogecoin Crypto(DOGE) is currently trading at $0.3257. Market analysts warn that without fresh developments and innovations, Dogecoin Crypto might continue to decline, particularly if rising coins like Panshibi keep capturing investor interest. As new investors join the crypto space, the demand for groundbreaking meme coins is increasing, challenging Dogecoin Crypto to innovate or risk losing its leading position. Reasons Investors Are Opting for Panshibi With Dogecoin Crypto showing signs of stagnation, investors are exploring alternatives that offer both growth and security. Here’s why Panshibi is becoming the top pick: ● Enormous Growth Potential: Analysts predict Panshibi could increase by 145,000% post-launch, based on early-stage investor interest and historical presale trends. after its launch, making it one of the highest-anticipated meme coins of 2025.● Security & Transparency: The project has completed a full smart contract audit and has locked its liquidity pool for 10 years, ensuring protection for investors.● Staking Rewards: Holders can earn up to 1,200% APY by staking their tokens, a feature missing in Dogecoin Crypto.● Community-Driven Model: Unlike Dogecoin Crypto, where large holders control a significant portion of the supply, Panshibi will renounce ownership after its presale, making it fully decentralized. Final Thoughts With Binance rumors heating up, Panshibi is quickly emerging as the most promising meme coin of 2025. Meanwhile, Dogecoin Crypto is facing increasing competition, and without major updates, it could struggle to maintain its market position. Investors looking for high-growth opportunities are already eyeing Panshibi’s presale , now at $0.003 per token.

To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto rideshare has died…again. Teleport — a decentralized rideshare startup — promised lower prices for riders, higher earnings for drivers and bountiful rewards for early adopters. But on Thursday, the project shut down , run aground trying to make the business work. Fellow OGs, I sense your déjà vu. Arcade City , La’Zooz , Chasyr , Ridecoin and more have all attempted to break Uber and Lyft’s stranglehold using blockchain-based incentives. Somehow, each has failed to gain social purchase. Like a lot of DePIN projects, the crypto rideshare concept depends on collective belief and a functional labor market. Projects face an uphill battle when participants can’t be sure who they’re working with, whether incentives will remain stable or whether the system itself will exist in six months. Plus, engagement in an actual ecosystem requires real work and participation. Yuck. The slow death of usefulness Sadly, it seems a lot of folks have lost the love of substance that the blockchain community once prized. An utter lack of social accountability has long transformed trust into a liability and utility into a sucker’s bet. It only takes a glance at crypto’s timeline to see how we got here. Bitcoin offered scarce digital money with transparent ownership — real utility with tangible value. Altcoins followed, building first and assigning value second. Then came ICOs, where mere ideas replaced the need to actually deliver working products, and NFTs, where hype fully eclipsed the promise of any actionable use case whatsoever (beyond feigned social hierarchy). Identifying problems became more profitable than solving them, and the space shifted from innovation to speculation. And then there were memecoins Memecoins don’t pretend to have real-world use cases, and that’s the point. They embrace chaos as a form of economic rebellion. Everything down to the puckishness with which participants insist upon calling the people behind these assets “devs” is an act of performative irony. Utility is a liability because it requires belief over time. Meme-based assets, on the other hand, are fully self-aware vehicles, operating in a no-holds-barred race to the exit. They’re fast, they’re easy and they make losing fun. Meanwhile, attempts to sneak utility into memecoins have flopped. McAfee’s AI memecoin tanked mid-AMA the moment its upcoming product suite was mentioned . The Venmo founder’s JellyJelly soared , then cratered 75% the instant its creator hinted at a roadmap. Reputation as the missing piece So why are promises of tangible value and effort so anathema to the current movement? Well, the optimism of belief is gone. We have so far failed to create sustainable methods of accountability, leaving investors to gamble in the dark. As a result, real builders have become indistinguishable from grifters looking for a quick cash grab. So why even bother? Just throw another $1000 on Fartcoin and call it a day. Looking back, we probably should have built Sybil-proof reputation systems in tandem with smart contracts and made blind trust a fundamental cornerstone of Web3 architecture. If we had methods to trace builders’ reputations, reveal asset distributions across a reputability mesh, and flag early mass exits based on transparent behavioral data, we might have preserved faith in long-term utility instead of fueling an endless cycle of speculation. Anonymity without accountability breeds chaos. And until that balance is restored, utility will always be a losing bet. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP and Remittix are gaining momentum, with both showing strong growth potential in 2025 despite market volatility. Table of Contents Analyst says XRP price could rally to $5 Remittix is changing cross-border payments Remittix aims to challenge xRP price momentum in 2025 The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced sideways movements in the past few days. However, market participants have been optimistic, suggesting the market could witness a relief rally that could kickstart a wave of bull runs in the months ahead. Meanwhile, Ripple and Remittix, two payment heavyweights, are also on track to surge in 2025. XRP’s rally has been impressive, surging by over 40% in the past month and over 500% in the past three months. Despite the recent market crash, XRP’s strong fundamentals have fueled positive bullish sentiments. Remittix ( RTX), on the other hand, has delivered over 220% returns for its early adopters. Market participants expect RTX to soar higher due to its unique PayFi solution, which addresses inefficiencies in the traditional global payment industry.

Top market analyst Dark Defender shared an optimistic XRP price prediction, suggesting that the token is at a crucial juncture. According to his analysis, the price of XRP has neared its conclusion of the ABC corrective wave pattern on its daily time frame. He pointed out that if XRP breaks the $3.11 level, it could experience a surge to its Fibonacci Orbit Levels, with the $5.85 level becoming its first target. Hi there. $XRP has almost finalised the ABC Corrective Wave pattern in the daily time frame! It will be confirmed if XRP breaks $3.11. I expect XRP to break here within 24 hours. Road to Fibonacci Orbit Levels at: $5.85 first & then $18.22. Not Financial Advice… pic.twitter.com/Fy5aHDhBZ7 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) January 28, 2025 Its second target will be around $18.22. Market watchers are keeping a close eye on the crypto despite bullish predictions. Another market analyst highlighted a critical support level for the token if it slips downward. Rose Premium Signal hinted at a potential dip, suggesting the $2.7 level could act as support. The brief correction could provide investors with a buying opportunity. Moreover, the crypto could surge to the $4 level and continue its rally to $5, aligning with Dark Defender’s forecast. Notably, XRP whales have accumulated 120 million during this downturn, suggesting investors’ strong confidence in the crypto asset. Several factors, like Ripple receiving Money Transmitter licenses in New York and Texas, have influenced the bullish sentiment. In the long run, XRP crypto could flip Ethereum, securing the second position by market capitalization. This suggests the market’s bullish outlook on the altcoin, indicating a looming price surge ahead. Remittix is changing cross-border payments The remittance sector, valued at over $750b yearly, continues to grow rapidly. Moreover, Remittix, a game-changing solution for the global remittance market, aims to eliminate the heavy fees and long processing times associated with traditional cross-border transactions. Remittix will also close the gap between crypto and conventional banks by deftly combining blockchain technology with local payment systems. Moreover, the project is quickly becoming one of the best prospects available today owing to its creative solution of providing individuals and companies with a faster and more reasonably priced means of worldwide fund transfers. This will help solve the most challenging issues within the cross-border payment sector, backed by unmatched transparency, minimal fees, and real-time transaction processing. Remittix will also provide a customer-centric approach free from the aggravations of conventional banking systems. Its open transparency on all transaction prices outshines traditional financial institutions, which have been choked with exorbitant fees. The platform supports 40-plus cryptos and over 30 fiat currencies, enabling users to quickly turn their digital assets into cash and send the money across any bank worldwide. The uniqueness of Remittix has already been seen with the increasing adoption of the RTX token in its presale stages. In just a few weeks, Remittix has already raised over $10m. Its price has also surged by over 219%, allowing early investors to enjoy better ROI. Moreover, the RTX price is also looking to rally towards the $0.05 level from a current price of $0.0498. Remittix aims to challenge xRP price momentum in 2025 Ripple’s price is gearing up for another rally that could see the XRP token target the $5 level in 2025. Similarly, Remittix is also forging its way by tackling key issues within the $750 billion remittance sector. Having already raised over $10m with an over 220% rally in just a few weeks, Remittix has set the base for more gains that could see the RTX token challenge XRP price movement in 2025.

This massive surge has led to the removal of over 1.1 billion tokens from circulation, effectively reducing the token’s significant supply. The latest sharp increase in SHIB burns have also caught the attention of the crypto market, bringing focus to the factors driving this substantial surge and its potential impact on the meme coin. What’s Driving The Surge In Shiba Inu Burn Rate Shibburn, a token burn tracker, has reported a massive 7,240.75% increase in Shiba Inu burn rate in the past 24 hours. Astonishingly, this substantial token burn led to the permanent removal of approximately 1,104,706,719 SHIB tokens from circulation. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees Major 600% Jump In Only 24 Hours, Will SHIB Price Follow Suit? Notably, the driving force behind this massive SHIB burn was identified to be a single wallet. This anonymous wallet address, ox6d0cf1f…, was responsible for more than 95% of this substantial Shiba Inu burn, sending approximately 1,000,148,675 SHIB tokens to a dead wallet. Following this, another address initiated a 100,000,000 SHIB burn, contributing to a significant amount of the burn activity. These combined efforts from Shiba Inu enthusiasts and community members have significantly impacted the circulating supply of SHIB, increasing the possibilities of a price surge in the meme coin. Typically, token burns are executed with the intention to increase scarcity and potentially drive up the value of a token over time. Since its inception in 2020, a total of 410.74 trillion SHIB tokens have been burnt from its initial supply of 999.98 trillion. Currently, the total supply of this meme coin stands at 589.2 trillion, reflecting a 41% decrease from its original amount. This reduction occurred in less than 5 years, marking a significant milestone for the Shiba Inu ecosystem. If burn rate continues to skyrocket, it could cause further deflation of supply, potentially leading to goals of many Shiba Inu community members, which is to drive the value of the meme coin to over $1. SHIB Price Dips Seen As Golden Opportunity Despite the increase in Shiba Inu’s burn rate, its price has remained unaffected, even declining by over $8.3% in the past week. The doggy-themed meme coin crashed from its previous high above $0.00002 to $0.0000186 as of writing. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Gearing Up To Fly After Lows, Here’s The Target While Shiba Inu faces this bearish trend, a crypto analyst SHIB Bezos, has highlighted the significant buying opportunities investors could take advantage of during this time. The analyst suggests that at some point, Shiba Inu will become oversold, and sellers will eventually get “exhausted”, leading to a rise in the price of the meme coin. Ahead of this increase, SHIB Bezos urges investors to take advantage of dip opportunities to buy more SHIB tokens at a discount and HODL for a long term growth potential of about 5-10 years.

With a jaw-dropping 50,000% growth potential, this token has already raised $1 million in minutes during its presale. With Bitcoin (BTC) crossing $100,000 and XRP’s recent 500% surge might seem impressive, but none can rival the explosive potential and exclusivity driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN forward. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines XRP and Others 1. Massive Growth Potential: XRP’s 500% returns pale in comparison to the staggering 50,000% potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Early investors are already seeing the impact of this token’s high demand and limited availability, making it the standout choice for transformative returns. 2. Exclusive Sale Creates High Demand: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN. This strategic exclusivity has heightened interest and secured its place as one of the most sought-after tokens. 3. Strong Community Support: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN thrives on a loyal and engaged community, driving organic growth and market demand. This strong backing amplifies its visibility and positions it as a top choice for long-term success. How It Stacks Up Against Other Cryptos Ethereum (ETH): A DeFi leader, but its growth has plateaued compared to early-stage tokens like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN. Solana (SOL): Strong in scalability, but SOL can’t match the exclusivity and skyrocketing demand of this new token. Optimism (OP): A Layer-2 solution with promise, but its gains are modest compared to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s potential. Injective Protocol (INJ): A promising DeFi player, but it hasn’t generated the same overwhelming excitement. The Crypto Everyone’s Talking About THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has already set new standards in the market. With its explosive potential, exclusive access, and investor confidence, this token is on track to deliver life-changing returns.

This is reminiscent of purchasing BTC in 2010, ETH in 2015, or BNB in 2017. I could continue listing these groundbreaking projects, but you get the idea. Investing early in these ventures with as little as $100 could have turned into millions when they peaked. Even though missing out on those top crypto ICOs back then might feel like a lost chance, there are still numerous opportunities available. Recently, the Remittixtoken ICO has emerged as a significant prospect this year. Veteran investors who monitored Ethereum, Binance, and Solana during their ICO stages are already discussing Remittix as one of today's top crypto investments. Many analysts anticipate that the Remittix token could become the next 100x altcoin, possibly achieving this milestone before the year's end. The Remittix token's potential sounds like something out of a billionaire's playbook, but there's more than meets the eye with this new altcoin. Here’s a detailed look at why Remittix might be the next 100x altcoin. Remittix: A Potential Catalyst for the Crypto Payment Sector's Growth One of the main challenges early crypto adopters encounter is deciding what to do with their cryptocurrency. Although numerous organizations and projects are striving to address this issue, the number of crypto investors keeps rising. This is driven by the vision of crypto as the currency of tomorrow, with many speculating a shift towards digital currency soon. Looking ahead, numerous organizations have started incorporating crypto into their payment systems, enhancing the value of using cryptocurrencies. While crypto-to-crypto transactions are becoming more common, there remains a gap in crypto-to-fiat solutions. This is where Remittix steps in, offering a payment solution that lets users send crypto as fiat globally. This innovative approach to utilizing cryptocurrency is why many believe the Remittixtoken is currently the best crypto to invest in. Analysts suggest that Remittix could be the next 100x altcoin to enter the market in the coming weeks. How the Market is Reacting to the Remittix Token Presale The enthusiastic reception the Remittix token has garnered over the past few weeks is remarkable. This suggests that the Remittix solution might be the breakthrough the crypto payment sector has been anticipating. The token has expanded at a rate that has already provided early investors with more than 4x returns. Typically, most presale tokens continue to attract investments and generate profits upon launch. However, the Remittix token presale round highlights how its price has steadily increased in recent weeks, showing investors how their stakes have grown. Those who invested in the Remittix $RTX token recently have seen gains of over 4x. Interestingly, this growth has resulted from about 415 out of the 750 million tokens available in the presale round. This means over 335 million tokens remain available for purchase. Thus, early investors can potentially achieve up to 10x returns, and those joining now could still see as much as 5x before the presale concludes. Don't miss out on this top crypto ICO as it continues to prove itself as the best crypto to invest in during this first half of the year.

This is like buying BTC in 2010, ETH in 2015 or BNB in 2017. I could go on about these revolutionary projects, but you get the point. Investing earlier in these projects with as little as $100 could have made you millions when they hit their all-time high. However, while missing out on those top crypto ICOs back in the day might seem like a missed opportunity, hundreds of others are still out there. But so far this year, the Remittixtoken ICO is another critical opportunity. Seasoned investors who followed Ethereum, Binance and Solana coins during their ICO are already commenting on Remittix, one of the best crypto investments today. Many analysts project that the Remittix token could be the next 100x altcoin; more importantly, this could happen before this year. The Remittix token projection sounds like a section from a billionaire story, but there is more to this new altcoin. Here is a full breakdown of why Remittix might be the next 100x altcoin. Remittix Could be the Innovation to Fuel the Crypto Payment Industry The primary problem that Early crypto users face is the question of “what to do with the crypto coins?” However, while many organizations and projects continue to work towards an answer to this question, the list of crypto investors continues to grow. This is because of the projection of crypto as the future currency with speculations suggesting the world might be moving toward a digital currency soon. Moving forward, many organizations have started adding crypto to their payment gateway, adding more value to using cryptocurrency. However, while crypto-to-crypto payment is getting more popular, there is not much solution for crypto-to-fiat payment. This is where Remittix comes in with a payment solution that allows users to send crypto as fiat all around the world. This mind-blowing new approach to using cryptocurrency is why many believe the Remittixtoken might be the best crypto to invest in right now. Analysts believe Remittix might be the next 100x altcoin to hit the market in the next few weeks. What is the Market Response to the Remittix Token Presale The wide acceptance the Remittix token has continued to receive these last few weeks is massive. This makes it clear that the Remittix solution could be the revolution the crypto payment industry has been waiting for. The token has grown at a pace that has already given early investors more than 4x. Ideally, most presale tokens continue to gather investment and return profit when they launch. However, the Remittix token presale round shows how the price has continued to grow in the last few weeks, showing users how their investment has continued to grow. Investors who joined the Remittix $RTX token in the last few weeks have recorded more than 4x. Interestingly, the growth has been from about 415 of the 750 million tokens available in the presale round. This means that over 335 million tokens are still available in the presale. Therefore, early investors have the opportunity to make up to 10x and those who join now can still make up to 5x before the end of the presale. Don't miss out on this top crypto ICO as it continues to prove its worth as the best crypto to invest in this first half. Below are the links to help you learn more about the Remittix $RTX presale.

39749288,https://timestabloid.com/?p=56064,1738359356,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,SBI Holdings Becoming the MicroStrategy of XRP,https://timestabloid.com/sbi-holdings-becoming-the-microstrategy-of-xrp/,"SBI Holdings , a major Japanese financial conglomerate, has emerged as one of the most significant institutional supporters of Ripple and XRP. Recent revelations indicate that SBI’s investment in Ripple and its XRP holdings are valued at approximately ¥1.6 trillion ($10 billion), surpassing the company’s entire market capitalization of ¥1.2 trillion. This striking dynamic has led some analysts to compare SBI Holdings’ XRP strategy to MicroStrategy’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin (BTC). XRP DROPZ recently shared his thought: “Imagine SBI Holdings becoming the Microstrategy of XRP ” With the GAM Global Special Situations Fund now urging SBI Holdings to implement a structured and public XRP accumulation program—akin to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy—the stage may be set for a new institutional paradigm in the digital asset space. SBI Holdings and XRP: A Deepening Relationship SBI Holdings has been a strong proponent of Ripple and XRP for years. Through its subsidiary, SBI Ripple Asia, the company has played a pivotal role in expanding Ripple’s blockchain-based financial solutions across Asia. SBI has also integrated XRP into various financial products, including remittances, lending, and institutional settlements. Key elements of SBI’s XRP engagement include: Equity Investment in Ripple Labs: SBI is a major shareholder in Ripple, giving it direct exposure to the company’s growth and influence over its strategic direction. XRP as a Liquidity Tool: SBI has long promoted XRP as a liquidity tool in cross-border payments, particularly in Asia. XRP Dividend Programs: SBI has previously offered XRP dividends to its shareholders, further demonstrating its commitment to the asset. The sheer scale of SBI’s investment in Ripple and XRP—now exceeding its market capitalization—suggests that the company sees XRP as a long-term strategic asset. This mirrors MicroStrategy’s approach to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Playbook MicroStrategy, a US-based business intelligence firm, has redefined corporate treasury management by aggressively accumulating Bitcoin. Since 2020, the company has continuously purchased BTC , using excess cash and debt financing to expand its holdings. MicroStrategy’s key Bitcoin strategies include consistent Bitcoin accumulation, debt financing for crypto purchases, and public endorsement of BTC as a reserve asset. MicroStrategy’s unwavering commitment to Bitcoin has made it the largest corporate holder of BTC and has significantly influenced the broader crypto market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Could SBI Holdings Adopt a Similar Strategy? The GAM Global Special Situations Fund has urged SBI Holdings to formalize its XRP accumulation strategy just like MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin playbook. The logic behind this proposal is compelling: Market Signaling : A structured and public XRP accumulation program would signal retail and institutional investors about SBI’s long-term confidence in the asset. Institutional Adoption Catalyst : MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases helped drive corporate interest in BTC, in the same manner, SBI’s structured approach could accelerate XRP’s adoption among institutions. Balance Sheet Strengthening : If XRP appreciates over time, SBI’s investment could significantly enhance its financial position, similar to how MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings have outperformed its core business revenue. However, there are notable differences between Bitcoin and XRP that could influence SBI’s approach: Regulatory Considerations: XRP has faced ongoing legal and regulatory scrutiny, especially in the U.S., which could impact SBI’s ability to execute a MicroStrategy-style accumulation. Use Case Differences: While Bitcoin is widely viewed as “digital gold,” XRP is designed for utility in payments and liquidity solutions. SBI may need to frame its investment strategy differently. Market Liquidity and Volatility: XRP’s market behavior differs from Bitcoin’s, and large-scale purchases could impact price stability differently. SBI Holdings is already one of the largest institutional backers of XRP, and its current exposure surpassing its market cap is a strong testament to its confidence in Ripple’s ecosystem. If SBI adopts an active and transparent XRP accumulation strategy, similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin playbook, it could reshape institutional adoption of XRP and redefine how financial giants integrate crypto assets into their balance sheets. As the crypto industry evolves, SBI’s next moves could set a precedent for other financial institutions looking to integrate digital assets into their long-term strategies. Whether this will lead to a full-fledged MicroStrategy-style XRP play remains to be seen, but one thing is clear—SBI Holdings is deeply committed to the future of XRP.

It might actually increase by 88x after its public listing, which has attracted so many investors to the presale stage. Ethereum’s Dominance Reveals Cracks Ethereum (ETH) has always been one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, but other altcoins are not giving up. Lately, it has been losing its dominance and the market share has been decreasing, while other altcoins are trying to get an edge over it. Ethereum’s network is often used for smart contracts and decentralized applications, but it has been declining for different reasons. It has really high gas fees that cause simple transactions to cost more than they should, and it has been hard to upgrade and scale the altcoin. Some other ecosystems have emerged like Solana and 1Fuel, which has been a major threat over Ethereum’s dominance as top DeFi tokens. 1Fuel especially has a DEX wallet that is better than some known platforms like Trust Wallet and MetaMask. 1Fuel Emerges As a Shocking Alternative 1Fuel (OFT) has emerged as a surprising alternative to Ethereum and is threatening its dominance, which investors didnt expect. Although 1Fuel is new, it has already shown a lot of promise to do better in terms of decentralized exchange transactions. Its ecosystem combines a crypto wallet and exchange platform for investors to take advantage of. All of the featuresposition 1Fuel OFT as a leading crypto investment for 2025. 1Fuel has been performing pretty well compared to widely known platforms like Trust Wallet and MetaMask because of its cross-chain transaction capability. Investors can easily send tokens from one blockchain to another, and they won’t need third-party tools or extra wallets. With this feature, it remains a top DeFi token among competitors. 1Fuel’s network also offers better privacy and security than known platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet, and even Ethereum. Its privacy mixer can make transactions anonymous and the disposable wallet offers offline storage options. Another highlight of 1Fuel that makes it a leading alternative in the DeFi space is the integrated financial tools. It features crypto credit and debit cards, peer-to-peer exchange, and AI tools. Investors Rush to Quickly Accumulate 1Fuel OFT After seeing the value of 1Fuel OFT and its DEX wallet, investors have become more interested in buying the token now that it's at the lowest price it would ever be. 1Fuel’s presale has been pretty impressive and the quick progress is boosting investor confidence. Investors are even more confident with the DEX wallet that rivals names like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. 1Fuel has sold a massive 166 million tokens in record time, and has raised over $1.6 million, all of which are pretty great milestones. Now that the OFT token is being sold at $0.017 per on, the low price makes it a leading crypto investment for early investors. Which DeFi Ecosystem Will Dominate in 2025? It seems like 1Fuel OFT has all the potential it needs to eventually dominate the DeFi ecosystem this year. Smart investors can grab this presale opportunity to buy the altcoin at the lowest price ever.

However, the rise of 1Fuel (OFT) could rival Solana's dominance in the DeFi space. 1Fuel is an emerging cross-chain exchange platform that offers better blockchain interoperability compared to Solana. The 1Fuel presale has been the talk of the town, raising $1.6 million in record time. Find out why experts are backing OFT to overtake SOL in 2025 Solana outlook: Imminent ETF approval could spur another all-time high Solana outlook: Imminent ETF approval could spur another SOL all-time high Solana has dipped by 4.27% in the last seven days , dropping below $250. However, its monthly run still shows a 20% uptick, suggesting that SOL is still bullish. Solana presently trades above $230, with a 50% rise in daily trading volume. However, this is far less than the record high of $294.33 that Solana reached in mid-January. Analysts say the market's overall decline is to blame for the Solana dump, but a recovery is anticipated before the next quarter. High SOL ETF application rates have fueled optimism of a bullish reversal from Solana. It has increased investors’ buy action and institutional interest in the token which may prompt Solana to breach its current resistance level and rally to a new milestone soon. Solana developers have also remained committed to seeing the network grow. They're implementing features that can improve the network and attract more developers. This will help Solana maintain relevance amidst the rise of revolutionary projects like 1Fuel. 1Fuel set to rival top blockchain networks with its revolutionary features 1Fuel set to rival top blockchain networks with its revolutionary features The goal of 1Fuel is to fix the interoperability problems that major blockchains are facing. It will facilitate hassle-free cross-chain transactions from the backend, ensuring users don’t need multiple wallets to complete transactions. 1Fuel will also ensure users can manage their assets effectively. The platform provides users with offline storage options and AI-powered insight tools. This will ensure better asset control while helping users make profitable decisions and manage risks well. Furthermore, 1Fuel plans to integrate crypto into everyday use. It will achieve this by providing physical and virtual debit cards that holders can use to complete real-time transactions. These cards will be accepted anywhere conventional credit or debit cards are used. The platform will also provide passive income opportunities for holders via staking, community engagement, and liquidity provision. OFT token holders will earn up to 30% APY as staking rewards. 1Fuel's multiple benefits make it a worthy competitor for Solana. 1Fuel has sold over 164 million out of its 500 million presale allocation, raising $1.64 million in ICO funding. Analysts say 1Fuel could yield 50x before its presale concludes, and now is the next best time to buy in at a low price.

BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin That’s Ready to Break The Internet BTFD Coin is turning heads for all the right reasons. The presale started at just $0.000004 per coin, but as it’s now in Stage 14, the price has already surged to $0.00016. It’s expected to list at $0.0006 once the presale ends.

Investors who scooped up Bonk when it was trading at less than a penny saw it explode in value, providing returns that would have been unimaginable just a few months prior. While Bonk’s price eventually cooled off, its meteoric rise showed how much potential meme coins have when the hype hits. Now, many of those who watched from the sidelines regret not getting in sooner. But here’s the silver lining—if you missed the Bonk presale, you don’t have to miss the next big thing. BTFD Coin is here, and it’s shaping up to be the next viral meme coin that could replicate, or even surpass, the gains seen by Bonk early on.

This DOT-focused fund marks one of the non-conventional crypto ETF applications filed with the regulator this week. The Polkadot ETF From 21Shares According to the S-1 filing, 21Shares said the firm plans to list the Polkadot ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange. The asset manager noted that the fund is a passive investment that does not seek to generate returns beyond tracking the price of DOT. Explaining this, 21Shares said this funds model means it will not speculatively sell DOT when the price is high and buy when it is low. It informed prospective investors that it will not pursue its investment objectives through leverage or derivatives products. Having ruled out these measures, it said it would solely track DOT price as featured on the CME CF Polkadot-Dollar Reference Rate. This 21Shares filing is the second time the firm is featured on the ETF front this week. As reported earlier, the Cboe exchange refiled its Solana 19b-4 application alongside those of VanEck, Canary Capital, and Bitwise. This is a breaking news, please check back for updates!!!!
