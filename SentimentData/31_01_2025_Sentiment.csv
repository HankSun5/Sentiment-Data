As analysts foresee a 50% drop in the price of Pepe, smart investors are already looking into other methods to protect their investments. Remittix, a token that is becoming more and more popular as the top token for investors in 2025, is a notable option among these choices. Why Pepe Coin May Drop By 50% In February Pepe Coin has enthralled the cryptocurrency community over the past year with its remarkable rallies and meme-inspired beginnings. However, maintaining growth becomes more difficult, as is the case with many speculative investments. It appears that February 2025 will be a crucial month for the coin. Experts are citing a number of reasons for the 50% prediction of the Pepe coin drop One of the main causes is market saturation. Pepe Coin has been very popular, but as new investors become cautious of its speculative nature, its market capitalization is currently facing opposition. Regulatory issues are also quite important. Tighter restrictions are affecting the entire cryptocurrency industry, and coins that appeal to memes are frequently subject to extra scrutiny. Declining utility makes the problem worse. Despite having a devoted following, Pepe Coin's limited application outside of speculative trading may make it less competitive. These difficulties imply that the February Pepe price prediction is in line with a gloomy trend, which will cause investors to look for more secure and encouraging opportunities. Additionally, macroeconomic factors like inflation and interest rate increases may have an effect on investor sentiment. Speculative assets like Pepe Coin are frequently among the first to undergo large sell-offs when the larger financial markets are uncertain. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum The focus shifts to Remittix, a token positioned as the top token for investors in 2025, as Pepe Coin's prospects deteriorate. Remittix is a compelling choice for individuals hedging against the projected 50% decline in Pepe coin since it provides a distinctive combination of usability, security, and growth potential. Remittix is attracting the interest of investors for the following main reasons. Remittix stands out due to its strong use case. Remittix, in contrast to many meme coins, is based on a network intended for international transfers, addressing actual financial difficulties. It is a more solid investment because of its utility, which guarantees steady demand. Another element is a capable development team. Supported by seasoned developers and financial specialists, Remittix has a transparent roadmap and other attributes that reassure investors. Support from the community is also essential. Remittix is supported by a devoted and expanding community, which guarantees active involvement in its ecosystem and promotes long-term growth. Lastly, what distinguishes it is its protective approach during market downturns. Compared to speculative assets, tokens that provide real benefits, like Remittix, typically do better. Because of this, it is a great tool for investors who want to protect themselves from erratic market swings. Remittix's attractiveness is further increased by its capacity to establish strategic alliances with blockchain networks and financial institutions. These partnerships increase its visibility and bolster its reputation as a sound cryptocurrency investment. Remittix's dedication to sustainability and environmentally friendly operations is another important element that contributes to its allure. By implementing energy-efficient blockchain technology, Remittix responds to the increasing need for crypto solutions that are ecologically conscious. These challenges suggest that the Pepe price prediction for February aligns with a bearish trend, prompting investors to seek more stable and promising opportunities. Conclusion Due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, investors must take preemptive steps. The Pepe price prediction of a 50% decline in February 2025 highlights the necessity for substitutes. With its strong functionality and investor-focused philosophy, Remittix stands out as a ray of light for anybody looking to protect their capital. Remittix is poised to revolutionize what it means to make wise investments in the realm of digital assets as the top token for investors in 2025.

With analysts predicting a 50% drop in Pepe's value, savvy investors are exploring alternative strategies to safeguard their portfolios. Remittix is emerging as a popular choice, becoming the leading token for investors in 2025, offering a promising alternative. Reasons for Pepe Coin's Potential 50% Decline in February Over the past year, Pepe Coin has captivated cryptocurrency enthusiasts with its impressive surges and meme-driven origins. However, sustaining such growth becomes challenging, much like with other speculative investments. February 2025 seems to be a pivotal period for the coin, with experts pointing to several factors that could lead to a 50% decline in the Pepe coin value. A key factor is market saturation. Pepe Coin has enjoyed widespread popularity, yet as new investors grow wary of its speculative nature, its market cap is currently encountering resistance. Regulatory challenges also play a significant role. Stricter regulations are impacting the broader crypto sector, and meme-centric coins often face heightened scrutiny. Decreasing utility adds to the issue. Despite a loyal fanbase, Pepe Coin's limited use beyond speculative trading could render it less competitive. These challenges suggest that the February Pepe price prediction aligns with a negative trend, prompting investors to seek more stable and promising alternatives. Additionally, broader economic factors such as rising inflation and interest rates might influence investor behavior. During periods of financial market uncertainty, speculative assets like Pepe Coin are often among the first to experience significant sell-offs. Why Remittix is Attracting Attention As Pepe Coin's outlook dims, the spotlight turns to Remittix, hailed as the top token for investors in 2025. With its unique blend of utility, security, and growth potential, Remittix emerges as an appealing option for those hedging against the anticipated 50% fall in Pepe Coin. Investors are drawn to Remittix for several key reasons. Remittix distinguishes itself with a robust use case. Unlike many meme-based tokens, Remittix is built on a network designed for global remittances, tackling real-world financial issues. This functionality ensures a steady demand, making it a more resilient investment. Another important factor is its strong development team. Backed by experienced developers and financial experts, Remittix offers a clear roadmap and other features that provide investors with confidence. Community support plays a crucial role as well. A dedicated and growing community supports Remittix, ensuring active participation in its ecosystem and fostering sustainable growth. Finally, its resilience during market downturns sets it apart. Tokens offering tangible benefits, such as Remittix, often outperform speculative assets. This makes it a valuable tool for investors seeking protection from volatile market changes. Its ability to form strategic partnerships with blockchain networks and financial institutions further enhances Remittix's appeal. These collaborations boost its visibility and reinforce its status as a reliable cryptocurrency investment. Remittix's commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly practices is another key factor enhancing its attractiveness. By adopting energy-efficient blockchain technology, Remittix addresses the growing demand for environmentally responsible crypto solutions. These conditions suggest that the Pepe price prediction for February corresponds with a bearish trend, driving investors to explore more stable and promising opportunities. Conclusion Given the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, it's crucial for investors to take proactive measures. The Pepe price prediction of a potential 50% drop in February 2025 underscores the need for alternatives. With its practical functionality and investor-centric approach, Remittix emerges as a beacon of hope for those aiming to safeguard their investments. As the leading token for investors in 2025, Remittix is set to redefine smart investment in the digital asset space.

Interestingly, this renewed momentum has seen Dogecoin open interest flipping from a negative threshold into a positive one. As the meme coin’s price gains traction, traders are once again pouring into derivatives markets, pushing the total open interest above $4 billion. Dogecoin Open Interest Surges With Market Revival According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin’s total open interest has climbed back above the $4 billion mark, indicating a resurgence in trading activity. This comes after the Dogecoin price rebounded on the $0.31 multi-year support again and started its move upwards again. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Explodes Ahead Of Donald Trump Inauguration, Traders Bet On $1 Interestingly, data from Coinglass show that the Dogecoin open interest has increased by 3.11% and 2.09% in the past 24 hours and 4 hours, respectively. This shift suggests that traders are once again looking at Dogecoin as a promising asset for leveraged plays, betting on further price movements. The most notable DOGE open interest is on the Gate.io exchange, which has seen an increase of 5.14% in the past 24 hours. This brings its total open interest to $1.64 billion, accounting for 41% of the total rate. Bitget and BingX have also witnessed notable uptrends, with the Dogecoin open interest growing by 6.41% and 6.67%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. Binance, on the other hand, is yet to flip into positive open interest change. The world’s largest crypto exchange is still on a -0.13% open interest rate in the past 24 hours but is also on the verge of a positive rate with a +1.41% increase in the last four hours. Increased Leverage Could Lead To More Price Volatility A rise in open interest means that more traders are opening leveraged positions, which could amplify price swings in either direction. Interestingly, Dogecoin often experiences strong price movements during periods of increase in open interest. This latest increase alone means that there is an increase in market participation in Dogecoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Weekly RSI Approaches The MA Line, Can Price Resume Uptrend To Break $0.74 ATH? If bullish sentiment continues, this market participation may drive the Dogecoin price further upward within the $0.30 to $0.4 range in the short term. However, it also raises the possibility of more liquidations if Dogecoin were to retest support at $0.31 again. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3316, marking a 7% gain since bouncing off its multi-week support at $0.31. The next step for the meme coin is breaking above a recently developed daily candlestick resistance at $0.3316, which could then pave the way for further upside momentum if sustained buying pressure continues.

Despite a 44% year-over-year drop in hacking incidents, the hacks grew ninefold month-over-month, according to the latest report from web3 bug bounty and security services platform Immunefi. Although the situation looks dire, the figure is a huge fall compared to January last year, when hackers stole $133 million. The crypto losses in January came from two major attacks. The most affected platform was a Singapore-based CeFi Phemex exchange, which hackers targeted and escaped with $69.1 million. The second incident was an exploit of the DeFi platform Moby Trade, which lost $2.5 million. Other low-magnitude attacks were Orange Finance, IPC, UniLend Finance, The Idols NFT, Odos, Laura AI, Pika Infinity, and Sorra. There were no fraud-related cases in January. Hackers exploited the Binance chain more than any other network The month of January saw the Binance chain suffering the most. Of all the attacks, Binance accounts for 50% of the losses on the blockchain, with the platform exploited ten times. Ethereum was also vulnerable, accounting for 25% of the total attacks. Arbitrum and Base suffered two attacks each, followed by Optimism with a single attack. On the other hand, centralized finance platforms were the most exploited, losing over $69 million, 93% of the total value lost in January. Decentralized finance appeared more secure, accounting for only 6.5%, with $4.8 million lost over 18 incidents. While releasing the report, Mitchell Amador, founder and CEO of Immunefi, warned that CeFi platforms will be the most targeted platform by crypto bandits. He said. “The largest volume of losses will likely come from CeFi, as hackers target infrastructure, particularly through private key compromises. CeFi doesn’t generally suffer the most successful attacks, but when a breach occurs, it typically leads to catastrophic losses.” Amador pointed out that the worst thing that can happen is for a hacker to get your private keys and then drain your account which is a major flaw of the CEFI. Whereas DeFi bugs are more common, the impact is small because not all the money is lost. CeFi platforms are enhancing security to prevent exploitations CeFi platforms are also vulnerable to phishing attacks and, therefore, require a multi-layer security approach. CeFi must factor in protective security protocols. It should also include security features that enhance key management, ensuring reduced reliance on a single private key. Furthermore, the platform must improve OpSec’s best practices, such as regular employee security training. Amador also advised that the platforms should have bug bounty programs and real-time threat detection tools. These could be crucial in enhancing the security of these protocols and chains. The Immunefi director advises the platforms to adopt these measures because they are already using them. The firm currently issues over $181 million worth of bug bounties for ethical hackers and manages over $190 billion worth of crypto user funds. The firm has involved ethical hackers and researchers, paying them research bounties worth $112 million. The payouts began three years ago and are still critical. So far, the ethical hackers have come out with 3,000 bug bounty reports. The largest was a $10 million award for a vulnerability discovered in Wormhole’s cross-chain protocol. Immunefi claims to operate the largest blockchain security community with more than 45,000 researchers, saving over $25 billion in user funds across protocols like Polygon, Optimism, Chainlink, The Graph, Synthetix, and MakerDAO (Sky) from being stolen.

After a recent 4.94% drop in market value, many players believe Ethereum could dip below $2,000 this year. The challenge comes as large holder entities may be liquidating assets and exploring alternatives and new blockchain projects, like Remittix (RTX), begin to take center stage. Remittix's public presale has already generated significant attention, offering early investors a chance to get involved with this promising project before it hits centralized exchanges.

While it leads in DeFi and NFT space, ETH’s dominance is being challenged by newer projects that offer swift and cost-effective options for crypto-to-fiat deals. Short-term traders should watch for further drops in Ethereum's value. This because on-chain data could confirm that more assets are exiting the Ethereum ecosystem.

Following a recent 4.94% decline in market value, there is speculation amongst investors that Ethereum might fall below $2,000 this year. This situation arises as major holders may be offloading assets and turning their attention to new blockchain initiatives like Remittix (RTX), which are beginning to gain prominence. The public presale of Remittix has already caught significant interest, presenting early investors with a chance to join this exciting venture before it is available on centralized exchanges.

Short-term investors should be cautious of more potential decreases in Ethereum's value. On-chain data might reveal that more assets are leaving the Ethereum network, leading investors to question the long-term supremacy of Ethereum in the DeFi space.

Recent aggregator data, however, shows daily volumes for both coins plummeting by 18%, as whales offload positions and market sentiment sours. Analysts say this DogWifHat & BONK slump signals that meme tokens relying solely on internet jokes can’t sustain interest in the long run. Retail holders appear left with steep losses, prompting a wave of complaints on community forums. Some watchers link the downturn to oversaturation, with meme tokens popping up faster than new investors can support them. As these favorite dog-themed assets fade, many traders look beyond comedic branding. The question is what sort of coin can outperform hype while also tackling serious issues. Why Real World Solutions Are Taking Center Stage Frustrated by the volatility of purely speculative tokens, investors now favor real world solutions that might outlast sudden hype cycles. Instead of dog memes and influencer pushes, they seek altcoins bridging crypto with tangible use cases like cross-border finance or enterprise adoption. This shift isn’t new: Ethereum broke ground by enabling smart contracts, but many subsequent tokens offered minimal utility beyond quick flips. Meme coins soared on novelty but often lacked real partnerships or stable demand. The meme coin crash for DogWifHat and BONK highlights how quickly that excitement can vanish. Faced with losses, holders crave tokens underpinned by genuine functionality. A coin that solves an everyday problem may see consistent growth, unlike memes that rely on viral tweets. Some watchers say the pivot to practical altcoins could define the next bull run, where tokens targeting large markets overshadow comedic clones. Remittix Synergy: A Growing PayFi Contender In the wake of DogWifHat & BONK slump, many turn to Remittix synergy for a more dependable approach. Rather than comedic marketing, Remittix focuses on a $190 trillion global banking sector, aiming to lower cross-border fees and speed transactions. Over $9.5 million in presale funds underscores strong faith in bridging crypto and everyday finance. The team locks liquidity for three years, then renounces the contract post-presale moves that calm fears of developer dumps. Critics note any new coin must still secure user adoption and partnerships. But supporters say cutting remittance costs appeals to freelancers, families sending money home and small businesses. If that vision clicks, analysts whisper about 50x or even 100x potential once it hits major listings. Curious? Check Remittix while presale tokens remain. As meme coins falter, real world solutions may be the ticket to recovering losses and possibly netting life-changing gains. Shifting from Meme Hype to Real Adoption That’s the storyline echoing across trading communities. The DogWifHat & BONK slumpunderlines how fragile these meme assets can be when enthusiasm wanes. Meanwhile, tokens emphasizing real world solutions like Remittix seem more appealing for investors seeking stability and big upside. Of course, no project is bulletproof, especially one fresh from presale. But many burned by meme collapses see Remittix synergy as a strategic hedge, believing the PayFi model could withstand bear cycles better than comedic marketing. If bridging daily finances with crypto intrigues you, swing by Remittix to grab presale tokens before final stages sell out.

However, recent data from aggregators reveals an 18% drop in daily trading volumes for both coins, as large holders sell off their stakes and overall market enthusiasm declines. Analysts suggest this downturn for DogWifHat & BONK indicates that meme tokens that rely solely on internet humor struggle to maintain long-term interest. Many retail investors are facing significant losses, leading to a surge of complaints on community platforms. Some analysts attribute the decline to an oversaturated market, as new meme tokens emerge more rapidly than the influx of new investors. With these once-popular dog-themed coins losing their appeal, traders are beginning to look beyond humorous branding. The key question now is what kind of coin can thrive beyond the hype while addressing real-world challenges. The Rise of Real World Solutions in Crypto Tired of the unpredictability of purely speculative tokens, investors are increasingly drawn to real world solutions that may endure beyond fleeting hype. Instead of focusing on dog memes or influencer endorsements, they're searching for altcoins that connect crypto with real applications in areas like cross-border payments or corporate use. This trend isn't entirely new: Ethereum made waves by introducing smart contracts, but many tokens that followed offered little practical use beyond quick trading opportunities. Meme coins rose to fame due to their novelty but often lacked genuine partnerships or sustained demand. The decline of DogWifHat and BONK underscores how quickly that excitement can dissipate. As holders face losses, there is a growing desire for tokens supported by real functionality. Coins that solve everyday issues have the potential for steady growth, unlike those that rely on viral social media posts. Some experts suggest the shift to practical altcoins could pave the way for the next bull market, where tokens targeting substantial markets overshadow comedic counterparts. Remittix: A Rising Player in PayFi Following the decline of DogWifHat & BONK, many are turning to Remittix synergy as a more reliable option. Instead of relying on humorous marketing, Remittix targets the $190 trillion global banking industry, focusing on reducing cross-border fees and accelerating transactions. The $9.5 million raised in presale funds reflects strong confidence in merging crypto with everyday financial needs. The team plans to lock liquidity for three years and renounce the contract post-presale, addressing concerns about developer sell-offs. Critics point out that any new coin must still achieve user adoption and partnerships. However, advocates argue that reducing remittance costs is appealing to freelancers, families sending money back home, and small businesses. If successful, analysts speculate about possible 50x or even 100x returns once listed on major exchanges. Interested? Check Remittix while presale tokens are available. As meme coins falter, real-world solutions may be the key to recouping losses and potentially achieving life-changing gains. Moving from Meme Hype to Real Adoption This narrative is resonating through trading circles. The DogWifHat & BONK downturn highlights how fragile these meme assets are when enthusiasm dwindles. Meanwhile, tokens that emphasize real world solutions, such as Remittix, are becoming more attractive to investors seeking stability with the potential for significant returns. Of course, no project is without risk, especially one that is freshly out of presale. However, many who have suffered from meme coin collapses view Remittix synergy as a strategic hedge, believing that the PayFi model could better endure market downturns compared to light-hearted marketing strategies.

While some projects fade into obscurity, others continue to disrupt industries and create new wealth opportunities. Whether it’s a bullish run or a temporary dip, the right crypto investments can offer massive returns within a short time frame. Qubetics , Litecoin (LTC), and Celestia (TIA) are three standout contenders in today’s volatile market. Qubetics is redefining asset tokenization with its record-breaking presale, Litecoin remains a gold standard for fast and secure payments, and Celestia is leading the charge in blockchain modularity. These projects aren’t just trends—they’re shaping the next era of blockchain utility and investment potential. Qubetics – The Web3 Aggregator Leading Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is making waves in the crypto space by offering quantum-resistant blockchain security, designed to withstand the future challenges posed by quantum computing. With its cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, Qubetics ensures that digital assets and transactions remain secure for the long term. Qubetics is capturing the attention of crypto investors at lightning speed. This next-gen Web3 aggregator has already raised over $11.4 million in its Qubetics presale , with more than 452 million $TICS tokens sold to over 17,400 holders. Currently in its 19th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0606 per token, and analysts are already predicting jaw-dropping price jumps post-presale. With projections ranging from $0.25 to as high as $15, the potential for life-changing returns is on the table. One of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics is its role in the real-world asset tokenization marketplace. Imagine a real estate investor looking to tokenize a high-value property to offer fractional ownership opportunities to global investors. Qubetics’ blockchain-powered system simplifies the process, making asset ownership accessible, transparent, and liquid. Businesses can tokenize intellectual property, luxury goods, and even rare collectibles. This groundbreaking approach is set to redefine asset ownership, allowing anyone to invest in high-value assets with ease. Litecoin – The OG of Fast and Reliable Transactions Litecoin (LTC) has long been regarded as one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies in the market. Often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin was created to provide faster transaction speeds and lower fees, making it an ideal choice for everyday payments. With its strong security, high liquidity, and an ever-growing adoption rate, Litecoin continues to be a solid alternative investment instrument. The crypto community respects Litecoin for its resilience and continuous upgrades. The network’s recent developments, including the MimbleWimble upgrade, have improved privacy features, making LTC even more appealing for transactions. Whether it’s merchants, retailers, or peer-to-peer payments, Litecoin has positioned itself as one of the most practical cryptocurrencies for real-world use. Currently priced at $127.81 and gaining 11.55% in value recently, Litecoin remains a key asset for short-term traders looking for quick gains and long-term holders banking on its steady growth. It may not have the flashiest branding, but its reliability keeps it in the ranks of top cryptos to hold for short term. Celestia – The Modular Blockchain Disruptor Celestia (TIA) is making serious waves in the crypto world by introducing modular blockchain technology. Instead of being a monolithic network like Ethereum or Solana, Celestia separates execution, consensus, and data availability, creating a more scalable and flexible infrastructure. This unique approach has positioned Celestia as a game-changer in the blockchain space, drawing interest from developers and investors alike. Why does Celestia matter? Scalability has been one of the biggest challenges in blockchain, leading to slow transactions and high fees. By adopting a modular architecture, Celestia allows developers to build highly scalable and customizable blockchains without sacrificing security. This is a huge step forward for decentralized applications, Web3 gaming, and even DeFi protocols looking for more efficient solutions. With Celestia currently priced at $4.06, investors are eyeing its potential to surge as adoption grows. If blockchain modularity takes off the way experts expect, Celestia could be one of the biggest winners in the next few years, making it a strong contender among top cryptos to hold for short term. Final Verdict – Where’s the Smart Money Going? Crypto investing is about catching the right wave at the right time. Qubetics , Litecoin, and Celestia all offer massive potential, but for those looking for top cryptos to hold for short term, Qubetics presents a golden opportunity. With its innovative asset tokenization marketplace, explosive presale growth, and bullish analyst predictions, $TICS could be one of the best-performing tokens of the year.

Immunefi, a Web3 security platform, reported that January saw $73.9 million in losses from 19 attacks. This is a staggering increase of nine times from the previous month. However, in a silver lining, this figure represents a 44.6% drop compared to January 2024, when losses exceeded $133 million. Two Major Crypto Hack Incidents Dominate the Landscape In January, the crypto industry was hit by hacking incidents, with $73.9 million siphoned off by cybercriminals. The most significant blow came from two major attacks. This includes the hack of Phemex, a Singapore-based exchange that lost $69.1 million. The breach of the decentralized finance (DeFi) options platform Moby Trade also resulted in a $2.5 million loss. These two incidents were the primary culprits behind the monthly loss total. Other affected platforms included Orange Finance, IPC, The Idols NFT, UniLend Finance, Odos, Laura Ai, Pika Infinity, and Sorra. These hacks contributed to the remaining DeFi losses; all suffered varying degrees of loss. Interestingly, no fraud cases were reported this month. These attacks show that both centralized and decentralized platforms are constantly at risk . Hackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities across different networks. Targeted Networks: BNB Chain and Ethereum Lead the Way BNB Chain was the most targeted, accounting for 50% of the total on-chain losses. Ethereum followed closely, with 25% of the total losses tied to exploits on its network. Other networks, such as Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, also faced breaches, but these were fewer in number, with just a couple of attacks on each. Immunefi’s Role in Crypto Security While the hacking incidents were alarming, Immunefi, a platform known for its web3 bug bounty and security services, plays a key role in combating these threats. The company has paid over $100 million in bounties to ethical hackers , helping to identify and fix vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Immunefi boasts the largest blockchain security community, with more than 45,000 researchers. Over the past three years, its efforts have saved over $25 billion from potential theft, covering protocols like Polygon, Synthetix, and MakerDAO.

The upgrade, which achieved 91.43% consensus from validators, ensures token issuers have control over assets deposited in liquidity pools under specific conditions. XRP Ledger Activates AMMClawback, Enhancing AMM Pool Compliance In a recent post on the X platform , XRPScan confirmed that the XRP Ledger has successfully implemented the AMMClawback amendment. This update introduces new rules governing liquidity pools, particularly for tokens with regulatory requirements. The amendment enables token issuers to retrieve assets from AMM pools under predefined circumstances. If a token is frozen, users will no longer be able to deposit new assets into the associated liquidity pool. This restriction prevents unauthorized transactions involving frozen tokens. More so, this development comes just days after Ondo Finance confirmed its push for expanding tokenized assets. The OUSG deployment on XRPL will enhance institutional liquidity and regulatory compliance. ONDO and XRP prices surged following the news, reflecting strong market confidence XRP/RLUSD AMM Pool Now Possible With the AMMClawback amendment now active, the creation of an XRP/RLUSD AMM pool is now possible. This development will improve liquidity for both XRP and Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin launched in December 2024. Previously, RLUSD could not participate in AMM pools due to its built-in clawback feature. This limitation has now been removed, allowing RLUSD holders to contribute liquidity and trade seamlessly within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. This upgrade could enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the network. Since Ripple’s stablecoin launch, major exchanges have steadily increased its adoption. RLUSD’s reserve report confirms strong backing, boosting investor confidence. Consequently, its most recent listing on Margex expanded its reach in high-leverage trading. New AMM Pool Rules for Wallets and Token Issuers The amendment introduces stricter deposit rules for liquidity providers. If one of the paired tokens is frozen, wallets cannot deposit single-sided or double-sided assets into an AMM pool. Additionally, unauthorized accounts can deposit only once if the paired asset is allowed. Token issuers must now use the AMMClawback function to retrieve assets from pools instead of the standard clawback transaction. This provides a structured approach to enforcing compliance without disrupting normal trading activity on the XRP Ledger. The amendment received 28 out of 35 votes from validators, surpassing the 80% threshold required for approval. Additionally, the XRP Ledger community expects this change to improve regulatory alignment while expanding opportunities for decentralized liquidity.

With Ethereum updates suggesting that this rising star is poised to outshine other meme and traditional coins by 2025, let's delve deeper into what makes this coin so intriguing.

From personalized health guidance to the extraction of value from health data, the global health management sector is in dire need of a profound innovation and upgrade. Today, we are excited to announce the official launch of the iPulse Protocol, marking the beginning of a new era! The iPulse Protocol not only integrates cutting-edge technologies like AI-powered predictions, DeSci collaboration, and DePIN, but also offers unprecedented ecosystem collaboration opportunities for global research institutions, healthcare providers, device manufacturers, and users.Through the iPulse Protocol, health data will no longer remain isolated or closed. Instead, it will be transformed into intelligent, decentralized, and tradable digital assets. This means that users will not only benefit from precise health predictions and personalized guidance powered by AI and big data analysis, but also ensure the privacy and security of their data through blockchain technology, ultimately enabling data to be tokenized. At the same time, research institutions, healthcare providers, and device manufacturers will find new opportunities for collaboration within the iPulse ecosystem, jointly driving the global health management and technological innovation process. Core Features of the iPulse Protocol: Precise Health Prediction and Personalized GuidanceThe fundamental goal of the iPulse Protocol is to comprehensively and accurately analyze user health data through AI technology and provide each user with personalized health advice. By collecting data from wearable devices, medical equipment, and mobile apps, the iPulse Protocol can continuously monitor the user's health status and predict potential health risks using adaptive AI models and advanced technologies like time-series analysis.For instance, by analyzing users' heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep quality, and other physiological data in real time, combined with their historical health status, the iPulse Protocol can predict potential health problems such as cardiovascular risks and diabetes progression. It then provides targeted lifestyle and dietary recommendations to help users take preventive measures. This approach not only helps users better manage their personal health but also supports the long-term maintenance of a healthy state.Data Tokenization: Transforming Health Data into Tradable Digital AssetsIn traditional health management systems, users' health data typically belongs to medical institutions or enterprises and is not owned by the individual. In contrast, with the iPulse Protocol, users' health data can be anonymized through encryption technology to ensure privacy, while blockchain technology enables the tokenization of data. This allows users to have both usage and revenue rights over their data. For example, users can authorize research institutions, insurance companies, healthcare providers, and other third parties to access their data in exchange for compensation.The iPulse Protocol offers users a new source of income, allowing them to participate in data transactions through smart contracts, all while ensuring privacy and data security. This mechanism will further stimulate global health tech innovation, promoting the efficient circulation and sharing of health data.DeSci Collaboration: A Global Research and Medical Data Sharing PlatformIn traditional health management and medical fields, data is typically closed and regional, making it difficult to achieve effective cross-border and cross-institution collaboration. The iPulse Protocol breaks this limitation by leveraging decentralized data storage and privacy computing technologies, creating a global data-sharing platform that supports cross-border cooperation among research institutions and medical teams.This data-sharing platform not only ensures the security and privacy of the data but also provides strong support for global scientific collaboration in the health field. For example, research institutions can use anonymized data to support drug development, disease treatment innovations, and more, advancing global health science. Moreover, governments and health organizations can analyze disease transmission trends via the platform to promptly respond to emerging health crises.Applications of the iPulse Protocol: Bridging Personal and Global Health Management Applications of the iPulse Protocol Applications of the iPulse Protocol The iPulse Protocol not only provides precise health management services for individual users but also has wide-ranging applications in various fields: Personal Health Management: By continuously monitoring biological and exercise data, the iPulse Protocol provides users with personalized health reports, dietary advice, and exercise plans, even predicting potential disease risks to help users adopt healthier lifestyles. Healthcare and Insurance Support: Medical institutions and insurance companies can utilize the iPulse Protocol to obtain precise health data analysis, optimize treatment plans, and more accurately assess health risks, enabling them to design tailored insurance products. Global Public Health Monitoring: The iPulse Protocol offers a powerful data support platform for global public health monitoring, helping governments and health organizations analyze disease trends, develop prevention strategies, and respond to global health crises. Global Research and Innovation: By creating a global biological database, the iPulse Protocol accelerates cross-border health data sharing. Research institutions can access anonymized health data through iPulse to support disease research, drug development, and treatment innovations. Support for Smart Device Manufacturers: Device manufacturers can integrate the iPulse Protocol to help users achieve more accurate health management, while using the health data provided by the protocol to optimize product designs, thereby enhancing market competitiveness.Looking to the Future: iPulse Protocol Brings a New Revolution to Health ManagementWith the official launch of the iPulse Protocol, we can anticipate unprecedented opportunities for global health management and scientific innovation. Through decentralized technologies, AI-powered predictions, and data tokenization, the iPulse Protocol offers a win-win ecosystem collaboration platform for users, research institutions, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and device manufacturers. Whether it's individual health management or global health data sharing and scientific collaboration, iPulse is driving the digital transformation of the health management industry and injecting new vitality into global public health.In the future, as the iPulse ecosystem continues to evolve, global health management will become more personalized, intelligent, and decentralized. The launch of the iPulse Protocol not only brings users a new health management experience but also provides continuous momentum for the development of global medical, research, and health industries.

However, there’s even more interesting news and that is about the rise of Panshibi (SHIBI), a new crypto project making waves with its engaging presale. Can this emerging meme coin project live up to the expectations? Find the details below! Solana Price Prediction: Can an ETF Take SOL To $500? Solana (SOL) has been a powerhouse in the crypto market, delivering unparalleled transaction speeds and efficiency. Currently, SOL is priced around $231.64 , having declined by 13.10% over the past week. However, its recent bull run to $294.33, which marks a 17.56% increase over the last 30 days, speaks volumes about its potential to hit $300 or higher in the next month. Technical analysis shows the Solana price prediction chart carving higher highs, indicating a significant bull run. The circulating supply of 593.01M SOL tokens against a market cap of $112.76B solidifies its position among top-tier altcoins. While most analysts have not been able to give a target price of Solana or affirm that it will reach $500, the three-month performance of Solana has shown promising figures. Moreover, with the impending launch of a Solana ETF, experts and investors believe such significant gains for Solana can be attainable. Panshibi: More Than Just a Meme Coin While Solana continues to attract attention in the crypto markets, Panshibi stands ready to deliver exciting returns and a vibrant ecosystem that could redefine what it means to invest in a meme coin. The Panshibi project is compelling for many reasons, one of which is the total allocation of its tokens, designed to promote fairness and long-term growth. This strategic approach not only promotes community engagement but also positions Panshibi as a noteworthy contender in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Buying SHIBI tokens isn’t just about making money; it’s about becoming part of a vibrant community. When you purchase these tokens, you join a shared adventure, inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas that symbolize this project. It’s a journey into new possibilities, where everyone can contribute and benefit from each other’s growth. One of the reassuring aspects of Panshibi is that its smart contract has been thoroughly checked for safety. This means investors can feel secure knowing that the project has been vetted and is less likely to have hidden issues. With these safety measures in place, Panshibiis shaping up to be an appealing choice for anyone looking to enter the crypto market. Panshibi's Promises Over 700% Gains for Early Buyers Currently, Panshibi is running a presale that lasts for 60 days, providing a fantastic opportunity for early investors. The presale operates with dynamic pricing which causes $SHIBI prices to climb when buyers acquire more tokens. At the time of writing, Panshibi has successfully sold out Stage 1 of its presale in record time, and is now in Stage 2 priced at $0.003. The price of SHIBI is expected to rise to $0.004 in its next stage. Ultimately, once the 15 stages of its presale is sold out, early investors will have pocketed an eye watering 1,200 ROI! Looking ahead, the Panshibi team has exciting plans for after the presale. In Phase 3, they will introduce new features like staking and exclusive NFTs, giving more value to token holders. Phase 4 will focus on expanding globally and engaging the community, making sure that Panshibi continues to evolve and innovate as it grows. Conclusion Although Solana is a strong player in the crypto world, Panshibi might be the better choice for investors looking for significant returns. Panshibi presents enticing attributes such as decentralized governance, transparent operations, and a potential for rapid expansion, positioning it as a formidable contender.

Solana (SOL) is a significant player in the crypto scene, known for its unmatched transaction speed and efficiency. At present, SOL trades at approximately $231.64 , reflecting a 13.10% drop over the past week. Nevertheless, its recent surge to $294.33, which is a 17.56% uptick over the past 30 days, highlights its potential to reach $300 or more soon. The technical analysis indicates the Solana price forecast chart is showing higher highs, suggesting a strong upward trend. With a circulating supply of 593.01M SOL tokens and a market cap of $112.76B, it firmly holds its place among the leading altcoins. While most experts have not set a definitive target price for Solana or confirmed it will hit $500, its performance over the last three months has been promising. Additionally, the anticipated launch of a Solana ETF has investors and analysts optimistic about the possibility of such gains for Solana. Panshibi: Beyond Just a Meme Coin While Solana continues to capture interest in the crypto markets, Panshibi is poised to offer thrilling returns and a lively ecosystem that might redefine meme coin investments. Several factors make the Panshibi project attractive, particularly its token distribution strategy aimed at ensuring fairness and sustainable growth. This approach not only fosters community involvement but also positions Panshibi as a serious player in the constantly changing crypto world. Acquiring SHIBI tokens isn't merely about profit; it's about joining an enthusiastic community. By purchasing these tokens, you become part of a shared journey, inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas that represent this initiative. It's a leap into new opportunities, where everyone can contribute and benefit from collective growth. A reassuring element of Panshibi is that its smart contract has undergone thorough security checks. This provides investors with peace of mind, knowing the project has been thoroughly vetted and is less prone to hidden vulnerabilities. With these security measures, Panshibi is emerging as an attractive option for those looking to enter the crypto market. Panshibi's Promises of Over 700% Returns for Early Investors At present, Panshibi is conducting a 60-day presale, presenting an excellent opportunity for early investors. The presale features dynamic pricing, meaning that $SHIBI prices increase as more tokens are purchased. As of now, Panshibi has already sold out Stage 1 of its presale in record time, and is now in Stage 2 with a price of $0.003. The price of SHIBI is anticipated to rise to $0.004 in the upcoming stage. Ultimately, once all 15 presale stages are completed, early investors could enjoy a staggering 1,200 ROI! Looking towards the future, the Panshibi team has exciting plans following the presale. In Phase 3, they plan to introduce new features such as staking and exclusive NFTs, adding more value for token holders. Phase 4 will focus on global expansion and community engagement, ensuring that Panshibi continues to grow and innovate. Conclusion While Solana remains a formidable force in the crypto realm, Panshibi could be a more attractive option for investors seeking substantial returns. Panshibi offers appealing features like decentralized governance, transparency, and rapid growth potential, establishing it as a strong contender. With its current price of $0.003 per SHIBI token, Panshibi is well-positioned for a successful market entry.

For those who are just catching on, the presale has already raised over $675,000, with an impressive 18,546% ROI from Stage 7 to the final listing price of $0.008. Each week, as Pablo “travels,” tokens are burned, reducing the total supply and adding an extra layer of scarcity. The more coins are burned, the higher the value of the remaining ones. This deflationary mechanism gives Arctic Pablo the potential to soar as it continues to captivate investors. 66% APY Staking: But it doesn’t stop there. Arctic Pablo also offers an enticing staking program with a massive 66% APY. That means you can stake your coins, watch your rewards accumulate, and be part of a growing adventure. The more you stake, the more you earn. But remember, your staked tokens will be vested for two months from the launch date—patience will pay off! Final Presale Price and Burn Mechanism: The presale is gradually building towards its final price of $0.0008 per token. Unsold tokens are burned each week, which keeps the environment deflationary and further drives up the potential for profits. As we get closer to the launch, every moment is an opportunity to grab a piece of the action before it explodes.

In 2028, SHIB can reach a maximum value of $0.000114. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach a minimum value of $0.000185 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem with significant growth and utility. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about its future price trajectory. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and solidify its position in the crypto market? Will SHIB ever reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Shiba Inu Token SHIB Price $0.00002154 Market Cap $11,010,939,337.5 Trading Volume $280,254,145.75 Circulating Supply 589,254,022,224,998.1 SHIB All-time High $0.00008845 (Oct 27, 2021) All-time Low $0.00000000008165 (Aug 31, 2020) 24-hour high $0.00001820 24-hour low $0.00001896 Shiba Inu coin price prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.31% 50-Day SMA $0.00002263 14-Day RSI 36.91 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.00001914 Shiba Inu price analysis: SHIB remains largely bearish as buyer interest grows TL;DR Breakdown SHIB is currently trading below its 50-day SMA. SHIB’s key support level is at $0.00001728. If SHIB breaks above $0.00001933, it may target higher resistance levels. Shiba Inu 1-day price chart: Minor bullish attempts exist amid a broader bearish trend The 1-day chart for Shiba Inu on January 30 shows the coin trading below the 20-day SMA at $0.00002066, reflecting a bearish trend. The MACD suggests ongoing bearish momentum, confirming that the slight bullish turn is not solid enough. Minor bullish attempts exist amid a broader Shiba Inu bearish trend The RSI at 41 indicates the asset is near the oversold region, hinting at potential consolidation or a mild recovery if buyers return at the bottom. A break above $0.00001933 could signal further upside, while a rejection risks revisiting lower support levels near $0.00001728. Shiba Inu 4-hour price chart: SHIB see short-term price uptick The 4-hour SHIB/USDT chart shows a slight uptick in price. The Bollinger Bands are still narrow, indicating reduced volatility and the possibility of range-bound price movement. The Balance of Power (BOP) at -0.50 signals growing bearish dominance unless a reversal occurs. Also, the CMF is slightly positive, suggesting some buying pressure despite a bearish takeover. Increased buyer interest and accumulation could see SHIB retest the upper Bollinger band at $0.00001925. Otherwise, SHIB could retest support at $0.00001728. Shiba Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00001981 SELL SMA 5 $0.00001940 SELL SMA 10 $0.00002039 SELL SMA 21 $0.00002106 SELL SMA 50 $0.00002263 SELL SMA 100 $0.00002300 SELL SMA 200 $0.00001948 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.00002067 SELL EMA 5 $0.00002106 SELL EMA 10 $0.00002160 SELL EMA 21 $0.00002234 SELL EMA 50 $0.00002318 SELL EMA 100 $0.00002240 SELL EMA 200 $0.00002083 SELL What to expect from Shiba Inu price analysis? SHIB shows slight signs of renewed buyer interest but still faces potential rejection around $0.00001925 – $0.00001933. A breakout above this range is needed to confirm a bullish recovery. If momentum holds, Shiba Inu could move towards $0.00002066 or dip further if it breaks its immediate support level. Is Shiba Inu a good investment? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has made strides with the launch of Shibarium, its Layer-2 blockchain, and a partnership with Chainlink, boosting cross-chain functionality and utility. The upcoming TREAT token – expected to play a significant role in Shiba Inu’s reward system and governance mechanisms – further expands its ecosystem. While promising, SHIB remains highly speculative and subject to market swings, so proceed cautiously as a trader or investor. Will Shiba Inu recover? Shiba Inu is experiencing fluctuations with a recent upward trend; there are signs of potential recovery. Will SHIB reach $1? Reaching $1 for Shiba Inu (SHIB) is highly unlikely due to its massive circulating supply and the unrealistic market cap. Significant demand increases and supply reductions would be necessary to approach such a price. Will SHIB reach $10 It is unlikely that SHIB will reach $10 due to its enormous circulating supply and the unrealistic market capitalization required to achieve this feat. Will SHIB reach $100? Reaching $100 for SHIB is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply and the astronomically high market capitalization it would necessitate. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on continued adoption, broader market adoption trends, and other cryptocurrency market space developments.

39713411,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=665697,1738281307,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39713411.jpeg,MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor graces the cover of Forbes: “The Bitcoin Alchemist”,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-graces-the-cover-of-forbes-the-bitcoin-alchemist/,"Michael Saylor is everywhere, and now he’s on the cover of Forbes in an issue released Jan. 30. The 59-year-old CEO of MicroStrategy was pictured grinning under the bold title, “The Bitcoin Alchemist,” an iconic and very fitting name. Michael came into the market just five years ago and quite literally devoured Bitcoin. Since then, he has accumulated 471,107 BTC worth around $50 billion, turning his company into the ultimate Bitcoin whale and himself into a $9.4 billion man. On New Year’s Eve, Michael hosted 500 elite guests at Villa Vecchia, his 18,000-square-foot mansion in Miami, Florida. Picture this the way Forbes described it in their issue: tangerine suits, golden bodysuits, and hors d’oeuvres stamped with Bitcoin’s iconic “B” logo. Michael Saylor’s Forbes cover Dancers swirled glowing orbs in Bitcoin’s signature orange hue. Outside, the 154-foot Usher yacht rocked against the Miami skyline, ferrying in institutional investors, crypto influencers, and executives. And get this, the main event wasn’t even the new year, it was Bitcoin breaking $100,000 for the first time ever. David Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc. and publisher of Bitcoin Magazine, walked the scene, wearing a cap stamped with “Satoshi Nakamoto.” He was the one who brought Donald Trump to July’s Bitcoin conference, where Trump declared he’d turn America into “the crypto capital of the planet.” But oh no, this night belonged to Michael. The whole party felt less like a party and more like a coronation for the untitled King of Crypto, something he might have to fight El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele for. Though hey listen, this article is about Michael, not Nayib. And Michael strolled through the party in his black blazer, blue jeans, and a T-shirt branded with the Bitcoin logo. Selfie requests and handshakes piled up. Here, Bitcoin was a religion, and Michael was its high priest. The comeback of the century Michael’s relationship with money has always been a bit so-so. Anyway, he built MicroStrategy in 1989 as a data-mining company right out of MIT. By 2000, this genius was worth $13 billion, but the tech bubble popped, and so did his empire. The SEC accused him of accounting fraud, and MicroStrategy’s stock dropped like a rock—from $313 per share to under $1. His $13 billion net worth was gone overnight. “It was the darkest part of my life. When people lose money because they believe in you, that’s pretty much the worst,” he said. For the next twenty years, MicroStrategy limped along with unimpressive sales and a market cap around $1 billion. Then came 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic triggered massive global fiat printing, and Michael said he started seeing the dollar as “trash.” He didn’t see safety in dollars or bonds, but he saw safety in Bitcoin’s 21 million token limit. With $530 million in cash reserves and after months of contemplation, he made the call, said MicroStrategy would go all-in on Bitcoin. Over three years, MicroStrategy scooped up more Bitcoin than anyone else in the world, apart from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. After the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock, Bitcoin’s price doubled, then smashed $100,000 in December after Trump won the election and gave the industry what he promised us. That spike pushed MicroStrategy straight into the Nasdaq 100. The company’s stock surged over 700% last year. Michael’s net worth went from $1.9 billion in 2024 to $9.4 billion in January 2025. Pretty crazy, huh? MicroStrategy is now worth $84 billion, despite having only $48 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Wall Street doesn’t really get it, but Michael does. “We put a crypto reactor in the middle of the company and spin it,” he said. “That volatility fuels everything.” How Michael Saylor weaponized volatility and became Wall Street’s King Now here’s the magic trick: Michael knew Wall Street thrives on volatility, the very thing traditional investors fear. In 2021, he began issuing billions in convertible bonds, offering investors the option to convert debt into shares of MicroStrategy. The implied volatility of MicroStrategy’s options skyrocketed as Bitcoin prices bounced wildly. Traders loved it. “People thought I was crazy,” Michael told Forbes. “How can such a small company have that liquidity? Because we created volatility on purpose.” MicroStrategy has issued six convertible notes since 2021, totaling $7.3 billion, with interest rates between 0% and 2.25%. Investors ate them up. Allianz and State Street grabbed huge chunks. The bonds delivered returns over 250%, making them one of the top-performing debt plays in the market. Even the $3 billion issued last November—with a 0% coupon—gained 89% in just a few months. With its stock price up 2,666% since 2020, MicroStrategy’s market frenzy rivals even Tesla and Amazon. Its shares jumped from 97 million to 246 million through secondary offerings and debt issuance. In January, shareholders approved increasing the authorized shares to 10.3 billion. His strategy is simple: raise debt, buy Bitcoin, drive prices up, issue more shares, and repeat. And just when Wall Street thought he was done, Michael introduced a new financial metric: Bitcoin Yield. It measures the growth of Bitcoin holdings relative to the company’s fully diluted shares. MicroStrategy reported a 74.3% BTC Yield for 2024. Wall Street couldn’t ignore the signal, even if it seemed arbitrary. So now those guys are knocking on Michael’s door, they want in on the action too. Michael’s financial engineering is now a template for others. Bitwise counts 90 public companies—Tesla and Block included—adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. In March 2025, Bitwise will launch a Bitcoin Standard ETF tracking 35 companies holding over 1,000 BTC each. MicroStrategy dominates the list. “Size is everything,” said Jeff Park from Bitwise. “MicroStrategy is the most liquid source for trading Bitcoin-related risks.” What happens if Bitcoin crashes? Here’s the question: What happens if Bitcoin drops like it did in 2018 or 2022? The answer is, according to Michael, MicroStrategy has time. Bitcoin would need to fall over 80% and stay there for two years before this hero would be in trouble. “Actually, there’s very little debt on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet,” said Jeff Park. The debt is unsecured, so there’s no forced liquidation of Bitcoin assets even if things go south. Michael isn’t worried. Trump’s crypto-friendly administration is back, and the US national debt keeps surging. “Cash is trash,” he said to Forbes, sticking to his mantra. Trump’s spending policies will for sure hurt the dollar, which will only strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal. Michael said, “The irony of my career is I invented 20 things, and I tried to make them successful, and I really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared, and now we just carry the torch. That, ironically, has made me more successful than me trying to commercialize every one of my own ideas. It is a lesson in humility.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-30 23:55:07

Ethereum ETFs Struggle & XRP Price Prediction Shows Rally,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-pick-for-2025-web3bay-shines-with-6000-roi-ethereum-etfs-struggle-xrp-price-prediction-shows-rally/,"The digital currency market is seeing high excitement, with investor enthusiasm and high valuations. Often, these periods have been followed by market dips, highlighting the importance of choosing cryptos with strong basics that can maintain value during downturns. XRP’s price forecast shows it nearing an important barrier at $3.30, suggesting possible growth, yet a market drop could still occur. Similarly, the Ethereum ETF managed by Fidelity has seen no new investments, indicating investor wariness amid market uncertainties. Amid these market trends, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as a strong investment choice. Its decentralized e-commerce platform is reinforced by a successful $980,000 presale and an anticipated return of 6,430%. This platform promises substantial long-term potential that transcends current market volatility. At the heart of Web3Bay is a commitment to innovation, presenting a solid opportunity for investors aiming to manage the complexities of the vibrant market with a project that is both innovative and focused on practical utility. Web3Bay (3BAY): A New Force in E-Commerce Web3Bay, known as the potential “Amazon Killer,” is transforming online shopping with its blockchain-based platform. This initiative addresses traditional e-commerce issues like high fees, transparency, and data privacy by empowering users. It provides secure and open dealings with added benefits such as a 5% savings on purchases using the 3BAY token. Its presale was a hit, with $980,000 raised and over 265 million tokens sold. With the current token price at $0.004562 in its third stage, it’s accessible for many. The token’s expected increase to $0.1959 could give early buyers a return of 6,430%. Web3Bay’s strategy includes innovative features like decentralized storage through IPFS, compatibility across blockchain networks like Ethereum and BNB, and plans for second-layer solutions to speed up and reduce transaction costs. Its community-led approach gives users a voice in the platform’s direction. With growing interest in its presale, Web3Bay is setting up to revolutionize e-commerce. This is your chance to get involved before it launches! XRP Price Prediction: Potential for Major Gains or a Pullback? The current analysis of XRP suggests it’s trading at $3.12 and facing a crucial resistance at $3.30. Overcoming this barrier could trigger a significant uptrend, potentially reaching $4.19, $5, or even $6.61. Despite a mixed track record recently and a 4% decrease over the last week, the support levels between $2.52 and $2.94 are robust, providing a solid foundation for those hoping for price appreciation. Conversely, these support levels offer a reliable fallback for purchasers. The recent breakout of XRP from a triangle formation on January 13 indicates potential for continued upward movement, though the current slowing momentum suggests it could soon reach a pivotal juncture. Investors should keep an eye on the $3.30-$3.40 range for signs of a possible ascent. While a surge could bring substantial rewards, there’s also a chance of regression to lower support zones in the near term. Ethereum ETF Faces Challenges with No Recent Inflows The Fidelity-managed Ethereum ETF has experienced no new inflows lately, indicating a stall in investor enthusiasm. This aligns with Ethereum’s price holding steady at $2,850 after a recent 1.2% decrease. The absence of fresh funds highlights investor caution, possibly due to a decline in trading volume and general activity within the Ethereum network. This ETF is now under close watch as investors assess how this trend might impact the broader market. Despite potential risks of market volatility, Ethereum’s established role in decentralized finance and smart contracts might still offer profitable scenarios for those willing to handle the current uncertainties. This market hiatus could serve as a potential opportunity for strategic investors eyeing Ethereum’s long-term growth. Summing Up! In a fluctuating crypto market, XRP, Ethereum, and Web3Bay each offer unique prospects, but Web3Bay stands out with its innovative approach and substantial ROI potential. While XRP might soon exceed $3.30 and Ethereum ETF is not seeing new money, Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce . It’s redefining the space with lower fees, privacy, and user governance, with its presale already achieving significant token sales and offering a 6,430% ROI. For those seeking impactful growth, Web3Bay is poised to lead the next wave of blockchain-based e-commerce, making it a top choice for future-focused investors.

Toncoin Eyes Potential Surge & HBAR Tests Key Support,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-tg-tap-miner-lands-on-okx-wallet-enhances-gamefi-toncoin-eyes-potential-surge-hbar-tests-key-support/,"The lines between gaming and blockchain are blurring, turning once simple in-game items into valuable digital assets. Projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have shown how GameFi can create new financial opportunities for players. But getting started with these games and accessing their full potential can be tricky, limiting their widespread appeal. BlockDAG ‘s TG Tap Miner offers a different path. It uses the familiar Telegram platform to provide a simple play-to-earn experience. Now, with its integration with OKX, accessing and managing in-game rewards and digital assets is easier than ever. Meanwhile, Toncoin’s recent price action and Hedera Hashgraph’s technical outlook remind us of the ever-present volatility in the crypto market. This volatility underscores the importance of GameFi projects like TG Tap Miner that prioritize user-friendliness. OKX Collaboration Accelerates BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner Into Mainstream Gaming BlockDAG’s recent partnership with OKX is a major step in its GameFi journey, highlighting its dedication to bringing gaming and decentralized finance closer together. TG Tap Miner, BlockDAG’s Telegram-based play-to-earn game, has already seen considerable interest. Its integration with OKX’s wallet system sets it up for widespread adoption. This move aligns with the broader rise of GameFi, where projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have shown how in-game items can become valuable, tradable assets. But TG Tap Miner stands out by providing a smooth user experience through Telegram, removing the usual hurdles to entry. BlockDAG’s presale success further demonstrates its momentum, raising over $186.5 million with 17.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently in its 27th batch at $0.0248 per coin, the project has seen an impressive 2,380% return since batch 1. With OKX integrating TG Tap Miner NFTs, BlockDAG is poised for even greater growth as more players gain easy access to in-game rewards and digital assets. Looking forward, BlockDAG could further improve its ecosystem with features like staking, allowing users to earn passive income on their BDAG holdings. NFT lending could let gamers borrow assets for gameplay, creating a more fluid in-game economy. A dedicated NFT marketplace could boost the value and trading of TG Tap Miner collectibles. As BlockDAG continues its rapid expansion, its partnership with OKX signals a new era where gaming and blockchain blend seamlessly, offering exciting opportunities for those who get in early. Is Toncoin’s Set For A Potential Surge? Toncoin (TON) is currently trading near $5.02, approaching a key resistance level at $5.30, with an all-time high of $8.24. The platform’s active development environment is attracting a variety of projects, fostering ecosystem growth. At the same time, recent U.S. political changes may lead to more crypto-friendly regulations, encouraging broader adoption—a significant shift given past regulatory uncertainties. TON’s focus on scalability and efficient transaction processing positions it well for mainstream use. Given these factors, analysts predict a potential rise to $54 in 2025, suggesting substantial returns for early investors. However, the crypto market’s inherent volatility means such forecasts should be approached cautiously. While TON’s technological strengths and favorable regulatory trends make it an appealing investment, thorough personal research and risk assessment are essential before making investment decisions. Hedera Hashgraph Tests Key Support Levels Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) recently tested its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as a critical support level after a slight pullback. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests oversold conditions, hinting at a possible rebound. If the price maintains support at $0.2559, an upward push toward $0.3930 remains likely. However, breaking below this level could accelerate losses. From a technical perspective, the outlook leans bullish, with potential recovery driven by improved market sentiment. Moreover, a break above resistance could fuel further gains, strengthening HBAR’s position. Consequently, traders are watching for confirmation signals to gauge the next move. Meanwhile, the market’s response to external factors, including broader crypto trends, will play a role in determining whether the bullish scenario unfolds. While uncertainty persists, maintaining the above support could reinforce buying momentum. If buyers regain control, the upcoming sessions might witness renewed optimism, positioning Hedera Hashgraph for an extended rally toward key resistance levels. The Bottom Line As blockchain ecosystems grow, accessibility and utility are becoming crucial factors in driving long-term adoption. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner stands out by simplifying the GameFi experience via Telegram, removing the obstacles that typically hinder wider participation. Thanks to its integration with OKX, players can now easily access in-game rewards, enhancing their position within the market. In parallel, Toncoin’s price fluctuations and Hedera Hashgraph’s technical trends highlight the ongoing volatility in the crypto space, affecting investor strategies. Looking ahead, projects like TG Tap Miner that focus on combining user-friendly interfaces with strong financial incentives are well-positioned to thrive, providing a smoother entry into blockchain-based gaming and decentralized finance.

Aptos is a fast-growing layer-1 blockchain network, and the biggest compliment to its reputation could be its “Solana killer” nickname. It claims to be an upgrade on existing blockchain platforms with its solutions to enhance scalability, security and user experience. The Aptos platform supports over 200 decentralized applications ( dApps ), with over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) and a stablecoin market cap of approximately $780 million. USDT holds a 75% share of the stablecoin in circulation on the network. Before the integration, the USDC on the platform was bridged from other networks. Financial institutions can now also interact with USDC liquidity and benefit from Aptos’ network. USDC launch on Aptos Circle announced in November 2024 that it would launch on the Aptos network. Now, two months later, the company announced on its website that its stablecoin is now available on the Aptos mainnet. With the integration, USDC is now accessible to developers and users with no bridging required. USDC is the world’s largest MiCA-compliant dollar stablecoin. The token’s availability on the Aptos layer-1 network could open more growth opportunities for the Circle-issued stablecoin. Aptos has a $4.54 billion market cap, which is a reflection of its success in supporting developers to build apps for various use cases. Apps on the network include DeFi, peer-to-peer payments, cross-border remittances, and much more. Some of the top applications in the Aptos ecosystem include Aries Markets, Thala, KGen, and Cellana Finance. The Aptos network has a bridged form of USDC circulating known as IzUSDC. It is bridged from Ethereum through the AptosBridge. The growth of the bridged version is possible due to bridge providers such as Stargate. The popularity of IzUSDC was a major factor in Circle’s decision to bring native USDC to the Aptos mainnet network. At present, lzUSDC is not issued by Circle and is not compatible nor redeemable with Circle Mint. However, the Aptos team and bridge providers will be working to help facilitate the migration from lzUSDC to native USDC over time. Circle gains ground on Tether Circle, the stablecoin issuer has witnessed a recent boost in the European market due to several factors. High on the list is that it has achieved full compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. MiCA is a regulatory body that requires issuers of stablecoins to meet strict transparency, liquidity, and consumer protection standards. On the other hand, Tether’s USDT did not meet the MiCA standards required to continue operating in Europe. Tether’s market cap dropped from $140 billion to $137 billion following MiCA regulations implementation, which started on December 30, 2024. ` Circle’s collaboration with Aptos is an apparent move to close the gap on Tether’s USDT. Tether announced a similar integration last year, but with USDC on the “Solana killer” layer-1 network, USDT’s 75% dominance could be under threat.

For thousands of traders, that story is Bonk (BONK). Back in 2023, when Solana’s first major dog-themed meme coin launched, most people laughed it off as another flash-in-the-pan gimmick. Big mistake. At launch, Bonk was practically free, trading at microscopic fractions of a cent. But then it exploded. Within months, BONK surged over 4,500%, minting overnight millionaires. Investors who threw in a few hundred bucks early walked away with six-figure gains. And yet, most people ignored it—until it was too late. If you’re reading this, you probably weren’t one of the lucky ones. But here’s the good news: history is repeating itself. Another meme coin with sky-high potential is in its early stages, and this time, you don’t have to miss out. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the top new meme coin to join in February 2025 that’s poised to dominate the market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Meme Coin Revolution You Can’t Ignore Meme coins aren’t just about hype anymore. The best ones are combining viral appeal with real-world utility, and BTFD is leading the charge. Unlike most meme coins that live and die by market sentiment alone, BTFD packs an arsenal of features designed to reward long-term holders and active community members. A Presale That’s Printing Future Millionaires If you’re looking for an early-stage play with a massive upside, BTFD’s presale is the golden ticket. The coin launched at just $0.000004 and is now sitting at $0.00016 in its 14th presale stage, with an expected launch price of $0.0006. That’s an easy 275% ROI waiting to happen just by getting in before the presale ends. Let’s put that into perspective. If you invest $20,000 in BTFD at its current presale price of $0.00016, you’ll snag 125 million BTFD tokens . Once it hits the listing price of $0.0006, your investment balloons to $75,000. Now imagine if BTFD pulls a Bonk-style rally—how high could your gains go? The “Bulls Squad” is Leading the Stampede BTFD isn’t just another faceless meme coin. It has a mascot-driven ecosystem called the Bulls Squad, featuring characters like Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull. These aren’t just cute icons—they represent the movement of traders who are sick of missing dips and are ready to take charge of their financial future. The Bulls Squad embodies the fearless spirit of early adopters. In other words, BTFD rewards those who grab opportunities before the crowd catches on. 90% APY Staking – Your Money Working for You Unlike most meme coins that sit idle in your wallet, BTFD lets you stake and earn a massive 90% APY. Whether you’re looking to stack more tokens passively or double down on your long-term bet, staking ensures that every BTFD holder is earning, even when the market takes a breather. Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game – Earn While You Play Launched on January 1, 2025, the BTFD Play-to-Earn (P2E) game lets users rack up rewards while enjoying the action-packed gaming experience. This isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a full ecosystem where holders can engage, play, and win. BTFD’s explosive growth is just getting started, and with over 9,900 holders already on board, it’s clear this is more than just hype—it’s a movement. Bonk (BONK) – The One That Got Away (For Some) Let’s rewind to late 2023. Bonk (BONK) was just another meme coin floating under the radar, and most people laughed it off as just another dog-themed gimmick. But while the skeptics laughed, early believers were banking serious cash. The Crazy Bonk (BONK) Surge Bonk went from being an airdrop token to a billion-dollar market cap meme coin. It saw massive gains, climbing over 5,000% in a few months. If you had thrown just $500 into Bonk in its early days, you could have easily turned that into $25,000 or more. The market didn’t take Bonk seriously at first, but when major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase listed it, things got wild. Bonk’s price skyrocketed, and suddenly, it wasn’t just a joke—it was the hottest meme coin of the season. Why You Might Have Missed Out Most investors ignored Bonk, thinking it was just another meme coin that wouldn’t last. Others thought they’d have more time to buy in. But by the time the FOMO kicked in, it was already too late—the biggest gains had already been made. And now, history is repeating itself. A fresh meme coin is rising, offering the same kind of early-stage opportunity, but with even more firepower behind it. Why BTFD is Your Second Chance at a Bonk-Style Payday Opportunities like Bonk (BONK) don’t come around often, and when they do, you have two choices: Get in early and reap the rewards, or hesitate and watch from the sidelines as others cash in. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a strategic, community-driven project with a massive ecosystem designed to reward early adopters. If you missed Bonk, this is your moment to make things right. Referral Program – Get Paid for Spreading the Word BTFD isn’t just letting you invest—it’s paying you to bring in new buyers. Its referral system rewards both referrers and new buyers with extra BTFD tokens. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet – Get a unique referral code. Share Your Code – Invite your friends, family, or crypto community. Earn Rewards – Your referrals get 10% extra BTFD , and you receive 10% of every purchase made with your code if you rank in the top 20 referrers. Track Your Earnings – Watch your BTFD stack grow in real-time. Passive income while you invest? Now that’s a game-changer. Final Verdict – Are You Going to Let This One Slip Away Too? Bonk (BONK) was the meme coin that made early believers rich, but most people didn’t take it seriously until it was too late. Now, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is presenting the same kind of massive opportunity—but with even more power, features, and earning potential behind it. The BTFD presale is in its 14th stage, with a price of $0.00016, already raising over $5.82 million. When it lists at $0.0006, early investors will see an easy 275% ROI—and that’s just the beginning. With 90% APY staking, a live Play-to-Earn game, and the unstoppable Bulls Squad movement, BTFD is the Top New Meme Coin to Join in February 2025 . So, will you Buy The Dip this time, or will you be kicking yourself six months from now? The choice is yours.

Ethereum MVRV Momentum Has Witnessed A Bearish Crossover As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has declined under its 160-day moving average (MA) recently. The “MVRV Ratio” refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Ethereum market cap and the realized cap. The realized cap here is a capitalization model that calculates ETH’s total valuation by assuming that the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin MPI Crossover Could Suggest Bull Run Still On Since the last transaction of any coin is likely to correspond to the last point at which it changed hands, the Realized Cap essentially measures the sum of the cost basis of the circulating supply. This model could also be looked at as a representation of the amount of capital the investors as whole have put into Ethereum. In contrast, the market cap is the value that the holders are carrying right now. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, it means the market cap is greater than the realized cap. Such a trend implies the investors as a whole are sitting on unrealized gains. On the other hand, the metric being under the mark suggests the holders are carrying a lower value than they initially put in, so the average investor could be considered underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV Ratio, as well as its 160-day MA, over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has registered a decline recently as ETH’s price has followed a bearish trajectory. The indicator is still above the 1 mark after this drawdown, suggesting the overall market remains in the green. The metric’s fall, however, has meant that it has slipped under its 160-day MA. The combination of the indicator’s daily value and its 160-day is known as the MVRV Momentum. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted what happened the last time the MVRV Momentum showed a similar pattern as recently.

It would appear that the MVRV Ratio crossing under its 160-day MA led to a 40% price correction for Ethereum last year. It now remains to be seen whether the negative momentum in the indicator would also prove to be bearish for the cryptocurrency this time as well or not. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,200, up more than 2% over the last seven days.

The company admitted it has been unable to sustain operations. It wrote : “This is not the outcome we had hoped for, but we’re incredibly grateful for this community and everyone who believed in the vision and showed up with enthusiasm. Your support meant everything. Thank you for believing in us. ” Teleport shuts down as users have until February 28 to withdraw funds The company’s website currently has a message informing visitors about the wind-down process. The app will provide off-ramping support until Feb. 28 so users can receive their remaining stablecoin balances and private keys. Meanwhile, the firm hopes to post a more detailed analysis of what led to this decision in the future, but for now, we’re focused on an orderly wind-down. Led by early crypto investor and former Dropbox engineer Paul Bohm, Teleport was launched in 2022 when the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) projects began to boom. Just as Helium did, Teleport also aimed to integrate blockchain-based incentives into real-world applications. The company was different from traditional ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft since it employed Solana’s blockchain to establish an open and transparent marketplace. Teleport’s Rideshare Protocol was intended to reduce costs for riders and increase earnings for drivers by excluding the middlemen corporations. Customer acquisition was not traditional but “permissionless marketing,” where users could find drivers and riders and bring them into the network. Teleport utilized a reward system inspired by Bitcoin’s mining rewards, which rewarded early adopters with Compressed NFTs on Solana. DEC’s $9 million seed funding couldn’t save Teleport from industry challenges The Decentralized Engineering Corporation (DEC) that built the app raised $9 million in a seed funding round co-led by Steve Vassallo at Foundation Capital and Thomas Bailey at Road Capital. However, while its innovative model was built on a sound idea, Teleport failed to gain critical mass and financial health. The ride-sharing industry is competitive, with the existing players keeping their stronghold on the users by having a large user base, regulatory power, and financial backup. While the blockchain-based incentives were a way of doing things differently, they were not enough to help Teleport navigate through the operational and market challenges that the project faced.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 314,000 followers on the social media platform X that dogwifhat ( WIF ) might have bottomed out after completing a correction in a three-wave pattern on the weekly time frame. The analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis says that while WIF’s bearish trend lasted longer than he had originally anticipated, there are “some nice signs of life forming” on the memecoin’s low time-frames. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. While cautioning that it’s too early to conclude that a bull run is underway, Bluntz says, “Obviously very early days and we haven’t seen a five-wave rise from the lows “yet” but I think there’s a decent chance one has begun to form.” Source: Bluntz/X WIF is trading at $1.32 at time of writing. Next up is Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to the widely followed analyst, Bitcoin could potentially be forming a “brutal” swing failure pattern (SFP) to the downside on the two-week chart. A swing failure pattern is a tool in technical analysis that is used to determine potential points of a trend reversal. “Bitcoin has five days to not be a brutal two-week SFP.” Source: Bluntz/X Bitcoin is trading at $101,912 at time of writing.

Analysts now suggest a pivot to RCO Finance, an altcoin project that is changing the narrative in the financial sector by leveraging artificial intelligence for streamlined investing. Read on to see why analysts expect RCO Finance to become one of the top altcoin assets 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Slows Down as Memecoin Appeal Wanes Dogecoin is one of the latest tokens to be affected by the fall in demand for meme coins. Despite surging to a 3-year high in December, Dogecoin has stagnated only a few weeks later. Dogecoin trades at $0.3348 after an 11.25% drop in the past week. Analysts predict a continuation of this bearish trend for Dogecoin (DOGE), as demand for meme coins wanes in favor of more stable altcoin assets. As a result, many Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are now seeking opportunities elsewhere, with RCO Finance attracting attention as its presale revenue crosses $12 million. RCO Finance: The Next Genration of Investing Tools for the Finance Sector Traders in the financial sector today have to sift through mountains of market data, which makes finding profitable opportunities difficult. However, RCO Finance (RCOF) presents a novel solution in its Robo Advisor, an AI tool that marries smart automation with broad market access, allowing you to stay focused while doing the heavy lifting in your portfolio. Robo Advisor is a tireless researcher who scans global markets, looking for patterns and risks. It continuously collects high-quality market data from reputable sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, watching for shifts that can bring you profits. Robo Advisor will provide trading strategies tailored to your investing goals, market preference, and risk appetite. Even better, this tool can adjust your portfolio for both short and long-term needs. This is especially useful in volatile markets, where quick decisions are essential to limit losses or maximize returns. For instance, imagine having Robo Advisor at your disposal in Q3 2024, right before XRP’s price surge. This tool would have notified you of its growth early on, allowing you to capitalize on its rise to $3. The best part is that you wouldn’t need to constantly watch the market as the trading bot will be in charge of your portfolio. Robo Advisor also provides access to a diverse range of financial instruments, which include over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories. Being an RCO Finance investor, you can explore everything from stocks, bonds, futures, and ETFs to cryptocurrencies, commodities, and even real estate. You can leverage this broad access to build a robust portfolio with exposure to distinct asset classes, allowing you to balance risk and return in a way that keeps you profitable. For instance, a crypto investor facing an imminent market crash can leverage RCO Finance’s trading bot to diversify part of their portfolio into Nvidia stock, gaining some stability from tech markets. Beyond the ability to trade across multiple asset classes, RCO Finance also offers extra profit-earning mechanisms. Like other DeFi ecosystems, you can stake RCOF tokens, contributing to liquidity pools. In return, investors will receive up to 86% APY, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 10%-15%. RCO Finance also rewards investors with trading fee discounts for keeping an RCOF balance. The higher your token reserve, the more trading fee discounts you will receive. Another area RCO Finance stands out is offering unmatched privacy and convenience. Many DeFi platforms have stringent KYC policies, which usually infringe on personal privacy. RCO Finance takes a different route, removing KYC policies and offering a non-invasive paperwork process. Additionally, investors enjoy extra security as all transactions are backed by RCO Finance’s smart contract technology, which has been audited by SolidProof, showing investors that RCO Finance is committed to user safety. RCO Finance’s User Signups Crosses 10,000 as Beta Platform Goes Live Over 10,000 investors have joined RCO Finance’s ecosystem, indicating the strong demand for its services. These investors can now understand its ecosystem by exploring the live beta platform. RCO Finance’s team is also working on changes and improvements on Robo Advisor and the trading platform before its full alpha launch. This news has impressed the altcoin sector, showing that RCO Finance is committed to providing tangible solutions to investor problems. Best Crypto Coins for 2025: Why Analysts Pick RCOF Over Dogecoin In the search for the best crypto coins for 2025, investors have picked RCO Finance for its AI-based investing solutions over the meme coin appeal of Dogecoin. Already, over $12 million worth of tokens have been sold in RCO Finance’s ongoing presale. RCOF is now in stage five of its presale, selling at $0.100. By the next stage, its value will grow to $0.130. With a targeted listing price of $0.4-$0.6, RCOF is poised to become one of the fastest-growing tokens in the market. Finally, analysts say it is poised for a 14,000x growth, which could take a $1,000 investment to $250,000 by Q2 2026. Don’t miss out on the chance to elevate your investing strategy.

This decision allows NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the fund, which will hold both Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside cash reserves. The approval was granted on an accelerated basis, as indicated in the SEC filing released on January 30, 2025. US SEC Approves Bitwise ETF Holding Both Bitcoin and Ethereum According to the recent filing , the SEC approved the Bitwise ETF on an accelerated basis. The approval permits NYSE Arca to list and trade the ETF, which will provide investors with direct exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Bitwise ETF will hold spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, and cash reserves. This structure is designed to offer diversified exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The SEC’s approval follows a series of crypto-related ETF filings submitted by multiple financial firms in recent months. Following the ongoing trend on crypto ETFs, a report highlighted that Grayscale filed for a spot XRP ETF with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The asset manager will convert its existing XRP Trust into an ETF, which would be listed and traded on the exchange. This move comes shortly after Grayscale filed for Litecoin and Solana ETFs, signaling increasing interest in crypto investment products. Pending S-1 Registration Required for Trading Despite the approval of form 19b-4, the Bitwise ETF still requires SEC clearance for its pending S-1 registration. Both steps are necessary before the fund can begin trading on the exchange. The S-1 registration review will determine compliance with regulatory standards, including investor protection measures and transparency requirements. Bitwise Asset Management must await further approval before officially launching the ETF in the market. In the Thursday filing, the US SEC wrote, “In particular, the Commission finds that the Proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Exchange’s rules be designed to ‘prevent manipulative acts and practices’ and, ‘in general, to protect investors and the public interest.” Broader Regulatory Shift in Crypto ETFs The US SEC decision reflects an evolving regulatory stance on cryptocurrency ETFs. Under the current administration, firms have submitted multiple applications to launch similar financial products. Recently, VanEck and ProShares filed for ETFs tracking assets like Litecoin, XRP, and Solana. The approval of the Bitwise ETF follows prior approvals in December 2024 for crypto index ETFs from firms such as Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. It is worth noting that earlier in the week, the asset management firm submitted an S-1 filing with the US SEC for a spot Dogecoin ETF . Bitwise confirmed that the ETF’s Net Asset Value (NAV) will be based on the Dogecoin-Dollar settlement benchmark from CF trading. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have shown movement following the announcement. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $104,612.69 with a 1.13% increase over the past week, while Ethereum stands at $3,269, gaining 4% in the last 24 hours.

39715922,https://nulltx.com/?p=142095,1738288803,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,What Has Got So Many Toncoin & Polkadot Holders Loving Up 1Fuel & Are Underlying Partnerships Going To Make This 100X,https://nulltx.com/what-has-got-so-many-toncoin-polkadot-holders-loving-up-1fuel-are-underlying-partnerships-going-to-make-this-100x/,"Over the years, Toncoin and Polkadot have dominated the market among the best cryptocurrencies to buy. However, times are changing rapidly, paving the way for utility-driven altcoins like 1Fuel , which is available for the low presale entry of $0.017. Read to discover why analysts eye 1Fuel as the best crypto to invest in from this moment and why it will likely outperform Toncoin and Polkadot in the upcoming bull cycle. Toncoin falters in late January The Toncoin price has stagnated over the past two weeks, causing profound losses for investors. Like many altcoins, Toncoin initially benefited from heightened market euphoria around Trump’s inauguration, soaring to $5.6 earlier this month. Now, in the final week of January, Toncoin exchanges for $4.8, which is a 5% decline in the past week and a 14% decline compared to the past month. Polkadot holders desperate to recoup losses Amid the ongoing crypto sell-offs, the Polkadot price has left investors wanting more. For context, DOT rallied to a high of $7.6 in early January, leading holders to predict massive gains. However, Polkadot could not live up to expectations and is now trading for $6, down over 4% compared to the previous week. With rising trading volume and buying pressure, bullish analysts suggest Polkadot could be due for a consolidation or price increase. However, a descent below its critical $6 support could trigger further Polkadot price drops. Is 1Fuel the best crypto to invest in? The recent Toncoin and Polkadot sell-offs are pushing many investors to 1Fuel. At its core, 1Fuel makes blockchain tech more accessible through its secure cross-chain wallet. Unlike any other cold crypto wallet, using 1Fuel, you do not have to worry about network tokens or excessive gas fees. Just choose the token you want to use, specify the crypto you want to own (no matter the network), then focus on your goals and let 1Fuel take care of the rest. Experts agree that 1Fuel’s ease of use and cross-chain capabilities position it as an important tool for the future of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Additionally, 1Fuel’s consensus mechanism reduces the ecological footprint of blockchain transactions. This approach adds an extra layer of appeal for investors who value eco-friendly crypto instruments. OFT: Expert predictions OFT is the native token of 1Fuel, which currently offers a golden chance to make unparalleled capital gains. The OFT presale price is $0.017, and it is expected to rise 100x in the coming months. This presale event also offers OFT at the lowest possible price. So, by securing an early entry, investors can position themselves to watch a tiny investment compound when 1Fuel hits exchanges. Conclusion Toncoin and Polkadot are undoubtedly among the best cryptocurrencies thanks to their dedicated communities and loyal investor bases. However, recent sell-offs are pushing their holders to get 1Fuel, which offers a way out of these losses. Thanks to diverse use cases and sustainable infrastructure, experts are convinced it will generate 100x returns as soon as 1Fuel makes its public launch. Want to buy 1Fuel tokens before the next price increase? Join the presale today and stake your claim in the future of secure cross-chain transactions.

By transforming the $600 trillion property market, PCHAIN delivers tangible asset backing, unlike XRP and Cardano, which focus on exchange and smart contracts. Investor confidence has surged, with analysts predicting a 55,000% upside, surpassing Cardano and XRP price movements. As adoption grows, PCHAIN is poised for a significant parabolic rally, bridging real estate and digital assets while reshaping the crypto landscape. This positions it as a leader in blockchain innovation. Cardano Price: A Community Sentiment or Market Stability Cardano has become a standout performer in the ongoing altcoin rally, showcasing strong bullish momentum. Following Bitcoin’s surge to $99,000 in November, Cardano (ADA) reached a 3-year high, benefiting from the market’s upward trajectory. Analysts are now debating the longevity of this altcoin season. Many experts believe Cardano will maintain its rally, with its growing DeFi activity playing a crucial role in driving substantial growth. XRP Faces Challenges Amidst Phishing Alert XRP recently experienced a 12.18% surge, reaching $3.13 and surpassing the $3 mark. Ripple’s anticipated legal victory over the SEC and the buzz around ETFs have likely fueled this momentum. However, new concerns about security vulnerabilities could hinder XRP’s continued growth. As uncertainties persist, some investors are reconsidering their long-term strategies, exploring alternatives in the crypto market that offer more tangible utility and resilience against potential setbacks. PropiChain: A New Frontier in Real Estate Market Innovation with 55,000% Upside PropiChain is reshaping the real estate industry with advanced technology, offering a new way to buy, sell, and invest in property. Its innovative platform is positioned to outpace established players like XRP and Cardano in adoption and market impact. PropiChain integrates Metaverse technology to redefine property scouting. Its interactive 3D virtual tours break down geographical barriers, enabling global investors to explore properties remotely. This approach enhances transparency and eliminates logistical hurdles. It allows real-time property assessments without the need for physical visits, reducing costs and time. PropiChain employs blockchain-powered smart contracts to automate key processes like lease management, ownership transfers, and rental payments. This eliminates intermediaries like brokers, increasing transaction security and efficiency. PropiChain integrates AI to optimize real estate investment strategies. Its AI assistants provide 24/7 support and offer market insights, forecasting property value shifts and delivering data-backed recommendations. This ensures investors maximize profitability while minimizing risks. By tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWA), PropiChain enables fractional ownership of premium real estate. This approach democratizes access to high-value assets, increases liquidity, and invites participation from global investors, creating a more inclusive market environment. Comparing PropiChain to XRP and Cardano While XRP and Cardano have long been key players in the crypto market, PropiChain is emerging as a strong competitor with a remarkable 55,000% growth potential. XRP’s focus on cross-border payments remains hindered by regulatory issues, including its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. On the other hand, Cardano has faced criticism for its slow progress and limited adoption of smart contract capabilities. In contrast, PropiChain is making rapid advancements and meeting key milestones on its roadmap. With a clear use case, robust adoption, and significant growth potential, PropiChain is surpassing XRP and Cardano in market momentum. PropiChain Presale Gains Momentum Over XRP and Cardano PropiChain’s swift rise above XRP and Cardano reflects the increasing interest in blockchain projects with practical applications. Offering a projected 55,000% growth, PropiChain’s ongoing presale is attracting traders and investors eager for high returns. Analysts predict a $1,000 investment could generate $384,570 by Q1 2025. The first presale raised $1.3 million, while the second round has surpassed the $1 million mark. Token prices are set to increase by over 109% after this phase. PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap has helped boost its visibility and adsorption. Additionally, its smart contracts audit by BlockAudit , a security blockchain firm, highlights its accessibility and security.

But among the flurry, BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight, not just for its innovative blockchain technology but also for its groundbreaking partnership with football giant Inter Milan. This exciting collaboration, coupled with the latest Ethereum (ETH) price action and XRP’s recent licensing victories, is creating a buzz that’s impossible to ignore. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters. BlockDAG and Inter Milan: Blockchain Takes the Field BlockDAG is making a bold statement by joining forces with Inter Milan, one of the most iconic and celebrated football clubs in the world. This isn’t just a sponsorship deal; it’s a strategic partnership that showcases the real-world applications of blockchain technology in the sports industry. Inter Milan, with its massive global following and rich history, is embracing the future by integrating BlockDAG’s blockchain solutions to revolutionize fan engagement and create unique digital experiences. Imagine a world where fans can own a piece of their favorite club through fan tokens, collect and trade digital memorabilia, and access exclusive content and experiences, all powered by the security and transparency of the blockchain. This is what BlockDAG and Inter Milan are bringing to the table. By leveraging blockchain technology, they’re creating a new era of fan interaction, where supporters feel more connected than ever before. The platform’s presale has been nothing short of phenomenal, raising an impressive $186.5 million and selling over 18.2 billion BDAG coins. With the current price of $0.0248 per BDAG, early investors have seen a staggering 2,380% return on investment. This remarkable achievement underscores the strong belief in BlockDAG’s potential to transform not just the sports industry, but various sectors. This partnership between BlockDAG and Inter Milan is more than just a headline-grabber; it’s a blueprint for the future of sports and entertainment. It demonstrates how blockchain can bridge the gap between traditional industries and cutting-edge technology, offering new avenues for fan engagement, revenue generation, and global reach. XRP Scores with New Licenses Meanwhile, XRP is making headlines too. Ripple, the company behind XRP, just got the green light to operate in New York and Texas. This is a big deal because these are two of the toughest places to get approval in the US. Now, XRP can be used for cross-border payments and other digital asset solutions in these major markets. This news has definitely boosted confidence in XRP. It’s currently trading at $3.15, and many believe this is just the beginning of a bigger climb. As Ripple continues to expand in the US, XRP is becoming a top contender in the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action: Still Going Strong Ethereum (ETH) is also holding its own. Despite some recent ups and downs, it’s currently sitting at $3,191.58, showing a 3.89% increase. This rebound is likely due to renewed excitement about Ethereum’s plans to become faster and more secure. Of course, Ethereum (ETH) price action is always influenced by what’s happening in the wider crypto world. With competitors like Solana gaining ground, Ethereum needs to keep innovating to stay ahead. But with its strong foundation in DeFi, NFTs, and other cool applications, Ethereum (ETH) price action remains a hot topic. Wrapping It Up To sum it up, the crypto world is constantly evolving, with projects like XRP and Ethereum showcasing resilience and adaptation in the face of new challenges and opportunities. XRP’s recent licensing victories pave the way for broader adoption and solidify its position as a key player in the cross-border payments arena. Meanwhile, Ethereum, despite facing competition, continues to demonstrate its strength. However, it’s BlockDAG that’s truly capturing the imagination right now. Its innovative partnership with Inter Milan transcends the typical boundaries of the crypto world, demonstrating the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the sports and entertainment industries. This collaboration not only opens up new avenues for fan engagement and revenue generation but also sets a precedent for other sectors looking to leverage blockchain for enhanced transparency, security, and user experiences.

The altcoin has surged 38% in just 30 days, reaching a seven-year high of $3.39. Solana, on the other hand, has taken a 12% hit in just 24 hours, now sitting at $227.62, but that hasn’t erased the 22% Solana price surge. While both XRP and SOL have reported gains, Web3Bay (3BAY) has unlocked a massive ROI potential for early investors. Those who got in during stage 1 of this web3 cryptocurrency’s presale have already secured a 6,430% ROI potential, while those in Stage 4 are still set for 4,200% returns by launch. XRP News: 38% Surge Sets the Stage for $4.79 XRP has started 2025 with a rally that few saw coming, climbing 38% in just 30 days and reaching a seven-year high of $3.39. CoinCodex predicts XRP could hit $4.79, offering a potential 50% ROI in the short term. Adding to this optimistic XRP news, the altcoin’s upcoming Community Day (Jan 28-29, 2025) is expected to bring major announcements, with Ripple President Monica Long unveiling plans for institutional adoption and expansion in Asia-Pacific. Combine this XRP news with talk of a potential ETF, and the stage is set for a year unlike any other for XRP. Q1 Solana (SOL) Price Surge: Is $400 Possible? Solana has dropped 12% in just 24 hours and is currently sitting at $227.62, well below its all-time high of $294.33 earlier this month. But even with the dip, SOL is still up 22% for the month. Analysts at CoinCodex predict a February high of $290, though some in the community are still holding out hope for a Q1 rally to $400. Beyond short-term price swings, Solana’s long-term outlook remains strong. With discussions around blockchain adoption in U.S. government spending, some believe Solana could play a major role, fueling speculation of a much higher Solana price surge in the years ahead. Missed Web3Bay’s 6,430% ROI? 4,200% Still On the Table! Just like Solana’s price surge and the latest XRP news point to a strong Q1 surge, Web3Bay’s presale is following a similar pattern—only on a much bigger scale. Right now, 3BAY is priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, set to hit $0.1959 at launch. Those who got in during Batch 1 have already locked in a 6,430% ROI potential, but even Stage 4 investors are still looking at a 4,200% return by launch. Underlining the potential the presale has raised more than $980,000 in a very short period of time. See the pattern? With every new presale stage, the price climbs, and with every climb, the ROI potential shrinks. Someone buying this web3 cryptocurrency at Stage 4 will see far higher returns than someone who waits for Stage 10—and by then, the biggest slice of the pie will be gone. This up-and-coming e-commerce giant is setting up a completely decentralized shopping experience where users—not corporations—call the shots. Transactions happen peer-to-peer, cutting out middlemen, unnecessary fees, and banking restrictions. Buyers and sellers have complete flexibility, choosing from crypto, PayPal, and traditional finance channels, making the platform accessible to everyone—not just blockchain insiders. Finally, instead of a centralized entity hoarding profits, Web3Bay redistributes value to those who keep the marketplace thriving, building a self-sustaining economy where users benefit directly. Considering Web3Bay’s mission to decentralize online shopping and the sheer success of its ongoing presale, investors aren’t wasting any time securing 3BAY tokens before the ongoing stage 4 sells out. Which Is the Best Web3 Cryptocurrency Today? According to XRP news, Ripple’s upcoming Community Day is set to bring major updates, potentially pushing the altcoin’s price to $4.79 soon. Solana’s path looks less certain—CoinCodex projects $290 by February, with some still eyeing $400 in Q1. But after a 12% drop in 24 hours, short-term sentiment isn’t exactly reassuring. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is reinventing e-commerce entirely, cutting out middlemen, slashing fees, and putting buyers and sellers in control. With over $960,000 raised, the presale Stage 4 of this web3 cryptocurrency is almost gone. Those who missed Stage 1’s 6,430% ROI potential still have a shot at 4,200% gains, but only if they move before Stage 4 disappears.

Key Market Signals Point to a Possible Rebound,https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/is-toncoin-set-for-a-comeback-key-market-signals-point-to-a-possible-rebound/,"While the broader cryptocurrency market appears to be gradually recovering, Toncoin (TON) has yet to join the upward trend. Over the past week, TON has faced significant challenges, seeing its price dip by 5.4%. Amid this price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst has highlighted signs of a potential reversal, especially as recent data sheds light on underlying market dynamics that could impact the coin’s near-term trajectory. Related Reading: Is Toncoin Price Gearing For A Rebound At $5? This On-Chain Metric Suggests So Toncoin Open Interest and Potential Reversal Signals The CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson has provided an intriguing perspective. In a recent post titled “TON: Signs of a Reversal?” Wedson highlighted a pattern within the open interest data that could hint at a price rebound. This analysis comes at a critical time, with market participants seeking any indicators that TON might stabilize and regain lost ground. Wedson’s analysis centers around the weekly variation in Toncoin’s open interest—a measure of the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts on the asset. According to the data, the open interest delta has shown a consistent increase whenever TON experiences volatility spikes. Historically, these patterns have been observed ahead of significant price surges, raising the possibility that a similar recovery could be on the horizon. TON: Signs of a Reversal? “We’ve observed a pattern where the Open Interest Delta increases with each volatility spike—a behavior that previously preceded a sharp price surge.” – By @joao_wedson Full analysis 👇https://t.co/FC8q4QYIp6 pic.twitter.com/5luN5VojDn — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 29, 2025 TON Market Performance In recent weeks, TON’s price action has been noticeably less bullish. Even as the broader cryptocurrency market experiences gradual gains, TON has struggled to recover, consistently declining and now down roughly 11% over the past two weeks. This divergence from the broader market’s upward momentum may suggest that TON is facing its own bearish pressures, whether driven by chart patterns or on-chain factors.

However, with the nature of memecoins, the market is showing signs of instability. As enthusiasm for Solana memecoins begins to fade, savvy investors are shifting their focus to more promising and sustainable opportunities. Among these, RCO Finance (RCOF) stands out as a rising star, positioning itself as the top crypto investment for the first quarter of 2025. The Bubble of Solana Memecoins: Losing Their Shine Memecoins have long been a favorite in the crypto world, enticing traders with dreams of quick and substantial profits. However, the bubble around these tokens, particularly Solana memecoins , is beginning to deflate. When placed side-by-side with utility-driven projects like RCO Finance (RCOF), the inherent weaknesses tokens become apparent. Solana memecoins have thrived on the sheer force of short-term speculative trading, which has fueled rapid price hikes. Yet, this same reliance on speculation has proven to be a double-edged sword. The lack of real-world applications or intrinsic utility has rendered these tokens highly volatile and increasingly unattractive to serious investors. For many, the allure of these memecoins is fading as their unpredictability and lack of foundational value deter long-term commitment. To make matters worse, Solana memecoins are facing intense competition as newer altcoins enter the market with fresh innovations and practical applications. This influx of projects, like AI altcoins, with tangible value has saturated the market, leaving the Solana memecoins scrambling to retain relevance. Why RCO Finance (RCOF) Is the Safer Bet for Long-Term Gains Amidst the instability brought about by the Solana memecoins, RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a compelling alternative. Positioned at artificial intelligence and decentralized finance (DeFi) intersection, RCO Finance offers AI tools to improve investment strategies. One of the standout features of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, which acts as a personal investment strategist for users. This sophisticated tool analyzes vast amounts of market data in real-time, offering personalized recommendations that align with individual investment goals and risk profiles. Unlike traditional advisors, which may charge hefty fees and require extensive market knowledge, the robo advisor democratizes investing by making it accessible to everyone, from seasoned traders to complete novices. This tool ensures that no trader is left behind due to market fluctuations and instabilities. RCO Finance also excels in providing diverse market access. Investors can explore over 120,000 assets across various classes, including stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate. This extensive range allows users to build robust portfolios to mitigate risk while maximizing returns. Moreover, RCOF introduces a unique opportunity for passive income generation through staking and rewards programs. Users can stake their tokens to earn substantial returns while supporting the platform’s liquidity. This feature not only incentivizes long-term holding but also cultivates a loyal community of investors. RCOF recently unveiled the beta version of its highly anticipated platform, igniting excitement among investors and traders alike. The platform’s innovative features have attracted over 10,000 users, showcasing its potential to disrupt the DeFi space. Building on this momentum, the upcoming alpha launch promises to deliver even more advanced capabilities, which are currently undergoing rigorous testing to ensure a seamless user experience. Security is another cornerstone of RCO Finance’s appeal. The platform undergoes regular audits by SolidProof , ensuring that investor funds are protected against potential threats. This commitment to transparency and security fosters trust among users, further solidifying RCOF’s position as a reliable investment option. Is RCO Finance Worth Investing? The current RCO Finance (RCOF) presale presents an exceptional opportunity for investors eager to get in on the ground floor of this promising project. The presale has already raised over $12.2 million and is on track to reach its target of $13 million by month’s end. Each RCOF token is priced at just $0.10, with projections estimating a potential surge to $0.60 upon listing, a remarkable 700% ROI. Beyond this, analysts predict post-listing growth to exceed $5 per token, equating to over 6,500% ROI, surpassing a significant portion of Solana memecoins in potential returns. Investors participating in the presale secure a stake in an innovative platform and gain access to AI analytics, private syndicate ETF funds, priority customer support, and governance rights. These features underline RCOF’s commitment to enhancing the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. While Solana memecoins have often delivered short-term gains fueled by speculative trading, RCO Finance goes beyond that. It aims to provide investors with both high returns and cutting-edge tools designed to revolutionize the DeFi sector, offering long-term growth and value. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this transformative journey, invest in RCO Finance today, and get access to long-term gains!

39717605,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=665746,1738288920,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39717605.jpeg,Uniswap Protocol on Base posts third consecutive monthly volume ATH in January 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uniswap-on-base-monthly-volume-ath-january/,"Uniswap Protocol recorded a monthly high trading volume of $15.65 billion on the Base network in January 2025. This makes it the third consecutive time Uniswap’s monthly trading volume on the Base network hit an all-time high. It also recorded all-time highs in November and December 2024. Overall, Uniswap has processed over $1 trillion in total trading volume, which makes it one of the largest DEXs in the world. What Uniswap users are doing on Base The monthly transaction volume on the Uniswap DEX on Coinbase’s native network, Base hit an all-time high for the third month in a row. According to data on the Uniswap interface on Base, memecoins, AI agents, and cbBTC are the hottest assets. Memes are one of the top-performing assets this cycle, and while Solana remains the home for risk-tolerant traders, Base also posts steady numbers in those regards. It also benefits from the intersection between the AI agent and memecoin narratives. For example, one of the top-performing tokens for the month, Virtual Protocol’s VIRTUAL, which is currently trading at $2.05, posted a monthly volume of $6.6 billion and an all-time volume of $12.2 billion. VIRTUAL is sandwiched between Ethereum and USDC, two tokens that enable DeFi activity on Base. USDC is currently enjoying a monopoly of volume on the network because Coinbase delisted USDT in Europe to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Its trading volume for the month came in at $5.5 billion, with an FDC of $53.1 billion. Tether’s USDT had a notably bad January, with less than $59 million in trading volume for the entire month. Aside from memes and AI agent tokens, users on Uniswap have also been heavily involved with Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC). Coinbase built cbBTC to be compatible with DeFi applications to allow customers to participate and unlock the financial utility in dApps. cbBTC holds $2.4 billion in FDV with a volume of $695.95 million Another AI token to feature high on the list is aixbt by Virtuals (AIXBT) with a $603 million trading volume month. Uniswap’s activity contributed to a strong month for Base Uniswap’s increased trading volume in the past couple of months has contributed to Base’s growth and the network’s recent liveliness. The chain carries over 500 decentralized apps, and activity on the tokenless chain expanded to over 2M daily active users this January. Base may have started out as a chain for fun NFT and meme experiments, but it has clearly matured and is now moving forward with DeFi, evidenced by the strong performance of cbBTC. Aerodrome, Morpho Blue, and Uniswap are some of the top apps on Base. Morpho grew after it was promoted as a source for crypto-backed loans. The app allows Coinbase users to borrow against Bitcoin (BTC) collateral. Another factor boosting Base was its integration into Phantom Wallet, which was instrumental to onboarding more new users in the last quarter of 2024. Base carries about $3.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), and the network posted close to $20 billion in volume for the entire month. Still, it remains a fair distance behind Solana, another network that posted record-breaking numbers throughout January. Uniswap first appeared on the scene in November 2018 and quickly gained traction in the decentralized finance space. It was a beneficiary of the bull run that came later in 2021. By that time, Uniswap had processed over 50 million transactions. In 2022, the platform remained steady despite bear market conditions. In 2023, Uniswap processed less than 180 million transactions, but it set a new record by processing over 300 million transactions in 2024.

At the Plan B conference in San Salvador, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced that the integration of USDT into Bitcoin and Lightning is designed to provide “practical solutions for remittances, payments, and other financial applications that require both speed and reliability.” USDT integration on Bitcoin marks a new era for stablecoins USDT, the company’s dollar-backed stablecoin, will soon be fully operational across both Bitcoin’s base layer and the Lightning Network, a scaling network for Bitcoin, as Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced Thursday at a Bitcoin conference in El Salvador. For Tether and Bitcoin, two powerful cryptocurrency players who had not yet united, the unification represents a critical turning point. With a market valuation of about $140 billion, USDT is by far the most popular stablecoin in the world. It is used by hundreds of millions of people globally as a safe way to connect traditional banking with the cryptocurrency economy. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is by far the world’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency. However, the Bitcoin network has been slow to attract on-chain users, as it was not initially designed to support decentralized applications. Scaling networks like the Lightning Network have filled this gap, making layer-2 transactions on Bitcoin fast and affordable and enabling the integration of assets like USDT into the Bitcoin ecosystem. “Today marks a new era for stablecoins,” said Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, the leading developer of infrastructure on the Lightning Network, in a statement on Thursday. Lightning Labs developed the protocol that enables USDT to integrate with the Bitcoin network. According to Stark, millions of people will now be able to send dollars globally using the most open, secure blockchain. Tether faces increased scrutiny amid growing role in global finance USDT is available on 17 other blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Solana. As cryptocurrency continues integrating with mainstream finance, stablecoins have become more essential than ever in linking both sectors. Tether remains the most widely used stablecoin, providing users an easy way to store crypto funds in a stable asset pegged to the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins, especially Tether, have become increasingly scrutinized as their influence on the global economy grows. On Wednesday, lawmakers questioned Howard Lutnick, President Donald Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary, about his close ties to Tether, a payment method used by retail users and criminal organizations. Lutnick’s Wall Street firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, currently holds billions of dollars in collateral assets for Tether, which theoretically ensures the stablecoin maintains its dollar peg. However, no independent agency has yet verified whether Cantor and Tether are accurately reporting the size of that collateral reserve. During the hearing, Lutnick acknowledged the need for the United States to implement a comprehensive auditing process for stablecoin issuers like Tether, given the growing importance of maintaining the stability of such assets.

Some coins have skyrocketed, while others have taken a backseat. Litecoin, once a promising contender, has seen its potential fade as newer, more innovative projects take the spotlight. If you’re an investor who missed the Litecoin train, you’re probably wondering what’s next—something with that same potential for growth but even more upside. That’s where Qubetics comes into play. Qubetics, a game-changing project that’s still in its presale stage, promises to revolutionize the crypto world in ways Litecoin never could. Its unique approach to real-world asset tokenization and decentralized VPN services has analysts buzzing about its future, predicting massive returns for early investors. While Litecoin has had its moment, the opportunity to get in on Qubetics is still very much alive. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy right now , especially if you missed out on Litecoin. Litecoin: A Missed Opportunity? When it comes to popular crypto coins to buy, Litecoin has been a household name for years. It’s often dubbed “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” and for a good reason. Litecoin has a solid track record of transaction speed, security, and stability. Many saw it as a top alternative to Bitcoin, mainly due to its lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times. However, despite its longevity in the crypto world, Litecoin’s price has remained relatively flat compared to the explosive growth of newer coins. Sure, Litecoin has had its moments of growth, but if you look at its performance over the past few years, it doesn’t have the same hype or wild potential that other coins have been delivering. Analysts are predicting modest gains, with some suggesting that Litecoin could hit around $500 in the future. But let’s be honest—if you’re looking for a big bang, Litecoin isn’t the investment that’s going to make you a crypto millionaire. If you missed Litecoin’s early days, you’re probably wondering where to put your money now. The good news? There’s still time to jump into a top crypto asset with huge growth potential: Qubetics. Qubetics: The Popular Crypto Coin To Buy Now Now, let’s talk about why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy today , especially for those who missed out on Litecoin. Qubetics is currently in its 19th presale stage and has already raised over $11.4 million, with 452 million tokens sold to more than 17,400 holders. Analysts are predicting massive returns for early investors—some even forecast Qubetics’ $TICS token price could skyrocket to $15 after the mainnet launch, giving early investors a 24,630% ROI. What makes Qubetics stand out in a sea of other projects is its innovative use of decentralized privacy solutions and real-world asset tokenization. The Qubetics team is building a platform that can tokenize tangible assets like real estate, luxury goods, and more. This is a game-changer for industries that have been stuck using outdated, inefficient systems. Not to mention, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN is going to give people unprecedented security and freedom in the digital age. The beauty of Qubetics is that it’s not just another coin—it’s solving real-world problems. Imagine a small business looking to raise capital through tokenized assets, or an investor trying to gain access to previously inaccessible markets. Qubetics is providing a solution that could level the playing field and bring the power of blockchain technology to the masses. Real-World Applications: How Qubetics is Changing the Game So, what does Qubetics actually do, and how does it impact real life? Let’s break it down. One of the most exciting features of Qubetics is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This isn’t just a concept—it’s happening now. Qubetics allows businesses, professionals, and individuals to tokenize real-world assets and make them accessible to a global pool of investors. For example, let’s say you’re a small business owner who owns a luxury car dealership. With Qubetics , you can tokenize a portion of your business—turning that equity into a digital asset—and sell it to investors from around the world. This opens up new funding opportunities and allows you to raise capital quickly without the usual bureaucratic red tape. Another scenario: imagine being a property investor who has always wanted to own shares of high-end real estate but has never had the means to do so. With Qubetics, you could purchase tokenized shares of luxury properties and earn returns without the huge upfront costs. And it’s not just businesses that benefit—individuals are going to be able to tokenize their assets, whether that’s through luxury goods or intellectual property, and access a new stream of income. The possibilities are endless. Conclusion: If you missed out on Litecoin, don’t sweat it—you still have an incredible opportunity with Qubetics. With its game-changing technology and massive potential for growth, Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy now for anyone looking to make a big impact on their portfolio. The presale is in its final stages, so now’s the time to hop in before prices explode. The future of crypto is here, and it’s Qubetics—get in while you can. Call to Action: Don’t wait around—head over to Qubetics’ official site and grab your $TICS tokens today. Time is ticking, and the opportunity to secure massive returns is slipping away fast. Make your move now, and don’t miss out on the next big thing in crypto.

The space is rapidly growing, and new projects are constantly emerging with big promises. If you’re looking for a meme coin with real potential, then Arctic Pablo (APC) is one to watch. With exciting features and a presale that’s already making waves, this could be your chance to get in early. In this article, we’ll also take a look at Moo Deng and Trump Meme Coin, two other notable crypto projects, but Arctic Pablo is included in the Best Meme Coins to Join for Long Term due to its promising presale and strategic tokenomics. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins, including Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Trump Meme Coin. Token Burns: The Deflationary Strategy Behind Arctic Pablo’s Growth Arctic Pablo (APC) is taking the world by storm with its innovative token burn mechanism. This feature, integral to the project’s strategy, ensures that unsold tokens are permanently eliminated weekly throughout the presale. The burn doesn’t stop there; after the presale, any remaining tokens will also be burned, creating a deflationary environment that boosts scarcity and value. This approach is designed to enhance the long-term potential of the project and increase the value of the remaining tokens over time. Transactions related to token burns are tracked and recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust in the process. This scarcity-driven model ensures that Arctic Pablo remains one of the most exciting meme coin projects, with the potential for significant returns. As more tokens are burned, the remaining supply becomes even more valuable—perfect for early investors looking for a long-term hold. Why You Shouldn’t Miss Out on Arctic Pablo’s Presale Arctic Pablo has reached the Glacier Grove phase of its presale, and it’s generating a lot of buzz. The current price is just $0.000043 per token, offering early investors a chance to secure their position at an incredibly low entry price. As Arctic Pablo continues its journey through various stages, the price will rise, making it harder to get in at these early levels. With over $700,000 raised and the presale moving forward, investors are already looking at a potential ROI of over 18,546% from the seventh stage, Glacier Grove, to the launch price of $0.008. Arctic Pablo finished exploring the El-Dorado stage in under 3 days and exceeded expectations by completing all six initial locations faster than anticipated. Now, as the price continues to climb, there’s no better time to get in before the next surge. Arctic Pablo has proven its momentum, and with such a strong presale performance, there’s little doubt that this project is one of the best meme coins to join for long term growth. If you’re ready to be part of something big, the Glacier Grove phase offers an exceptional opportunity to buy in at a low price before the final price hike. Moo Deng: The Latest Developments and Market Success Moo Deng (MOODENG) has been gaining significant attention in the meme coin world. Currently priced at $0.10336 per coin, Moo Deng has a market cap of USD 102.32 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of USD 77.44 million. The project continues to make strides, and its growing presence in the market suggests a promising future. Moo Deng’s performance highlights its appeal among investors looking for potential growth and innovation within the meme coin sector. Whether it’s its community or unique features, Moo Deng remains a key player in the crypto space. Trump Meme Coin: Standing Strong Among Top Meme Coins Trump Meme Coin currently has a market cap of over USD 5.5 billion. This impressive figure speaks volumes about the growing popularity and strength of the project. Investors are taking notice, and the coin continues to make waves with its large following and innovative initiatives. The project has shown significant growth since its inception, cementing its place as one of the most recognized meme coins in the market today. If you’re looking for an established meme coin with strong support, Trump Meme Coin remains a solid choice. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Should Be on Your Radar All three of these meme coins—Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Trump Meme Coin—have their unique selling points, but Arctic Pablo stands out among top meme coins for long term growth. With an innovative token burn mechanism, a presale that has already raised over $700,000, and the potential for massive ROI, Arctic Pablo presents an exciting opportunity for early investors. The presale, currently at the Glacier Grove phase, is the perfect entry point, offering one of the best meme coins to join for long-term success. Don’t miss your chance to be part of Arctic Pablo’s rise—get in now while prices are still low!

Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev was speaking at a meeting of the Legislative Assembly of the Irkutsk Region, which was aired on the region’s VK channel . The Governor said he would ask Moscow to extend its wintertime mining ban in the south of the region. However, not everyone in Kobzev’s government appears to be on board with such a ban. Some fear it could drive mining firms out of the region once and for all. Russian Bitcoin Mining Hotspot Government Divided on Ban Call Many industrial players remain in the areas, despite a recent decree ordering them to power down their rigs in the winter months. A notable historical building in Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: Fanzuga [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The ban came into force on January 1. And Kobzev said the policy has already demonstrated results. The Governor said it has already “freed up about 300 MW of energy capacity.” However, he said, electricity shortages remain acute in the Angara region. He called for an end to mining “in energy-deficient regions” until work was completed on new housing and state construction projects had been completed. But Kobzev conceded that not everyone in the Irkutsk government agreed on the move. Before Russia’s Bitcoin mining boom, the area struggled to attract investors. Mining has revitalized the local economy. And with Moscow set to launch crypto mining taxes later this year, forcing miners out of the area could prove a costly decision. Russia appears to have overcome for now a deficit of yuan that led to a spike in short-term borrowing costs after the US threatened to penalize lenders for processing cross-border payments https://t.co/a0DKQ1n9nL — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) January 30, 2025 “We know that the restrictions in the southern part of the region have caused a mixed reaction. We know that there are opponents to further restrictions. However, we are confident that these measures are necessary. They will ensure the sustainable development of the region.” Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev Kobzev added that he was “confident that we will go further together.” He said: “We will obtain a year-round ban on mining in energy-deficient areas of the Irkutsk region until 2031.” The River Angara in Russia. (Source: Octagon [CC BY 3.0]) North Excempt from Ban Crypto miners continue to operate in Northern Irkutsk. And Kobzev appeared keen to let them continue doing so. At the same meeting, he ordered the creation of a “commission to determine to what extent the new federal rules” would “allow for an increase in tax returns from miners’ activities in the north.” This commission, he added, would present its findings “at the federal level,” with talks about tax rates still ongoing in Moscow. The Kremlin expressed its condolences to the families of Russian citizens who lost their lives in the American Airlines plane crash in Washington https://t.co/4iJxBExA3D — Reuters (@Reuters) January 30, 2025 Perfect Package for Miners Irkutsk, in Siberia, offers miners a seemingly perfect package of incentives: Real estate prices and rental fees are low, energy costs are similarly low, and winters are famously long. However, Irkutsk’s fame as a Bitcoin mining destination means that it has also attracted scores of “grey” miners. Many of these, Siberian power firms claim, use illegal connections to the grid to avoid detection from the authorities. The regional ban decree runs until 2031, but – at present – will allow miners to turn their rigs on again in spring this year. Should Irkutsk’s Governor get his way, scores of other regions look ready to vie to become Russia’s newest Bitcoin mining hotspot.

As a result, a Dogecoin millionaire picks a low cap AI altcoin as the best choice for life-changing gain in the 2025 bull market. In this text, we will analyze the Dogecoin millionaire view on this low cap altcoin and know why it is the best choice for 2025 gains. Which Low-Cap Altcoin Is the Dogecoin Millionaire’s Choice and Why This Dogecoin millionaire made a massive profit in 2021 when Dogecoin (DOGE) had an explosive upward trajectory. According to the crypto millionaire, joining a high-potential, low-cap altcoin early is the key to unlocking life-changing gains in the crypto market. Therefore, the Dogecoin millionaire believes PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a decentralized real estate marketplace that aims to reshape the $300 trillion sector, is the best altcoin choice for gains. The project is set to integrate AI, the Metaverse, and blockchain into the real estate industry. PropiChain has been gaining traction in the RWA sector and witnessing early success one instance is the CoinMarketCap listing which increases the visibility of the project. The project is currently in the second round of its token presale and it is going for $0.011 which is the lowest entry price anyone will get because it will be higher in the third round. Also, BlockAudit reviewed the project , and their report shows that the security of users’ assets is a top priority for the platform. This news further indicates the authenticity of the project and the high desire to protect investors from fraudulent activities that might lead to the loss of their assets. Hereunder, we will discuss in detail how the core features of PropiChain platform will revolutionize real estate and what investors stand to benefit. How PropiChain Will Transform Real Estate Investment Landscape PropiChain goes beyond the typical AI altcoin offering a comprehensive solution that is aimed at resolving traditional real estate investment hurdles and tapping into new avenues of opportunity. We will discuss in detail how this project will transform real estate. Fractional Ownership for Better Asset Acquisition Model The conventional real estate market is known for its high entry costs, which serve as a barrier for most people except wealthy investors. Therefore, PropiChain aims to eradicate this barrier by introducing a fractional ownership model for easier asset acquisition. This is a model that will enable users of PropiChain to own shares of valuable properties based on their financial capability. Returns from these properties will be shared proportionally among the shareholders of the assets. This model can be used to own a percentage in any set from any location on the globe with a capital of $100. Aside from democratizing access to the multi-trillion dollar sector, this approach will benefit sellers globally by addressing liquidity issues as it will enable faster sales compared to the traditional market. Empowering Investors with AI-Powered Real Estate Investment PropiChain leverages AI to help investors on the platform with practical insights. With the AI’s capability to analyze vast data, it could help investors pinpoint high potential areas to invest in. The AI will use data on trends, price fluctuations, demand for specific assets and so on to locate undervalued assets and give insights to users. First time real estate investors won’t need to spend extra money to hire brokers because PCHAIN’s AI can serve as a virtual assistant that will guide them on real investment. Also, both existing and new investors can use the AI chatbot as a legal adviser that will help them understand legal terms in real estate contracts before making a commitment. Also, PropiChain AI introduces an advanced method for filtering properties that will enable users to find assets that align with their investment objectives. For instance, users can search for assets with a potential returns filter and choose the one that fits their objective. Real Estate Without Borders With the Help of the Metaverse PropiChain integrated the interactive environment of the Metaverse to enable leasing spaces for digital events, showcasing assets for potential buyers, holding meetings, and remote inspections. With the help of the Metaverse, international investors will be able to participate actively in the real estate market of several continents without traveling. This innovative approach will break down the geographical barrier that is currently in the conventional real estate market. Therefore, owning assets globally will now be easy and at a cheaper cost. Conclusion The Dogecoin millionaire states that PropiChain , being an AI altcoin, is a major factor that will aid its surge. AI-meta is the hottest narrative in the crypto market at the moment, and PCHAIN aims to bring unique AI offerings to RWA via its platform. Experts are convinced it could deliver a staggering 35780% ROI in Q1 of 2025. The current token presale round, which is going for $0.011, is the best price for early investors to join before the anticipated price surge. An investment of $1000 in this round could potentially yield more than $350,000 in Q1 of 2025. Dogecoin was the success story of a lot of early investors in 2021, PropiChain is presenting another opportunity and its utility in the real estate means it can replicate and outperform Dogecoin’s 2021 run. Join now to stay ahead of market trends and optimize returns with PropiChain’s AI-powered platform.

33767162,[object Object],1738292447,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Teases Ascending Triangle On 4-Hour Chart, Here’s What Could Happen If It Forms",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-teases-key-pattern/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) could be on the verge of an explosive price rally , as recent technical analysis reveals that the popular meme coin may be forming a distinctive Ascending Triangle pattern on its 4-hour chart. This bullish continuation pattern, combined with a rebound from an oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) , suggests that a breakout could occur anytime soon. Dogecoin Eyes Breakout As Ascending Triangle Forms An Ascending Triangle is typically seen as a bullish chart pattern, formed by a horizontal resistance line connecting swing highs and a rising trendline connecting lower lows. Interestingly, a crypto analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has identified what appears to be an Ascending Triangle forming on the Dogecoin price chart in the 4-hour timeframe. Analyzing the analyst’s presented chart, Dogecoin’s price action shows a series of higher lows along an ascending trendline while facing resistance at $0.334 on the horizontal level. This Ascending Triangle formation suggests that buyers may be gaining strength, potentially leading to a breakout to the upside if the meme coin breaches the above resistance level. Notably, the lower part of the chart shows that Dogecoin’s RSI indicator recently entered oversold territory, dropping below 30%. The RSI has since rebounded and is gaining significant momentum, with indicators suggesting it may have room to surge towards overbought zone s above 70%. This positive shift in momentum indicates a steady increase in buying pressure, supporting the possibility of a Dogecoin price appreciation to new highs. Based on the chart’s forecast, DOGE’s price could skyrocket toward the range between $0.355 and $0.360 if it successfully breaks above the Ascending Triangle resistance at $0.334. Conversely, a rejection at this resistance level could lead to a retest of the ascending trendline before another breakout attempt. What’s Next For DOGE? Despite reports from CoinMarketCap highlighting a price decline of over 6% in the past week, Dogecoin remains resilient, aiming for new highs above the $0.6 mark. A prominent crypto analyst, identified as ‘Coinvo’, has announced to his over 324,000 followers that a new Dogecoin all-time high is imminent . The analyst shared a detailed chart illustrating the DOGE price action over a multi-year period on a weekly timeframe. He highlighted two primary resistance levels, which suggests that the meme coin could rise to a new ATH soon. The first resistance level , $0.015, was broken in early 2021 during the previous bull run, leading to a parabolic price surge in Dogecoin. The second resistance level, $0.6, represents Dogecoin’s all-time high in 2021, which its current price looks to be approaching again. DOGE is currently trading at $0.33, having experienced a prolonged downtrend and consolidation between 2022 and 2023. Based on historical trends, the meme coin’s price could be nearing its previous peak, as it follows a similar bullish trajectory as the 2021 bull run.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Ascending Triangle Pattern|Coinmarketcap|Coinvo|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|meme coin|Overbought Zones|RSI|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-31 03:00:47

The approval, granted on an “accelerated basis” on Thursday, allows the fund to track both spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) based on their market capitalization. This approval marks a major shift in the regulatory landscape under the Trump administration, as several firms have recently sought to list new crypto products with the SEC. Bitwise’s ETF, launched in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is designed to provide easier access to Bitcoin and Ethereum for mainstream investors. The NYSE Arca filed the necessary paperwork for the ETF in November 2024. “In particular, the Commission finds that the Proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Exchange’s rules be designed to ‘prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and, ‘in general, to protect investors and the public interest,” the agency said. It added, “The Commission finds that the Proposal, as with other ETPs that the commission has approved, is reasonably designed to promote fair disclosure of information that may be necessary to price the Shares appropriately, to prevent trading when a reasonable degree of transparency cannot be assured, to safeguard material non-public information relating to the Trust’s portfolio, and to ensure fair and orderly markets for the Shares.” This approval follows a series of changes in the SEC’s stance on crypto products, including the previous hesitance of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve Bitcoin ETF trading, which only occurred after a court ruling.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 03:06:25

Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF aims to provide investors with exposure to both digital assets, weighted by their respective market capitalizations. The fund’s structure will be similar to existing ETFs that directly hold either Bitcoin or Ether. The SEC has approved the fund’s 19b-4 filing, an essential step in the approval process. However, Bitwise still requires the SEC’s clearance for its S-1 registration application, which is necessary before trading can commence. Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF The “Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF” will offer exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in a single fund, weighted by their relative market capitalizations—83% BTC and 17% ETH as of the filing date. The ETF will determine market capitalisation by multiplying pricing benchmarks by circulating supply, according to the filing. Approval comes less than two weeks after a crypto-friendly acting chair took over the SEC. Commissioner Mark Uyeda took over as acting head of the SEC while the agency awaits Senate confirmation of President Donald Trump’s nominee for the permanent role, Paul Atkins. Bitwise Investment Advisers will manage the fund, with Coinbase providing custody and Bank of New York Mellon serving as the cash custodian, administrator, and transfer agent. Crypto ETFs boom after Trump’s return Bitwise submitted the application for the dual crypto ETF in November, shortly after the US presidential election. The election saw Donald Trump, who has expressed a more favorable stance toward the cryptocurrency industry, return to office. The administration has pledged to introduce supportive regulations to position the US as a leading hub for digital assets. The SEC has received increasing numbers of ETF proposals from investment firms seeking to expand the range of crypto-based financial products. Bloomberg analyst Nathan Dean noted that issuers are “probing the SEC’s boundaries,” with some firms even filing applications for ETFs based on meme coins. Bitwise has proposed an ETF tracking Dogecoin , a cryptocurrency known for its volatile price movements influenced by social media trends. Additionally, the SEC has received applications for ETFs tracking assets like XRP , Solana, and Litecoin, which claim to offer various forms of utility beyond speculation. The launch of US-based Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 was met with strong investor interest. The group of ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin—including one from Bitwise—has accumulated more than $121 billion in total assets. Ether-based ETFs followed later, with more than $11 billion in assets under management so far. The strong demand for these products reflects the growing role of cryptocurrencies in investment portfolios, despite ongoing debates over their classification and long-term value proposition.

Well, right now, the crypto market is buzzing with exciting opportunities, and one presale is turning heads among the top meme coin presales to buy now— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . While Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) and Mog Coin (MOG) are making moves in the meme coin space, BTFD Coin has just pulled a massive power play: burning unsold tokens from Stage 13 and dropping a mind-blowing 100% bonus offer for Stage 14 investors. Yes, you heard that right—double your tokens instantly with the LAUNCH100 code! With its P2E game now fully live, 90% APY staking, and a bullish community, BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a revolution. Considering the presale started at just $0.000004 and will launch at $0.0006, investors are staring at a 550% ROI with the bonus included. Meanwhile, MEW is navigating a volatile market, and MOG is experiencing a pullback after its December pump. Let’s have a look. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That’s Breaking Records Ever seen a presale jump straight to the next stage and burn unsold tokens? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin just did! With Stage 14 now live at $0.00016, every investor can double their BTFD stack using the LAUNCH100 bonus code. Here’s why this meme coin is dominating the market: The BTFD Coin presale is on fire, raising over $5.82 million with 9,900+ Bulls already on board and 68+ billion BTFD tokens sold. Investors are securing BTFD at just $0.00016, with a launch price set at $0.0006, promising a 275% ROI—or a massive 550% with the LAUNCH100 bonus code. Don’t miss out on one of the top meme coin presales to buy now! If you throw down $8,000 in Stage 14, you’re bagging 50 million BTFD tokens. But if you enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code, that doubles to 100 million tokens! At launch, that’s a $60,000+ valuation. This isn’t just a presale—it’s a goldmine for early adopters. The P2E Game That’s Changing the Meme Coin Scene Forget about meme coins with no utility— BTFD Coin’s P2E game is fully live, and users can earn rewards while playing. Since its full launch on January 1, 2025, gamers have been stacking BTFD just by leveling up. Unlike the beta version, which didn’t reward players, the full version pays out actual tokens—meaning playtime equals profit. The game is already buzzing in crypto gaming circles, and with the Bulls Squad leading the charge, this isn’t just another play-to-earn gimmick. It’s the future of interactive crypto investments. 90% APY Staking & Referral Program – Passive Income on Autopilot Why just hold when you can stake your BTFD for a 90% APY return? Since staking went live on December 2, 2024, early investors have been multiplying their holdings passively. Plus, the BTFD Referral Program lets you earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD if your code is used. If your referral spends $500, they get 10% extra BTFD, and you get 10% of their purchase amount. The top 20 referrers each month cash out big. It’s a win-win for Bulls! Claim the 100% Bonus Before it Ends! Ready to double your tokens? Follow these steps : Visit the Presale Site Connect Your Wallet – Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet Enter the LAUNCH100 Code – Hit a pply Buy BTFD – Choose how much to invest Confirm Your Purchase – Watch your tokens double instantly This 100% bonus won’t last forever, so don’t sleep on it! Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) – A Meme Coin with Market Momentum MEW, a Solana-based feline challenger to dog-themed meme coins, is currently trading at $0.00438, with recent price swings between $0.00412 and $0.00446. With a total circulating supply of 88.89 billion tokens, it’s been making noise in the meme coin space. A recent highlight for MEW is its recognition as one of the top meme coins to watch. Plus, it’s collaborating with Locus Animation Studios to co-produce a 3D animated series, expanding its presence beyond crypto into mainstream media. Despite these moves, MEW has seen some market dips, so investors are closely watching whether it rebounds or continues consolidating. Mog Coin (MOG) – Facing a Correction After a Monster Pump MOG had a massive December, shooting up to $0.000004022 and crossing the $1 billion market cap mark after a 30% surge. This was largely driven by its Coinbase listing roadmap announcement on December 3, 2024, which triggered a 20% price boost. However, MOG is currently experiencing a correction, trading at $0.00000114 after dropping 32.4% in a week. Analysts are watching key support at $0.00000170 and resistance at $0.00000200 to see if it rebounds or dips further. With its market volatility, MOG is still a big name in the meme coin world, but the excitement seems to have cooled off for now. Final Thoughts Based on market trends, presale performance, and real utility, BTFD Coin stands out as the top meme coin presale to buy now . While MEW and MOG are making moves, they don’t have the insane 100% bonus offer, a fully launched P2E game, and 90% staking rewards that BTFD is offering right now. With a 550% ROI potential (including the bonus), staking, gaming rewards, and a massive community, this is a no-brainer for crypto investors looking for the next big thing. The LAUNCH100 bonus code won’t last forever, so if you want to double your investment before the presale ends, now’s the time to move. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and secure your spot before it’s too late!

ETH was able to surpass the $3,120 and $3,150 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $3,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,427 wing high to the $3,020 swing low. However, the bears are now active near the $3,270 and $3,280 resistance levels . Ethereum price is now trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The first major resistance is near the $3,330 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,360. A clear move above the $3,360 resistance might send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. An upside break above the $3,450 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,550 resistance zone or even $3,650 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,270 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,220 level. The first major support sits near the $3,200. A clear move below the $3,200 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000.

Given Bitcoin’s resilience, analysts are now predicting a new BTC all-time high (ATH) in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Defies DeepSeek Sell-Off, FOMC Uncertainty Earlier this week, US stocks took a hit after Chinese AI firm DeepSeek unveiled its open-source LLM, raising concerns over the high market valuation of its American counterparts. As a result, the S&P 500 saw a strong sell-off, with NVIDIA leading the losses, dropping 16% in a single day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid NASDAQ Decline, Analyst Calls It ‘Extremely Bullish’ Similarly, in its latest meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left interest rates unchanged, in line with market expectations. While the hawkish stance was expected to deal another blow to crypto markets, BTC remained relatively unscathed after an initial dip. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,839, having essentially recouped all its losses from the DeepSeek-induced market crash. In fact, BTC has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five days, surging 1.53%, compared to the latter’s 1.25% decline. New BTC ATH In February? Seasoned crypto trader Pentoshi commented on BTC’s strength, saying that the digital asset has held up well despite the turmoil. The trader added that they see no reason why BTC shouldn’t hit a new ATH soon. Another Bitcoin enthusiast, Castillo Trading, noted that Bitcoin’s price structure “looks flawless.” They added that both lower- and higher-time frames suggest that BTC will likely go higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Target $145,000 To $249,000 Under Trump Administration: Report In a similar vein, crypto trader and entrepreneur Michael van de Poppe said that the market will likely see a new BTC ATH in the ‘coming weeks,’ potentially hinting at February as the target month. Further, crypto trader Roman shared the following chart, commenting that “Stoch & RSI have plenty of room to break $108,000 resistance and head higher.” They added that bullish divergence on BTC is also playing out nicely. For the uninitiated, both Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) and Relative-Strength Index (RSI) are momentum indicators that help traders identify whether the underlying asset is oversold or overbought in current market conditions. While projections for a new BTC ATH may be focused on the short-term, market cycle peaks are expected to occur in the summer of 2025. For instance, a recent report by Bitfinex forecasts that BTC could surge to $200,000 by mid-2025, amid shallow price pullbacks. Meanwhile DeepSeek predicts that BTC may top out between $500,000 and $600,000 by Q1 2026. At press time, BTC trades at $105,839, up 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

With two lawsuits in motion and fraud allegations flying, is this meme coin casino finally running out of luck? Pump.fun, a platform notorious for launching meme coins on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain, is now facing a second class-action lawsuit just days after the first. The legal battle, led by Burwick Law and Wolf Popper LLP, alleges that the platform is violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered securities disguised as meme tokens. **LAWSUIT ALERT** Burwick Law and @WolfPopperLLP have filed a second federal class action lawsuit on behalf of investors against the PumpdotFun platform. Full complaint available below. — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) January 30, 2025 The latest lawsuit, filed on Jan. 30 in the Southern District of New York, names multiple defendants, including Baton Corporation Ltd (operating as Pump.fun) and key figures Alon Cohen, Dylan Kerler, and Noah Bernhard Hugo Tweedale. According to court filings, plaintiff Diego Aguilar claims he suffered financial losses after purchasing several tokens on the platform, including the Fwog ( FWOG ) token, and the Griffain ( GRIFFAIN ) token. These tokens, aggressively marketed with meme culture and promises of exponential returns, allegedly led to significant losses despite reaching high valuations—such as the FWOG Token, which Pump.fun promoted as having hit a $500 million market cap. This lawsuit follows an earlier case filed on Jan. 16 by Burwick Law on behalf of Kendall Carnahan, targeting the sale of the Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ) Token. **LEGAL ACTION ALERT: PUMPDOTFUN** Burwick Law is pursuing legal action on behalf of investors in pumpdotfun memecoins. If you lost money on any pumpdotfun memecoins, you may be entitled to compensation. Read more below. — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) January 15, 2025 The complaint argues that Pump.fun operates by collaborating with influencers to co-issue and market unregistered securities. The lawsuit also alleges that the platform’s business model represents an evolved form of Ponzi and pump-and-dump schemes, extracting nearly half a billion dollars in fees from investors. Burwick Law’s legal campaign against Pump.fun comes as no surprise. On Jan. 15, Max Burwick, the firm’s founder and partner, openly criticized platforms like Pump.fun, calling them “the ultimate evolution of multi-level marketing scams, preying on human desperation and the digital attention economy.” With impending legal announcements, I want to make my personal position on the exploitation of memecoins widely available. Read it below. Please feel free to share! pic.twitter.com/adndcQNRxH — Max Burwick (@burwick_max) January 15, 2025 That same day, his firm urged investors who lost money to memecoins through rug pulls and misleading promises to come forward, later launching a dedicated website to assist affected clients. Beyond legal troubles, Pump.fun has also faced controversy over its platform features. In November 2024, it introduced a livestream function to boost user engagement. However, reports quickly emerged of users misusing the feature to broadcast disturbing and explicit content, including violent material and graphic footage involving minors and animals. The backlash forced Pump.fun to shut down the feature following widespread condemnation from the crypto community. Despite mounting legal and reputational challenges, Pump.fun continues to generate massive revenue. As of Jan. 31, data from Dune Analytics indicates that the platform’s total earnings are nearing $500 million, with nearly $47 million in revenue collected in the past week alone.",News|Lawsuit|Meme Coin|Solana,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|SOL|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-31 03:33:50

According to Bloomberg, they have met with lawyers and figures connected to Trump’s circle to explore their options. Bankman-Fried, who is also appealing his conviction, argues that his sentence is excessive, especially considering that most FTX customers have managed to recover their funds. This push for clemency follows a trend set by Trump’s previous pardons, including that of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road marketplace. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 for running an online platform Silk Road that facilitated over $200 million in illegal transactions. Trump granted Ulbricht a pardon, citing his libertarian views and the belief that his sentence was excessive. This move has sparked growing support for Ulbricht, particularly within libertarian circles. While Bankman-Fried’s case lacks broad public support, his legal team is pushing for a pardon by leveraging Trump’s history of granting clemency, which has often been based on informal appeals rather than traditional Justice Department channels. Bankman-Fried is not alone in his pursuit; Ryan Salame, another former FTX executive, is also reportedly exploring similar efforts for a pardon. As Trump’s administration has been more open to considering clemency for controversial cases, including Ulbricht’s, the push for a pardon signals a shift in the broader landscape of white-collar criminal justice. However, no formal outreach to the White House regarding Bankman-Fried’s case has been confirmed as of now.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 03:40:21

Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and Kaspa (KAS) have also built strong reputations, while Arbitrum (ARB) has shown potential as an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. However, a new coin, OFFICIALMAGACOIN, is now commanding the attention of savvy investors. OFFICIALMAGACOIN Could Deliver 60,000% Returns OFFICIALMAGACOIN has emerged as a unique player, with a record-breaking presale raising over $1 million in minutes. The token is only available at officialmagacoin.com , adding an element of exclusivity that appeals to both retail and institutional investors. Its potential for 60,000% returns has investors speculating that it could mirror or even surpass Bitcoin’s early growth trajectory. Early-Stage Growth Potential: With its presale success, OFFICIALMAGACOIN offers investors a chance to get in on the ground floor of a coin poised for exponential growth.
