As analysts foresee a 50% drop in the price of Pepe, smart investors are already looking into other methods to protect their investments. Remittix, a token that is becoming more and more popular as the top token for investors in 2025, is a notable option among these choices. Why Pepe Coin May Drop By 50% In February Pepe Coin has enthralled the cryptocurrency community over the past year with its remarkable rallies and meme-inspired beginnings. However, maintaining growth becomes more difficult, as is the case with many speculative investments. It appears that February 2025 will be a crucial month for the coin. Experts are citing a number of reasons for the 50% prediction of the Pepe coin drop One of the main causes is market saturation. Pepe Coin has been very popular, but as new investors become cautious of its speculative nature, its market capitalization is currently facing opposition. Regulatory issues are also quite important. Tighter restrictions are affecting the entire cryptocurrency industry, and coins that appeal to memes are frequently subject to extra scrutiny. Declining utility makes the problem worse. Despite having a devoted following, Pepe Coin's limited application outside of speculative trading may make it less competitive. These difficulties imply that the February Pepe price prediction is in line with a gloomy trend, which will cause investors to look for more secure and encouraging opportunities. Additionally, macroeconomic factors like inflation and interest rate increases may have an effect on investor sentiment. Speculative assets like Pepe Coin are frequently among the first to undergo large sell-offs when the larger financial markets are uncertain. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum The focus shifts to Remittix, a token positioned as the top token for investors in 2025, as Pepe Coin's prospects deteriorate. Remittix is a compelling choice for individuals hedging against the projected 50% decline in Pepe coin since it provides a distinctive combination of usability, security, and growth potential. Remittix is attracting the interest of investors for the following main reasons. Remittix stands out due to its strong use case. Remittix, in contrast to many meme coins, is based on a network intended for international transfers, addressing actual financial difficulties. It is a more solid investment because of its utility, which guarantees steady demand. Another element is a capable development team. Supported by seasoned developers and financial specialists, Remittix has a transparent roadmap and other attributes that reassure investors. Support from the community is also essential. Remittix is supported by a devoted and expanding community, which guarantees active involvement in its ecosystem and promotes long-term growth. Lastly, what distinguishes it is its protective approach during market downturns. Compared to speculative assets, tokens that provide real benefits, like Remittix, typically do better. Because of this, it is a great tool for investors who want to protect themselves from erratic market swings. Remittix's attractiveness is further increased by its capacity to establish strategic alliances with blockchain networks and financial institutions. These partnerships increase its visibility and bolster its reputation as a sound cryptocurrency investment. Remittix's dedication to sustainability and environmentally friendly operations is another important element that contributes to its allure. By implementing energy-efficient blockchain technology, Remittix responds to the increasing need for crypto solutions that are ecologically conscious. These challenges suggest that the Pepe price prediction for February aligns with a bearish trend, prompting investors to seek more stable and promising opportunities. Conclusion Due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, investors must take preemptive steps. The Pepe price prediction of a 50% decline in February 2025 highlights the necessity for substitutes. With its strong functionality and investor-focused philosophy, Remittix stands out as a ray of light for anybody looking to protect their capital. Remittix is poised to revolutionize what it means to make wise investments in the realm of digital assets as the top token for investors in 2025.

With analysts predicting a 50% drop in Pepe's value, savvy investors are exploring alternative strategies to safeguard their portfolios. Remittix is emerging as a popular choice, becoming the leading token for investors in 2025, offering a promising alternative. Reasons for Pepe Coin's Potential 50% Decline in February Over the past year, Pepe Coin has captivated cryptocurrency enthusiasts with its impressive surges and meme-driven origins. However, sustaining such growth becomes challenging, much like with other speculative investments. February 2025 seems to be a pivotal period for the coin, with experts pointing to several factors that could lead to a 50% decline in the Pepe coin value. A key factor is market saturation. Pepe Coin has enjoyed widespread popularity, yet as new investors grow wary of its speculative nature, its market cap is currently encountering resistance. Regulatory challenges also play a significant role. Stricter regulations are impacting the broader crypto sector, and meme-centric coins often face heightened scrutiny. Decreasing utility adds to the issue. Despite a loyal fanbase, Pepe Coin's limited use beyond speculative trading could render it less competitive. These challenges suggest that the February Pepe price prediction aligns with a negative trend, prompting investors to seek more stable and promising alternatives. Additionally, broader economic factors such as rising inflation and interest rates might influence investor behavior. During periods of financial market uncertainty, speculative assets like Pepe Coin are often among the first to experience significant sell-offs. Why Remittix is Attracting Attention As Pepe Coin's outlook dims, the spotlight turns to Remittix, hailed as the top token for investors in 2025. With its unique blend of utility, security, and growth potential, Remittix emerges as an appealing option for those hedging against the anticipated 50% fall in Pepe Coin. Investors are drawn to Remittix for several key reasons. Remittix distinguishes itself with a robust use case. Unlike many meme-based tokens, Remittix is built on a network designed for global remittances, tackling real-world financial issues. This functionality ensures a steady demand, making it a more resilient investment. Another important factor is its strong development team. Backed by experienced developers and financial experts, Remittix offers a clear roadmap and other features that provide investors with confidence. Community support plays a crucial role as well. A dedicated and growing community supports Remittix, ensuring active participation in its ecosystem and fostering sustainable growth. Finally, its resilience during market downturns sets it apart. Tokens offering tangible benefits, such as Remittix, often outperform speculative assets. This makes it a valuable tool for investors seeking protection from volatile market changes. Its ability to form strategic partnerships with blockchain networks and financial institutions further enhances Remittix's appeal. These collaborations boost its visibility and reinforce its status as a reliable cryptocurrency investment. Remittix's commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly practices is another key factor enhancing its attractiveness. By adopting energy-efficient blockchain technology, Remittix addresses the growing demand for environmentally responsible crypto solutions. These conditions suggest that the Pepe price prediction for February corresponds with a bearish trend, driving investors to explore more stable and promising opportunities. Conclusion Given the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, it's crucial for investors to take proactive measures. The Pepe price prediction of a potential 50% drop in February 2025 underscores the need for alternatives. With its practical functionality and investor-centric approach, Remittix emerges as a beacon of hope for those aiming to safeguard their investments. As the leading token for investors in 2025, Remittix is set to redefine smart investment in the digital asset space.

Interestingly, this renewed momentum has seen Dogecoin open interest flipping from a negative threshold into a positive one. As the meme coin’s price gains traction, traders are once again pouring into derivatives markets, pushing the total open interest above $4 billion. Dogecoin Open Interest Surges With Market Revival According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin’s total open interest has climbed back above the $4 billion mark, indicating a resurgence in trading activity. This comes after the Dogecoin price rebounded on the $0.31 multi-year support again and started its move upwards again. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Explodes Ahead Of Donald Trump Inauguration, Traders Bet On $1 Interestingly, data from Coinglass show that the Dogecoin open interest has increased by 3.11% and 2.09% in the past 24 hours and 4 hours, respectively. This shift suggests that traders are once again looking at Dogecoin as a promising asset for leveraged plays, betting on further price movements. The most notable DOGE open interest is on the Gate.io exchange, which has seen an increase of 5.14% in the past 24 hours. This brings its total open interest to $1.64 billion, accounting for 41% of the total rate. Bitget and BingX have also witnessed notable uptrends, with the Dogecoin open interest growing by 6.41% and 6.67%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. Binance, on the other hand, is yet to flip into positive open interest change. The world’s largest crypto exchange is still on a -0.13% open interest rate in the past 24 hours but is also on the verge of a positive rate with a +1.41% increase in the last four hours. Increased Leverage Could Lead To More Price Volatility A rise in open interest means that more traders are opening leveraged positions, which could amplify price swings in either direction. Interestingly, Dogecoin often experiences strong price movements during periods of increase in open interest. This latest increase alone means that there is an increase in market participation in Dogecoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Weekly RSI Approaches The MA Line, Can Price Resume Uptrend To Break $0.74 ATH? If bullish sentiment continues, this market participation may drive the Dogecoin price further upward within the $0.30 to $0.4 range in the short term. However, it also raises the possibility of more liquidations if Dogecoin were to retest support at $0.31 again. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3316, marking a 7% gain since bouncing off its multi-week support at $0.31. The next step for the meme coin is breaking above a recently developed daily candlestick resistance at $0.3316, which could then pave the way for further upside momentum if sustained buying pressure continues.

Despite a 44% year-over-year drop in hacking incidents, the hacks grew ninefold month-over-month, according to the latest report from web3 bug bounty and security services platform Immunefi. Although the situation looks dire, the figure is a huge fall compared to January last year, when hackers stole $133 million. The crypto losses in January came from two major attacks. The most affected platform was a Singapore-based CeFi Phemex exchange, which hackers targeted and escaped with $69.1 million. The second incident was an exploit of the DeFi platform Moby Trade, which lost $2.5 million. Other low-magnitude attacks were Orange Finance, IPC, UniLend Finance, The Idols NFT, Odos, Laura AI, Pika Infinity, and Sorra. There were no fraud-related cases in January. Hackers exploited the Binance chain more than any other network The month of January saw the Binance chain suffering the most. Of all the attacks, Binance accounts for 50% of the losses on the blockchain, with the platform exploited ten times. Ethereum was also vulnerable, accounting for 25% of the total attacks. Arbitrum and Base suffered two attacks each, followed by Optimism with a single attack. On the other hand, centralized finance platforms were the most exploited, losing over $69 million, 93% of the total value lost in January. Decentralized finance appeared more secure, accounting for only 6.5%, with $4.8 million lost over 18 incidents. While releasing the report, Mitchell Amador, founder and CEO of Immunefi, warned that CeFi platforms will be the most targeted platform by crypto bandits. He said. “The largest volume of losses will likely come from CeFi, as hackers target infrastructure, particularly through private key compromises. CeFi doesn’t generally suffer the most successful attacks, but when a breach occurs, it typically leads to catastrophic losses.” Amador pointed out that the worst thing that can happen is for a hacker to get your private keys and then drain your account which is a major flaw of the CEFI. Whereas DeFi bugs are more common, the impact is small because not all the money is lost. CeFi platforms are enhancing security to prevent exploitations CeFi platforms are also vulnerable to phishing attacks and, therefore, require a multi-layer security approach. CeFi must factor in protective security protocols. It should also include security features that enhance key management, ensuring reduced reliance on a single private key. Furthermore, the platform must improve OpSec’s best practices, such as regular employee security training. Amador also advised that the platforms should have bug bounty programs and real-time threat detection tools. These could be crucial in enhancing the security of these protocols and chains. The Immunefi director advises the platforms to adopt these measures because they are already using them. The firm currently issues over $181 million worth of bug bounties for ethical hackers and manages over $190 billion worth of crypto user funds. The firm has involved ethical hackers and researchers, paying them research bounties worth $112 million. The payouts began three years ago and are still critical. So far, the ethical hackers have come out with 3,000 bug bounty reports. The largest was a $10 million award for a vulnerability discovered in Wormhole’s cross-chain protocol. Immunefi claims to operate the largest blockchain security community with more than 45,000 researchers, saving over $25 billion in user funds across protocols like Polygon, Optimism, Chainlink, The Graph, Synthetix, and MakerDAO (Sky) from being stolen.

After a recent 4.94% drop in market value, many players believe Ethereum could dip below $2,000 this year. The challenge comes as large holder entities may be liquidating assets and exploring alternatives and new blockchain projects, like Remittix (RTX), begin to take center stage. Remittix's public presale has already generated significant attention, offering early investors a chance to get involved with this promising project before it hits centralized exchanges.

While it leads in DeFi and NFT space, ETH’s dominance is being challenged by newer projects that offer swift and cost-effective options for crypto-to-fiat deals. Short-term traders should watch for further drops in Ethereum's value. This because on-chain data could confirm that more assets are exiting the Ethereum ecosystem.

Following a recent 4.94% decline in market value, there is speculation amongst investors that Ethereum might fall below $2,000 this year. This situation arises as major holders may be offloading assets and turning their attention to new blockchain initiatives like Remittix (RTX), which are beginning to gain prominence. The public presale of Remittix has already caught significant interest, presenting early investors with a chance to join this exciting venture before it is available on centralized exchanges.

Short-term investors should be cautious of more potential decreases in Ethereum's value. On-chain data might reveal that more assets are leaving the Ethereum network, leading investors to question the long-term supremacy of Ethereum in the DeFi space.

Recent aggregator data, however, shows daily volumes for both coins plummeting by 18%, as whales offload positions and market sentiment sours. Analysts say this DogWifHat & BONK slump signals that meme tokens relying solely on internet jokes can’t sustain interest in the long run. Retail holders appear left with steep losses, prompting a wave of complaints on community forums. Some watchers link the downturn to oversaturation, with meme tokens popping up faster than new investors can support them. As these favorite dog-themed assets fade, many traders look beyond comedic branding. The question is what sort of coin can outperform hype while also tackling serious issues. Why Real World Solutions Are Taking Center Stage Frustrated by the volatility of purely speculative tokens, investors now favor real world solutions that might outlast sudden hype cycles. Instead of dog memes and influencer pushes, they seek altcoins bridging crypto with tangible use cases like cross-border finance or enterprise adoption. This shift isn’t new: Ethereum broke ground by enabling smart contracts, but many subsequent tokens offered minimal utility beyond quick flips. Meme coins soared on novelty but often lacked real partnerships or stable demand. The meme coin crash for DogWifHat and BONK highlights how quickly that excitement can vanish. Faced with losses, holders crave tokens underpinned by genuine functionality. A coin that solves an everyday problem may see consistent growth, unlike memes that rely on viral tweets. Some watchers say the pivot to practical altcoins could define the next bull run, where tokens targeting large markets overshadow comedic clones. Remittix Synergy: A Growing PayFi Contender In the wake of DogWifHat & BONK slump, many turn to Remittix synergy for a more dependable approach. Rather than comedic marketing, Remittix focuses on a $190 trillion global banking sector, aiming to lower cross-border fees and speed transactions. Over $9.5 million in presale funds underscores strong faith in bridging crypto and everyday finance. The team locks liquidity for three years, then renounces the contract post-presale moves that calm fears of developer dumps. Critics note any new coin must still secure user adoption and partnerships. But supporters say cutting remittance costs appeals to freelancers, families sending money home and small businesses. If that vision clicks, analysts whisper about 50x or even 100x potential once it hits major listings. Curious? Check Remittix while presale tokens remain. As meme coins falter, real world solutions may be the ticket to recovering losses and possibly netting life-changing gains. Shifting from Meme Hype to Real Adoption That’s the storyline echoing across trading communities. The DogWifHat & BONK slumpunderlines how fragile these meme assets can be when enthusiasm wanes. Meanwhile, tokens emphasizing real world solutions like Remittix seem more appealing for investors seeking stability and big upside. Of course, no project is bulletproof, especially one fresh from presale. But many burned by meme collapses see Remittix synergy as a strategic hedge, believing the PayFi model could withstand bear cycles better than comedic marketing. If bridging daily finances with crypto intrigues you, swing by Remittix to grab presale tokens before final stages sell out.

However, recent data from aggregators reveals an 18% drop in daily trading volumes for both coins, as large holders sell off their stakes and overall market enthusiasm declines. Analysts suggest this downturn for DogWifHat & BONK indicates that meme tokens that rely solely on internet humor struggle to maintain long-term interest. Many retail investors are facing significant losses, leading to a surge of complaints on community platforms. Some analysts attribute the decline to an oversaturated market, as new meme tokens emerge more rapidly than the influx of new investors. With these once-popular dog-themed coins losing their appeal, traders are beginning to look beyond humorous branding. The key question now is what kind of coin can thrive beyond the hype while addressing real-world challenges. The Rise of Real World Solutions in Crypto Tired of the unpredictability of purely speculative tokens, investors are increasingly drawn to real world solutions that may endure beyond fleeting hype. Instead of focusing on dog memes or influencer endorsements, they're searching for altcoins that connect crypto with real applications in areas like cross-border payments or corporate use. This trend isn't entirely new: Ethereum made waves by introducing smart contracts, but many tokens that followed offered little practical use beyond quick trading opportunities. Meme coins rose to fame due to their novelty but often lacked genuine partnerships or sustained demand. The decline of DogWifHat and BONK underscores how quickly that excitement can dissipate. As holders face losses, there is a growing desire for tokens supported by real functionality. Coins that solve everyday issues have the potential for steady growth, unlike those that rely on viral social media posts. Some experts suggest the shift to practical altcoins could pave the way for the next bull market, where tokens targeting substantial markets overshadow comedic counterparts. Remittix: A Rising Player in PayFi Following the decline of DogWifHat & BONK, many are turning to Remittix synergy as a more reliable option. Instead of relying on humorous marketing, Remittix targets the $190 trillion global banking industry, focusing on reducing cross-border fees and accelerating transactions. The $9.5 million raised in presale funds reflects strong confidence in merging crypto with everyday financial needs. The team plans to lock liquidity for three years and renounce the contract post-presale, addressing concerns about developer sell-offs. Critics point out that any new coin must still achieve user adoption and partnerships. However, advocates argue that reducing remittance costs is appealing to freelancers, families sending money back home, and small businesses. If successful, analysts speculate about possible 50x or even 100x returns once listed on major exchanges. Interested? Check Remittix while presale tokens are available. As meme coins falter, real-world solutions may be the key to recouping losses and potentially achieving life-changing gains. Moving from Meme Hype to Real Adoption This narrative is resonating through trading circles. The DogWifHat & BONK downturn highlights how fragile these meme assets are when enthusiasm dwindles. Meanwhile, tokens that emphasize real world solutions, such as Remittix, are becoming more attractive to investors seeking stability with the potential for significant returns. Of course, no project is without risk, especially one that is freshly out of presale. However, many who have suffered from meme coin collapses view Remittix synergy as a strategic hedge, believing that the PayFi model could better endure market downturns compared to light-hearted marketing strategies.

While some projects fade into obscurity, others continue to disrupt industries and create new wealth opportunities. Whether it’s a bullish run or a temporary dip, the right crypto investments can offer massive returns within a short time frame. Qubetics , Litecoin (LTC), and Celestia (TIA) are three standout contenders in today’s volatile market. Qubetics is redefining asset tokenization with its record-breaking presale, Litecoin remains a gold standard for fast and secure payments, and Celestia is leading the charge in blockchain modularity. These projects aren’t just trends—they’re shaping the next era of blockchain utility and investment potential. Qubetics – The Web3 Aggregator Leading Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is making waves in the crypto space by offering quantum-resistant blockchain security, designed to withstand the future challenges posed by quantum computing. With its cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, Qubetics ensures that digital assets and transactions remain secure for the long term. Qubetics is capturing the attention of crypto investors at lightning speed. This next-gen Web3 aggregator has already raised over $11.4 million in its Qubetics presale , with more than 452 million $TICS tokens sold to over 17,400 holders. Currently in its 19th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0606 per token, and analysts are already predicting jaw-dropping price jumps post-presale. With projections ranging from $0.25 to as high as $15, the potential for life-changing returns is on the table. One of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics is its role in the real-world asset tokenization marketplace. Imagine a real estate investor looking to tokenize a high-value property to offer fractional ownership opportunities to global investors. Qubetics’ blockchain-powered system simplifies the process, making asset ownership accessible, transparent, and liquid. Businesses can tokenize intellectual property, luxury goods, and even rare collectibles. This groundbreaking approach is set to redefine asset ownership, allowing anyone to invest in high-value assets with ease. Litecoin – The OG of Fast and Reliable Transactions Litecoin (LTC) has long been regarded as one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies in the market. Often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin was created to provide faster transaction speeds and lower fees, making it an ideal choice for everyday payments. With its strong security, high liquidity, and an ever-growing adoption rate, Litecoin continues to be a solid alternative investment instrument. The crypto community respects Litecoin for its resilience and continuous upgrades. The network’s recent developments, including the MimbleWimble upgrade, have improved privacy features, making LTC even more appealing for transactions. Whether it’s merchants, retailers, or peer-to-peer payments, Litecoin has positioned itself as one of the most practical cryptocurrencies for real-world use. Currently priced at $127.81 and gaining 11.55% in value recently, Litecoin remains a key asset for short-term traders looking for quick gains and long-term holders banking on its steady growth. It may not have the flashiest branding, but its reliability keeps it in the ranks of top cryptos to hold for short term. Celestia – The Modular Blockchain Disruptor Celestia (TIA) is making serious waves in the crypto world by introducing modular blockchain technology. Instead of being a monolithic network like Ethereum or Solana, Celestia separates execution, consensus, and data availability, creating a more scalable and flexible infrastructure. This unique approach has positioned Celestia as a game-changer in the blockchain space, drawing interest from developers and investors alike. Why does Celestia matter? Scalability has been one of the biggest challenges in blockchain, leading to slow transactions and high fees. By adopting a modular architecture, Celestia allows developers to build highly scalable and customizable blockchains without sacrificing security. This is a huge step forward for decentralized applications, Web3 gaming, and even DeFi protocols looking for more efficient solutions. With Celestia currently priced at $4.06, investors are eyeing its potential to surge as adoption grows. If blockchain modularity takes off the way experts expect, Celestia could be one of the biggest winners in the next few years, making it a strong contender among top cryptos to hold for short term. Final Verdict – Where’s the Smart Money Going? Crypto investing is about catching the right wave at the right time. Qubetics , Litecoin, and Celestia all offer massive potential, but for those looking for top cryptos to hold for short term, Qubetics presents a golden opportunity. With its innovative asset tokenization marketplace, explosive presale growth, and bullish analyst predictions, $TICS could be one of the best-performing tokens of the year.

Immunefi, a Web3 security platform, reported that January saw $73.9 million in losses from 19 attacks. This is a staggering increase of nine times from the previous month. However, in a silver lining, this figure represents a 44.6% drop compared to January 2024, when losses exceeded $133 million. Two Major Crypto Hack Incidents Dominate the Landscape In January, the crypto industry was hit by hacking incidents, with $73.9 million siphoned off by cybercriminals. The most significant blow came from two major attacks. This includes the hack of Phemex, a Singapore-based exchange that lost $69.1 million. The breach of the decentralized finance (DeFi) options platform Moby Trade also resulted in a $2.5 million loss. These two incidents were the primary culprits behind the monthly loss total. Other affected platforms included Orange Finance, IPC, The Idols NFT, UniLend Finance, Odos, Laura Ai, Pika Infinity, and Sorra. These hacks contributed to the remaining DeFi losses; all suffered varying degrees of loss. Interestingly, no fraud cases were reported this month. These attacks show that both centralized and decentralized platforms are constantly at risk . Hackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities across different networks. Targeted Networks: BNB Chain and Ethereum Lead the Way BNB Chain was the most targeted, accounting for 50% of the total on-chain losses. Ethereum followed closely, with 25% of the total losses tied to exploits on its network. Other networks, such as Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, also faced breaches, but these were fewer in number, with just a couple of attacks on each. Immunefi’s Role in Crypto Security While the hacking incidents were alarming, Immunefi, a platform known for its web3 bug bounty and security services, plays a key role in combating these threats. The company has paid over $100 million in bounties to ethical hackers , helping to identify and fix vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Immunefi boasts the largest blockchain security community, with more than 45,000 researchers. Over the past three years, its efforts have saved over $25 billion from potential theft, covering protocols like Polygon, Synthetix, and MakerDAO.

The upgrade, which achieved 91.43% consensus from validators, ensures token issuers have control over assets deposited in liquidity pools under specific conditions. XRP Ledger Activates AMMClawback, Enhancing AMM Pool Compliance In a recent post on the X platform , XRPScan confirmed that the XRP Ledger has successfully implemented the AMMClawback amendment. This update introduces new rules governing liquidity pools, particularly for tokens with regulatory requirements. The amendment enables token issuers to retrieve assets from AMM pools under predefined circumstances. If a token is frozen, users will no longer be able to deposit new assets into the associated liquidity pool. This restriction prevents unauthorized transactions involving frozen tokens. More so, this development comes just days after Ondo Finance confirmed its push for expanding tokenized assets. The OUSG deployment on XRPL will enhance institutional liquidity and regulatory compliance. ONDO and XRP prices surged following the news, reflecting strong market confidence XRP/RLUSD AMM Pool Now Possible With the AMMClawback amendment now active, the creation of an XRP/RLUSD AMM pool is now possible. This development will improve liquidity for both XRP and Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin launched in December 2024. Previously, RLUSD could not participate in AMM pools due to its built-in clawback feature. This limitation has now been removed, allowing RLUSD holders to contribute liquidity and trade seamlessly within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. This upgrade could enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the network. Since Ripple’s stablecoin launch, major exchanges have steadily increased its adoption. RLUSD’s reserve report confirms strong backing, boosting investor confidence. Consequently, its most recent listing on Margex expanded its reach in high-leverage trading. New AMM Pool Rules for Wallets and Token Issuers The amendment introduces stricter deposit rules for liquidity providers. If one of the paired tokens is frozen, wallets cannot deposit single-sided or double-sided assets into an AMM pool. Additionally, unauthorized accounts can deposit only once if the paired asset is allowed. Token issuers must now use the AMMClawback function to retrieve assets from pools instead of the standard clawback transaction. This provides a structured approach to enforcing compliance without disrupting normal trading activity on the XRP Ledger. The amendment received 28 out of 35 votes from validators, surpassing the 80% threshold required for approval. Additionally, the XRP Ledger community expects this change to improve regulatory alignment while expanding opportunities for decentralized liquidity.

With Ethereum updates suggesting that this rising star is poised to outshine other meme and traditional coins by 2025, let's delve deeper into what makes this coin so intriguing.

From personalized health guidance to the extraction of value from health data, the global health management sector is in dire need of a profound innovation and upgrade. Today, we are excited to announce the official launch of the iPulse Protocol, marking the beginning of a new era! The iPulse Protocol not only integrates cutting-edge technologies like AI-powered predictions, DeSci collaboration, and DePIN, but also offers unprecedented ecosystem collaboration opportunities for global research institutions, healthcare providers, device manufacturers, and users.Through the iPulse Protocol, health data will no longer remain isolated or closed. Instead, it will be transformed into intelligent, decentralized, and tradable digital assets. This means that users will not only benefit from precise health predictions and personalized guidance powered by AI and big data analysis, but also ensure the privacy and security of their data through blockchain technology, ultimately enabling data to be tokenized. At the same time, research institutions, healthcare providers, and device manufacturers will find new opportunities for collaboration within the iPulse ecosystem, jointly driving the global health management and technological innovation process. Core Features of the iPulse Protocol: Precise Health Prediction and Personalized GuidanceThe fundamental goal of the iPulse Protocol is to comprehensively and accurately analyze user health data through AI technology and provide each user with personalized health advice. By collecting data from wearable devices, medical equipment, and mobile apps, the iPulse Protocol can continuously monitor the user's health status and predict potential health risks using adaptive AI models and advanced technologies like time-series analysis.For instance, by analyzing users' heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep quality, and other physiological data in real time, combined with their historical health status, the iPulse Protocol can predict potential health problems such as cardiovascular risks and diabetes progression. It then provides targeted lifestyle and dietary recommendations to help users take preventive measures. This approach not only helps users better manage their personal health but also supports the long-term maintenance of a healthy state.Data Tokenization: Transforming Health Data into Tradable Digital AssetsIn traditional health management systems, users' health data typically belongs to medical institutions or enterprises and is not owned by the individual. In contrast, with the iPulse Protocol, users' health data can be anonymized through encryption technology to ensure privacy, while blockchain technology enables the tokenization of data. This allows users to have both usage and revenue rights over their data. For example, users can authorize research institutions, insurance companies, healthcare providers, and other third parties to access their data in exchange for compensation.The iPulse Protocol offers users a new source of income, allowing them to participate in data transactions through smart contracts, all while ensuring privacy and data security. This mechanism will further stimulate global health tech innovation, promoting the efficient circulation and sharing of health data.DeSci Collaboration: A Global Research and Medical Data Sharing PlatformIn traditional health management and medical fields, data is typically closed and regional, making it difficult to achieve effective cross-border and cross-institution collaboration. The iPulse Protocol breaks this limitation by leveraging decentralized data storage and privacy computing technologies, creating a global data-sharing platform that supports cross-border cooperation among research institutions and medical teams.This data-sharing platform not only ensures the security and privacy of the data but also provides strong support for global scientific collaboration in the health field. For example, research institutions can use anonymized data to support drug development, disease treatment innovations, and more, advancing global health science. Moreover, governments and health organizations can analyze disease transmission trends via the platform to promptly respond to emerging health crises.Applications of the iPulse Protocol: Bridging Personal and Global Health Management Applications of the iPulse Protocol Applications of the iPulse Protocol The iPulse Protocol not only provides precise health management services for individual users but also has wide-ranging applications in various fields: Personal Health Management: By continuously monitoring biological and exercise data, the iPulse Protocol provides users with personalized health reports, dietary advice, and exercise plans, even predicting potential disease risks to help users adopt healthier lifestyles. Healthcare and Insurance Support: Medical institutions and insurance companies can utilize the iPulse Protocol to obtain precise health data analysis, optimize treatment plans, and more accurately assess health risks, enabling them to design tailored insurance products. Global Public Health Monitoring: The iPulse Protocol offers a powerful data support platform for global public health monitoring, helping governments and health organizations analyze disease trends, develop prevention strategies, and respond to global health crises. Global Research and Innovation: By creating a global biological database, the iPulse Protocol accelerates cross-border health data sharing. Research institutions can access anonymized health data through iPulse to support disease research, drug development, and treatment innovations. Support for Smart Device Manufacturers: Device manufacturers can integrate the iPulse Protocol to help users achieve more accurate health management, while using the health data provided by the protocol to optimize product designs, thereby enhancing market competitiveness.Looking to the Future: iPulse Protocol Brings a New Revolution to Health ManagementWith the official launch of the iPulse Protocol, we can anticipate unprecedented opportunities for global health management and scientific innovation. Through decentralized technologies, AI-powered predictions, and data tokenization, the iPulse Protocol offers a win-win ecosystem collaboration platform for users, research institutions, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and device manufacturers. Whether it's individual health management or global health data sharing and scientific collaboration, iPulse is driving the digital transformation of the health management industry and injecting new vitality into global public health.In the future, as the iPulse ecosystem continues to evolve, global health management will become more personalized, intelligent, and decentralized. The launch of the iPulse Protocol not only brings users a new health management experience but also provides continuous momentum for the development of global medical, research, and health industries.

However, there’s even more interesting news and that is about the rise of Panshibi (SHIBI), a new crypto project making waves with its engaging presale. Can this emerging meme coin project live up to the expectations? Find the details below! Solana Price Prediction: Can an ETF Take SOL To $500? Solana (SOL) has been a powerhouse in the crypto market, delivering unparalleled transaction speeds and efficiency. Currently, SOL is priced around $231.64 , having declined by 13.10% over the past week. However, its recent bull run to $294.33, which marks a 17.56% increase over the last 30 days, speaks volumes about its potential to hit $300 or higher in the next month. Technical analysis shows the Solana price prediction chart carving higher highs, indicating a significant bull run. The circulating supply of 593.01M SOL tokens against a market cap of $112.76B solidifies its position among top-tier altcoins. While most analysts have not been able to give a target price of Solana or affirm that it will reach $500, the three-month performance of Solana has shown promising figures. Moreover, with the impending launch of a Solana ETF, experts and investors believe such significant gains for Solana can be attainable. Panshibi: More Than Just a Meme Coin While Solana continues to attract attention in the crypto markets, Panshibi stands ready to deliver exciting returns and a vibrant ecosystem that could redefine what it means to invest in a meme coin. The Panshibi project is compelling for many reasons, one of which is the total allocation of its tokens, designed to promote fairness and long-term growth. This strategic approach not only promotes community engagement but also positions Panshibi as a noteworthy contender in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Buying SHIBI tokens isn’t just about making money; it’s about becoming part of a vibrant community. When you purchase these tokens, you join a shared adventure, inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas that symbolize this project. It’s a journey into new possibilities, where everyone can contribute and benefit from each other’s growth. One of the reassuring aspects of Panshibi is that its smart contract has been thoroughly checked for safety. This means investors can feel secure knowing that the project has been vetted and is less likely to have hidden issues. With these safety measures in place, Panshibiis shaping up to be an appealing choice for anyone looking to enter the crypto market. Panshibi's Promises Over 700% Gains for Early Buyers Currently, Panshibi is running a presale that lasts for 60 days, providing a fantastic opportunity for early investors. The presale operates with dynamic pricing which causes $SHIBI prices to climb when buyers acquire more tokens. At the time of writing, Panshibi has successfully sold out Stage 1 of its presale in record time, and is now in Stage 2 priced at $0.003. The price of SHIBI is expected to rise to $0.004 in its next stage. Ultimately, once the 15 stages of its presale is sold out, early investors will have pocketed an eye watering 1,200 ROI! Looking ahead, the Panshibi team has exciting plans for after the presale. In Phase 3, they will introduce new features like staking and exclusive NFTs, giving more value to token holders. Phase 4 will focus on expanding globally and engaging the community, making sure that Panshibi continues to evolve and innovate as it grows. Conclusion Although Solana is a strong player in the crypto world, Panshibi might be the better choice for investors looking for significant returns. Panshibi presents enticing attributes such as decentralized governance, transparent operations, and a potential for rapid expansion, positioning it as a formidable contender.

Solana (SOL) is a significant player in the crypto scene, known for its unmatched transaction speed and efficiency. At present, SOL trades at approximately $231.64 , reflecting a 13.10% drop over the past week. Nevertheless, its recent surge to $294.33, which is a 17.56% uptick over the past 30 days, highlights its potential to reach $300 or more soon. The technical analysis indicates the Solana price forecast chart is showing higher highs, suggesting a strong upward trend. With a circulating supply of 593.01M SOL tokens and a market cap of $112.76B, it firmly holds its place among the leading altcoins. While most experts have not set a definitive target price for Solana or confirmed it will hit $500, its performance over the last three months has been promising. Additionally, the anticipated launch of a Solana ETF has investors and analysts optimistic about the possibility of such gains for Solana. Panshibi: Beyond Just a Meme Coin While Solana continues to capture interest in the crypto markets, Panshibi is poised to offer thrilling returns and a lively ecosystem that might redefine meme coin investments. Several factors make the Panshibi project attractive, particularly its token distribution strategy aimed at ensuring fairness and sustainable growth. This approach not only fosters community involvement but also positions Panshibi as a serious player in the constantly changing crypto world. Acquiring SHIBI tokens isn't merely about profit; it's about joining an enthusiastic community. By purchasing these tokens, you become part of a shared journey, inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas that represent this initiative. It's a leap into new opportunities, where everyone can contribute and benefit from collective growth. A reassuring element of Panshibi is that its smart contract has undergone thorough security checks. This provides investors with peace of mind, knowing the project has been thoroughly vetted and is less prone to hidden vulnerabilities. With these security measures, Panshibi is emerging as an attractive option for those looking to enter the crypto market. Panshibi's Promises of Over 700% Returns for Early Investors At present, Panshibi is conducting a 60-day presale, presenting an excellent opportunity for early investors. The presale features dynamic pricing, meaning that $SHIBI prices increase as more tokens are purchased. As of now, Panshibi has already sold out Stage 1 of its presale in record time, and is now in Stage 2 with a price of $0.003. The price of SHIBI is anticipated to rise to $0.004 in the upcoming stage. Ultimately, once all 15 presale stages are completed, early investors could enjoy a staggering 1,200 ROI! Looking towards the future, the Panshibi team has exciting plans following the presale. In Phase 3, they plan to introduce new features such as staking and exclusive NFTs, adding more value for token holders. Phase 4 will focus on global expansion and community engagement, ensuring that Panshibi continues to grow and innovate. Conclusion While Solana remains a formidable force in the crypto realm, Panshibi could be a more attractive option for investors seeking substantial returns. Panshibi offers appealing features like decentralized governance, transparency, and rapid growth potential, establishing it as a strong contender. With its current price of $0.003 per SHIBI token, Panshibi is well-positioned for a successful market entry.

For those who are just catching on, the presale has already raised over $675,000, with an impressive 18,546% ROI from Stage 7 to the final listing price of $0.008. Each week, as Pablo “travels,” tokens are burned, reducing the total supply and adding an extra layer of scarcity. The more coins are burned, the higher the value of the remaining ones. This deflationary mechanism gives Arctic Pablo the potential to soar as it continues to captivate investors. 66% APY Staking: But it doesn’t stop there. Arctic Pablo also offers an enticing staking program with a massive 66% APY. That means you can stake your coins, watch your rewards accumulate, and be part of a growing adventure. The more you stake, the more you earn. But remember, your staked tokens will be vested for two months from the launch date—patience will pay off! Final Presale Price and Burn Mechanism: The presale is gradually building towards its final price of $0.0008 per token. Unsold tokens are burned each week, which keeps the environment deflationary and further drives up the potential for profits. As we get closer to the launch, every moment is an opportunity to grab a piece of the action before it explodes.

In 2028, SHIB can reach a maximum value of $0.000114. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach a minimum value of $0.000185 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem with significant growth and utility. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about its future price trajectory. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and solidify its position in the crypto market? Will SHIB ever reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Shiba Inu Token SHIB Price $0.00002154 Market Cap $11,010,939,337.5 Trading Volume $280,254,145.75 Circulating Supply 589,254,022,224,998.1 SHIB All-time High $0.00008845 (Oct 27, 2021) All-time Low $0.00000000008165 (Aug 31, 2020) 24-hour high $0.00001820 24-hour low $0.00001896 Shiba Inu coin price prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.31% 50-Day SMA $0.00002263 14-Day RSI 36.91 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.00001914 Shiba Inu price analysis: SHIB remains largely bearish as buyer interest grows TL;DR Breakdown SHIB is currently trading below its 50-day SMA. SHIB’s key support level is at $0.00001728. If SHIB breaks above $0.00001933, it may target higher resistance levels. Shiba Inu 1-day price chart: Minor bullish attempts exist amid a broader bearish trend The 1-day chart for Shiba Inu on January 30 shows the coin trading below the 20-day SMA at $0.00002066, reflecting a bearish trend. The MACD suggests ongoing bearish momentum, confirming that the slight bullish turn is not solid enough. Minor bullish attempts exist amid a broader Shiba Inu bearish trend The RSI at 41 indicates the asset is near the oversold region, hinting at potential consolidation or a mild recovery if buyers return at the bottom. A break above $0.00001933 could signal further upside, while a rejection risks revisiting lower support levels near $0.00001728. Shiba Inu 4-hour price chart: SHIB see short-term price uptick The 4-hour SHIB/USDT chart shows a slight uptick in price. The Bollinger Bands are still narrow, indicating reduced volatility and the possibility of range-bound price movement. The Balance of Power (BOP) at -0.50 signals growing bearish dominance unless a reversal occurs. Also, the CMF is slightly positive, suggesting some buying pressure despite a bearish takeover. Increased buyer interest and accumulation could see SHIB retest the upper Bollinger band at $0.00001925. Otherwise, SHIB could retest support at $0.00001728. Shiba Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00001981 SELL SMA 5 $0.00001940 SELL SMA 10 $0.00002039 SELL SMA 21 $0.00002106 SELL SMA 50 $0.00002263 SELL SMA 100 $0.00002300 SELL SMA 200 $0.00001948 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.00002067 SELL EMA 5 $0.00002106 SELL EMA 10 $0.00002160 SELL EMA 21 $0.00002234 SELL EMA 50 $0.00002318 SELL EMA 100 $0.00002240 SELL EMA 200 $0.00002083 SELL What to expect from Shiba Inu price analysis? SHIB shows slight signs of renewed buyer interest but still faces potential rejection around $0.00001925 – $0.00001933. A breakout above this range is needed to confirm a bullish recovery. If momentum holds, Shiba Inu could move towards $0.00002066 or dip further if it breaks its immediate support level. Is Shiba Inu a good investment? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has made strides with the launch of Shibarium, its Layer-2 blockchain, and a partnership with Chainlink, boosting cross-chain functionality and utility. The upcoming TREAT token – expected to play a significant role in Shiba Inu’s reward system and governance mechanisms – further expands its ecosystem. While promising, SHIB remains highly speculative and subject to market swings, so proceed cautiously as a trader or investor. Will Shiba Inu recover? Shiba Inu is experiencing fluctuations with a recent upward trend; there are signs of potential recovery. Will SHIB reach $1? Reaching $1 for Shiba Inu (SHIB) is highly unlikely due to its massive circulating supply and the unrealistic market cap. Significant demand increases and supply reductions would be necessary to approach such a price. Will SHIB reach $10 It is unlikely that SHIB will reach $10 due to its enormous circulating supply and the unrealistic market capitalization required to achieve this feat. Will SHIB reach $100? Reaching $100 for SHIB is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply and the astronomically high market capitalization it would necessitate. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on continued adoption, broader market adoption trends, and other cryptocurrency market space developments.

39713411,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=665697,1738281307,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39713411.jpeg,MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor graces the cover of Forbes: “The Bitcoin Alchemist”,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-graces-the-cover-of-forbes-the-bitcoin-alchemist/,"Michael Saylor is everywhere, and now he’s on the cover of Forbes in an issue released Jan. 30. The 59-year-old CEO of MicroStrategy was pictured grinning under the bold title, “The Bitcoin Alchemist,” an iconic and very fitting name. Michael came into the market just five years ago and quite literally devoured Bitcoin. Since then, he has accumulated 471,107 BTC worth around $50 billion, turning his company into the ultimate Bitcoin whale and himself into a $9.4 billion man. On New Year’s Eve, Michael hosted 500 elite guests at Villa Vecchia, his 18,000-square-foot mansion in Miami, Florida. Picture this the way Forbes described it in their issue: tangerine suits, golden bodysuits, and hors d’oeuvres stamped with Bitcoin’s iconic “B” logo. Michael Saylor’s Forbes cover Dancers swirled glowing orbs in Bitcoin’s signature orange hue. Outside, the 154-foot Usher yacht rocked against the Miami skyline, ferrying in institutional investors, crypto influencers, and executives. And get this, the main event wasn’t even the new year, it was Bitcoin breaking $100,000 for the first time ever. David Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc. and publisher of Bitcoin Magazine, walked the scene, wearing a cap stamped with “Satoshi Nakamoto.” He was the one who brought Donald Trump to July’s Bitcoin conference, where Trump declared he’d turn America into “the crypto capital of the planet.” But oh no, this night belonged to Michael. The whole party felt less like a party and more like a coronation for the untitled King of Crypto, something he might have to fight El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele for. Though hey listen, this article is about Michael, not Nayib. And Michael strolled through the party in his black blazer, blue jeans, and a T-shirt branded with the Bitcoin logo. Selfie requests and handshakes piled up. Here, Bitcoin was a religion, and Michael was its high priest. The comeback of the century Michael’s relationship with money has always been a bit so-so. Anyway, he built MicroStrategy in 1989 as a data-mining company right out of MIT. By 2000, this genius was worth $13 billion, but the tech bubble popped, and so did his empire. The SEC accused him of accounting fraud, and MicroStrategy’s stock dropped like a rock—from $313 per share to under $1. His $13 billion net worth was gone overnight. “It was the darkest part of my life. When people lose money because they believe in you, that’s pretty much the worst,” he said. For the next twenty years, MicroStrategy limped along with unimpressive sales and a market cap around $1 billion. Then came 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic triggered massive global fiat printing, and Michael said he started seeing the dollar as “trash.” He didn’t see safety in dollars or bonds, but he saw safety in Bitcoin’s 21 million token limit. With $530 million in cash reserves and after months of contemplation, he made the call, said MicroStrategy would go all-in on Bitcoin. Over three years, MicroStrategy scooped up more Bitcoin than anyone else in the world, apart from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. After the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock, Bitcoin’s price doubled, then smashed $100,000 in December after Trump won the election and gave the industry what he promised us. That spike pushed MicroStrategy straight into the Nasdaq 100. The company’s stock surged over 700% last year. Michael’s net worth went from $1.9 billion in 2024 to $9.4 billion in January 2025. Pretty crazy, huh? MicroStrategy is now worth $84 billion, despite having only $48 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Wall Street doesn’t really get it, but Michael does. “We put a crypto reactor in the middle of the company and spin it,” he said. “That volatility fuels everything.” How Michael Saylor weaponized volatility and became Wall Street’s King Now here’s the magic trick: Michael knew Wall Street thrives on volatility, the very thing traditional investors fear. In 2021, he began issuing billions in convertible bonds, offering investors the option to convert debt into shares of MicroStrategy. The implied volatility of MicroStrategy’s options skyrocketed as Bitcoin prices bounced wildly. Traders loved it. “People thought I was crazy,” Michael told Forbes. “How can such a small company have that liquidity? Because we created volatility on purpose.” MicroStrategy has issued six convertible notes since 2021, totaling $7.3 billion, with interest rates between 0% and 2.25%. Investors ate them up. Allianz and State Street grabbed huge chunks. The bonds delivered returns over 250%, making them one of the top-performing debt plays in the market. Even the $3 billion issued last November—with a 0% coupon—gained 89% in just a few months. With its stock price up 2,666% since 2020, MicroStrategy’s market frenzy rivals even Tesla and Amazon. Its shares jumped from 97 million to 246 million through secondary offerings and debt issuance. In January, shareholders approved increasing the authorized shares to 10.3 billion. His strategy is simple: raise debt, buy Bitcoin, drive prices up, issue more shares, and repeat. And just when Wall Street thought he was done, Michael introduced a new financial metric: Bitcoin Yield. It measures the growth of Bitcoin holdings relative to the company’s fully diluted shares. MicroStrategy reported a 74.3% BTC Yield for 2024. Wall Street couldn’t ignore the signal, even if it seemed arbitrary. So now those guys are knocking on Michael’s door, they want in on the action too. Michael’s financial engineering is now a template for others. Bitwise counts 90 public companies—Tesla and Block included—adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. In March 2025, Bitwise will launch a Bitcoin Standard ETF tracking 35 companies holding over 1,000 BTC each. MicroStrategy dominates the list. “Size is everything,” said Jeff Park from Bitwise. “MicroStrategy is the most liquid source for trading Bitcoin-related risks.” What happens if Bitcoin crashes? Here’s the question: What happens if Bitcoin drops like it did in 2018 or 2022? The answer is, according to Michael, MicroStrategy has time. Bitcoin would need to fall over 80% and stay there for two years before this hero would be in trouble. “Actually, there’s very little debt on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet,” said Jeff Park. The debt is unsecured, so there’s no forced liquidation of Bitcoin assets even if things go south. Michael isn’t worried. Trump’s crypto-friendly administration is back, and the US national debt keeps surging. “Cash is trash,” he said to Forbes, sticking to his mantra. Trump’s spending policies will for sure hurt the dollar, which will only strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal. Michael said, “The irony of my career is I invented 20 things, and I tried to make them successful, and I really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared, and now we just carry the torch. That, ironically, has made me more successful than me trying to commercialize every one of my own ideas. It is a lesson in humility.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-30 23:55:07

Ethereum ETFs Struggle & XRP Price Prediction Shows Rally,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-pick-for-2025-web3bay-shines-with-6000-roi-ethereum-etfs-struggle-xrp-price-prediction-shows-rally/,"The digital currency market is seeing high excitement, with investor enthusiasm and high valuations. Often, these periods have been followed by market dips, highlighting the importance of choosing cryptos with strong basics that can maintain value during downturns. XRP’s price forecast shows it nearing an important barrier at $3.30, suggesting possible growth, yet a market drop could still occur. Similarly, the Ethereum ETF managed by Fidelity has seen no new investments, indicating investor wariness amid market uncertainties. Amid these market trends, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as a strong investment choice. Its decentralized e-commerce platform is reinforced by a successful $980,000 presale and an anticipated return of 6,430%. This platform promises substantial long-term potential that transcends current market volatility. At the heart of Web3Bay is a commitment to innovation, presenting a solid opportunity for investors aiming to manage the complexities of the vibrant market with a project that is both innovative and focused on practical utility. Web3Bay (3BAY): A New Force in E-Commerce Web3Bay, known as the potential “Amazon Killer,” is transforming online shopping with its blockchain-based platform. This initiative addresses traditional e-commerce issues like high fees, transparency, and data privacy by empowering users. It provides secure and open dealings with added benefits such as a 5% savings on purchases using the 3BAY token. Its presale was a hit, with $980,000 raised and over 265 million tokens sold. With the current token price at $0.004562 in its third stage, it’s accessible for many. The token’s expected increase to $0.1959 could give early buyers a return of 6,430%. Web3Bay’s strategy includes innovative features like decentralized storage through IPFS, compatibility across blockchain networks like Ethereum and BNB, and plans for second-layer solutions to speed up and reduce transaction costs. Its community-led approach gives users a voice in the platform’s direction. With growing interest in its presale, Web3Bay is setting up to revolutionize e-commerce. This is your chance to get involved before it launches! XRP Price Prediction: Potential for Major Gains or a Pullback? The current analysis of XRP suggests it’s trading at $3.12 and facing a crucial resistance at $3.30. Overcoming this barrier could trigger a significant uptrend, potentially reaching $4.19, $5, or even $6.61. Despite a mixed track record recently and a 4% decrease over the last week, the support levels between $2.52 and $2.94 are robust, providing a solid foundation for those hoping for price appreciation. Conversely, these support levels offer a reliable fallback for purchasers. The recent breakout of XRP from a triangle formation on January 13 indicates potential for continued upward movement, though the current slowing momentum suggests it could soon reach a pivotal juncture. Investors should keep an eye on the $3.30-$3.40 range for signs of a possible ascent. While a surge could bring substantial rewards, there’s also a chance of regression to lower support zones in the near term. Ethereum ETF Faces Challenges with No Recent Inflows The Fidelity-managed Ethereum ETF has experienced no new inflows lately, indicating a stall in investor enthusiasm. This aligns with Ethereum’s price holding steady at $2,850 after a recent 1.2% decrease. The absence of fresh funds highlights investor caution, possibly due to a decline in trading volume and general activity within the Ethereum network. This ETF is now under close watch as investors assess how this trend might impact the broader market. Despite potential risks of market volatility, Ethereum’s established role in decentralized finance and smart contracts might still offer profitable scenarios for those willing to handle the current uncertainties. This market hiatus could serve as a potential opportunity for strategic investors eyeing Ethereum’s long-term growth. Summing Up! In a fluctuating crypto market, XRP, Ethereum, and Web3Bay each offer unique prospects, but Web3Bay stands out with its innovative approach and substantial ROI potential. While XRP might soon exceed $3.30 and Ethereum ETF is not seeing new money, Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce . It’s redefining the space with lower fees, privacy, and user governance, with its presale already achieving significant token sales and offering a 6,430% ROI. For those seeking impactful growth, Web3Bay is poised to lead the next wave of blockchain-based e-commerce, making it a top choice for future-focused investors.

Toncoin Eyes Potential Surge & HBAR Tests Key Support,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-tg-tap-miner-lands-on-okx-wallet-enhances-gamefi-toncoin-eyes-potential-surge-hbar-tests-key-support/,"The lines between gaming and blockchain are blurring, turning once simple in-game items into valuable digital assets. Projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have shown how GameFi can create new financial opportunities for players. But getting started with these games and accessing their full potential can be tricky, limiting their widespread appeal. BlockDAG ‘s TG Tap Miner offers a different path. It uses the familiar Telegram platform to provide a simple play-to-earn experience. Now, with its integration with OKX, accessing and managing in-game rewards and digital assets is easier than ever. Meanwhile, Toncoin’s recent price action and Hedera Hashgraph’s technical outlook remind us of the ever-present volatility in the crypto market. This volatility underscores the importance of GameFi projects like TG Tap Miner that prioritize user-friendliness. OKX Collaboration Accelerates BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner Into Mainstream Gaming BlockDAG’s recent partnership with OKX is a major step in its GameFi journey, highlighting its dedication to bringing gaming and decentralized finance closer together. TG Tap Miner, BlockDAG’s Telegram-based play-to-earn game, has already seen considerable interest. Its integration with OKX’s wallet system sets it up for widespread adoption. This move aligns with the broader rise of GameFi, where projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have shown how in-game items can become valuable, tradable assets. But TG Tap Miner stands out by providing a smooth user experience through Telegram, removing the usual hurdles to entry. BlockDAG’s presale success further demonstrates its momentum, raising over $186.5 million with 17.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently in its 27th batch at $0.0248 per coin, the project has seen an impressive 2,380% return since batch 1. With OKX integrating TG Tap Miner NFTs, BlockDAG is poised for even greater growth as more players gain easy access to in-game rewards and digital assets. Looking forward, BlockDAG could further improve its ecosystem with features like staking, allowing users to earn passive income on their BDAG holdings. NFT lending could let gamers borrow assets for gameplay, creating a more fluid in-game economy. A dedicated NFT marketplace could boost the value and trading of TG Tap Miner collectibles. As BlockDAG continues its rapid expansion, its partnership with OKX signals a new era where gaming and blockchain blend seamlessly, offering exciting opportunities for those who get in early. Is Toncoin’s Set For A Potential Surge? Toncoin (TON) is currently trading near $5.02, approaching a key resistance level at $5.30, with an all-time high of $8.24. The platform’s active development environment is attracting a variety of projects, fostering ecosystem growth. At the same time, recent U.S. political changes may lead to more crypto-friendly regulations, encouraging broader adoption—a significant shift given past regulatory uncertainties. TON’s focus on scalability and efficient transaction processing positions it well for mainstream use. Given these factors, analysts predict a potential rise to $54 in 2025, suggesting substantial returns for early investors. However, the crypto market’s inherent volatility means such forecasts should be approached cautiously. While TON’s technological strengths and favorable regulatory trends make it an appealing investment, thorough personal research and risk assessment are essential before making investment decisions. Hedera Hashgraph Tests Key Support Levels Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) recently tested its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as a critical support level after a slight pullback. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests oversold conditions, hinting at a possible rebound. If the price maintains support at $0.2559, an upward push toward $0.3930 remains likely. However, breaking below this level could accelerate losses. From a technical perspective, the outlook leans bullish, with potential recovery driven by improved market sentiment. Moreover, a break above resistance could fuel further gains, strengthening HBAR’s position. Consequently, traders are watching for confirmation signals to gauge the next move. Meanwhile, the market’s response to external factors, including broader crypto trends, will play a role in determining whether the bullish scenario unfolds. While uncertainty persists, maintaining the above support could reinforce buying momentum. If buyers regain control, the upcoming sessions might witness renewed optimism, positioning Hedera Hashgraph for an extended rally toward key resistance levels. The Bottom Line As blockchain ecosystems grow, accessibility and utility are becoming crucial factors in driving long-term adoption. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner stands out by simplifying the GameFi experience via Telegram, removing the obstacles that typically hinder wider participation. Thanks to its integration with OKX, players can now easily access in-game rewards, enhancing their position within the market. In parallel, Toncoin’s price fluctuations and Hedera Hashgraph’s technical trends highlight the ongoing volatility in the crypto space, affecting investor strategies. Looking ahead, projects like TG Tap Miner that focus on combining user-friendly interfaces with strong financial incentives are well-positioned to thrive, providing a smoother entry into blockchain-based gaming and decentralized finance.

Aptos is a fast-growing layer-1 blockchain network, and the biggest compliment to its reputation could be its “Solana killer” nickname. It claims to be an upgrade on existing blockchain platforms with its solutions to enhance scalability, security and user experience. The Aptos platform supports over 200 decentralized applications ( dApps ), with over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) and a stablecoin market cap of approximately $780 million. USDT holds a 75% share of the stablecoin in circulation on the network. Before the integration, the USDC on the platform was bridged from other networks. Financial institutions can now also interact with USDC liquidity and benefit from Aptos’ network. USDC launch on Aptos Circle announced in November 2024 that it would launch on the Aptos network. Now, two months later, the company announced on its website that its stablecoin is now available on the Aptos mainnet. With the integration, USDC is now accessible to developers and users with no bridging required. USDC is the world’s largest MiCA-compliant dollar stablecoin. The token’s availability on the Aptos layer-1 network could open more growth opportunities for the Circle-issued stablecoin. Aptos has a $4.54 billion market cap, which is a reflection of its success in supporting developers to build apps for various use cases. Apps on the network include DeFi, peer-to-peer payments, cross-border remittances, and much more. Some of the top applications in the Aptos ecosystem include Aries Markets, Thala, KGen, and Cellana Finance. The Aptos network has a bridged form of USDC circulating known as IzUSDC. It is bridged from Ethereum through the AptosBridge. The growth of the bridged version is possible due to bridge providers such as Stargate. The popularity of IzUSDC was a major factor in Circle’s decision to bring native USDC to the Aptos mainnet network. At present, lzUSDC is not issued by Circle and is not compatible nor redeemable with Circle Mint. However, the Aptos team and bridge providers will be working to help facilitate the migration from lzUSDC to native USDC over time. Circle gains ground on Tether Circle, the stablecoin issuer has witnessed a recent boost in the European market due to several factors. High on the list is that it has achieved full compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. MiCA is a regulatory body that requires issuers of stablecoins to meet strict transparency, liquidity, and consumer protection standards. On the other hand, Tether’s USDT did not meet the MiCA standards required to continue operating in Europe. Tether’s market cap dropped from $140 billion to $137 billion following MiCA regulations implementation, which started on December 30, 2024. ` Circle’s collaboration with Aptos is an apparent move to close the gap on Tether’s USDT. Tether announced a similar integration last year, but with USDC on the “Solana killer” layer-1 network, USDT’s 75% dominance could be under threat.

For thousands of traders, that story is Bonk (BONK). Back in 2023, when Solana’s first major dog-themed meme coin launched, most people laughed it off as another flash-in-the-pan gimmick. Big mistake. At launch, Bonk was practically free, trading at microscopic fractions of a cent. But then it exploded. Within months, BONK surged over 4,500%, minting overnight millionaires. Investors who threw in a few hundred bucks early walked away with six-figure gains. And yet, most people ignored it—until it was too late. If you’re reading this, you probably weren’t one of the lucky ones. But here’s the good news: history is repeating itself. Another meme coin with sky-high potential is in its early stages, and this time, you don’t have to miss out. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the top new meme coin to join in February 2025 that’s poised to dominate the market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Meme Coin Revolution You Can’t Ignore Meme coins aren’t just about hype anymore. The best ones are combining viral appeal with real-world utility, and BTFD is leading the charge. Unlike most meme coins that live and die by market sentiment alone, BTFD packs an arsenal of features designed to reward long-term holders and active community members. A Presale That’s Printing Future Millionaires If you’re looking for an early-stage play with a massive upside, BTFD’s presale is the golden ticket. The coin launched at just $0.000004 and is now sitting at $0.00016 in its 14th presale stage, with an expected launch price of $0.0006. That’s an easy 275% ROI waiting to happen just by getting in before the presale ends. Let’s put that into perspective. If you invest $20,000 in BTFD at its current presale price of $0.00016, you’ll snag 125 million BTFD tokens . Once it hits the listing price of $0.0006, your investment balloons to $75,000. Now imagine if BTFD pulls a Bonk-style rally—how high could your gains go? The “Bulls Squad” is Leading the Stampede BTFD isn’t just another faceless meme coin. It has a mascot-driven ecosystem called the Bulls Squad, featuring characters like Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull. These aren’t just cute icons—they represent the movement of traders who are sick of missing dips and are ready to take charge of their financial future. The Bulls Squad embodies the fearless spirit of early adopters. In other words, BTFD rewards those who grab opportunities before the crowd catches on. 90% APY Staking – Your Money Working for You Unlike most meme coins that sit idle in your wallet, BTFD lets you stake and earn a massive 90% APY. Whether you’re looking to stack more tokens passively or double down on your long-term bet, staking ensures that every BTFD holder is earning, even when the market takes a breather. Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game – Earn While You Play Launched on January 1, 2025, the BTFD Play-to-Earn (P2E) game lets users rack up rewards while enjoying the action-packed gaming experience. This isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a full ecosystem where holders can engage, play, and win. BTFD’s explosive growth is just getting started, and with over 9,900 holders already on board, it’s clear this is more than just hype—it’s a movement. Bonk (BONK) – The One That Got Away (For Some) Let’s rewind to late 2023. Bonk (BONK) was just another meme coin floating under the radar, and most people laughed it off as just another dog-themed gimmick. But while the skeptics laughed, early believers were banking serious cash. The Crazy Bonk (BONK) Surge Bonk went from being an airdrop token to a billion-dollar market cap meme coin. It saw massive gains, climbing over 5,000% in a few months. If you had thrown just $500 into Bonk in its early days, you could have easily turned that into $25,000 or more. The market didn’t take Bonk seriously at first, but when major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase listed it, things got wild. Bonk’s price skyrocketed, and suddenly, it wasn’t just a joke—it was the hottest meme coin of the season. Why You Might Have Missed Out Most investors ignored Bonk, thinking it was just another meme coin that wouldn’t last. Others thought they’d have more time to buy in. But by the time the FOMO kicked in, it was already too late—the biggest gains had already been made. And now, history is repeating itself. A fresh meme coin is rising, offering the same kind of early-stage opportunity, but with even more firepower behind it. Why BTFD is Your Second Chance at a Bonk-Style Payday Opportunities like Bonk (BONK) don’t come around often, and when they do, you have two choices: Get in early and reap the rewards, or hesitate and watch from the sidelines as others cash in. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a strategic, community-driven project with a massive ecosystem designed to reward early adopters. If you missed Bonk, this is your moment to make things right. Referral Program – Get Paid for Spreading the Word BTFD isn’t just letting you invest—it’s paying you to bring in new buyers. Its referral system rewards both referrers and new buyers with extra BTFD tokens. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet – Get a unique referral code. Share Your Code – Invite your friends, family, or crypto community. Earn Rewards – Your referrals get 10% extra BTFD , and you receive 10% of every purchase made with your code if you rank in the top 20 referrers. Track Your Earnings – Watch your BTFD stack grow in real-time. Passive income while you invest? Now that’s a game-changer. Final Verdict – Are You Going to Let This One Slip Away Too? Bonk (BONK) was the meme coin that made early believers rich, but most people didn’t take it seriously until it was too late. Now, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is presenting the same kind of massive opportunity—but with even more power, features, and earning potential behind it. The BTFD presale is in its 14th stage, with a price of $0.00016, already raising over $5.82 million. When it lists at $0.0006, early investors will see an easy 275% ROI—and that’s just the beginning. With 90% APY staking, a live Play-to-Earn game, and the unstoppable Bulls Squad movement, BTFD is the Top New Meme Coin to Join in February 2025 . So, will you Buy The Dip this time, or will you be kicking yourself six months from now? The choice is yours.

Ethereum MVRV Momentum Has Witnessed A Bearish Crossover As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has declined under its 160-day moving average (MA) recently. The “MVRV Ratio” refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Ethereum market cap and the realized cap. The realized cap here is a capitalization model that calculates ETH’s total valuation by assuming that the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain. Related Reading: Bitcoin MPI Crossover Could Suggest Bull Run Still On Since the last transaction of any coin is likely to correspond to the last point at which it changed hands, the Realized Cap essentially measures the sum of the cost basis of the circulating supply. This model could also be looked at as a representation of the amount of capital the investors as whole have put into Ethereum. In contrast, the market cap is the value that the holders are carrying right now. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, it means the market cap is greater than the realized cap. Such a trend implies the investors as a whole are sitting on unrealized gains. On the other hand, the metric being under the mark suggests the holders are carrying a lower value than they initially put in, so the average investor could be considered underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV Ratio, as well as its 160-day MA, over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has registered a decline recently as ETH’s price has followed a bearish trajectory. The indicator is still above the 1 mark after this drawdown, suggesting the overall market remains in the green. The metric’s fall, however, has meant that it has slipped under its 160-day MA. The combination of the indicator’s daily value and its 160-day is known as the MVRV Momentum. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted what happened the last time the MVRV Momentum showed a similar pattern as recently.

It would appear that the MVRV Ratio crossing under its 160-day MA led to a 40% price correction for Ethereum last year. It now remains to be seen whether the negative momentum in the indicator would also prove to be bearish for the cryptocurrency this time as well or not. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,200, up more than 2% over the last seven days.

The company admitted it has been unable to sustain operations. It wrote : “This is not the outcome we had hoped for, but we’re incredibly grateful for this community and everyone who believed in the vision and showed up with enthusiasm. Your support meant everything. Thank you for believing in us. ” Teleport shuts down as users have until February 28 to withdraw funds The company’s website currently has a message informing visitors about the wind-down process. The app will provide off-ramping support until Feb. 28 so users can receive their remaining stablecoin balances and private keys. Meanwhile, the firm hopes to post a more detailed analysis of what led to this decision in the future, but for now, we’re focused on an orderly wind-down. Led by early crypto investor and former Dropbox engineer Paul Bohm, Teleport was launched in 2022 when the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) projects began to boom. Just as Helium did, Teleport also aimed to integrate blockchain-based incentives into real-world applications. The company was different from traditional ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft since it employed Solana’s blockchain to establish an open and transparent marketplace. Teleport’s Rideshare Protocol was intended to reduce costs for riders and increase earnings for drivers by excluding the middlemen corporations. Customer acquisition was not traditional but “permissionless marketing,” where users could find drivers and riders and bring them into the network. Teleport utilized a reward system inspired by Bitcoin’s mining rewards, which rewarded early adopters with Compressed NFTs on Solana. DEC’s $9 million seed funding couldn’t save Teleport from industry challenges The Decentralized Engineering Corporation (DEC) that built the app raised $9 million in a seed funding round co-led by Steve Vassallo at Foundation Capital and Thomas Bailey at Road Capital. However, while its innovative model was built on a sound idea, Teleport failed to gain critical mass and financial health. The ride-sharing industry is competitive, with the existing players keeping their stronghold on the users by having a large user base, regulatory power, and financial backup. While the blockchain-based incentives were a way of doing things differently, they were not enough to help Teleport navigate through the operational and market challenges that the project faced.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 314,000 followers on the social media platform X that dogwifhat ( WIF ) might have bottomed out after completing a correction in a three-wave pattern on the weekly time frame. The analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis says that while WIF’s bearish trend lasted longer than he had originally anticipated, there are “some nice signs of life forming” on the memecoin’s low time-frames. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. While cautioning that it’s too early to conclude that a bull run is underway, Bluntz says, “Obviously very early days and we haven’t seen a five-wave rise from the lows “yet” but I think there’s a decent chance one has begun to form.” Source: Bluntz/X WIF is trading at $1.32 at time of writing. Next up is Bitcoin ( BTC ). According to the widely followed analyst, Bitcoin could potentially be forming a “brutal” swing failure pattern (SFP) to the downside on the two-week chart. A swing failure pattern is a tool in technical analysis that is used to determine potential points of a trend reversal. “Bitcoin has five days to not be a brutal two-week SFP.” Source: Bluntz/X Bitcoin is trading at $101,912 at time of writing.

Analysts now suggest a pivot to RCO Finance, an altcoin project that is changing the narrative in the financial sector by leveraging artificial intelligence for streamlined investing. Read on to see why analysts expect RCO Finance to become one of the top altcoin assets 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Slows Down as Memecoin Appeal Wanes Dogecoin is one of the latest tokens to be affected by the fall in demand for meme coins. Despite surging to a 3-year high in December, Dogecoin has stagnated only a few weeks later. Dogecoin trades at $0.3348 after an 11.25% drop in the past week. Analysts predict a continuation of this bearish trend for Dogecoin (DOGE), as demand for meme coins wanes in favor of more stable altcoin assets. As a result, many Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are now seeking opportunities elsewhere, with RCO Finance attracting attention as its presale revenue crosses $12 million. RCO Finance: The Next Genration of Investing Tools for the Finance Sector Traders in the financial sector today have to sift through mountains of market data, which makes finding profitable opportunities difficult. However, RCO Finance (RCOF) presents a novel solution in its Robo Advisor, an AI tool that marries smart automation with broad market access, allowing you to stay focused while doing the heavy lifting in your portfolio. Robo Advisor is a tireless researcher who scans global markets, looking for patterns and risks. It continuously collects high-quality market data from reputable sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, watching for shifts that can bring you profits. Robo Advisor will provide trading strategies tailored to your investing goals, market preference, and risk appetite. Even better, this tool can adjust your portfolio for both short and long-term needs. This is especially useful in volatile markets, where quick decisions are essential to limit losses or maximize returns. For instance, imagine having Robo Advisor at your disposal in Q3 2024, right before XRP’s price surge. This tool would have notified you of its growth early on, allowing you to capitalize on its rise to $3. The best part is that you wouldn’t need to constantly watch the market as the trading bot will be in charge of your portfolio. Robo Advisor also provides access to a diverse range of financial instruments, which include over 120,000 assets across 12,500 categories. Being an RCO Finance investor, you can explore everything from stocks, bonds, futures, and ETFs to cryptocurrencies, commodities, and even real estate. You can leverage this broad access to build a robust portfolio with exposure to distinct asset classes, allowing you to balance risk and return in a way that keeps you profitable. For instance, a crypto investor facing an imminent market crash can leverage RCO Finance’s trading bot to diversify part of their portfolio into Nvidia stock, gaining some stability from tech markets. Beyond the ability to trade across multiple asset classes, RCO Finance also offers extra profit-earning mechanisms. Like other DeFi ecosystems, you can stake RCOF tokens, contributing to liquidity pools. In return, investors will receive up to 86% APY, which is significantly higher than the industry average of 10%-15%. RCO Finance also rewards investors with trading fee discounts for keeping an RCOF balance. The higher your token reserve, the more trading fee discounts you will receive. Another area RCO Finance stands out is offering unmatched privacy and convenience. Many DeFi platforms have stringent KYC policies, which usually infringe on personal privacy. RCO Finance takes a different route, removing KYC policies and offering a non-invasive paperwork process. Additionally, investors enjoy extra security as all transactions are backed by RCO Finance’s smart contract technology, which has been audited by SolidProof, showing investors that RCO Finance is committed to user safety. RCO Finance’s User Signups Crosses 10,000 as Beta Platform Goes Live Over 10,000 investors have joined RCO Finance’s ecosystem, indicating the strong demand for its services. These investors can now understand its ecosystem by exploring the live beta platform. RCO Finance’s team is also working on changes and improvements on Robo Advisor and the trading platform before its full alpha launch. This news has impressed the altcoin sector, showing that RCO Finance is committed to providing tangible solutions to investor problems. Best Crypto Coins for 2025: Why Analysts Pick RCOF Over Dogecoin In the search for the best crypto coins for 2025, investors have picked RCO Finance for its AI-based investing solutions over the meme coin appeal of Dogecoin. Already, over $12 million worth of tokens have been sold in RCO Finance’s ongoing presale. RCOF is now in stage five of its presale, selling at $0.100. By the next stage, its value will grow to $0.130. With a targeted listing price of $0.4-$0.6, RCOF is poised to become one of the fastest-growing tokens in the market. Finally, analysts say it is poised for a 14,000x growth, which could take a $1,000 investment to $250,000 by Q2 2026. Don’t miss out on the chance to elevate your investing strategy.

This decision allows NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of the fund, which will hold both Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside cash reserves. The approval was granted on an accelerated basis, as indicated in the SEC filing released on January 30, 2025. US SEC Approves Bitwise ETF Holding Both Bitcoin and Ethereum According to the recent filing , the SEC approved the Bitwise ETF on an accelerated basis. The approval permits NYSE Arca to list and trade the ETF, which will provide investors with direct exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Bitwise ETF will hold spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, and cash reserves. This structure is designed to offer diversified exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The SEC’s approval follows a series of crypto-related ETF filings submitted by multiple financial firms in recent months. Following the ongoing trend on crypto ETFs, a report highlighted that Grayscale filed for a spot XRP ETF with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The asset manager will convert its existing XRP Trust into an ETF, which would be listed and traded on the exchange. This move comes shortly after Grayscale filed for Litecoin and Solana ETFs, signaling increasing interest in crypto investment products. Pending S-1 Registration Required for Trading Despite the approval of form 19b-4, the Bitwise ETF still requires SEC clearance for its pending S-1 registration. Both steps are necessary before the fund can begin trading on the exchange. The S-1 registration review will determine compliance with regulatory standards, including investor protection measures and transparency requirements. Bitwise Asset Management must await further approval before officially launching the ETF in the market. In the Thursday filing, the US SEC wrote, “In particular, the Commission finds that the Proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Exchange’s rules be designed to ‘prevent manipulative acts and practices’ and, ‘in general, to protect investors and the public interest.” Broader Regulatory Shift in Crypto ETFs The US SEC decision reflects an evolving regulatory stance on cryptocurrency ETFs. Under the current administration, firms have submitted multiple applications to launch similar financial products. Recently, VanEck and ProShares filed for ETFs tracking assets like Litecoin, XRP, and Solana. The approval of the Bitwise ETF follows prior approvals in December 2024 for crypto index ETFs from firms such as Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. It is worth noting that earlier in the week, the asset management firm submitted an S-1 filing with the US SEC for a spot Dogecoin ETF . Bitwise confirmed that the ETF’s Net Asset Value (NAV) will be based on the Dogecoin-Dollar settlement benchmark from CF trading. Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have shown movement following the announcement. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $104,612.69 with a 1.13% increase over the past week, while Ethereum stands at $3,269, gaining 4% in the last 24 hours.

39715922,https://nulltx.com/?p=142095,1738288803,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,What Has Got So Many Toncoin & Polkadot Holders Loving Up 1Fuel & Are Underlying Partnerships Going To Make This 100X,https://nulltx.com/what-has-got-so-many-toncoin-polkadot-holders-loving-up-1fuel-are-underlying-partnerships-going-to-make-this-100x/,"Over the years, Toncoin and Polkadot have dominated the market among the best cryptocurrencies to buy. However, times are changing rapidly, paving the way for utility-driven altcoins like 1Fuel , which is available for the low presale entry of $0.017. Read to discover why analysts eye 1Fuel as the best crypto to invest in from this moment and why it will likely outperform Toncoin and Polkadot in the upcoming bull cycle. Toncoin falters in late January The Toncoin price has stagnated over the past two weeks, causing profound losses for investors. Like many altcoins, Toncoin initially benefited from heightened market euphoria around Trump’s inauguration, soaring to $5.6 earlier this month. Now, in the final week of January, Toncoin exchanges for $4.8, which is a 5% decline in the past week and a 14% decline compared to the past month. Polkadot holders desperate to recoup losses Amid the ongoing crypto sell-offs, the Polkadot price has left investors wanting more. For context, DOT rallied to a high of $7.6 in early January, leading holders to predict massive gains. However, Polkadot could not live up to expectations and is now trading for $6, down over 4% compared to the previous week. With rising trading volume and buying pressure, bullish analysts suggest Polkadot could be due for a consolidation or price increase. However, a descent below its critical $6 support could trigger further Polkadot price drops. Is 1Fuel the best crypto to invest in? The recent Toncoin and Polkadot sell-offs are pushing many investors to 1Fuel. At its core, 1Fuel makes blockchain tech more accessible through its secure cross-chain wallet. Unlike any other cold crypto wallet, using 1Fuel, you do not have to worry about network tokens or excessive gas fees. Just choose the token you want to use, specify the crypto you want to own (no matter the network), then focus on your goals and let 1Fuel take care of the rest. Experts agree that 1Fuel’s ease of use and cross-chain capabilities position it as an important tool for the future of decentralized finance and decentralized applications. Additionally, 1Fuel’s consensus mechanism reduces the ecological footprint of blockchain transactions. This approach adds an extra layer of appeal for investors who value eco-friendly crypto instruments. OFT: Expert predictions OFT is the native token of 1Fuel, which currently offers a golden chance to make unparalleled capital gains. The OFT presale price is $0.017, and it is expected to rise 100x in the coming months. This presale event also offers OFT at the lowest possible price. So, by securing an early entry, investors can position themselves to watch a tiny investment compound when 1Fuel hits exchanges. Conclusion Toncoin and Polkadot are undoubtedly among the best cryptocurrencies thanks to their dedicated communities and loyal investor bases. However, recent sell-offs are pushing their holders to get 1Fuel, which offers a way out of these losses. Thanks to diverse use cases and sustainable infrastructure, experts are convinced it will generate 100x returns as soon as 1Fuel makes its public launch. Want to buy 1Fuel tokens before the next price increase? Join the presale today and stake your claim in the future of secure cross-chain transactions.

By transforming the $600 trillion property market, PCHAIN delivers tangible asset backing, unlike XRP and Cardano, which focus on exchange and smart contracts. Investor confidence has surged, with analysts predicting a 55,000% upside, surpassing Cardano and XRP price movements. As adoption grows, PCHAIN is poised for a significant parabolic rally, bridging real estate and digital assets while reshaping the crypto landscape. This positions it as a leader in blockchain innovation. Cardano Price: A Community Sentiment or Market Stability Cardano has become a standout performer in the ongoing altcoin rally, showcasing strong bullish momentum. Following Bitcoin’s surge to $99,000 in November, Cardano (ADA) reached a 3-year high, benefiting from the market’s upward trajectory. Analysts are now debating the longevity of this altcoin season. Many experts believe Cardano will maintain its rally, with its growing DeFi activity playing a crucial role in driving substantial growth. XRP Faces Challenges Amidst Phishing Alert XRP recently experienced a 12.18% surge, reaching $3.13 and surpassing the $3 mark. Ripple’s anticipated legal victory over the SEC and the buzz around ETFs have likely fueled this momentum. However, new concerns about security vulnerabilities could hinder XRP’s continued growth. As uncertainties persist, some investors are reconsidering their long-term strategies, exploring alternatives in the crypto market that offer more tangible utility and resilience against potential setbacks. PropiChain: A New Frontier in Real Estate Market Innovation with 55,000% Upside PropiChain is reshaping the real estate industry with advanced technology, offering a new way to buy, sell, and invest in property. Its innovative platform is positioned to outpace established players like XRP and Cardano in adoption and market impact. PropiChain integrates Metaverse technology to redefine property scouting. Its interactive 3D virtual tours break down geographical barriers, enabling global investors to explore properties remotely. This approach enhances transparency and eliminates logistical hurdles. It allows real-time property assessments without the need for physical visits, reducing costs and time. PropiChain employs blockchain-powered smart contracts to automate key processes like lease management, ownership transfers, and rental payments. This eliminates intermediaries like brokers, increasing transaction security and efficiency. PropiChain integrates AI to optimize real estate investment strategies. Its AI assistants provide 24/7 support and offer market insights, forecasting property value shifts and delivering data-backed recommendations. This ensures investors maximize profitability while minimizing risks. By tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWA), PropiChain enables fractional ownership of premium real estate. This approach democratizes access to high-value assets, increases liquidity, and invites participation from global investors, creating a more inclusive market environment. Comparing PropiChain to XRP and Cardano While XRP and Cardano have long been key players in the crypto market, PropiChain is emerging as a strong competitor with a remarkable 55,000% growth potential. XRP’s focus on cross-border payments remains hindered by regulatory issues, including its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. On the other hand, Cardano has faced criticism for its slow progress and limited adoption of smart contract capabilities. In contrast, PropiChain is making rapid advancements and meeting key milestones on its roadmap. With a clear use case, robust adoption, and significant growth potential, PropiChain is surpassing XRP and Cardano in market momentum. PropiChain Presale Gains Momentum Over XRP and Cardano PropiChain’s swift rise above XRP and Cardano reflects the increasing interest in blockchain projects with practical applications. Offering a projected 55,000% growth, PropiChain’s ongoing presale is attracting traders and investors eager for high returns. Analysts predict a $1,000 investment could generate $384,570 by Q1 2025. The first presale raised $1.3 million, while the second round has surpassed the $1 million mark. Token prices are set to increase by over 109% after this phase. PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap has helped boost its visibility and adsorption. Additionally, its smart contracts audit by BlockAudit , a security blockchain firm, highlights its accessibility and security.

But among the flurry, BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight, not just for its innovative blockchain technology but also for its groundbreaking partnership with football giant Inter Milan. This exciting collaboration, coupled with the latest Ethereum (ETH) price action and XRP’s recent licensing victories, is creating a buzz that’s impossible to ignore. Let’s break down what’s happening and why it matters. BlockDAG and Inter Milan: Blockchain Takes the Field BlockDAG is making a bold statement by joining forces with Inter Milan, one of the most iconic and celebrated football clubs in the world. This isn’t just a sponsorship deal; it’s a strategic partnership that showcases the real-world applications of blockchain technology in the sports industry. Inter Milan, with its massive global following and rich history, is embracing the future by integrating BlockDAG’s blockchain solutions to revolutionize fan engagement and create unique digital experiences. Imagine a world where fans can own a piece of their favorite club through fan tokens, collect and trade digital memorabilia, and access exclusive content and experiences, all powered by the security and transparency of the blockchain. This is what BlockDAG and Inter Milan are bringing to the table. By leveraging blockchain technology, they’re creating a new era of fan interaction, where supporters feel more connected than ever before. The platform’s presale has been nothing short of phenomenal, raising an impressive $186.5 million and selling over 18.2 billion BDAG coins. With the current price of $0.0248 per BDAG, early investors have seen a staggering 2,380% return on investment. This remarkable achievement underscores the strong belief in BlockDAG’s potential to transform not just the sports industry, but various sectors. This partnership between BlockDAG and Inter Milan is more than just a headline-grabber; it’s a blueprint for the future of sports and entertainment. It demonstrates how blockchain can bridge the gap between traditional industries and cutting-edge technology, offering new avenues for fan engagement, revenue generation, and global reach. XRP Scores with New Licenses Meanwhile, XRP is making headlines too. Ripple, the company behind XRP, just got the green light to operate in New York and Texas. This is a big deal because these are two of the toughest places to get approval in the US. Now, XRP can be used for cross-border payments and other digital asset solutions in these major markets. This news has definitely boosted confidence in XRP. It’s currently trading at $3.15, and many believe this is just the beginning of a bigger climb. As Ripple continues to expand in the US, XRP is becoming a top contender in the crypto world. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action: Still Going Strong Ethereum (ETH) is also holding its own. Despite some recent ups and downs, it’s currently sitting at $3,191.58, showing a 3.89% increase. This rebound is likely due to renewed excitement about Ethereum’s plans to become faster and more secure. Of course, Ethereum (ETH) price action is always influenced by what’s happening in the wider crypto world. With competitors like Solana gaining ground, Ethereum needs to keep innovating to stay ahead. But with its strong foundation in DeFi, NFTs, and other cool applications, Ethereum (ETH) price action remains a hot topic. Wrapping It Up To sum it up, the crypto world is constantly evolving, with projects like XRP and Ethereum showcasing resilience and adaptation in the face of new challenges and opportunities. XRP’s recent licensing victories pave the way for broader adoption and solidify its position as a key player in the cross-border payments arena. Meanwhile, Ethereum, despite facing competition, continues to demonstrate its strength. However, it’s BlockDAG that’s truly capturing the imagination right now. Its innovative partnership with Inter Milan transcends the typical boundaries of the crypto world, demonstrating the transformative potential of blockchain technology in the sports and entertainment industries. This collaboration not only opens up new avenues for fan engagement and revenue generation but also sets a precedent for other sectors looking to leverage blockchain for enhanced transparency, security, and user experiences.

The altcoin has surged 38% in just 30 days, reaching a seven-year high of $3.39. Solana, on the other hand, has taken a 12% hit in just 24 hours, now sitting at $227.62, but that hasn’t erased the 22% Solana price surge. While both XRP and SOL have reported gains, Web3Bay (3BAY) has unlocked a massive ROI potential for early investors. Those who got in during stage 1 of this web3 cryptocurrency’s presale have already secured a 6,430% ROI potential, while those in Stage 4 are still set for 4,200% returns by launch. XRP News: 38% Surge Sets the Stage for $4.79 XRP has started 2025 with a rally that few saw coming, climbing 38% in just 30 days and reaching a seven-year high of $3.39. CoinCodex predicts XRP could hit $4.79, offering a potential 50% ROI in the short term. Adding to this optimistic XRP news, the altcoin’s upcoming Community Day (Jan 28-29, 2025) is expected to bring major announcements, with Ripple President Monica Long unveiling plans for institutional adoption and expansion in Asia-Pacific. Combine this XRP news with talk of a potential ETF, and the stage is set for a year unlike any other for XRP. Q1 Solana (SOL) Price Surge: Is $400 Possible? Solana has dropped 12% in just 24 hours and is currently sitting at $227.62, well below its all-time high of $294.33 earlier this month. But even with the dip, SOL is still up 22% for the month. Analysts at CoinCodex predict a February high of $290, though some in the community are still holding out hope for a Q1 rally to $400. Beyond short-term price swings, Solana’s long-term outlook remains strong. With discussions around blockchain adoption in U.S. government spending, some believe Solana could play a major role, fueling speculation of a much higher Solana price surge in the years ahead. Missed Web3Bay’s 6,430% ROI? 4,200% Still On the Table! Just like Solana’s price surge and the latest XRP news point to a strong Q1 surge, Web3Bay’s presale is following a similar pattern—only on a much bigger scale. Right now, 3BAY is priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, set to hit $0.1959 at launch. Those who got in during Batch 1 have already locked in a 6,430% ROI potential, but even Stage 4 investors are still looking at a 4,200% return by launch. Underlining the potential the presale has raised more than $980,000 in a very short period of time. See the pattern? With every new presale stage, the price climbs, and with every climb, the ROI potential shrinks. Someone buying this web3 cryptocurrency at Stage 4 will see far higher returns than someone who waits for Stage 10—and by then, the biggest slice of the pie will be gone. This up-and-coming e-commerce giant is setting up a completely decentralized shopping experience where users—not corporations—call the shots. Transactions happen peer-to-peer, cutting out middlemen, unnecessary fees, and banking restrictions. Buyers and sellers have complete flexibility, choosing from crypto, PayPal, and traditional finance channels, making the platform accessible to everyone—not just blockchain insiders. Finally, instead of a centralized entity hoarding profits, Web3Bay redistributes value to those who keep the marketplace thriving, building a self-sustaining economy where users benefit directly. Considering Web3Bay’s mission to decentralize online shopping and the sheer success of its ongoing presale, investors aren’t wasting any time securing 3BAY tokens before the ongoing stage 4 sells out. Which Is the Best Web3 Cryptocurrency Today? According to XRP news, Ripple’s upcoming Community Day is set to bring major updates, potentially pushing the altcoin’s price to $4.79 soon. Solana’s path looks less certain—CoinCodex projects $290 by February, with some still eyeing $400 in Q1. But after a 12% drop in 24 hours, short-term sentiment isn’t exactly reassuring. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is reinventing e-commerce entirely, cutting out middlemen, slashing fees, and putting buyers and sellers in control. With over $960,000 raised, the presale Stage 4 of this web3 cryptocurrency is almost gone. Those who missed Stage 1’s 6,430% ROI potential still have a shot at 4,200% gains, but only if they move before Stage 4 disappears.

Key Market Signals Point to a Possible Rebound,https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/is-toncoin-set-for-a-comeback-key-market-signals-point-to-a-possible-rebound/,"While the broader cryptocurrency market appears to be gradually recovering, Toncoin (TON) has yet to join the upward trend. Over the past week, TON has faced significant challenges, seeing its price dip by 5.4%. Amid this price performance, a CryptoQuant analyst has highlighted signs of a potential reversal, especially as recent data sheds light on underlying market dynamics that could impact the coin’s near-term trajectory. Related Reading: Is Toncoin Price Gearing For A Rebound At $5? This On-Chain Metric Suggests So Toncoin Open Interest and Potential Reversal Signals The CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson has provided an intriguing perspective. In a recent post titled “TON: Signs of a Reversal?” Wedson highlighted a pattern within the open interest data that could hint at a price rebound. This analysis comes at a critical time, with market participants seeking any indicators that TON might stabilize and regain lost ground. Wedson’s analysis centers around the weekly variation in Toncoin’s open interest—a measure of the total number of outstanding derivatives contracts on the asset. According to the data, the open interest delta has shown a consistent increase whenever TON experiences volatility spikes. Historically, these patterns have been observed ahead of significant price surges, raising the possibility that a similar recovery could be on the horizon. TON: Signs of a Reversal? “We’ve observed a pattern where the Open Interest Delta increases with each volatility spike—a behavior that previously preceded a sharp price surge.” – By @joao_wedson Full analysis 👇https://t.co/FC8q4QYIp6 pic.twitter.com/5luN5VojDn — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 29, 2025 TON Market Performance In recent weeks, TON’s price action has been noticeably less bullish. Even as the broader cryptocurrency market experiences gradual gains, TON has struggled to recover, consistently declining and now down roughly 11% over the past two weeks. This divergence from the broader market’s upward momentum may suggest that TON is facing its own bearish pressures, whether driven by chart patterns or on-chain factors.

However, with the nature of memecoins, the market is showing signs of instability. As enthusiasm for Solana memecoins begins to fade, savvy investors are shifting their focus to more promising and sustainable opportunities. Among these, RCO Finance (RCOF) stands out as a rising star, positioning itself as the top crypto investment for the first quarter of 2025. The Bubble of Solana Memecoins: Losing Their Shine Memecoins have long been a favorite in the crypto world, enticing traders with dreams of quick and substantial profits. However, the bubble around these tokens, particularly Solana memecoins , is beginning to deflate. When placed side-by-side with utility-driven projects like RCO Finance (RCOF), the inherent weaknesses tokens become apparent. Solana memecoins have thrived on the sheer force of short-term speculative trading, which has fueled rapid price hikes. Yet, this same reliance on speculation has proven to be a double-edged sword. The lack of real-world applications or intrinsic utility has rendered these tokens highly volatile and increasingly unattractive to serious investors. For many, the allure of these memecoins is fading as their unpredictability and lack of foundational value deter long-term commitment. To make matters worse, Solana memecoins are facing intense competition as newer altcoins enter the market with fresh innovations and practical applications. This influx of projects, like AI altcoins, with tangible value has saturated the market, leaving the Solana memecoins scrambling to retain relevance. Why RCO Finance (RCOF) Is the Safer Bet for Long-Term Gains Amidst the instability brought about by the Solana memecoins, RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a compelling alternative. Positioned at artificial intelligence and decentralized finance (DeFi) intersection, RCO Finance offers AI tools to improve investment strategies. One of the standout features of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, which acts as a personal investment strategist for users. This sophisticated tool analyzes vast amounts of market data in real-time, offering personalized recommendations that align with individual investment goals and risk profiles. Unlike traditional advisors, which may charge hefty fees and require extensive market knowledge, the robo advisor democratizes investing by making it accessible to everyone, from seasoned traders to complete novices. This tool ensures that no trader is left behind due to market fluctuations and instabilities. RCO Finance also excels in providing diverse market access. Investors can explore over 120,000 assets across various classes, including stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate. This extensive range allows users to build robust portfolios to mitigate risk while maximizing returns. Moreover, RCOF introduces a unique opportunity for passive income generation through staking and rewards programs. Users can stake their tokens to earn substantial returns while supporting the platform’s liquidity. This feature not only incentivizes long-term holding but also cultivates a loyal community of investors. RCOF recently unveiled the beta version of its highly anticipated platform, igniting excitement among investors and traders alike. The platform’s innovative features have attracted over 10,000 users, showcasing its potential to disrupt the DeFi space. Building on this momentum, the upcoming alpha launch promises to deliver even more advanced capabilities, which are currently undergoing rigorous testing to ensure a seamless user experience. Security is another cornerstone of RCO Finance’s appeal. The platform undergoes regular audits by SolidProof , ensuring that investor funds are protected against potential threats. This commitment to transparency and security fosters trust among users, further solidifying RCOF’s position as a reliable investment option. Is RCO Finance Worth Investing? The current RCO Finance (RCOF) presale presents an exceptional opportunity for investors eager to get in on the ground floor of this promising project. The presale has already raised over $12.2 million and is on track to reach its target of $13 million by month’s end. Each RCOF token is priced at just $0.10, with projections estimating a potential surge to $0.60 upon listing, a remarkable 700% ROI. Beyond this, analysts predict post-listing growth to exceed $5 per token, equating to over 6,500% ROI, surpassing a significant portion of Solana memecoins in potential returns. Investors participating in the presale secure a stake in an innovative platform and gain access to AI analytics, private syndicate ETF funds, priority customer support, and governance rights. These features underline RCOF’s commitment to enhancing the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. While Solana memecoins have often delivered short-term gains fueled by speculative trading, RCO Finance goes beyond that. It aims to provide investors with both high returns and cutting-edge tools designed to revolutionize the DeFi sector, offering long-term growth and value. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this transformative journey, invest in RCO Finance today, and get access to long-term gains!

39717605,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=665746,1738288920,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39717605.jpeg,Uniswap Protocol on Base posts third consecutive monthly volume ATH in January 2025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uniswap-on-base-monthly-volume-ath-january/,"Uniswap Protocol recorded a monthly high trading volume of $15.65 billion on the Base network in January 2025. This makes it the third consecutive time Uniswap’s monthly trading volume on the Base network hit an all-time high. It also recorded all-time highs in November and December 2024. Overall, Uniswap has processed over $1 trillion in total trading volume, which makes it one of the largest DEXs in the world. What Uniswap users are doing on Base The monthly transaction volume on the Uniswap DEX on Coinbase’s native network, Base hit an all-time high for the third month in a row. According to data on the Uniswap interface on Base, memecoins, AI agents, and cbBTC are the hottest assets. Memes are one of the top-performing assets this cycle, and while Solana remains the home for risk-tolerant traders, Base also posts steady numbers in those regards. It also benefits from the intersection between the AI agent and memecoin narratives. For example, one of the top-performing tokens for the month, Virtual Protocol’s VIRTUAL, which is currently trading at $2.05, posted a monthly volume of $6.6 billion and an all-time volume of $12.2 billion. VIRTUAL is sandwiched between Ethereum and USDC, two tokens that enable DeFi activity on Base. USDC is currently enjoying a monopoly of volume on the network because Coinbase delisted USDT in Europe to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. Its trading volume for the month came in at $5.5 billion, with an FDC of $53.1 billion. Tether’s USDT had a notably bad January, with less than $59 million in trading volume for the entire month. Aside from memes and AI agent tokens, users on Uniswap have also been heavily involved with Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC). Coinbase built cbBTC to be compatible with DeFi applications to allow customers to participate and unlock the financial utility in dApps. cbBTC holds $2.4 billion in FDV with a volume of $695.95 million Another AI token to feature high on the list is aixbt by Virtuals (AIXBT) with a $603 million trading volume month. Uniswap’s activity contributed to a strong month for Base Uniswap’s increased trading volume in the past couple of months has contributed to Base’s growth and the network’s recent liveliness. The chain carries over 500 decentralized apps, and activity on the tokenless chain expanded to over 2M daily active users this January. Base may have started out as a chain for fun NFT and meme experiments, but it has clearly matured and is now moving forward with DeFi, evidenced by the strong performance of cbBTC. Aerodrome, Morpho Blue, and Uniswap are some of the top apps on Base. Morpho grew after it was promoted as a source for crypto-backed loans. The app allows Coinbase users to borrow against Bitcoin (BTC) collateral. Another factor boosting Base was its integration into Phantom Wallet, which was instrumental to onboarding more new users in the last quarter of 2024. Base carries about $3.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), and the network posted close to $20 billion in volume for the entire month. Still, it remains a fair distance behind Solana, another network that posted record-breaking numbers throughout January. Uniswap first appeared on the scene in November 2018 and quickly gained traction in the decentralized finance space. It was a beneficiary of the bull run that came later in 2021. By that time, Uniswap had processed over 50 million transactions. In 2022, the platform remained steady despite bear market conditions. In 2023, Uniswap processed less than 180 million transactions, but it set a new record by processing over 300 million transactions in 2024.

At the Plan B conference in San Salvador, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced that the integration of USDT into Bitcoin and Lightning is designed to provide “practical solutions for remittances, payments, and other financial applications that require both speed and reliability.” USDT integration on Bitcoin marks a new era for stablecoins USDT, the company’s dollar-backed stablecoin, will soon be fully operational across both Bitcoin’s base layer and the Lightning Network, a scaling network for Bitcoin, as Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced Thursday at a Bitcoin conference in El Salvador. For Tether and Bitcoin, two powerful cryptocurrency players who had not yet united, the unification represents a critical turning point. With a market valuation of about $140 billion, USDT is by far the most popular stablecoin in the world. It is used by hundreds of millions of people globally as a safe way to connect traditional banking with the cryptocurrency economy. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is by far the world’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency. However, the Bitcoin network has been slow to attract on-chain users, as it was not initially designed to support decentralized applications. Scaling networks like the Lightning Network have filled this gap, making layer-2 transactions on Bitcoin fast and affordable and enabling the integration of assets like USDT into the Bitcoin ecosystem. “Today marks a new era for stablecoins,” said Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, the leading developer of infrastructure on the Lightning Network, in a statement on Thursday. Lightning Labs developed the protocol that enables USDT to integrate with the Bitcoin network. According to Stark, millions of people will now be able to send dollars globally using the most open, secure blockchain. Tether faces increased scrutiny amid growing role in global finance USDT is available on 17 other blockchain networks, including Ethereum and Solana. As cryptocurrency continues integrating with mainstream finance, stablecoins have become more essential than ever in linking both sectors. Tether remains the most widely used stablecoin, providing users an easy way to store crypto funds in a stable asset pegged to the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins, especially Tether, have become increasingly scrutinized as their influence on the global economy grows. On Wednesday, lawmakers questioned Howard Lutnick, President Donald Trump’s nominee for Commerce Secretary, about his close ties to Tether, a payment method used by retail users and criminal organizations. Lutnick’s Wall Street firm, Cantor Fitzgerald, currently holds billions of dollars in collateral assets for Tether, which theoretically ensures the stablecoin maintains its dollar peg. However, no independent agency has yet verified whether Cantor and Tether are accurately reporting the size of that collateral reserve. During the hearing, Lutnick acknowledged the need for the United States to implement a comprehensive auditing process for stablecoin issuers like Tether, given the growing importance of maintaining the stability of such assets.

Some coins have skyrocketed, while others have taken a backseat. Litecoin, once a promising contender, has seen its potential fade as newer, more innovative projects take the spotlight. If you’re an investor who missed the Litecoin train, you’re probably wondering what’s next—something with that same potential for growth but even more upside. That’s where Qubetics comes into play. Qubetics, a game-changing project that’s still in its presale stage, promises to revolutionize the crypto world in ways Litecoin never could. Its unique approach to real-world asset tokenization and decentralized VPN services has analysts buzzing about its future, predicting massive returns for early investors. While Litecoin has had its moment, the opportunity to get in on Qubetics is still very much alive. Let’s dive into why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy right now , especially if you missed out on Litecoin. Litecoin: A Missed Opportunity? When it comes to popular crypto coins to buy, Litecoin has been a household name for years. It’s often dubbed “the silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” and for a good reason. Litecoin has a solid track record of transaction speed, security, and stability. Many saw it as a top alternative to Bitcoin, mainly due to its lower transaction fees and faster confirmation times. However, despite its longevity in the crypto world, Litecoin’s price has remained relatively flat compared to the explosive growth of newer coins. Sure, Litecoin has had its moments of growth, but if you look at its performance over the past few years, it doesn’t have the same hype or wild potential that other coins have been delivering. Analysts are predicting modest gains, with some suggesting that Litecoin could hit around $500 in the future. But let’s be honest—if you’re looking for a big bang, Litecoin isn’t the investment that’s going to make you a crypto millionaire. If you missed Litecoin’s early days, you’re probably wondering where to put your money now. The good news? There’s still time to jump into a top crypto asset with huge growth potential: Qubetics. Qubetics: The Popular Crypto Coin To Buy Now Now, let’s talk about why Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy today , especially for those who missed out on Litecoin. Qubetics is currently in its 19th presale stage and has already raised over $11.4 million, with 452 million tokens sold to more than 17,400 holders. Analysts are predicting massive returns for early investors—some even forecast Qubetics’ $TICS token price could skyrocket to $15 after the mainnet launch, giving early investors a 24,630% ROI. What makes Qubetics stand out in a sea of other projects is its innovative use of decentralized privacy solutions and real-world asset tokenization. The Qubetics team is building a platform that can tokenize tangible assets like real estate, luxury goods, and more. This is a game-changer for industries that have been stuck using outdated, inefficient systems. Not to mention, Qubetics’ decentralized VPN is going to give people unprecedented security and freedom in the digital age. The beauty of Qubetics is that it’s not just another coin—it’s solving real-world problems. Imagine a small business looking to raise capital through tokenized assets, or an investor trying to gain access to previously inaccessible markets. Qubetics is providing a solution that could level the playing field and bring the power of blockchain technology to the masses. Real-World Applications: How Qubetics is Changing the Game So, what does Qubetics actually do, and how does it impact real life? Let’s break it down. One of the most exciting features of Qubetics is its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This isn’t just a concept—it’s happening now. Qubetics allows businesses, professionals, and individuals to tokenize real-world assets and make them accessible to a global pool of investors. For example, let’s say you’re a small business owner who owns a luxury car dealership. With Qubetics , you can tokenize a portion of your business—turning that equity into a digital asset—and sell it to investors from around the world. This opens up new funding opportunities and allows you to raise capital quickly without the usual bureaucratic red tape. Another scenario: imagine being a property investor who has always wanted to own shares of high-end real estate but has never had the means to do so. With Qubetics, you could purchase tokenized shares of luxury properties and earn returns without the huge upfront costs. And it’s not just businesses that benefit—individuals are going to be able to tokenize their assets, whether that’s through luxury goods or intellectual property, and access a new stream of income. The possibilities are endless. Conclusion: If you missed out on Litecoin, don’t sweat it—you still have an incredible opportunity with Qubetics. With its game-changing technology and massive potential for growth, Qubetics is the popular crypto coin to buy now for anyone looking to make a big impact on their portfolio. The presale is in its final stages, so now’s the time to hop in before prices explode. The future of crypto is here, and it’s Qubetics—get in while you can. Call to Action: Don’t wait around—head over to Qubetics’ official site and grab your $TICS tokens today. Time is ticking, and the opportunity to secure massive returns is slipping away fast. Make your move now, and don’t miss out on the next big thing in crypto.

The space is rapidly growing, and new projects are constantly emerging with big promises. If you’re looking for a meme coin with real potential, then Arctic Pablo (APC) is one to watch. With exciting features and a presale that’s already making waves, this could be your chance to get in early. In this article, we’ll also take a look at Moo Deng and Trump Meme Coin, two other notable crypto projects, but Arctic Pablo is included in the Best Meme Coins to Join for Long Term due to its promising presale and strategic tokenomics. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins, including Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Trump Meme Coin. Token Burns: The Deflationary Strategy Behind Arctic Pablo’s Growth Arctic Pablo (APC) is taking the world by storm with its innovative token burn mechanism. This feature, integral to the project’s strategy, ensures that unsold tokens are permanently eliminated weekly throughout the presale. The burn doesn’t stop there; after the presale, any remaining tokens will also be burned, creating a deflationary environment that boosts scarcity and value. This approach is designed to enhance the long-term potential of the project and increase the value of the remaining tokens over time. Transactions related to token burns are tracked and recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and trust in the process. This scarcity-driven model ensures that Arctic Pablo remains one of the most exciting meme coin projects, with the potential for significant returns. As more tokens are burned, the remaining supply becomes even more valuable—perfect for early investors looking for a long-term hold. Why You Shouldn’t Miss Out on Arctic Pablo’s Presale Arctic Pablo has reached the Glacier Grove phase of its presale, and it’s generating a lot of buzz. The current price is just $0.000043 per token, offering early investors a chance to secure their position at an incredibly low entry price. As Arctic Pablo continues its journey through various stages, the price will rise, making it harder to get in at these early levels. With over $700,000 raised and the presale moving forward, investors are already looking at a potential ROI of over 18,546% from the seventh stage, Glacier Grove, to the launch price of $0.008. Arctic Pablo finished exploring the El-Dorado stage in under 3 days and exceeded expectations by completing all six initial locations faster than anticipated. Now, as the price continues to climb, there’s no better time to get in before the next surge. Arctic Pablo has proven its momentum, and with such a strong presale performance, there’s little doubt that this project is one of the best meme coins to join for long term growth. If you’re ready to be part of something big, the Glacier Grove phase offers an exceptional opportunity to buy in at a low price before the final price hike. Moo Deng: The Latest Developments and Market Success Moo Deng (MOODENG) has been gaining significant attention in the meme coin world. Currently priced at $0.10336 per coin, Moo Deng has a market cap of USD 102.32 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of USD 77.44 million. The project continues to make strides, and its growing presence in the market suggests a promising future. Moo Deng’s performance highlights its appeal among investors looking for potential growth and innovation within the meme coin sector. Whether it’s its community or unique features, Moo Deng remains a key player in the crypto space. Trump Meme Coin: Standing Strong Among Top Meme Coins Trump Meme Coin currently has a market cap of over USD 5.5 billion. This impressive figure speaks volumes about the growing popularity and strength of the project. Investors are taking notice, and the coin continues to make waves with its large following and innovative initiatives. The project has shown significant growth since its inception, cementing its place as one of the most recognized meme coins in the market today. If you’re looking for an established meme coin with strong support, Trump Meme Coin remains a solid choice. Conclusion: Why Arctic Pablo Should Be on Your Radar All three of these meme coins—Arctic Pablo, Moo Deng, and Trump Meme Coin—have their unique selling points, but Arctic Pablo stands out among top meme coins for long term growth. With an innovative token burn mechanism, a presale that has already raised over $700,000, and the potential for massive ROI, Arctic Pablo presents an exciting opportunity for early investors. The presale, currently at the Glacier Grove phase, is the perfect entry point, offering one of the best meme coins to join for long-term success. Don’t miss your chance to be part of Arctic Pablo’s rise—get in now while prices are still low!

Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev was speaking at a meeting of the Legislative Assembly of the Irkutsk Region, which was aired on the region’s VK channel . The Governor said he would ask Moscow to extend its wintertime mining ban in the south of the region. However, not everyone in Kobzev’s government appears to be on board with such a ban. Some fear it could drive mining firms out of the region once and for all. Russian Bitcoin Mining Hotspot Government Divided on Ban Call Many industrial players remain in the areas, despite a recent decree ordering them to power down their rigs in the winter months. A notable historical building in Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: Fanzuga [CC BY-SA 3.0]) The ban came into force on January 1. And Kobzev said the policy has already demonstrated results. The Governor said it has already “freed up about 300 MW of energy capacity.” However, he said, electricity shortages remain acute in the Angara region. He called for an end to mining “in energy-deficient regions” until work was completed on new housing and state construction projects had been completed. But Kobzev conceded that not everyone in the Irkutsk government agreed on the move. Before Russia’s Bitcoin mining boom, the area struggled to attract investors. Mining has revitalized the local economy. And with Moscow set to launch crypto mining taxes later this year, forcing miners out of the area could prove a costly decision. Russia appears to have overcome for now a deficit of yuan that led to a spike in short-term borrowing costs after the US threatened to penalize lenders for processing cross-border payments https://t.co/a0DKQ1n9nL — Bloomberg Markets (@markets) January 30, 2025 “We know that the restrictions in the southern part of the region have caused a mixed reaction. We know that there are opponents to further restrictions. However, we are confident that these measures are necessary. They will ensure the sustainable development of the region.” Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev Kobzev added that he was “confident that we will go further together.” He said: “We will obtain a year-round ban on mining in energy-deficient areas of the Irkutsk region until 2031.” The River Angara in Russia. (Source: Octagon [CC BY 3.0]) North Excempt from Ban Crypto miners continue to operate in Northern Irkutsk. And Kobzev appeared keen to let them continue doing so. At the same meeting, he ordered the creation of a “commission to determine to what extent the new federal rules” would “allow for an increase in tax returns from miners’ activities in the north.” This commission, he added, would present its findings “at the federal level,” with talks about tax rates still ongoing in Moscow. The Kremlin expressed its condolences to the families of Russian citizens who lost their lives in the American Airlines plane crash in Washington https://t.co/4iJxBExA3D — Reuters (@Reuters) January 30, 2025 Perfect Package for Miners Irkutsk, in Siberia, offers miners a seemingly perfect package of incentives: Real estate prices and rental fees are low, energy costs are similarly low, and winters are famously long. However, Irkutsk’s fame as a Bitcoin mining destination means that it has also attracted scores of “grey” miners. Many of these, Siberian power firms claim, use illegal connections to the grid to avoid detection from the authorities. The regional ban decree runs until 2031, but – at present – will allow miners to turn their rigs on again in spring this year. Should Irkutsk’s Governor get his way, scores of other regions look ready to vie to become Russia’s newest Bitcoin mining hotspot.

As a result, a Dogecoin millionaire picks a low cap AI altcoin as the best choice for life-changing gain in the 2025 bull market. In this text, we will analyze the Dogecoin millionaire view on this low cap altcoin and know why it is the best choice for 2025 gains. Which Low-Cap Altcoin Is the Dogecoin Millionaire’s Choice and Why This Dogecoin millionaire made a massive profit in 2021 when Dogecoin (DOGE) had an explosive upward trajectory. According to the crypto millionaire, joining a high-potential, low-cap altcoin early is the key to unlocking life-changing gains in the crypto market. Therefore, the Dogecoin millionaire believes PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a decentralized real estate marketplace that aims to reshape the $300 trillion sector, is the best altcoin choice for gains. The project is set to integrate AI, the Metaverse, and blockchain into the real estate industry. PropiChain has been gaining traction in the RWA sector and witnessing early success one instance is the CoinMarketCap listing which increases the visibility of the project. The project is currently in the second round of its token presale and it is going for $0.011 which is the lowest entry price anyone will get because it will be higher in the third round. Also, BlockAudit reviewed the project , and their report shows that the security of users’ assets is a top priority for the platform. This news further indicates the authenticity of the project and the high desire to protect investors from fraudulent activities that might lead to the loss of their assets. Hereunder, we will discuss in detail how the core features of PropiChain platform will revolutionize real estate and what investors stand to benefit. How PropiChain Will Transform Real Estate Investment Landscape PropiChain goes beyond the typical AI altcoin offering a comprehensive solution that is aimed at resolving traditional real estate investment hurdles and tapping into new avenues of opportunity. We will discuss in detail how this project will transform real estate. Fractional Ownership for Better Asset Acquisition Model The conventional real estate market is known for its high entry costs, which serve as a barrier for most people except wealthy investors. Therefore, PropiChain aims to eradicate this barrier by introducing a fractional ownership model for easier asset acquisition. This is a model that will enable users of PropiChain to own shares of valuable properties based on their financial capability. Returns from these properties will be shared proportionally among the shareholders of the assets. This model can be used to own a percentage in any set from any location on the globe with a capital of $100. Aside from democratizing access to the multi-trillion dollar sector, this approach will benefit sellers globally by addressing liquidity issues as it will enable faster sales compared to the traditional market. Empowering Investors with AI-Powered Real Estate Investment PropiChain leverages AI to help investors on the platform with practical insights. With the AI’s capability to analyze vast data, it could help investors pinpoint high potential areas to invest in. The AI will use data on trends, price fluctuations, demand for specific assets and so on to locate undervalued assets and give insights to users. First time real estate investors won’t need to spend extra money to hire brokers because PCHAIN’s AI can serve as a virtual assistant that will guide them on real investment. Also, both existing and new investors can use the AI chatbot as a legal adviser that will help them understand legal terms in real estate contracts before making a commitment. Also, PropiChain AI introduces an advanced method for filtering properties that will enable users to find assets that align with their investment objectives. For instance, users can search for assets with a potential returns filter and choose the one that fits their objective. Real Estate Without Borders With the Help of the Metaverse PropiChain integrated the interactive environment of the Metaverse to enable leasing spaces for digital events, showcasing assets for potential buyers, holding meetings, and remote inspections. With the help of the Metaverse, international investors will be able to participate actively in the real estate market of several continents without traveling. This innovative approach will break down the geographical barrier that is currently in the conventional real estate market. Therefore, owning assets globally will now be easy and at a cheaper cost. Conclusion The Dogecoin millionaire states that PropiChain , being an AI altcoin, is a major factor that will aid its surge. AI-meta is the hottest narrative in the crypto market at the moment, and PCHAIN aims to bring unique AI offerings to RWA via its platform. Experts are convinced it could deliver a staggering 35780% ROI in Q1 of 2025. The current token presale round, which is going for $0.011, is the best price for early investors to join before the anticipated price surge. An investment of $1000 in this round could potentially yield more than $350,000 in Q1 of 2025. Dogecoin was the success story of a lot of early investors in 2021, PropiChain is presenting another opportunity and its utility in the real estate means it can replicate and outperform Dogecoin’s 2021 run. Join now to stay ahead of market trends and optimize returns with PropiChain’s AI-powered platform.

33767162,[object Object],1738292447,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Dogecoin Teases Ascending Triangle On 4-Hour Chart, Here’s What Could Happen If It Forms",https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-teases-key-pattern/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) could be on the verge of an explosive price rally , as recent technical analysis reveals that the popular meme coin may be forming a distinctive Ascending Triangle pattern on its 4-hour chart. This bullish continuation pattern, combined with a rebound from an oversold Relative Strength Index (RSI) , suggests that a breakout could occur anytime soon. Dogecoin Eyes Breakout As Ascending Triangle Forms An Ascending Triangle is typically seen as a bullish chart pattern, formed by a horizontal resistance line connecting swing highs and a rising trendline connecting lower lows. Interestingly, a crypto analyst, Trader Tardigrade, has identified what appears to be an Ascending Triangle forming on the Dogecoin price chart in the 4-hour timeframe. Analyzing the analyst’s presented chart, Dogecoin’s price action shows a series of higher lows along an ascending trendline while facing resistance at $0.334 on the horizontal level. This Ascending Triangle formation suggests that buyers may be gaining strength, potentially leading to a breakout to the upside if the meme coin breaches the above resistance level. Notably, the lower part of the chart shows that Dogecoin’s RSI indicator recently entered oversold territory, dropping below 30%. The RSI has since rebounded and is gaining significant momentum, with indicators suggesting it may have room to surge towards overbought zone s above 70%. This positive shift in momentum indicates a steady increase in buying pressure, supporting the possibility of a Dogecoin price appreciation to new highs. Based on the chart’s forecast, DOGE’s price could skyrocket toward the range between $0.355 and $0.360 if it successfully breaks above the Ascending Triangle resistance at $0.334. Conversely, a rejection at this resistance level could lead to a retest of the ascending trendline before another breakout attempt. What’s Next For DOGE? Despite reports from CoinMarketCap highlighting a price decline of over 6% in the past week, Dogecoin remains resilient, aiming for new highs above the $0.6 mark. A prominent crypto analyst, identified as ‘Coinvo’, has announced to his over 324,000 followers that a new Dogecoin all-time high is imminent . The analyst shared a detailed chart illustrating the DOGE price action over a multi-year period on a weekly timeframe. He highlighted two primary resistance levels, which suggests that the meme coin could rise to a new ATH soon. The first resistance level , $0.015, was broken in early 2021 during the previous bull run, leading to a parabolic price surge in Dogecoin. The second resistance level, $0.6, represents Dogecoin’s all-time high in 2021, which its current price looks to be approaching again. DOGE is currently trading at $0.33, having experienced a prolonged downtrend and consolidation between 2022 and 2023. Based on historical trends, the meme coin’s price could be nearing its previous peak, as it follows a similar bullish trajectory as the 2021 bull run.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Ascending Triangle Pattern|Coinmarketcap|Coinvo|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|meme coin|Overbought Zones|RSI|Trader Tardigrade,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-31 03:00:47

The approval, granted on an “accelerated basis” on Thursday, allows the fund to track both spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) based on their market capitalization. This approval marks a major shift in the regulatory landscape under the Trump administration, as several firms have recently sought to list new crypto products with the SEC. Bitwise’s ETF, launched in partnership with the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), is designed to provide easier access to Bitcoin and Ethereum for mainstream investors. The NYSE Arca filed the necessary paperwork for the ETF in November 2024. “In particular, the Commission finds that the Proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Exchange’s rules be designed to ‘prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and, ‘in general, to protect investors and the public interest,” the agency said. It added, “The Commission finds that the Proposal, as with other ETPs that the commission has approved, is reasonably designed to promote fair disclosure of information that may be necessary to price the Shares appropriately, to prevent trading when a reasonable degree of transparency cannot be assured, to safeguard material non-public information relating to the Trust’s portfolio, and to ensure fair and orderly markets for the Shares.” This approval follows a series of changes in the SEC’s stance on crypto products, including the previous hesitance of former SEC Chair Gary Gensler to approve Bitcoin ETF trading, which only occurred after a court ruling.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 03:06:25

Bitwise Asset Management’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF aims to provide investors with exposure to both digital assets, weighted by their respective market capitalizations. The fund’s structure will be similar to existing ETFs that directly hold either Bitcoin or Ether. The SEC has approved the fund’s 19b-4 filing, an essential step in the approval process. However, Bitwise still requires the SEC’s clearance for its S-1 registration application, which is necessary before trading can commence. Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF The “Bitwise Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF” will offer exposure to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) in a single fund, weighted by their relative market capitalizations—83% BTC and 17% ETH as of the filing date. The ETF will determine market capitalisation by multiplying pricing benchmarks by circulating supply, according to the filing. Approval comes less than two weeks after a crypto-friendly acting chair took over the SEC. Commissioner Mark Uyeda took over as acting head of the SEC while the agency awaits Senate confirmation of President Donald Trump’s nominee for the permanent role, Paul Atkins. Bitwise Investment Advisers will manage the fund, with Coinbase providing custody and Bank of New York Mellon serving as the cash custodian, administrator, and transfer agent. Crypto ETFs boom after Trump’s return Bitwise submitted the application for the dual crypto ETF in November, shortly after the US presidential election. The election saw Donald Trump, who has expressed a more favorable stance toward the cryptocurrency industry, return to office. The administration has pledged to introduce supportive regulations to position the US as a leading hub for digital assets. The SEC has received increasing numbers of ETF proposals from investment firms seeking to expand the range of crypto-based financial products. Bloomberg analyst Nathan Dean noted that issuers are “probing the SEC’s boundaries,” with some firms even filing applications for ETFs based on meme coins. Bitwise has proposed an ETF tracking Dogecoin , a cryptocurrency known for its volatile price movements influenced by social media trends. Additionally, the SEC has received applications for ETFs tracking assets like XRP , Solana, and Litecoin, which claim to offer various forms of utility beyond speculation. The launch of US-based Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 was met with strong investor interest. The group of ETFs investing directly in Bitcoin—including one from Bitwise—has accumulated more than $121 billion in total assets. Ether-based ETFs followed later, with more than $11 billion in assets under management so far. The strong demand for these products reflects the growing role of cryptocurrencies in investment portfolios, despite ongoing debates over their classification and long-term value proposition.

Well, right now, the crypto market is buzzing with exciting opportunities, and one presale is turning heads among the top meme coin presales to buy now— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . While Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) and Mog Coin (MOG) are making moves in the meme coin space, BTFD Coin has just pulled a massive power play: burning unsold tokens from Stage 13 and dropping a mind-blowing 100% bonus offer for Stage 14 investors. Yes, you heard that right—double your tokens instantly with the LAUNCH100 code! With its P2E game now fully live, 90% APY staking, and a bullish community, BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a revolution. Considering the presale started at just $0.000004 and will launch at $0.0006, investors are staring at a 550% ROI with the bonus included. Meanwhile, MEW is navigating a volatile market, and MOG is experiencing a pullback after its December pump. Let’s have a look. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Presale That’s Breaking Records Ever seen a presale jump straight to the next stage and burn unsold tokens? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin just did! With Stage 14 now live at $0.00016, every investor can double their BTFD stack using the LAUNCH100 bonus code. Here’s why this meme coin is dominating the market: The BTFD Coin presale is on fire, raising over $5.82 million with 9,900+ Bulls already on board and 68+ billion BTFD tokens sold. Investors are securing BTFD at just $0.00016, with a launch price set at $0.0006, promising a 275% ROI—or a massive 550% with the LAUNCH100 bonus code. Don’t miss out on one of the top meme coin presales to buy now! If you throw down $8,000 in Stage 14, you’re bagging 50 million BTFD tokens. But if you enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code, that doubles to 100 million tokens! At launch, that’s a $60,000+ valuation. This isn’t just a presale—it’s a goldmine for early adopters. The P2E Game That’s Changing the Meme Coin Scene Forget about meme coins with no utility— BTFD Coin’s P2E game is fully live, and users can earn rewards while playing. Since its full launch on January 1, 2025, gamers have been stacking BTFD just by leveling up. Unlike the beta version, which didn’t reward players, the full version pays out actual tokens—meaning playtime equals profit. The game is already buzzing in crypto gaming circles, and with the Bulls Squad leading the charge, this isn’t just another play-to-earn gimmick. It’s the future of interactive crypto investments. 90% APY Staking & Referral Program – Passive Income on Autopilot Why just hold when you can stake your BTFD for a 90% APY return? Since staking went live on December 2, 2024, early investors have been multiplying their holdings passively. Plus, the BTFD Referral Program lets you earn 10% of the raise amount in BTFD if your code is used. If your referral spends $500, they get 10% extra BTFD, and you get 10% of their purchase amount. The top 20 referrers each month cash out big. It’s a win-win for Bulls! Claim the 100% Bonus Before it Ends! Ready to double your tokens? Follow these steps : Visit the Presale Site Connect Your Wallet – Use MetaMask or Trust Wallet Enter the LAUNCH100 Code – Hit a pply Buy BTFD – Choose how much to invest Confirm Your Purchase – Watch your tokens double instantly This 100% bonus won’t last forever, so don’t sleep on it! Cat in a Dog’s World (MEW) – A Meme Coin with Market Momentum MEW, a Solana-based feline challenger to dog-themed meme coins, is currently trading at $0.00438, with recent price swings between $0.00412 and $0.00446. With a total circulating supply of 88.89 billion tokens, it’s been making noise in the meme coin space. A recent highlight for MEW is its recognition as one of the top meme coins to watch. Plus, it’s collaborating with Locus Animation Studios to co-produce a 3D animated series, expanding its presence beyond crypto into mainstream media. Despite these moves, MEW has seen some market dips, so investors are closely watching whether it rebounds or continues consolidating. Mog Coin (MOG) – Facing a Correction After a Monster Pump MOG had a massive December, shooting up to $0.000004022 and crossing the $1 billion market cap mark after a 30% surge. This was largely driven by its Coinbase listing roadmap announcement on December 3, 2024, which triggered a 20% price boost. However, MOG is currently experiencing a correction, trading at $0.00000114 after dropping 32.4% in a week. Analysts are watching key support at $0.00000170 and resistance at $0.00000200 to see if it rebounds or dips further. With its market volatility, MOG is still a big name in the meme coin world, but the excitement seems to have cooled off for now. Final Thoughts Based on market trends, presale performance, and real utility, BTFD Coin stands out as the top meme coin presale to buy now . While MEW and MOG are making moves, they don’t have the insane 100% bonus offer, a fully launched P2E game, and 90% staking rewards that BTFD is offering right now. With a 550% ROI potential (including the bonus), staking, gaming rewards, and a massive community, this is a no-brainer for crypto investors looking for the next big thing. The LAUNCH100 bonus code won’t last forever, so if you want to double your investment before the presale ends, now’s the time to move. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and secure your spot before it’s too late!

ETH was able to surpass the $3,120 and $3,150 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $3,200 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,427 wing high to the $3,020 swing low. However, the bears are now active near the $3,270 and $3,280 resistance levels . Ethereum price is now trading above $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The first major resistance is near the $3,330 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,360. A clear move above the $3,360 resistance might send the price toward the $3,450 resistance. An upside break above the $3,450 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,550 resistance zone or even $3,650 in the near term. Another Drop In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,270 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,220 level. The first major support sits near the $3,200. A clear move below the $3,200 support might push the price toward the $3,120 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000.

Given Bitcoin’s resilience, analysts are now predicting a new BTC all-time high (ATH) in the coming weeks. Bitcoin Defies DeepSeek Sell-Off, FOMC Uncertainty Earlier this week, US stocks took a hit after Chinese AI firm DeepSeek unveiled its open-source LLM, raising concerns over the high market valuation of its American counterparts. As a result, the S&P 500 saw a strong sell-off, with NVIDIA leading the losses, dropping 16% in a single day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Steady Amid NASDAQ Decline, Analyst Calls It ‘Extremely Bullish’ Similarly, in its latest meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left interest rates unchanged, in line with market expectations. While the hawkish stance was expected to deal another blow to crypto markets, BTC remained relatively unscathed after an initial dip. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $105,839, having essentially recouped all its losses from the DeepSeek-induced market crash. In fact, BTC has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five days, surging 1.53%, compared to the latter’s 1.25% decline. New BTC ATH In February? Seasoned crypto trader Pentoshi commented on BTC’s strength, saying that the digital asset has held up well despite the turmoil. The trader added that they see no reason why BTC shouldn’t hit a new ATH soon. Another Bitcoin enthusiast, Castillo Trading, noted that Bitcoin’s price structure “looks flawless.” They added that both lower- and higher-time frames suggest that BTC will likely go higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Target $145,000 To $249,000 Under Trump Administration: Report In a similar vein, crypto trader and entrepreneur Michael van de Poppe said that the market will likely see a new BTC ATH in the ‘coming weeks,’ potentially hinting at February as the target month. Further, crypto trader Roman shared the following chart, commenting that “Stoch & RSI have plenty of room to break $108,000 resistance and head higher.” They added that bullish divergence on BTC is also playing out nicely. For the uninitiated, both Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) and Relative-Strength Index (RSI) are momentum indicators that help traders identify whether the underlying asset is oversold or overbought in current market conditions. While projections for a new BTC ATH may be focused on the short-term, market cycle peaks are expected to occur in the summer of 2025. For instance, a recent report by Bitfinex forecasts that BTC could surge to $200,000 by mid-2025, amid shallow price pullbacks. Meanwhile DeepSeek predicts that BTC may top out between $500,000 and $600,000 by Q1 2026. At press time, BTC trades at $105,839, up 3.1% in the past 24 hours.

With two lawsuits in motion and fraud allegations flying, is this meme coin casino finally running out of luck? Pump.fun, a platform notorious for launching meme coins on the Solana ( SOL ) blockchain, is now facing a second class-action lawsuit just days after the first. The legal battle, led by Burwick Law and Wolf Popper LLP, alleges that the platform is violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered securities disguised as meme tokens. **LAWSUIT ALERT** Burwick Law and @WolfPopperLLP have filed a second federal class action lawsuit on behalf of investors against the PumpdotFun platform. Full complaint available below. — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) January 30, 2025 The latest lawsuit, filed on Jan. 30 in the Southern District of New York, names multiple defendants, including Baton Corporation Ltd (operating as Pump.fun) and key figures Alon Cohen, Dylan Kerler, and Noah Bernhard Hugo Tweedale. According to court filings, plaintiff Diego Aguilar claims he suffered financial losses after purchasing several tokens on the platform, including the Fwog ( FWOG ) token, and the Griffain ( GRIFFAIN ) token. These tokens, aggressively marketed with meme culture and promises of exponential returns, allegedly led to significant losses despite reaching high valuations—such as the FWOG Token, which Pump.fun promoted as having hit a $500 million market cap. This lawsuit follows an earlier case filed on Jan. 16 by Burwick Law on behalf of Kendall Carnahan, targeting the sale of the Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ) Token. **LEGAL ACTION ALERT: PUMPDOTFUN** Burwick Law is pursuing legal action on behalf of investors in pumpdotfun memecoins. If you lost money on any pumpdotfun memecoins, you may be entitled to compensation. Read more below. — Burwick Law (@BurwickLaw) January 15, 2025 The complaint argues that Pump.fun operates by collaborating with influencers to co-issue and market unregistered securities. The lawsuit also alleges that the platform’s business model represents an evolved form of Ponzi and pump-and-dump schemes, extracting nearly half a billion dollars in fees from investors. Burwick Law’s legal campaign against Pump.fun comes as no surprise. On Jan. 15, Max Burwick, the firm’s founder and partner, openly criticized platforms like Pump.fun, calling them “the ultimate evolution of multi-level marketing scams, preying on human desperation and the digital attention economy.” With impending legal announcements, I want to make my personal position on the exploitation of memecoins widely available. Read it below. Please feel free to share! pic.twitter.com/adndcQNRxH — Max Burwick (@burwick_max) January 15, 2025 That same day, his firm urged investors who lost money to memecoins through rug pulls and misleading promises to come forward, later launching a dedicated website to assist affected clients. Beyond legal troubles, Pump.fun has also faced controversy over its platform features. In November 2024, it introduced a livestream function to boost user engagement. However, reports quickly emerged of users misusing the feature to broadcast disturbing and explicit content, including violent material and graphic footage involving minors and animals. The backlash forced Pump.fun to shut down the feature following widespread condemnation from the crypto community. Despite mounting legal and reputational challenges, Pump.fun continues to generate massive revenue. As of Jan. 31, data from Dune Analytics indicates that the platform’s total earnings are nearing $500 million, with nearly $47 million in revenue collected in the past week alone.",News|Lawsuit|Meme Coin|Solana,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|SOL|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-31 03:33:50

According to Bloomberg, they have met with lawyers and figures connected to Trump’s circle to explore their options. Bankman-Fried, who is also appealing his conviction, argues that his sentence is excessive, especially considering that most FTX customers have managed to recover their funds. This push for clemency follows a trend set by Trump’s previous pardons, including that of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road marketplace. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 for running an online platform Silk Road that facilitated over $200 million in illegal transactions. Trump granted Ulbricht a pardon, citing his libertarian views and the belief that his sentence was excessive. This move has sparked growing support for Ulbricht, particularly within libertarian circles. While Bankman-Fried’s case lacks broad public support, his legal team is pushing for a pardon by leveraging Trump’s history of granting clemency, which has often been based on informal appeals rather than traditional Justice Department channels. Bankman-Fried is not alone in his pursuit; Ryan Salame, another former FTX executive, is also reportedly exploring similar efforts for a pardon. As Trump’s administration has been more open to considering clemency for controversial cases, including Ulbricht’s, the push for a pardon signals a shift in the broader landscape of white-collar criminal justice. However, no formal outreach to the White House regarding Bankman-Fried’s case has been confirmed as of now.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-31 03:40:21

After a period of consolidation, the chart hints at a solid bullish setup t hat has been building in recent days and weeks. The market’s reaction to these support zones suggests the potential for a positive price move ahead. At the time of writing, XRP is trading below $3.10 and is down by more than one percent in the last 24 hours. Current Price Action and Support Levels After a pullback in mid-January, XRP dipped into a support area between $2.52 and $2.68. While the market didn’t immediately breakout upwards, this range remains crucial for determining the next move. As long as the price stays above this support zone, it suggests the market is respecting the current parameters, and a rebound could occur. Key Price Levels to Watch To confirm that the low has been established and wave two is complete, XRP needs to hold its current low (around $2.65). If this level holds, XRP can expect the market to potentially rally towards the $4.20–$5 range. It’s important to note that wave two is a corrective pullback, and experts anticipate a trend continuation after this phase. Critical Breakout Levels For a strong confirmation that the upward trend is resuming, XRP needs to break key resistance levels. The first hurdle is a break above $3.21, followed by a move above $3.40. Until these levels are surpassed, the market remains in a range, and a retest of the support zone between $2.76 and $2.97 is still possible.

Regulators and industry players advocate for the importance of regulation, but we face the stark reality – i t’s nearly impossible to implement effective oversight in this space. Meanwhile, stolen funds continue to be laundered through DeFi tools . How do we balance decentralization with legal obligations? Using oracles becomes an effective solution. Why traditional AML fails in DeFi – security and limitations of smart contracts Traditional AML policies struggle to adapt to the DeFi ecosystem because of a significant limitation. Smart contracts can’t make decisions that require external information, such as passing AML checks. These contracts are limited to the data available on the blockchain they run on. They cannot directly access data from other blockchains or external sources, such as websites or APIs. This is because smart contracts are executed by blockchain nodes, which do not have built-in internet connectivity and can only connect to their own blockchain. This design is intentional to preserve the security and decentralization of the blockchain. Blockchain consensus requires that all data used in a transaction must be recorded on the blockchain before the transaction can be executed. This ensures that the network operates in a trustless and secure manner, with all nodes agreeing on the same information. If smart contracts could connect to the internet, they would introduce security and operational risks. External data – like from websites or APIs – d oesn’t follow blockchain rules, making it possible for manipulated or false data to be fed into the system. Oracles bring additional information to DeFi apps This is where DeFi oracles play a key role. Oracles allow DeFi applications to bring in external data to the blockchain, enabling blockchain transactions to achieve consensus with this off-chain information. This information can include data from an AML platform, such as KYC (know your customer)/KYB (know your business) information, watchlists, blacklists, sanctions lists, transaction monitoring and transaction screening/filtering. The diagram below depicts how the AML oracle for DeFi works. How the DeFi compliance oracle works 1. User interacts with DeFi service Users engage with the DeFi service to perform common financial actions such as depositing, withdrawing, swapping, lending or staking assets. Before processing the transaction, the DeFi service must ensure the transaction complies with AML regulations. 2. DeFi service request to the AML oracle When a user initiates a transaction, the DeFi service requests an AML check for the user’s address and the associated data. The DeFi service communicates with the AML oracle smart contract, asking for the KYC/KYB assessment result and a transaction risk rating or address risk rating. 3. External AML provider monitors the AML oracle requests The external AML provider continuously monitors the AML oracle smart contract for incoming requests from DeFi services. Once the external AML provider detects a request, it begins the AML check based on the specific details provided in the request. 4. External AML provider screens blockchain and off-chain data The external AML provider conducts the AML check by analyzing both on-chain and off-chain data. On-chain data – such as transaction history, wallet addresses and other relevant blockchain activities Off-chain data, including sanction lists, watchlists and internet or deep web sources that contain information about suspicious addresses KYC/KYB data provided by users and linked to their corresponding blockchain addresses 5. AML provider responds After completing the check, the external AML provider writes the result to the blockchain and provides a reference to this data for the AML oracle smart contract. The result typically includes a pass/fail status and a link to more detailed data stored by the AML provider for audit purposes (to save on costly blockchain space). 6. DeFi service acts based on the AML check result Once the AML check result is available on the blockchain, the DeFi service automatically takes action based on its smart contract rules. If the user passes the AML check, the DeFi service proceeds with the transaction (deposit, withdrawal, swap, lending, staking, etc.). If the AML check fails or raises concerns, the DeFi service may halt the transaction or freeze the user’s funds. All of these steps occur as part of an atomic transaction In blockchain, an atomic transaction means that either all the steps in the process succeed or none of them do. This guarantees that no partial or inconsistent state is left, ensuring the integrity and security of the transaction. For example, if a user’s address appears on a sanctions list, the swap transaction would be automatically canceled by the blockchain’s rules – without any need for human intervention. This eliminates the risk of system failure or human error from a compliance officer. To sum up DeFi systems have the potential to integrate effective AML solutions. Achieving this goal will likely require time and effort. So far, oracles can be considered a universal technical solution for AML embodiment in DeFi.

As the PCE inflation data looms for Friday, traders and investors appear to be uncertain about the market’s performance ahead. Simultaneously, BTC traded near the $104K level as of press time, whereas leading altcoins illustrated mixed price actions. Here’s a brief overview encompassing some of the most trending coins for the day and how they are performing intraday. Crypto Market Today Reflects Uncertainty Ahead Of PCE Inflation Data The broader market eagerly awaits the December U.S PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation data, which is set to be released on January 31. Notably, this data remains much eyed by investors as it could pave the way for interest rate changes by the next FOMC. As a result, market participants are uncertain about future performances. In turn, even the global crypto market cap stagnated around the $3.5 trillion mark. Besides, the global market volume plunged by 16% intraday, reaching $105.07 billion. So, let’s delve deeper into the coins’ prices today. Bitcoin Price Briefly Touches $106K BTC price is currently trading at $104,331, down nearly 1% from yesterday. However, the coin briefly touched the $106K mark in its intraday movement while also reaching a low of $103,962. Notably, the volatile price action comes against the backdrop of looming U.S. PCE inflation data. Also, the flagship crypto’s futures OI dropped nearly 2% to $64.91 billion on Friday. Ethereum Price Fluxes Amid Broader Crypto Market Turbulence ETH price saw a marginal 0.5% jump in value over the past day, reaching $3,227. The coin’s 24-hour bottom and peak were $3,179.45 and $3,282.99, respectively. While the coin faces turbulence in tandem with the broader market trend, renowned analyst Ali Martinez spotlighted a highly bullish metric for Ethereum. Intriguingly, whales have heavily purchased the crypto amid its recent price dip, accumulating nearly 100,000 ETH. This massive accumulation underscores rising market confidence in the asset, signaling that potential gains are imminent. Source: Ali Charts, X XRP Price Slips XRP price slipped by nearly 1% in the past 24 hours and is currently resting at $3.09. The coin’s intraday low and high were $3.08 and $3.15, respectively. It’s noteworthy that the asset has consolidated around the $3 mark for quite some time, signaling that a potential breakout looms. Solana Price Today SOL price fell by nearly 2% in the past 24 hours, reaching $235 at the time of reporting. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $235.39 and $244.33, respectively. Solana currently mirrors volatility in sync with the broader market trend. How Is The Meme Coin Market Performing? Simultaneously, Dogecoin (DOGE) price witnessed a 1% dip in value, reaching 0.3272.

Traditional convertible bonds are equity plays with low coupons, but iShares Convertible Bond ETF's performance is heavily influenced by bitcoin prices. The ETF has a high technology sector exposure and political risk through holdings in Alibaba and JD. ICVT offers lower volatility but may underperform if bitcoin prices do not rally, given its holdings in MSTR 0% coupon bonds. Thesis When buying into a convertible securities fund, an investor is usually subject to equity and rates risk factors. The iShares Convertible Bond ETF ( ICVT ) is a bit more complex than that. The fund's stated objective is: The iShares Convertible Bond ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. dollar-denominated convertible securities, specifically cash pay bonds, with outstanding issue sizes greater than $250 million . With the equity market rally in the past year and lower Fed Funds from the central bank, ICVT has done well in the past year, being up almost +13%. However, an investor looking at this name should dig a bit deeper into the details and understand the true risk factors at play. In today's article, we are going to look at the fund holdings and its structuring, and articulate why retail investors need to understand that bitcoin prices play a large role in ICVT's performance, a fact not understood by many. Traditional converts are an equity play usually Going back to the basics, we have to highlight that traditional convertible bonds are mostly an equity play via their very low coupons and convertibles features: Convertible bonds are a type of corporate debt security that can be exchanged for a set number of shares in the issuing company. They are a combination of stocks and bonds, and can be a good way to diversify risk Rates are a secondary risk factor here, with lower rates helping converts funds via the discount factor and valuation. When digging into ICVT though, a third factor emerges: Top Holdings (Fund Website) The largest holding in the fund is a converts issuance from MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), a company considered by many as a leveraged bet on bitcoin. Also, kindly note that Coinbase Global ( COIN ) is also represented in the top names, COIN being also very closely correlated with bitcoin prices. Please note that the 4.4% weighting above for MSTR converts is across a number of issuances, not just one bond: MSTR Holdings (Holdings) There are bonds with a 2027, 2028, 2029 and 2030 maturity here. Let us take an example and do a deeper dive. Large Bitcoin exposure via MSTR and COIN Let us look at the 0% coupon 2029 notes. You can find the announcement for the offering here : The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 1.4872 shares of MicroStrategy's class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $672.40 per share. The initial conversion price of the notes represents a premium of approximately 55% over the U.S. composite volume weighted average price of MicroStrategy's class A common stock from 1:30 p.m. through 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on November 19, 2024, which was $433.7997. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. We have already established that the debt pays 0% coupon. Now, if we look at the terms for the conversion, we will see the initial conversion price of $672/share. Today, MSTR is trading at $346/share, therefore below the price of the company when it placed the debt. Kindly note the close correlation between MSTR and bitcoin. If bitcoin fails to rally from here until maturity date, the conversion feature will not be attractive, thus leaving investors getting just their principal back and nothing else. MSTR is not an operating company that makes widgets. MSTR is a financial entity that raises capital and purchases bitcoin with said cash. Converts are a more conservative way to bet on bitcoin since they represent debt, and debt has to be repaid in a principal format if the conversion price does not make sense. However, investors need to understand that the upside here for ICVT in its MSTR position lies squarely with bitcoin prices. COIN is a similar story, but COIN is less volatile and leveraged: Data by YCharts If we plot COIN, MSTR and bitcoin on the same graph (we are using the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF - IBIT as a bitcoin proxy) we can see the almost one for one correlation between COIN and bitcoin, while MSTR is very leveraged. Technology exposure The fund has a high exposure to the technology sector, a sleeve where COIN and MSTR reside: Sectors (Fund Website) We have just shown you how in fact MSTR and COIN converts are bitcoin plays. The rest of the holdings are more traditional tech companies, but the fund does hold political risk exposure as well via its Alibaba ( BABA ) and JD ( JD ) holdings. Historic performance Converts do not have the full equity delta of an equities only fund, thus lag indices over longer periods of time: Data by YCharts We can see the fund outperforming only during the zero rates environment that characterized 2020/2021 which helped both the equity and bond component. In a higher rates environment like today's funds like ICVT tend to lag indices. On the flip side, they also have a lower volatility due to their composition. Unless the underlying company defaults, the ETF will get the principal back on the convert. This translates into a 3-year standard deviation of 12%, much lower than the 18% one on the S&P 500 index. Conclusion ICVT is a convertibles bond ETF. The name tends to do best when equities rally and rates move lower. The fund comes with a lower volatility of as measured by its 12% 3-year standard deviation, but currently contains a large exposure to bitcoin related companies. The article shows how MSTR and COIN are bitcoin plays, and the ETF contains 5% of exposure to the names combined. If bitcoin fails to rally significantly from here, these bonds will not generate much of a return, especially since a large proportion have a 0% coupon. Retail investors looking at the ETF need to fully understand the risk drivers behind this fund.",MSTR|COIN|ICVT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-31 04:59:14

The asset has surged over 5% in the past day, pushing its market capitalization and daily trading volume higher. This recent movement has narrowed the gap between Ethereum’s current price and its all-time high to just 33%, giving investors reasons to pay closer attention. Various analysts have weighed in on the potential implications of this price action, offering a mix of short- and long-term outlooks. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Prolonged Consolidation: What Is Really Going On? Analyst Weighs In Analysts Discuss Key Levels and Future Targets Elite, a well-known crypto analyst, pointed out that Ethereum’s resilience came in the face of “hawkish signals” from the Federal Reserve. The analyst wrote: Despite the Fed’s hawkish signals yesterday, ETH broke past the $3,200 mark, showing impressive resilience. But that’s not all—on-chain activity is soaring. According to IntoTheBlock data, active Ethereum addresses have increased by 37% over the last few months, reaching 670,000—significantly surpassing the 400,000 level seen in early 2024. This sharp rise in network activity is viewed by some as an indication of growing demand and renewed bullish momentum as the new year unfolds. Several other analysts have also shared their perspectives on Ethereum’s price trajectory. WorldofCharts highlighted the cryptocurrency’s consolidation within a tight range, forming a bullish pennant. He suggested that a successful breakout from this pattern could propel Ethereum toward the $4,000 resistance area. This ascending triangle level, previously outlined in his analysis, may serve as a critical milestone for the asset’s upward trajectory. $Eth #Eth Consolidating Within Tight Range Of Bullish Pennant, Expecting Upside Breakout Soon, Incase Of Successful Breakout Ethereum Can Target 4000$ Area Ascending Triangle Resistance Area “Which I Shared Recently” https://t.co/Gq5sYBiKfA pic.twitter.com/B36VRnN9Qm — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) January 30, 2025 Ethereum On The Path To A $9,000 Rally? Another prominent analyst, Ted, emphasized that Ethereum’s higher lows on longer timeframes signal a strengthening bullish structure. He identified the $4,000 level as pivotal, predicting that its recovery could open the door to a new all-time high. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Struggles Against Resistance: A Tough Road Ahead Ted went even further, forecasting that Ethereum could reach $9,000 to $10,000 within the next three to four months if these bullish conditions persist. This optimism is supported by growing on-chain activity and sustained investor interest. Ethereum is forming higher lows on the longer timeframe. $4K remains the most crucial level, and the reclaim of that will send $ETH to new ATH. Once that happens, I’m expecting Ethereum to hit $9K-$10K within 3-4 months.

January 30 th is the next key date that the market is closely watching, and it could dictate the short-term future of XRP. At the same time, NovaDEX, a Solana-based high-performance DEX could gain more whale attention with its robust staking pool and yield farming tools. Just recently, NovaDEX’s mainnet went live and it already reached several important milestones. Below, we’ll check out all the latest details on both platforms. XRP News Today: SEC Appeal Strategy and Its Ripple Effects on XRP-Spot ETFs On January 23, the SEC held a closed meeting on enforcement cases, including Ripple’s. With Mark Uyeda as acting Chair, known for opposing non-fraud enforcement, a shift in priorities is possible. A withdrawal of the SEC’s appeal requires a quorum vote, and the recent rollback of SAB 121 suggests procedural changes. The next closed meeting on January 30 may offer clarity on legal settlements and enforcement actions. If the SEC drops its appeal, it could open the door for XRP-spot ETF approvals, a highly anticipated move. Meanwhile, XRP’s RSI at 65 indicates room for further gains before hitting overbought levels. NovaDEX Might be a Promising New Decentralized Exchange with Potential DeFi Innovations and Tools NovaDEX , a recently launched decentralized exchange (DEX), might introduce several exciting features to its users, including concentrated liquidity pools, yield farming opportunities, and staking options. Since its mainnet launch, the platform has shown encouraging signs of adoption, with over 85,000 transactions reported across various activities. Early traction is evident, with approximately 1,900 users engaging with the platform. This initial growth could signal increasing interest in NovaDEX’s offerings and its potential role within the broader DeFi ecosystem. What might differentiate NovaDEX is its permissionless pool model, which could allow users to create liquidity pools for any supported token. This flexibility could provide users with more options compared to traditional DEX platforms. Additionally, NovaDEX may offer competitive rates, including lower slippage and potentially higher APRs, which could make it an attractive option for liquidity providers seeking passive opportunities. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, the platform might simplify complex DeFi activities like token swapping, liquidity provision, and yield farming. This ease of use could appeal to both seasoned users and those new to decentralized finance. NovaDEX Could Create a Community-Driven Trading Ecosystem NovaDEX wants to embrace a decentralized governance model, potentially enabling its community members to play an active role in shaping the platform’s future. This approach could empower users to participate in key decisions and contribute to the project’s growth. Security seems to be a top priority for NovaDEX. The platform has completed a smart contract audit through QuillAudits, which helps ensure the safety of user assets and build trust in its community. NVX might serve as a central element, granting access to various features and benefits within the protocol. NVX has already reached significant milestones, including listings on established centralized exchanges like MEXC and decentralized platforms such as Raydium and Jupiter. The Takeaway While XRP awaits the SEC appeal and next regulatory steps, new projects could step in and start gaining traction. One project that may be particularly interesting is NovaDEX . This DEX platform has already reached some important milestones and could generate substantial buzz in the upcoming weeks with its robust tools. —- This article is not financial advice.

Tether ( USDT ), the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, has announced its integration with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ecosystem, marking a new step in the stablecoin’s expansion beyond traditional blockchain networks. Revealed on Jan. 30 at the Plan B conference in El Salvador, the move will bring USDT to both Bitcoin’s base layer and its high-speed Lightning Network , unlocking new possibilities for remittances, payments, and everyday transactions. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino described the initiative as a push toward real-world financial applications, stating that the goal is to offer “practical solutions for remittances, payments, and other financial applications that demand both speed and reliability.” Meanwhile, Elizabeth Stark, CEO of Lightning Labs, stressed the broader impact, saying, “Millions of people will now be able to use the most open, secure blockchain to send dollars globally. It all comes back to Bitcoin.” The key to making this possible is Taproot Assets, a protocol developed by Lightning Labs that enables asset issuances on Bitcoin’s base layer while allowing transactions to be settled on the Lightning Network. Released in 2023, Taproot Assets effectively bridges stablecoins and other digital assets into Bitcoin’s infrastructure, making micropayments more efficient and reducing transaction costs. Once fully integrated, USDT will function seamlessly across Bitcoin’s main chain and its Lightning-powered layer 2 network, combining Bitcoin’s security with Lightning’s near-instant transaction speeds. Stablecoins have grown into a $220 billion asset class, with USDT dominating the sector. As of Jan. 30, USDT has a market capitalization of $139.4 billion, nearly three times that of its closest competitor, Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ), which stands at $53.1 billion. In 2024 alone, USDT processed over $10 trillion in on-chain volume, rapidly approaching Visa’s annual payment volume of $16 trillion. Tether’s latest announcement follows its recent relocation to El Salvador, the only country where Bitcoin holds legal tender status. However, in a parallel development, El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly amended its Bitcoin Law on Jan. 30, reversing the mandatory acceptance of Bitcoin and making it optional for merchants. The change aligns with International Monetary Fund conditions for a $1.4 billion loan to support the country’s economy.",News|El Salvador|Lightning Network|Stablecoin|Tether,EN,0,0,USDT|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-31 05:05:13

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.950 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it trades below the $0.9350 support zone. Cardano Price Turns Red After struggling to stay above the $1.00 level, Cardano started a fresh decline unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.9650 and $0.950 support levels. There was a clear move below the $0.950 support zone. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.950 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The pair even traded below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.9007 swing low to the $0.9881 high. Cardano price is now trading below $0.950 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.950 zone. The first resistance is near $0.9650. The next key resistance might be $0.9880. If there is a close above the $0.9880 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.00 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.050 in the near term. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.950 resistance level, it could start another decline.

The lawsuit claims that all tokens are created on Pump. fun’s platform qualifies as securities, and the company has raked in nearly $500 million in fees by enabling users to launch memecoins . Filed in the Southern District of New York, the case brings up the ongoing debate of when a token is considered a security. Legal Battle Heats Up The lead plaintiff, Diego Aguilar, alleges he suffered financial losses trading Pump. fun-created tokens FWOG, FRED, and GRIFFAIN. Although Pump.fun doesn’t directly create tokens, the lawsuit argues that by providing an automated launchpad for memecoins, the company acts as a “joint issuer.” The suit targets the U.K.-registered Baton Corporation, believed to operate Pump.fun, along with its co-founders. Protecting the investor interest, Burwick Law and Wolf Pepper LLP jointly filed a lawsuit against the platform for harming investors with memecoin scams and broken promises. The firm says it has been working with people who lost money due to rug pulls and fraud. It also criticized Pump.fun for making hundreds of millions in fees while allowing harmful and offensive content on its platform. However, an X user in his post shared his thoughts on the securities controversy, known as Apate pointing out that memecoins were explicitly excluded from being classified as securities under the 1987 Securities Exchange Act amendment. He also highlights that the SEC lost a similar case in 2019 involving Dogecoin derivatives, suggesting a tough legal road ahead for regulators trying to label memecoins as securities. According to the 1987 Securities Exchange Act amendment, memecoins were explicitly excluded from securities classification. The SEC lost a similar case in 2019 against DogeCoin derivatives — Apate (@ApateAI) January 31, 2025 Not Their First Lawsuit This isn’t the first legal battle for Pump.fun. The same law firm, Wolf Popper LLP, previously sued the company over the PNUT token , which once hit a $1 billion market cap but has since plummeted by 89%. Another suit targeted the HAWK token, associated with influencer Hailey Welch. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News: Bankman-Fried’s Family Seeks Trump Pardon After Ulbricht’s Release , Market sentiment Despite the controversy and lawsuits, memecoins have seen massive growth in early 2025. A clear sign of this is Pump.fun’s record transaction volume, surpassing even major networks like Solana and Ethereum. In the past month, Pump.fun made $116.72 million in revenue, beating Solana’s $116.46 million and Ethereum’s $107.64 million. In just 24 hours, trading volume hit $295.53 million, with fees soaring to $1.45 billion. Regulatory Challenges Loom Pump.fun has faced scrutiny since its launch, including a warning from the U.K. financial regulator and criticism for its now-disabled livestream feature, which some users misused. Meanwhile, the SEC under the Trump administration is shifting its approach to crypto regulation , which might change the crypto game for violators. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

If things keep going this way, the crypto giant may be one of the top picks for those seeking stable returns this year. Meanwhile, a new PayFi project has been highlighted as a standout for 2025, positioned perfectly to ride the growth of the global payments sector. Having rapidly surpassed $10 million in its presale, Remittix is transforming how we view global payments by blending blockchain’s efficiency with the trustworthiness of traditional finance. So what sets Remittix apart from other projects, and how far could Bitcoin go in 2025? Bitcoin Posts Steady Gains Bitcoin has been on a tear recently, passing $100,000 in December and hitting an ATH of $109,588 on the 20th January. This major uptick has been widely attributed to institutional players jumping on board. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink even said that if major funds allocated 2-5% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, prices could shoot up to $700,000. Traders have been eyeing the next big move as bitcoin remains above $100,000. The recent dip below this level had some holders sweating, but it bounced back relatively quickly. Looking forward, the future looks bright for Bitcoin. U.S. approval of Bitcoin ETFs has primed Bitcoin for more mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, central banks including the Czech National Bank are also adding Bitcoin to their reserves. Remittix Sets a New Benchmark for Global Payments Remittix (RTX) lets users change more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and send money to worldwide bank accounts within 24 hours. Without long processing times, hidden fees or accessibility issues, Remittix (RTX) is an optimal choice for businesses or individual needs who want to be able to transact internationally without high costs. The Remittix Pay API is more than a nifty piece of technology. It stands out as an indispensable tool for businesses. Using the API, companies can accept cryptocurrency payments and settle them in fiat, with funds transferred directly to a designated bank account. By supporting over 30 fiat currencies and 50 cryptocurrency pairs, the API offers the flexibility that businesses need to integrate cryptocurrency without worrying about market fluctuations or complex setups. Remittix’s (RTX) design also has a strong focus on privacy and security. Transactions through the platform are delivered to recipients as standard bank transfers, concealing any connection to cryptocurrency origins. This discreet process has gained traction among users who value privacy in their financial dealings while exploring blockchain technology. Another central goal for Remittix is promoting global financial inclusion. Its 24/7 platform exists independently of traditional banking infrastructure, a lifeline for those who do not have access to global financial systems. Breaking down barriers, Remittix is reaching underbanked populations worldwide, and democratizing cross-border payments. Remittix Presale Flys High, Surpassing $10 Million In just a matter of weeks, Remittix’s presale has already surpassed $10 million raised. At the current stage, tokens are up for grabs for just $0.0498, and analysts project an 800% increase in value during the presale phase, followed by a huge rally post-launch. As Remittix (RTX) positions itself to disrupt the cross-border payments industry, it is gearing up for a big year in 2025.

The upgrade went live yesterday after attaining 91.43% validator consensus. Source – xrpscan The modifications will allow the creation of AMM pools for stablecoin RLSUD. The development remains crucial as it will likely enhance liquidity for the remittance token while enriching trading opportunities within the XRPL DEX. What the amendment means Automated Market Makers are vital in decentralized finance (DeFi) for individuals to trade without old-style order books. The XRP Ledger unveiled the AMM feature in March 2024, allowing liquidity providers to earn rewards on selected pools. Meanwhile, specific limits hindered Ripple’s stablecoin from participating in the Automated Market Maker pools. The restriction arose from the clawback functionality. The feature allows token issuers to recover tokens in scenarios involving criminal activities, regulatory obstacles, or dealings with sanctioned players. The clawback functionality went live early in 2024. Vet @Vet_X0 · Follow The XRP Ledger Clawback Amendment is now activated and usable ! 8:34 pm · 8 Feb 2024 824 Reply Copy link Read 39 replies Meanwhile, XRPL’s policies banned assets like Ripple stablecoin (as they boast the feature), excluding them from AMM pools. That restricted RLUSD holders from trading within the XRP Ledger DEX and capitalizing on automated liquidity provision incentives. The XRPL community launched the XLS-73d amendment to resolve the issue. The improvement changes how clawback-enables assets interact with the Automated Market Maker pools. The proposal witnessed massive support from validators, with votes well beyond the approval threshold of 80%. Meanwhile, the AMMClawback upgrade went live as Ripple’s stablecoin attained a crucial growth milestone. Ripple USD exceeds $100M market cap Ripple’s official, Jack McDonald, confirmed impressive growth for RLUSD. The product topped the $100 million market cap “a little over a month” after its launch. Jack McDonald @_JackMcDonald_ · Follow A little over a month since $RLUSD’s launch, we’ve seen amazing traction hitting ~$100M in market cap. As previously committed, we’ll be publishing a monthly independent attestation for RLUSD, in compliance with the highest regulatory standards.A few points to keep in mind:… 8:38 pm · 30 Jan 2025 851 Reply Copy link Read 27 replies McDonald clarified that the stablecoin remains over-reserved. That means Ripple’s reserves surpass the RLSUD’s total supply. We currently hold $6M more in reserves than the total RLUSD supply. Ripple strictly maintains reserves of highly liquid, low-risk assets to ensure our ability to fully meet redemptions. BitGo’s Brett Reeves predicted an increase in stablecoin adoption this year , citing global regulatory shifts. XRP price outlook Ripple’s native token trades at $3.09 after recovering from Monday’s low of $2.74. The daily chart indicates bearishness as XRP dipped from the daily peak of $3.15. Chart by Coinmarketcap The declined trading volume signals faded interest, suggesting more dips for XRP before potential rebounds. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Armando Pantoja expects a massive move for the remittance coin. Armando Pantoja @_TallGuyTycoon · Follow $XRP is about to explode! Charts say we are about to hit $3.85 soon. Resistance at $3.13 and $3.15. If XRP breaks these levels we’ll be at $3.85 next then on to $8.If not, Brace for a drop.

That will magnify optimism in the altcoin, motivating bulls to push towards the historic high of $8. However, Pantoja warned about potential retracement that might take XRP back to the $3 psychological mark. Losing this barrier could catalyze further declines to $2.85.

The company recently announced the integration of its USDT stablecoin with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, aiming to improve transaction efficiency and expand payment options. At the same time, European regulations under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework are prompting exchanges like Crypto.com and Coinbase to delist USDT, raising questions about stablecoin accessibility in the region. Tether Expands USDT to Bitcoin Network via Lightning Integration, Enhancing Global Payments Tether has announced its expansion onto Bitcoin through the Lightning Network, leveraging the Taproot Assets protocol. The announcement was made by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino and Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark at the Bitcoin-focused Plan B conference in San Salvador, El Salvador, on Jan. 30. Tether , the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, is set to integrate with Bitcoin’s Layer 2 scaling solution, the Lightning Network. This initiative, powered by Lightning Labs, is designed to facilitate faster and more cost-efficient transactions, broadening the accessibility of stablecoin payments worldwide. The integration uses the Taproot Assets protocol, an upgrade introduced in 2022 to enhance Bitcoin’s ability to support tokenized assets. As of now, USDT boasts a market capitalization of $139.4 billion, significantly surpassing its closest competitor, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), which stands at $53.1 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Tether also dominates the stablecoin market by processing a staggering $10 trillion in transactions in 2024 alone, placing it in close competition with traditional financial giants like Visa, which handled $16 trillion over the same period. One of the key benefits of this integration is the potential for seamless merchant adoption. Businesses that already accept Bitcoin via the Lightning Network will be able to integrate USDT as a payment method using the same infrastructure. This could significantly increase the adoption of stablecoin payments, especially in regions where volatility in local currencies drives demand for dollar-pegged alternatives. “Millions of people will now be able to use the most open, secure blockchain to send dollars globally,” Stark noted, emphasizing the role of stablecoins in providing financial stability to emerging markets. Furthermore, Lightning Labs envisions a future where AI-driven transactions and autonomous vehicles benefit from the enhanced efficiency of micropayments facilitated by USDT over Lightning. This development aligns with the broader trend of blockchain technology intersecting with emerging digital economies. Strategic Move Amid El Salvador’s Bitcoin Push This announcement follows Tether’s recent decision to relocate its headquarters to El Salvador, the first and only country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. The move signals Tether’s commitment to supporting Bitcoin adoption and advancing financial innovation in the region. El Salvador introduced the Lightning Network-powered Chivo Wallet in September 2021, aiming to promote Bitcoin usage among its citizens. However, the adoption has faced challenges, with mixed reactions from the public. Initially, the government mandated that merchants accept Bitcoin, but recent agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have led to a shift toward voluntary acceptance. The integration of USDT into the Lightning Network marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of Bitcoin’s utility beyond just a store of value. With faster transactions and reduced costs, Bitcoin’s infrastructure becomes more attractive for stablecoin-based payments, furthering the potential for global remittances, merchant adoption, and decentralized financial interactions. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, the partnership between Tether and Lightning Labs could be a catalyst for increased institutional interest and mainstream adoption. Whether this integration will drive mass adoption remains to be seen, but it undeniably represents a significant stride toward a more interconnected and efficient digital payment ecosystem. Tether Responds to MiCA Regulations as European Exchanges Prepare to Delist USDT In related news, the European cryptocurrency market is undergoing a significant transformation as exchanges prepare to delist Tether’s USDT stablecoin in response to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The new regulatory environment is forcing major platforms, including Crypto.com and Coinbase, to reassess their stablecoin offerings, raising concerns over potential market disruptions. Tether has voiced its concerns over the impact of MiCA on the European cryptocurrency sector, particularly regarding the delisting of its flagship stablecoin, USDT. Crypto.com confirmed on Jan. 29 that it will begin delisting USDT along with nine other tokens on Jan. 31 to comply with MiCA regulations. “It is disappointing to see the rushed actions brought on by statements which do little to clarify the basis for such moves,” a spokesperson for Tether said. Tether warned that the MiCA-triggered changes could create a “disorderly” market, particularly as the framework is still in its early stages. The company emphasized that these developments extend beyond USDT, affecting multiple tokens across the EU market. “These changes affect many tokens in the EU market, not only USDT, and we fear that such actions will lead to further risk being placed on consumers in the EU,” Tether’s representative said. The implications of MiCA regulations extend beyond Tether , as multiple exchanges are adjusting their token offerings. Crypto.com’s delisting efforts will impact a total of ten tokens, including Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Dai (DAI). Coinbase also delisted USDT in December 2024 as part of its compliance measures and confirmed on Jan. 30 that it had removed eight tokens to align with MiCA regulations. “We regularly review the assets we make available to customers on our platform to ensure we are meeting regulatory requirements and will assess re-enabling services for stablecoins that achieve MiCA compliance on a later date,” a Coinbase representative stated. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has been actively pushing crypto asset service providers (CASPs) to restrict non-MiCA-compliant stablecoins. While exchanges can still offer these tokens in sell mode until March 31, they must fully restrict non-compliant stablecoins by the end of Q1 2025. Tether’s Strategy Amid MiCA Implementation Tether is finalizing its European strategy to ensure compliance while continuing to introduce innovative technologies. Despite its criticisms of MiCA’s complexity, the company acknowledged the EU’s regulatory efforts in structuring the crypto industry. “As we have consistently expressed, some aspects of MiCA make the operation of EU-licensed stablecoins more complex and potentially introduce new risks,” Tether stated. Tether also noted that the USD stablecoin market in Europe is relatively small compared to its widespread adoption in emerging markets. The company emphasized that MiCA should take into account the different use cases of stablecoins globally. The firm reaffirmed its commitment to compliance and innovation, highlighting its ongoing investment in projects such as Hadron and Quantor, both designed to be MiCA-compliant. As the deadline for MiCA compliance approaches, the European cryptocurrency market is at a crossroads. While regulators seek to establish a structured framework, concerns persist over the potential consequences of abrupt regulatory enforcement. Tether’s response shows the tension between regulatory clarity and market stability, emphasizing the need for balanced measures that promote innovation without disrupting financial ecosystems. Whether MiCA will ultimately foster a more secure and regulated stablecoin market in the EU remains to be seen. For now, the crypto industry is navigating uncharted waters, with stablecoin issuers and exchanges adapting to the new regulatory landscape.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,USDT|BTC|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-31 05:30:00

The commission remarked, “In particular, the Commission finds that the Proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the Exchange’s rules be designed to ‘prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and, ‘in general, to protect investors and the public interest.” Bitwise’s new ETF could start trading soon if the S-1 form is approved On November 26, 2024, the NYSE Arca submitted a 19B-4 form on Bitwise’s combined Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund. On Thursday, the commission approved the filing, saying the ETF application complied with the Exchange Act, particularly Section 6(b)(5) and Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(iii). However, the regulatory agency has yet to approve the S-1 form for the Bitwise fund, which is necessary for trading to commence. According to Bitwise, once fully approved, the ETF Trust will hold both spot Bitcoin and spot ether. The trust will also “provide exposure” to the value of Bitcoin and Ether to investors. Moreover, the Trust’s asset allocation to Bitcoin and Ether will be based on the tokens’ respective market capitalizations in accordance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. On each Exchange trading day, the Administrator will also determine the Trust’s NAV and NAV per Share at 4:00 p.m. ET or at the earliest feasible time thereafter. Several crypto corporations have filed registration forms with the SEC for crypto ETFs With an expected change in crypto regulations under Trump’s administration, several crypto exchanges have filed for the approval of new crypto products. Since late November, the SEC has received multiple exchange-traded fund applications for various assets, including XRP, Solana, and Litecoin. For starters, VanEck and ProShares submitted registration forms for Litecoin, XRP, and Solana’s ETFs. Bitwise even proposed having a Dogecoin ETF, which would be interesting to see given Dogecoin is a meme coin whose value is heavily influenced by social media. Furthermore, Coinbase Derivatives, a subsidiary of the largest US crypto exchange, filed to list new futures contacts for Solana and Hedera. If the subsidiary gets its Solana Futures approved, it will have a contract size of 100 SOL. The SEC has so far approved filings from Nasdaq and the Cboe BZX Exchange to trade shares of crypto index ETFs from Hashdex and Franklin Templeton, respectively, in December 2024. Both ETFs will first hold spot Bitcoin and Ether on a market cap-weighted basis before including other crypto assets. At the time, the ETF Store President Nate Geraci wondered if other crypto corporations would join and launch similar products, pointing out that there would be high demand for such funds.

The proposed ETF would continue to hold XRP as its primary asset and track its performance on a price return basis, adjusted for operational fees, providing investors with a direct link to XRP's performance. Besides Grayscale, firms like CoinShares and Bitwise have also submitted applications for XRP-based ETFs, indicating a growing institutional appetite for structured investment products in XRP. Earlier in January, Ripple Labs president Monica Long remarked an XRP ETF could “soon be a reality” under the new Trump administration, one that has promised to bring crypto innovation back to the U.S. and support locally-based businesses. Meanwhile, trading volumes on XRP-native applications have been on the rise as it gains favor among investors. Swap volumes on XRP Ledger’s decentralized exchange (DEX) crossed the $400 million mark in January to cross the $1 billion mark for the first time since its automated market maker feature launched in May — a feat that some say contributed to making 2024 a “monumental” year for the token .",Markets,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-31 05:44:22

Recent developments suggest that the resolution of this case could be closer than expected, with some pointing to key signs indicating a possible outcome. One factor intensifying speculation is the revelation that Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has had direct discussions with President Donald Trump regarding XRP as a potential U.S. national digital asset reserve. While the idea of XRP becoming a national reserve asset remains uncertain, the fact that such discussions are happening is seen as a major development. The recent removal of the Ripple case from the SEC’s website is also being widely discussed. While this move has sparked rumors about an imminent settlement, experts warn against reading too much into it. Sherrie, a well-known expert in the XRP community, said that the SEC didn’t move the case; it’s actually been concluded and is now listed under Award Claims. Once the case was appealed, it received a new case number and can be found on the Court of Appeals website. When a user enquired about why acting Chairman Mark Uyeda has not yet dropped the case, she explained that it would be unusual for an acting SEC Chair to drop a high-profile case like Ripple’s. Normally, these big cases are handled by the official Chairman “It would be unusual for an Acting Chair to take such a liberty as to drop a high profile case such as Ripple’s. Generally these big cases are dealt with by the actual Chairman.

Market analysts are hopeful that this would significantly expand Bitcoin ecosystem, increase BTC Layer 2 adoption, and expand stablecoin utility. Furthermore, it could also put an end to ongoing discussions regarding the Tether USDT black swan event. Tether USDT Bitcoin Lightning Network Integration Is A Chess Move Amid talks of Tether’s regulatory challenges and concerns about a black swan event, the stablecoin firm made a huge announcement by integrating USDT into the Bitcoin ecosystem. In its announcement, Lightning Labs noted : “With the security and decentralization of bitcoin and the speed and scalability of Lightning, USDT will bring hundreds of millions of users and trillions in volume. It all comes back to Bitcoin”. Will Bitcoin Layer-2 Adoption Explode With Tether’s USDT? With the Tether USDT integration into the Bitcoin ecosystem, the firm will leverage the Taproot-powered Taproot Assets protocol developed by Lightning Labs. This move combines Bitcoin’s unmatched decentralization and security with the speed and scalability of the Lightning Network. Furthermore, the integration will allow USDT to operate seamlessly on Bitcoin’s base layer and its Layer 2 Lightning Network, enabling high-speed, low-cost transactions. This could be a game-changer in expanding Bitcoin’s Layer-2 capabilities thereby eating into the market share of giants like Ethereum. Furthermore, market analysts believe that the Bitcoin Lightning Network can play a crucial role in powering artificial intelligence (AI) agents. These agents will play a crucial as a medium of exchange for BTC. Very interesting prediction that #LightningNetwork will become the medium of exchange network for AI agents. — Caitlin Long (@CaitlinLong_) January 30, 2025 Expanding BTC Utility in Payments The Tether USDT integration aims to redefine stablecoin use cases within the Bitcoin ecosystem, providing a more scalable, secure, and reliable payment infrastructure. As Bitcoin gains traction among institutions and retail traders, the integration of USDT solidifies its role as a cornerstone of Bitcoin-based financial systems. Additionally, by leveraging Taproot assets, Bitcoin’s functionality will expand by supporting tokenized assets like USDT while preserving its decentralized integrity. It will facilitate a scalable and seamless payment solution while allowing microtransactions, remittances, and streamlined cross-border settlements. This makes things clear that stablecoins will take the lead from here while putting CBDCs in the back seat. Previous reports suggest that the US CBDC Digital Dollar could likely face a ban in the Donald Trump Administration. Black Swan Event Chances Shrink Tether USDT has always been under the scrutiny of regulations with concerns about whether it has enough USD reserves to support its USDT in circulation. However, the stablecoin firm has proved critics wrong time and again by showing how it manages its reserves. Furthermore, it’s among the largest holders of US treasuries, much higher than that of Germany. Last year Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that Tether could be subject to regulatory heat in the US, which could lead to a devastating effect on the crypto ecosystem. This has led to a long-term beef between Tether executives and Garlinghouse over the past few months. Despite this Tether has been facing a tough time in Europe recently, with top exchanges like Crypto.com delisting USDT stablecoin as MiCA regulatory framework kicks in. As a result, the firm also decided to move to El Salvador due to its crypto-friendly policies.

BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, changed hands near $104,400 at press time. Bitcoin prices are just 4.7% short of setting a new lifetime high, according to CoinDesk data. President Trump's reiteration of the tariffs threat looks to have clipped BTC's wings. While some fear an extended sell-off before the next big bullish wave unfolds, action in the onchain derivatives market suggests otherwise. ""While some crypto leaders are betting on BTC to fall before rallying towards $250K later this year, the Derive.xyz market remains skeptical. In fact, there’s a 9.7% chance of BTC falling below $75K before March and an even less likely 4.4% chance that it will swing over $250K before September 26,"" Nick Forster, founder at the leading decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform Derive.xyz , told CoinDesk. Flows on Deribit and the CME remain bullish as momentum looks to be building for state-level BTC reserves in the U.S. That said, gold, a traditional safe haven, and tokens tied to gold are on the rise, and the latest uptick in Tokyo inflation supports the bullish case in the anti-risk yen. Gold hits lifetime high Gold rose to a record high of $2,799 per ounce early Friday, taking the month-to-date gain to 6.5%. The lifetime high comes as participants in the London bullion market rush to borrow the yellow metal from central banks, motivated by reports of heightened gold deliveries to the U.S. The flurry of activity is reportedly driven by worries over possible import tariffs, according to Reuters . According to Blokland Smart Multi-Asset Fund's Founder, Jeroen Blokland, gold's rally to record highs against major fiat currencies hints at currency debasement . The intentional devaluation of paper money could also source demand for alternative investments like cryptocurrencies. Gold-backed tokens are already drawing strength from the XAU price rise, although they continue to trade at a discount to the yellow metal. Tether gold (XAUT) rose to its lifetime high of $2,796 on Bitfinex early today, TradingView data show. Meanwhile, PAXG also teased a move to record highs above $2,800. Tokyo inflation surges, AUD/JPY looks south Consumer inflation in Tokyo, which tends to lead nationwide trends, sped up slightly in January, government data showed . Notably, the core figure, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, rose 2.5% in January from a year earlier, compared with the 2.4% increase seen in December. The fastest annual increase is conducive to more Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate hikes and yen strength. Last week, the central bank raised the policy rate to 0.5%, the highest in over 16 years. A potential surge in the yen could destabilize riskier assets, as seen in August of last year. AUD/JPY, the FX market's risk barometer, has dived out of a consolidation pattern, hinting at more losses and broad-based risk-off ahead.",Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Xaut|Paxg|Tokyo|Inflation,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XAUT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-31 06:00:12

Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, both professors at Stanford Law School and part of FTX’s inner circle, are reportedly engaging with individuals connected to Trump's inner circle, according to the report. In recent weeks SBF's parents have tried to engage with the Trump administration to discuss potential clemency for their 32-year-old son, who was handed a 25-year prison sentence after being convicted of fraud. The specifics of whether direct communications with the White House have occurred remain unclear, per Bloomberg . The appeal for a pardon leans on Trump's recent history of using his clemency powers to free widely-supported individuals, such as Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Unlike Ulbricht, however, Bankman-Fried lacks widespread public support, though he argues his sentence is excessively harsh, especially since most FTX customers have recovered their financial losses. Bankman-Fried's FTX, formerly the world's third largest crypto exchange, went bust in November 2022 after a CoinDesk scoop said the platform's sister concern, Alameda Research, was on shaky financial footing. It was later found that Alameda used backdoor code to raid billions in customer funds from FTX — an arrangement helmed by Bankman-Fried and other Alameda founding members. The once-crypto titan has since been sentenced to 25 years in prison and ordered to forfeit $11 billion after getting convicted of seven counts of fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering.",Policy,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-31 06:02:33

Indonesia is currently ranked as the third-highest country in terms of crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis . Less than 8% of the population is said to hold crypto, according to the latest data. Not only that, Indonesia is also currently at a transition phase when it comes to its crypto industry, with regulatory supervision being transferred to the FSA from its Commodity Futures Trading Agency. Mohammed AlKaff AlHashmi, co-founder of HAQQ Network, a layer1 permissionless blockchain that prides itself in implementing a system that is fully compliant with the Sharia laws, told crypto.news that just last week, Indonesian regulators gave the HAQQ Network’s coin, the Islamic Coin or ISLM, the stamp of approval. The token is already available on local Indonesian crypto exchange, Indodax. “If I’m successful in Indonesia and my protocol is accepted, I will be everywhere in the world. If my blockchain, coin or smart contracts are mostly adopted in Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim country in the world. I will have no barrier to enter other Muslim countries,” he explained. This is because AlHashmi believes that Indonesia will soon grow into the largest crypto hub in Asia.

Speaking from experience, he also highlights the smooth process his team went through in order to get regulatory approval from Indonesia’s Commodity Futures Trading Agency. The process was detailed, but it was quicker compared to other countries. “First their knowledge and background in terms of Technology especially web 3 they’re very knowledgeable and people in their team have a very good background and history before they joined,” said AlHashmi. “Also I would say their regulations are flexible enough to enable project owners to do good business to protect the community as well,” he added. AlHashmi and the HAQQ network team are currently in talks with the Indonesian FSA regarding their approval status, as the financial watchdog is poised to takeover crypto asset oversight from Commodity Futures Trading Agency. “When we look at Indonesia as a market, I would say it is incomparable. It can be number one to be honest. Because I have seen statistics of growth happening in a very big volume. The volume of trade, transactions and users, I think Indonesia can be very soon one of the top 3 countries in the world.” Mohammed AlKaff AlHashmi, co-founder of HAQQ Network Untapped potential in Indonesia’s unbanked According to the Indonesia Embedded Finance Business Report 2024-2029, around 74% of the population is unbanked or underbanked. This means a majority of Indonesian do not have access to traditional banking services. AlHashmi sees this 74% as an untapped market that could truly benefit from using the decentralized blockchain, especially one that implements a system that is compliant to Islamic laws. Considering Indonesia has the largest population of Muslims worldwide with roughly 241.5 million, based on 2022 data, a lot of its citizens are skeptical of traditional banking systems due to religious reasons. Although some banks do offer Shariah-specific services, not all of them are easily accessible to the public. Islamic financing is based on Sharia principles that emphasize justice, transparency, and social welfare. One of its main principles is the prohibition of charging or paying interest. You might also like: More than 60% of Indonesian youths invest in crypto: report “We have something unique on the blockchain, or in we developed it in a way to maintain the Sharia compliance there, which is called the Sharia Oracle, because we are a decentralized blockchain,” said AlHashmi. HAQQ Network has already implemented a similar system in Brazil for halal food certification, indicating the food is prepared in a way that complies to Islamic law. As Brazil as the largest halal food export, the country has benefited greatly from HAQQ’s blockchain. “We have done a pilot successfully in Indonesia, with different entities and the distribution and everything done in a very satisfactory way,” he said. Expanding products for the Indonesian crypto market Mohammed AlKaff AlHashmi said the protocol is getting ready to introduce a range of crypto products into the Indonesian crypto market. One of which is making Zakat donations doable through the blockchain. “Zakat is a must donation for Muslims who are rich a certain cap of resources, and they are not using it for a year. Zakat donation distribution is very important and crucial worldwide,” said AlHashmi. Because Zakat donations are often manned by people, donators often become uncertain whether their donations will reach the intended parties, such as orphanages and other charities. With the blockchain, the process of submitting donations becomes much more transparent and traceable to the user. “So what we have done, we have designed a solution on the blockchain called Fairshare. And the solution, it enables all donators to donate in a very transparent way, and it also actually it connects the wallet through smart contracts,” he said. In fact, HAQQ has already started implementing this program in Indonesia. In collaboration with NUCare for Empower Widows Initiative and Bright Future for Orphans, HAQQ implemented pilot donations through Fairshare. Additionally, HAQQ also launched a pilot for shariah compliant loans with the Indonesian entity, Agridesa, that combines technology and product development for agricultural sectors. In the future, AlHashmi hopes these products will encourage wider crypto adoption in Indonesia, raising its potential to become a global crypto hub.

This week’s expiry event is a large one because it is the end of the month. However, crypto derivatives expiry events such as this rarely influence spot markets, which have remained relatively flat this week. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.68, which means that there are more call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $120,000 strike price, which is $2.4 billion, according to Deribit. There is also around $1.65 billion in OI at the $110,000 strike price, as derivatives traders continue to speculate that BTC prices will rise from current levels. Earlier this week, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the “longer-term outlook remains constructive with expectations of continued upward momentum.” Meanwhile, Deribit reported that Bitcoin’s brief drop below $100,000 this week caused changes in the derivatives market. Short-term traders were buying more put options than usual, but longer-term traders remained optimistic, favoring call options, it stated. Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit Around 600,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring in addition to today’s tranche of Bitcoin options. These have a notional value of $1.95 billion and a put/call ratio of 0.43. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $10.3 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization has fallen just over 1% on the day to $3.68 trillion, where it was at the same time last week. Bitcoin reached $106,000 in an intraday high on Thursday but started to retreat during the Friday morning Asian trading session, falling to $104,300 at the time of writing. It has recovered from a Monday dip into the five-figure territory but failed to gain further momentum this week. Ethereum remains weak, having failed to reach $3,300 and trading at just over $3,200 at the time of writing. The altcoins were generally mixed with minor gains and losses on Friday morning. Stellar (XLM), Sui (SUI), and Litecoin (LTC) were doing a little better than the rest. Analysts have observed that February is usually much better for crypto price action than January, so things could be about to heat up.

Meanwhile, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund increased its indirect Bitcoin exposure, while El Salvador continues accumulating Bitcoin despite amending its laws to align with IMF conditions. Additionally, Grayscale launched a Bitcoin Miners ETF that gives investors indirect exposure to the mining sector. European Central Bank Stands Firm Against Bitcoin in Reserve Strategies Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), dismissed the possibility of Bitcoin (BTC) being included in central bank reserves as there is a need for liquidity, security, and safety in reserve assets. Her comments were made after Czech National Bank Governor Aleš Michl suggested the institution explore Bitcoin as part of its diversification strategy. However, the Czech central bank’s board did not explicitly mention Bitcoin in its plans. Lagarde’s statement is one of the first clear rejections from the ECB regarding Bitcoin as a reserve asset, especially at a time of growing discussions around digital asset stockpiling. The comments also follow US President Donald Trump’s executive order to establish a working group for exploring regulations on a national digital asset reserve. At least one ECB member has advocated for exploring a digital euro in response to the Trump administration’s openness toward crypto. The push for Bitcoin adoption as a reserve asset gained a lot of traction globally. This is particularly true in the United States, where lawmakers from states like Texas , Utah, Illinois, Wyoming, and Arizona introduced legislative proposals for Bitcoin stockpiling. These initiatives were inspired by the advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund, which championed the idea of Bitcoin as a financial hedge. Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong also urged global policymakers to consider BTC reserves as protection against inflation. Christine Lagarde at the European Council El Salvador is still the best example of a nation that is actively accumulating Bitcoin for its national reserves. The country’s approach has set a precedent, though many central banks are still a bit hesitant to follow suit. Despite these discussions on Bitcoin as a reserve asset, its price has been rather volatile recently. At press time, BTC was trading hands at $104,203.66 after its price slipped by 0.36% over the past 24 hours. Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund Expands Bitcoin Exposure It has become very clear that not everyone necessarily agrees with Lagarde’s thoughts on Bitcoin. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund that is managed by Norges Bank Investment Management, recently increased its indirect exposure to Bitcoin through investments in crypto-friendly companies. NBIM’s exposure to Bitcoin (Source: K33 Research ) According to K33 Research , the fund’s exposure to Bitcoin reached 3,821 BTC, which is valued at $356 million by the end of 2024. This is an annual increase of 153%. It seems like the exposure is attributed to rule-based sector weighting rather than a deliberate strategy to prioritize Bitcoin. The sovereign wealth fund holds a $500 million stake in MicroStrategy, along with investments in crypto exchange Coinbase and Bitcoin mining companies like Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms. The Government Pension Fund Global, as it is officially known, reported record profits of $222 billion in 2024, which was its second consecutive year of impressive gains. The fund’s CEO, Nicolai Tangen, credited most of this success to large returns from the technology sector. The increasing presence of publicly traded crypto companies and the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have made it much easier for institutions to gain both direct and indirect exposure to digital assets. In the United States, spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated more than $124 billion in net assets in just their first year of trading. As regulatory frameworks become clearer, many analysts believe institutional adoption of Bitcoin will expand even more. A pro-crypto policy shift in the United States is already influencing global markets as there is a very clear growing interest in digital assets seen in Europe and beyond. Swiss crypto bank Sygnum recently surveyed 400 institutional investors across 27 countries and found that 57% plan to increase their exposure to crypto assets. This suggests that institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets is likely to accelerate as financial markets grow and evolve. Sygnum Bank survey key findings (Source: Sygnum ) El Salvador Amends Bitcoin Law to Meet IMF Terms El Salvador’s Congress recently quickly approved legislation amending its Bitcoin laws to comply with terms set by the International Monetary Fund as part of a $1.4 billion loan agreement . The bill was passed just minutes after President Nayib Bukele sent it to the Legislative Assembly, securing 55 votes in favor and only two against. The amendment scales back the government’s Bitcoin involvement and makes its acceptance optional for businesses, unlike the previous legal requirement. Ruling party lawmaker Elisa Rosales stated that the reform ensures Bitcoin’s permanence as legal tender while making its implementation a lot more practical. Despite the amendment and Lagarge’s recent comments, El Salvador continues to expand its Bitcoin holdings, and recently purchased an additional 11 BTC. The country’s Bitcoin Office confirmed its plans to keep accumulating Bitcoin, which could intensify in 2025. El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves currently stand at 6,049 BTC, which is valued at approximately $633 million, with an overall profit of 127% based on an average purchase price of $46,000 per Bitcoin. Meanwhile, former US Senator Bob Menendez, who was a very vocal critic of El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for accepting bribes in gold and cash. An FBI search of his home uncovered $480,000 in cash and gold bars worth an estimated $150,000. Grayscale Launches Bitcoin Miners ETF Grayscale also recently expanded its crypto investment offerings with the launch of the Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF (MNRS) , which provides exposure to Bitcoin mining companies and the broader mining ecosystem. The fund was announced on Jan. 30, and it invests in firms listed in the Indxx Bitcoin Miners Index , which tracks companies primarily generating revenue from Bitcoin mining, mining-related hardware, software, and services. MNRS does not invest in digital assets directly or through derivatives but may have indirect exposure due to its holdings. Grayscale believes in the fundamental role of Bitcoin miners in maintaining the security, integrity, and functionality of the Bitcoin network. The company pointed out that Bitcoin mining firms present an alternative for investors who may not have direct access to Bitcoin or prefer a different way to get some exposure to the market. According to David LaValle, Grayscale’s global head of ETFs, Bitcoin miners are positioned for huge growth as adoption increases, making MNRS a very attractive option for a broad range of investors. MNRS details (Source: Grayscale ) The launch of the ETF happened as Bitcoin mining stocks have faced challenges despite Bitcoin’s 100+% gains in 2024. While Grayscale pointed to the correlation between Bitcoin’s price and mining companies, data from the Hashrate Index and Google Finance shows that most publicly traded mining firms struggled to capitalize on the rally. In fact, some stocks saw declines of up to 84%. However, the downturn in mining stocks in late January followed a broader market drop linked to the frenzy surrounding DeepSeek’s new AI model. Despite recent challenges, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Miners ETF is part of the continued push to expand investment options in the crypto sector to offer investors a structured and rules-based way to gain exposure to the mining industry.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-31 06:10:56

However, it’s still unclear whether they have directly reached out to Trump or his administration. Their efforts come at a time when crypto-related pardons are making headlines, especially after Trump granted clemency to Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht . Life Behind Bars- Will Trump Take Chance? Ulbricht’s pardon has sparked speculation that other high-profile crypto figures might also get a second chance. elon musk elon musk Elon Musk Is the Co-founder of Tesla, an investor and entrepreneur. He was born on the 28th of June,1971, and is based in Pretoria, South Africa. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, earning a bachelor's degree in Arts and physics, and the Wharton School, earning a bachelor's degree in science, and economics.

He was also listed on Forbes Billionaire with a total net worth of $2 Billion. NAsales@teslamotors.com Entrepreneur Investor Chief Executive Officer recently hinted that Roger Ver, also known as “ Bitcoin Jesus ,” could be next. Last year, Musk also made a cryptic remark about SBF, suggesting his political connections might protect him from serious consequences. SBF was a major Dem donor, so no investigation — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 13, 2022 Now, the debate is heating up over whether Trump will consider freeing sam bankman fried sam bankman fried Sam Bankman Fried is a successful American entrepreneur, angel investor, and billionaire with a remarkable history in the space of the cryptocurrency industry. Being the Founder and CEO of FTX, a leading cryptocurrency exchange he has played a key role in the revolutionization and development of the crypto space through his excellent experience and potency. Sam Bankman Fried is a native of Stanford, California, United States. Ranked as 60th on the 2022 Forbes billionaires list incorporating a net worth of US$24 Billion. Began his career working at Jane Street Capital, a trading organization that trades international ETFs. Later, in 2017 he quit Jane Street and founded Alameda Research, a quantitative cryptocurrency trading organization established in October 2017.

Bankman aims to support lawmakers who perform the vast game on policymaking in spaces like pandemic planning and preparedness. Entrepreneur Chief Executive Officer Trader as well. Challenges in Securing a Pardon Unlike Ulbricht, who had a strong community advocating for his release, SBF faces significant challenges. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison for defrauding investors out of billions through FTX, one of the biggest financial frauds in U.S. history. His close ties to the Democratic Party, including a $5.2 million donation to Biden’s 2020 campaign, could also work against him under a Trump administration. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Can Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda Drop the Ripple Case? , However, SBF’s family and friends sent many letters to the judge during his trial to reduce his imprisonment; they painted a positive picture of him by calling him a compassionate genius business tycoon who failed due to his ‘neurodiverse’ traits. All these factors and Elon Musk’s support may prove beneficial for him. Odds Are Stacked Against Him Despite the discussions, betting markets remain doubtful about SBF’s chances. Polymarket currently gives him only a 6% chance of receiving a pardon, compared to Ulbricht’s 95% before his release. With Trump likely facing pressure to be selective in his pardons, it remains uncertain whether SBF will receive the same leniency. However, the crypto world is watching closely to see how this unfolds. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
