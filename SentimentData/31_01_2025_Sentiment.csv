As analysts foresee a 50% drop in the price of Pepe, smart investors are already looking into other methods to protect their investments. Remittix, a token that is becoming more and more popular as the top token for investors in 2025, is a notable option among these choices. Why Pepe Coin May Drop By 50% In February Pepe Coin has enthralled the cryptocurrency community over the past year with its remarkable rallies and meme-inspired beginnings. However, maintaining growth becomes more difficult, as is the case with many speculative investments. It appears that February 2025 will be a crucial month for the coin. Experts are citing a number of reasons for the 50% prediction of the Pepe coin drop One of the main causes is market saturation. Pepe Coin has been very popular, but as new investors become cautious of its speculative nature, its market capitalization is currently facing opposition. Regulatory issues are also quite important. Tighter restrictions are affecting the entire cryptocurrency industry, and coins that appeal to memes are frequently subject to extra scrutiny. Declining utility makes the problem worse. Despite having a devoted following, Pepe Coin's limited application outside of speculative trading may make it less competitive. These difficulties imply that the February Pepe price prediction is in line with a gloomy trend, which will cause investors to look for more secure and encouraging opportunities. Additionally, macroeconomic factors like inflation and interest rate increases may have an effect on investor sentiment. Speculative assets like Pepe Coin are frequently among the first to undergo large sell-offs when the larger financial markets are uncertain. Why Remittix Is Gaining Momentum The focus shifts to Remittix, a token positioned as the top token for investors in 2025, as Pepe Coin's prospects deteriorate. Remittix is a compelling choice for individuals hedging against the projected 50% decline in Pepe coin since it provides a distinctive combination of usability, security, and growth potential. Remittix is attracting the interest of investors for the following main reasons. Remittix stands out due to its strong use case. Remittix, in contrast to many meme coins, is based on a network intended for international transfers, addressing actual financial difficulties. It is a more solid investment because of its utility, which guarantees steady demand. Another element is a capable development team. Supported by seasoned developers and financial specialists, Remittix has a transparent roadmap and other attributes that reassure investors. Support from the community is also essential. Remittix is supported by a devoted and expanding community, which guarantees active involvement in its ecosystem and promotes long-term growth. Lastly, what distinguishes it is its protective approach during market downturns. Compared to speculative assets, tokens that provide real benefits, like Remittix, typically do better. Because of this, it is a great tool for investors who want to protect themselves from erratic market swings. Remittix's attractiveness is further increased by its capacity to establish strategic alliances with blockchain networks and financial institutions. These partnerships increase its visibility and bolster its reputation as a sound cryptocurrency investment. Remittix's dedication to sustainability and environmentally friendly operations is another important element that contributes to its allure. By implementing energy-efficient blockchain technology, Remittix responds to the increasing need for crypto solutions that are ecologically conscious. These challenges suggest that the Pepe price prediction for February aligns with a bearish trend, prompting investors to seek more stable and promising opportunities. Conclusion Due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, investors must take preemptive steps. The Pepe price prediction of a 50% decline in February 2025 highlights the necessity for substitutes. With its strong functionality and investor-focused philosophy, Remittix stands out as a ray of light for anybody looking to protect their capital. Remittix is poised to revolutionize what it means to make wise investments in the realm of digital assets as the top token for investors in 2025.

With analysts predicting a 50% drop in Pepe's value, savvy investors are exploring alternative strategies to safeguard their portfolios. Remittix is emerging as a popular choice, becoming the leading token for investors in 2025, offering a promising alternative. Reasons for Pepe Coin's Potential 50% Decline in February Over the past year, Pepe Coin has captivated cryptocurrency enthusiasts with its impressive surges and meme-driven origins. However, sustaining such growth becomes challenging, much like with other speculative investments. February 2025 seems to be a pivotal period for the coin, with experts pointing to several factors that could lead to a 50% decline in the Pepe coin value. A key factor is market saturation. Pepe Coin has enjoyed widespread popularity, yet as new investors grow wary of its speculative nature, its market cap is currently encountering resistance. Regulatory challenges also play a significant role. Stricter regulations are impacting the broader crypto sector, and meme-centric coins often face heightened scrutiny. Decreasing utility adds to the issue. Despite a loyal fanbase, Pepe Coin's limited use beyond speculative trading could render it less competitive. These challenges suggest that the February Pepe price prediction aligns with a negative trend, prompting investors to seek more stable and promising alternatives. Additionally, broader economic factors such as rising inflation and interest rates might influence investor behavior. During periods of financial market uncertainty, speculative assets like Pepe Coin are often among the first to experience significant sell-offs. Why Remittix is Attracting Attention As Pepe Coin's outlook dims, the spotlight turns to Remittix, hailed as the top token for investors in 2025. With its unique blend of utility, security, and growth potential, Remittix emerges as an appealing option for those hedging against the anticipated 50% fall in Pepe Coin. Investors are drawn to Remittix for several key reasons. Remittix distinguishes itself with a robust use case. Unlike many meme-based tokens, Remittix is built on a network designed for global remittances, tackling real-world financial issues. This functionality ensures a steady demand, making it a more resilient investment. Another important factor is its strong development team. Backed by experienced developers and financial experts, Remittix offers a clear roadmap and other features that provide investors with confidence. Community support plays a crucial role as well. A dedicated and growing community supports Remittix, ensuring active participation in its ecosystem and fostering sustainable growth. Finally, its resilience during market downturns sets it apart. Tokens offering tangible benefits, such as Remittix, often outperform speculative assets. This makes it a valuable tool for investors seeking protection from volatile market changes. Its ability to form strategic partnerships with blockchain networks and financial institutions further enhances Remittix's appeal. These collaborations boost its visibility and reinforce its status as a reliable cryptocurrency investment. Remittix's commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly practices is another key factor enhancing its attractiveness. By adopting energy-efficient blockchain technology, Remittix addresses the growing demand for environmentally responsible crypto solutions. These conditions suggest that the Pepe price prediction for February corresponds with a bearish trend, driving investors to explore more stable and promising opportunities. Conclusion Given the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, it's crucial for investors to take proactive measures. The Pepe price prediction of a potential 50% drop in February 2025 underscores the need for alternatives. With its practical functionality and investor-centric approach, Remittix emerges as a beacon of hope for those aiming to safeguard their investments. As the leading token for investors in 2025, Remittix is set to redefine smart investment in the digital asset space.

Interestingly, this renewed momentum has seen Dogecoin open interest flipping from a negative threshold into a positive one. As the meme coin’s price gains traction, traders are once again pouring into derivatives markets, pushing the total open interest above $4 billion. Dogecoin Open Interest Surges With Market Revival According to data from Coinglass, Dogecoin’s total open interest has climbed back above the $4 billion mark, indicating a resurgence in trading activity. This comes after the Dogecoin price rebounded on the $0.31 multi-year support again and started its move upwards again. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Explodes Ahead Of Donald Trump Inauguration, Traders Bet On $1 Interestingly, data from Coinglass show that the Dogecoin open interest has increased by 3.11% and 2.09% in the past 24 hours and 4 hours, respectively. This shift suggests that traders are once again looking at Dogecoin as a promising asset for leveraged plays, betting on further price movements. The most notable DOGE open interest is on the Gate.io exchange, which has seen an increase of 5.14% in the past 24 hours. This brings its total open interest to $1.64 billion, accounting for 41% of the total rate. Bitget and BingX have also witnessed notable uptrends, with the Dogecoin open interest growing by 6.41% and 6.67%, respectively, in the past 24 hours. Binance, on the other hand, is yet to flip into positive open interest change. The world’s largest crypto exchange is still on a -0.13% open interest rate in the past 24 hours but is also on the verge of a positive rate with a +1.41% increase in the last four hours. Increased Leverage Could Lead To More Price Volatility A rise in open interest means that more traders are opening leveraged positions, which could amplify price swings in either direction. Interestingly, Dogecoin often experiences strong price movements during periods of increase in open interest. This latest increase alone means that there is an increase in market participation in Dogecoin. Related Reading: Dogecoin Weekly RSI Approaches The MA Line, Can Price Resume Uptrend To Break $0.74 ATH? If bullish sentiment continues, this market participation may drive the Dogecoin price further upward within the $0.30 to $0.4 range in the short term. However, it also raises the possibility of more liquidations if Dogecoin were to retest support at $0.31 again. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.3316, marking a 7% gain since bouncing off its multi-week support at $0.31. The next step for the meme coin is breaking above a recently developed daily candlestick resistance at $0.3316, which could then pave the way for further upside momentum if sustained buying pressure continues.

Despite a 44% year-over-year drop in hacking incidents, the hacks grew ninefold month-over-month, according to the latest report from web3 bug bounty and security services platform Immunefi. Although the situation looks dire, the figure is a huge fall compared to January last year, when hackers stole $133 million. The crypto losses in January came from two major attacks. The most affected platform was a Singapore-based CeFi Phemex exchange, which hackers targeted and escaped with $69.1 million. The second incident was an exploit of the DeFi platform Moby Trade, which lost $2.5 million. Other low-magnitude attacks were Orange Finance, IPC, UniLend Finance, The Idols NFT, Odos, Laura AI, Pika Infinity, and Sorra. There were no fraud-related cases in January. Hackers exploited the Binance chain more than any other network The month of January saw the Binance chain suffering the most. Of all the attacks, Binance accounts for 50% of the losses on the blockchain, with the platform exploited ten times. Ethereum was also vulnerable, accounting for 25% of the total attacks. Arbitrum and Base suffered two attacks each, followed by Optimism with a single attack. On the other hand, centralized finance platforms were the most exploited, losing over $69 million, 93% of the total value lost in January. Decentralized finance appeared more secure, accounting for only 6.5%, with $4.8 million lost over 18 incidents. While releasing the report, Mitchell Amador, founder and CEO of Immunefi, warned that CeFi platforms will be the most targeted platform by crypto bandits. He said. “The largest volume of losses will likely come from CeFi, as hackers target infrastructure, particularly through private key compromises. CeFi doesn’t generally suffer the most successful attacks, but when a breach occurs, it typically leads to catastrophic losses.” Amador pointed out that the worst thing that can happen is for a hacker to get your private keys and then drain your account which is a major flaw of the CEFI. Whereas DeFi bugs are more common, the impact is small because not all the money is lost. CeFi platforms are enhancing security to prevent exploitations CeFi platforms are also vulnerable to phishing attacks and, therefore, require a multi-layer security approach. CeFi must factor in protective security protocols. It should also include security features that enhance key management, ensuring reduced reliance on a single private key. Furthermore, the platform must improve OpSec’s best practices, such as regular employee security training. Amador also advised that the platforms should have bug bounty programs and real-time threat detection tools. These could be crucial in enhancing the security of these protocols and chains. The Immunefi director advises the platforms to adopt these measures because they are already using them. The firm currently issues over $181 million worth of bug bounties for ethical hackers and manages over $190 billion worth of crypto user funds. The firm has involved ethical hackers and researchers, paying them research bounties worth $112 million. The payouts began three years ago and are still critical. So far, the ethical hackers have come out with 3,000 bug bounty reports. The largest was a $10 million award for a vulnerability discovered in Wormhole’s cross-chain protocol. Immunefi claims to operate the largest blockchain security community with more than 45,000 researchers, saving over $25 billion in user funds across protocols like Polygon, Optimism, Chainlink, The Graph, Synthetix, and MakerDAO (Sky) from being stolen.

After a recent 4.94% drop in market value, many players believe Ethereum could dip below $2,000 this year.

Remittix's public presale has already generated significant attention, offering early investors a chance to get involved with this promising project before it hits centralized exchanges.

Following a recent 4.94% decline in market value, there is speculation amongst investors that Ethereum might fall below $2,000 this year. This situation arises as major holders may be offloading assets and turning their attention to new blockchain initiatives like Remittix (RTX), which are beginning to gain prominence. The public presale of Remittix has already caught significant interest, presenting early investors with a chance to join this exciting venture before it is available on centralized exchanges.

The Future of Ethereum Amid Rising Competition In the past week, Ethereum’s market value has fallen by 6%. Large investors could be cashing out, potentially triggering more sell-offs and causing further price declines. Although Ethereum holds a leading position in the DeFi and NFT markets, its dominance is being challenged by newer projects that offer faster and cheaper solutions for converting crypto to fiat currency. Short-term investors should be cautious of more potential decreases in Ethereum's value. On-chain data might reveal that more assets are leaving the Ethereum network, leading investors to question the long-term supremacy of Ethereum in the DeFi space.

This payment platform enables users to effortlessly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat money, which can then be transferred to bank accounts worldwide.

However, recent data from aggregators reveals an 18% drop in daily trading volumes for both coins, as large holders sell off their stakes and overall market enthusiasm declines. Analysts suggest this downturn for DogWifHat & BONK indicates that meme tokens that rely solely on internet humor struggle to maintain long-term interest. Many retail investors are facing significant losses, leading to a surge of complaints on community platforms. Some analysts attribute the decline to an oversaturated market, as new meme tokens emerge more rapidly than the influx of new investors. With these once-popular dog-themed coins losing their appeal, traders are beginning to look beyond humorous branding. The key question now is what kind of coin can thrive beyond the hype while addressing real-world challenges. The Rise of Real World Solutions in Crypto Tired of the unpredictability of purely speculative tokens, investors are increasingly drawn to real world solutions that may endure beyond fleeting hype. Instead of focusing on dog memes or influencer endorsements, they're searching for altcoins that connect crypto with real applications in areas like cross-border payments or corporate use. This trend isn't entirely new: Ethereum made waves by introducing smart contracts, but many tokens that followed offered little practical use beyond quick trading opportunities. Meme coins rose to fame due to their novelty but often lacked genuine partnerships or sustained demand. The decline of DogWifHat and BONK underscores how quickly that excitement can dissipate. As holders face losses, there is a growing desire for tokens supported by real functionality. Coins that solve everyday issues have the potential for steady growth, unlike those that rely on viral social media posts. Some experts suggest the shift to practical altcoins could pave the way for the next bull market, where tokens targeting substantial markets overshadow comedic counterparts. Remittix: A Rising Player in PayFi Following the decline of DogWifHat & BONK, many are turning to Remittix synergy as a more reliable option. Instead of relying on humorous marketing, Remittix targets the $190 trillion global banking industry, focusing on reducing cross-border fees and accelerating transactions. The $9.5 million raised in presale funds reflects strong confidence in merging crypto with everyday financial needs. The team plans to lock liquidity for three years and renounce the contract post-presale, addressing concerns about developer sell-offs. Critics point out that any new coin must still achieve user adoption and partnerships. However, advocates argue that reducing remittance costs is appealing to freelancers, families sending money back home, and small businesses. If successful, analysts speculate about possible 50x or even 100x returns once listed on major exchanges. Interested? Check Remittix while presale tokens are available. As meme coins falter, real-world solutions may be the key to recouping losses and potentially achieving life-changing gains. Moving from Meme Hype to Real Adoption This narrative is resonating through trading circles. The DogWifHat & BONK downturn highlights how fragile these meme assets are when enthusiasm dwindles. Meanwhile, tokens that emphasize real world solutions, such as Remittix, are becoming more attractive to investors seeking stability with the potential for significant returns. Of course, no project is without risk, especially one that is freshly out of presale. However, many who have suffered from meme coin collapses view Remittix synergy as a strategic hedge, believing that the PayFi model could better endure market downturns compared to light-hearted marketing strategies. If the idea of integrating daily finances with crypto interests you, check out Remittix to purchase presale tokens before the final stages conclude.

Recent aggregator data, however, shows daily volumes for both coins plummeting by 18%, as whales offload positions and market sentiment sours. Analysts say this DogWifHat & BONK slump signals that meme tokens relying solely on internet jokes can’t sustain interest in the long run. Retail holders appear left with steep losses, prompting a wave of complaints on community forums. Some watchers link the downturn to oversaturation, with meme tokens popping up faster than new investors can support them. As these favorite dog-themed assets fade, many traders look beyond comedic branding. The question is what sort of coin can outperform hype while also tackling serious issues. Why Real World Solutions Are Taking Center Stage Frustrated by the volatility of purely speculative tokens, investors now favor real world solutions that might outlast sudden hype cycles. Instead of dog memes and influencer pushes, they seek altcoins bridging crypto with tangible use cases like cross-border finance or enterprise adoption. This shift isn’t new: Ethereum broke ground by enabling smart contracts, but many subsequent tokens offered minimal utility beyond quick flips. Meme coins soared on novelty but often lacked real partnerships or stable demand. The meme coin crash for DogWifHat and BONK highlights how quickly that excitement can vanish. Faced with losses, holders crave tokens underpinned by genuine functionality. A coin that solves an everyday problem may see consistent growth, unlike memes that rely on viral tweets. Some watchers say the pivot to practical altcoins could define the next bull run, where tokens targeting large markets overshadow comedic clones. Remittix Synergy: A Growing PayFi Contender In the wake of DogWifHat & BONK slump, many turn to Remittix synergy for a more dependable approach. Rather than comedic marketing, Remittix focuses on a $190 trillion global banking sector, aiming to lower cross-border fees and speed transactions. Over $9.5 million in presale funds underscores strong faith in bridging crypto and everyday finance. The team locks liquidity for three years, then renounces the contract post-presale moves that calm fears of developer dumps. Critics note any new coin must still secure user adoption and partnerships. But supporters say cutting remittance costs appeals to freelancers, families sending money home and small businesses. If that vision clicks, analysts whisper about 50x or even 100x potential once it hits major listings. Curious? Check Remittix while presale tokens remain. As meme coins falter, real world solutions may be the ticket to recovering losses and possibly netting life-changing gains. Shifting from Meme Hype to Real Adoption That’s the storyline echoing across trading communities. The DogWifHat & BONK slumpunderlines how fragile these meme assets can be when enthusiasm wanes. Meanwhile, tokens emphasizing real world solutions like Remittix seem more appealing for investors seeking stability and big upside. Of course, no project is bulletproof, especially one fresh from presale. But many burned by meme collapses see Remittix synergy as a strategic hedge, believing the PayFi model could withstand bear cycles better than comedic marketing.

While some projects fade into obscurity, others continue to disrupt industries and create new wealth opportunities. Whether it’s a bullish run or a temporary dip, the right crypto investments can offer massive returns within a short time frame. Qubetics , Litecoin (LTC), and Celestia (TIA) are three standout contenders in today’s volatile market. Qubetics is redefining asset tokenization with its record-breaking presale, Litecoin remains a gold standard for fast and secure payments, and Celestia is leading the charge in blockchain modularity. These projects aren’t just trends—they’re shaping the next era of blockchain utility and investment potential. Qubetics – The Web3 Aggregator Leading Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is making waves in the crypto space by offering quantum-resistant blockchain security, designed to withstand the future challenges posed by quantum computing. With its cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, Qubetics ensures that digital assets and transactions remain secure for the long term. Qubetics is capturing the attention of crypto investors at lightning speed. This next-gen Web3 aggregator has already raised over $11.4 million in its Qubetics presale , with more than 452 million $TICS tokens sold to over 17,400 holders. Currently in its 19th presale stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0606 per token, and analysts are already predicting jaw-dropping price jumps post-presale. With projections ranging from $0.25 to as high as $15, the potential for life-changing returns is on the table. One of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics is its role in the real-world asset tokenization marketplace. Imagine a real estate investor looking to tokenize a high-value property to offer fractional ownership opportunities to global investors. Qubetics’ blockchain-powered system simplifies the process, making asset ownership accessible, transparent, and liquid. Businesses can tokenize intellectual property, luxury goods, and even rare collectibles. This groundbreaking approach is set to redefine asset ownership, allowing anyone to invest in high-value assets with ease. Litecoin – The OG of Fast and Reliable Transactions Litecoin (LTC) has long been regarded as one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies in the market. Often referred to as the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, Litecoin was created to provide faster transaction speeds and lower fees, making it an ideal choice for everyday payments. With its strong security, high liquidity, and an ever-growing adoption rate, Litecoin continues to be a solid alternative investment instrument. The crypto community respects Litecoin for its resilience and continuous upgrades. The network’s recent developments, including the MimbleWimble upgrade, have improved privacy features, making LTC even more appealing for transactions. Whether it’s merchants, retailers, or peer-to-peer payments, Litecoin has positioned itself as one of the most practical cryptocurrencies for real-world use. Currently priced at $127.81 and gaining 11.55% in value recently, Litecoin remains a key asset for short-term traders looking for quick gains and long-term holders banking on its steady growth. It may not have the flashiest branding, but its reliability keeps it in the ranks of top cryptos to hold for short term. Celestia – The Modular Blockchain Disruptor Celestia (TIA) is making serious waves in the crypto world by introducing modular blockchain technology. Instead of being a monolithic network like Ethereum or Solana, Celestia separates execution, consensus, and data availability, creating a more scalable and flexible infrastructure. This unique approach has positioned Celestia as a game-changer in the blockchain space, drawing interest from developers and investors alike. Why does Celestia matter? Scalability has been one of the biggest challenges in blockchain, leading to slow transactions and high fees. By adopting a modular architecture, Celestia allows developers to build highly scalable and customizable blockchains without sacrificing security. This is a huge step forward for decentralized applications, Web3 gaming, and even DeFi protocols looking for more efficient solutions. With Celestia currently priced at $4.06, investors are eyeing its potential to surge as adoption grows. If blockchain modularity takes off the way experts expect, Celestia could be one of the biggest winners in the next few years, making it a strong contender among top cryptos to hold for short term. Final Verdict – Where’s the Smart Money Going? Crypto investing is about catching the right wave at the right time. Qubetics , Litecoin, and Celestia all offer massive potential, but for those looking for top cryptos to hold for short term, Qubetics presents a golden opportunity. With its innovative asset tokenization marketplace, explosive presale growth, and bullish analyst predictions, $TICS could be one of the best-performing tokens of the year.

Immunefi, a Web3 security platform, reported that January saw $73.9 million in losses from 19 attacks. This is a staggering increase of nine times from the previous month. However, in a silver lining, this figure represents a 44.6% drop compared to January 2024, when losses exceeded $133 million. Two Major Crypto Hack Incidents Dominate the Landscape In January, the crypto industry was hit by hacking incidents, with $73.9 million siphoned off by cybercriminals. The most significant blow came from two major attacks. This includes the hack of Phemex, a Singapore-based exchange that lost $69.1 million. The breach of the decentralized finance (DeFi) options platform Moby Trade also resulted in a $2.5 million loss. These two incidents were the primary culprits behind the monthly loss total. Other affected platforms included Orange Finance, IPC, The Idols NFT, UniLend Finance, Odos, Laura Ai, Pika Infinity, and Sorra. These hacks contributed to the remaining DeFi losses; all suffered varying degrees of loss. Interestingly, no fraud cases were reported this month. These attacks show that both centralized and decentralized platforms are constantly at risk . Hackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities across different networks. Targeted Networks: BNB Chain and Ethereum Lead the Way BNB Chain was the most targeted, accounting for 50% of the total on-chain losses. Ethereum followed closely, with 25% of the total losses tied to exploits on its network. Other networks, such as Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, also faced breaches, but these were fewer in number, with just a couple of attacks on each. Immunefi’s Role in Crypto Security While the hacking incidents were alarming, Immunefi, a platform known for its web3 bug bounty and security services, plays a key role in combating these threats. The company has paid over $100 million in bounties to ethical hackers , helping to identify and fix vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Immunefi boasts the largest blockchain security community, with more than 45,000 researchers. Over the past three years, its efforts have saved over $25 billion from potential theft, covering protocols like Polygon, Synthetix, and MakerDAO.

The upgrade, which achieved 91.43% consensus from validators, ensures token issuers have control over assets deposited in liquidity pools under specific conditions. XRP Ledger Activates AMMClawback, Enhancing AMM Pool Compliance In a recent post on the X platform , XRPScan confirmed that the XRP Ledger has successfully implemented the AMMClawback amendment. This update introduces new rules governing liquidity pools, particularly for tokens with regulatory requirements. The amendment enables token issuers to retrieve assets from AMM pools under predefined circumstances. If a token is frozen, users will no longer be able to deposit new assets into the associated liquidity pool. This restriction prevents unauthorized transactions involving frozen tokens. More so, this development comes just days after Ondo Finance confirmed its push for expanding tokenized assets. The OUSG deployment on XRPL will enhance institutional liquidity and regulatory compliance. ONDO and XRP prices surged following the news, reflecting strong market confidence XRP/RLUSD AMM Pool Now Possible With the AMMClawback amendment now active, the creation of an XRP/RLUSD AMM pool is now possible. This development will improve liquidity for both XRP and Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin launched in December 2024. Previously, RLUSD could not participate in AMM pools due to its built-in clawback feature. This limitation has now been removed, allowing RLUSD holders to contribute liquidity and trade seamlessly within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. This upgrade could enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the network. Since Ripple’s stablecoin launch, major exchanges have steadily increased its adoption. RLUSD’s reserve report confirms strong backing, boosting investor confidence. Consequently, its most recent listing on Margex expanded its reach in high-leverage trading. New AMM Pool Rules for Wallets and Token Issuers The amendment introduces stricter deposit rules for liquidity providers. If one of the paired tokens is frozen, wallets cannot deposit single-sided or double-sided assets into an AMM pool. Additionally, unauthorized accounts can deposit only once if the paired asset is allowed. Token issuers must now use the AMMClawback function to retrieve assets from pools instead of the standard clawback transaction. This provides a structured approach to enforcing compliance without disrupting normal trading activity on the XRP Ledger. The amendment received 28 out of 35 votes from validators, surpassing the 80% threshold required for approval. Additionally, the XRP Ledger community expects this change to improve regulatory alignment while expanding opportunities for decentralized liquidity.

With Ethereum updates suggesting that this rising star is poised to outshine other meme and traditional coins by 2025, let's delve deeper into what makes this coin so intriguing.

From personalized health guidance to the extraction of value from health data, the global health management sector is in dire need of a profound innovation and upgrade. Today, we are excited to announce the official launch of the iPulse Protocol, marking the beginning of a new era! The iPulse Protocol not only integrates cutting-edge technologies like AI-powered predictions, DeSci collaboration, and DePIN, but also offers unprecedented ecosystem collaboration opportunities for global research institutions, healthcare providers, device manufacturers, and users.Through the iPulse Protocol, health data will no longer remain isolated or closed. Instead, it will be transformed into intelligent, decentralized, and tradable digital assets. This means that users will not only benefit from precise health predictions and personalized guidance powered by AI and big data analysis, but also ensure the privacy and security of their data through blockchain technology, ultimately enabling data to be tokenized. At the same time, research institutions, healthcare providers, and device manufacturers will find new opportunities for collaboration within the iPulse ecosystem, jointly driving the global health management and technological innovation process. Core Features of the iPulse Protocol: Precise Health Prediction and Personalized GuidanceThe fundamental goal of the iPulse Protocol is to comprehensively and accurately analyze user health data through AI technology and provide each user with personalized health advice. By collecting data from wearable devices, medical equipment, and mobile apps, the iPulse Protocol can continuously monitor the user's health status and predict potential health risks using adaptive AI models and advanced technologies like time-series analysis.For instance, by analyzing users' heart rate, blood oxygen levels, sleep quality, and other physiological data in real time, combined with their historical health status, the iPulse Protocol can predict potential health problems such as cardiovascular risks and diabetes progression. It then provides targeted lifestyle and dietary recommendations to help users take preventive measures. This approach not only helps users better manage their personal health but also supports the long-term maintenance of a healthy state.Data Tokenization: Transforming Health Data into Tradable Digital AssetsIn traditional health management systems, users' health data typically belongs to medical institutions or enterprises and is not owned by the individual. In contrast, with the iPulse Protocol, users' health data can be anonymized through encryption technology to ensure privacy, while blockchain technology enables the tokenization of data. This allows users to have both usage and revenue rights over their data. For example, users can authorize research institutions, insurance companies, healthcare providers, and other third parties to access their data in exchange for compensation.The iPulse Protocol offers users a new source of income, allowing them to participate in data transactions through smart contracts, all while ensuring privacy and data security. This mechanism will further stimulate global health tech innovation, promoting the efficient circulation and sharing of health data.DeSci Collaboration: A Global Research and Medical Data Sharing PlatformIn traditional health management and medical fields, data is typically closed and regional, making it difficult to achieve effective cross-border and cross-institution collaboration. The iPulse Protocol breaks this limitation by leveraging decentralized data storage and privacy computing technologies, creating a global data-sharing platform that supports cross-border cooperation among research institutions and medical teams.This data-sharing platform not only ensures the security and privacy of the data but also provides strong support for global scientific collaboration in the health field. For example, research institutions can use anonymized data to support drug development, disease treatment innovations, and more, advancing global health science. Moreover, governments and health organizations can analyze disease transmission trends via the platform to promptly respond to emerging health crises.Applications of the iPulse Protocol: Bridging Personal and Global Health Management Applications of the iPulse Protocol Applications of the iPulse Protocol The iPulse Protocol not only provides precise health management services for individual users but also has wide-ranging applications in various fields: Personal Health Management: By continuously monitoring biological and exercise data, the iPulse Protocol provides users with personalized health reports, dietary advice, and exercise plans, even predicting potential disease risks to help users adopt healthier lifestyles. Healthcare and Insurance Support: Medical institutions and insurance companies can utilize the iPulse Protocol to obtain precise health data analysis, optimize treatment plans, and more accurately assess health risks, enabling them to design tailored insurance products. Global Public Health Monitoring: The iPulse Protocol offers a powerful data support platform for global public health monitoring, helping governments and health organizations analyze disease trends, develop prevention strategies, and respond to global health crises. Global Research and Innovation: By creating a global biological database, the iPulse Protocol accelerates cross-border health data sharing. Research institutions can access anonymized health data through iPulse to support disease research, drug development, and treatment innovations. Support for Smart Device Manufacturers: Device manufacturers can integrate the iPulse Protocol to help users achieve more accurate health management, while using the health data provided by the protocol to optimize product designs, thereby enhancing market competitiveness.Looking to the Future: iPulse Protocol Brings a New Revolution to Health ManagementWith the official launch of the iPulse Protocol, we can anticipate unprecedented opportunities for global health management and scientific innovation. Through decentralized technologies, AI-powered predictions, and data tokenization, the iPulse Protocol offers a win-win ecosystem collaboration platform for users, research institutions, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and device manufacturers. Whether it's individual health management or global health data sharing and scientific collaboration, iPulse is driving the digital transformation of the health management industry and injecting new vitality into global public health.In the future, as the iPulse ecosystem continues to evolve, global health management will become more personalized, intelligent, and decentralized. The launch of the iPulse Protocol not only brings users a new health management experience but also provides continuous momentum for the development of global medical, research, and health industries.

However, there’s even more interesting news and that is about the rise of Panshibi (SHIBI), a new crypto project making waves with its engaging presale. Can this emerging meme coin project live up to the expectations? Find the details below! Solana Price Prediction: Can an ETF Take SOL To $500? Solana (SOL) has been a powerhouse in the crypto market, delivering unparalleled transaction speeds and efficiency. Currently, SOL is priced around $231.64 , having declined by 13.10% over the past week. However, its recent bull run to $294.33, which marks a 17.56% increase over the last 30 days, speaks volumes about its potential to hit $300 or higher in the next month. Technical analysis shows the Solana price prediction chart carving higher highs, indicating a significant bull run. The circulating supply of 593.01M SOL tokens against a market cap of $112.76B solidifies its position among top-tier altcoins. While most analysts have not been able to give a target price of Solana or affirm that it will reach $500, the three-month performance of Solana has shown promising figures. Moreover, with the impending launch of a Solana ETF, experts and investors believe such significant gains for Solana can be attainable. Panshibi: More Than Just a Meme Coin While Solana continues to attract attention in the crypto markets, Panshibi stands ready to deliver exciting returns and a vibrant ecosystem that could redefine what it means to invest in a meme coin. The Panshibi project is compelling for many reasons, one of which is the total allocation of its tokens, designed to promote fairness and long-term growth. This strategic approach not only promotes community engagement but also positions Panshibi as a noteworthy contender in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Buying SHIBI tokens isn’t just about making money; it’s about becoming part of a vibrant community. When you purchase these tokens, you join a shared adventure, inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas that symbolize this project. It’s a journey into new possibilities, where everyone can contribute and benefit from each other’s growth. One of the reassuring aspects of Panshibi is that its smart contract has been thoroughly checked for safety. This means investors can feel secure knowing that the project has been vetted and is less likely to have hidden issues. With these safety measures in place, Panshibiis shaping up to be an appealing choice for anyone looking to enter the crypto market. Panshibi's Promises Over 700% Gains for Early Buyers Currently, Panshibi is running a presale that lasts for 60 days, providing a fantastic opportunity for early investors. The presale operates with dynamic pricing which causes $SHIBI prices to climb when buyers acquire more tokens. At the time of writing, Panshibi has successfully sold out Stage 1 of its presale in record time, and is now in Stage 2 priced at $0.003. The price of SHIBI is expected to rise to $0.004 in its next stage. Ultimately, once the 15 stages of its presale is sold out, early investors will have pocketed an eye watering 1,200 ROI! Looking ahead, the Panshibi team has exciting plans for after the presale. In Phase 3, they will introduce new features like staking and exclusive NFTs, giving more value to token holders. Phase 4 will focus on expanding globally and engaging the community, making sure that Panshibi continues to evolve and innovate as it grows. Conclusion Although Solana is a strong player in the crypto world, Panshibi might be the better choice for investors looking for significant returns. Panshibi presents enticing attributes such as decentralized governance, transparent operations, and a potential for rapid expansion, positioning it as a formidable contender.

Solana (SOL) is a significant player in the crypto scene, known for its unmatched transaction speed and efficiency. At present, SOL trades at approximately $231.64 , reflecting a 13.10% drop over the past week. Nevertheless, its recent surge to $294.33, which is a 17.56% uptick over the past 30 days, highlights its potential to reach $300 or more soon. The technical analysis indicates the Solana price forecast chart is showing higher highs, suggesting a strong upward trend. With a circulating supply of 593.01M SOL tokens and a market cap of $112.76B, it firmly holds its place among the leading altcoins. While most experts have not set a definitive target price for Solana or confirmed it will hit $500, its performance over the last three months has been promising. Additionally, the anticipated launch of a Solana ETF has investors and analysts optimistic about the possibility of such gains for Solana. Panshibi: Beyond Just a Meme Coin While Solana continues to capture interest in the crypto markets, Panshibi is poised to offer thrilling returns and a lively ecosystem that might redefine meme coin investments. Several factors make the Panshibi project attractive, particularly its token distribution strategy aimed at ensuring fairness and sustainable growth. This approach not only fosters community involvement but also positions Panshibi as a serious player in the constantly changing crypto world. Acquiring SHIBI tokens isn't merely about profit; it's about joining an enthusiastic community. By purchasing these tokens, you become part of a shared journey, inspired by the legendary Panshibi Pandas that represent this initiative. It's a leap into new opportunities, where everyone can contribute and benefit from collective growth. A reassuring element of Panshibi is that its smart contract has undergone thorough security checks. This provides investors with peace of mind, knowing the project has been thoroughly vetted and is less prone to hidden vulnerabilities. With these security measures, Panshibi is emerging as an attractive option for those looking to enter the crypto market. Panshibi's Promises of Over 700% Returns for Early Investors At present, Panshibi is conducting a 60-day presale, presenting an excellent opportunity for early investors. The presale features dynamic pricing, meaning that $SHIBI prices increase as more tokens are purchased. As of now, Panshibi has already sold out Stage 1 of its presale in record time, and is now in Stage 2 with a price of $0.003. The price of SHIBI is anticipated to rise to $0.004 in the upcoming stage. Ultimately, once all 15 presale stages are completed, early investors could enjoy a staggering 1,200 ROI! Looking towards the future, the Panshibi team has exciting plans following the presale. In Phase 3, they plan to introduce new features such as staking and exclusive NFTs, adding more value for token holders. Phase 4 will focus on global expansion and community engagement, ensuring that Panshibi continues to grow and innovate. Conclusion While Solana remains a formidable force in the crypto realm, Panshibi could be a more attractive option for investors seeking substantial returns. Panshibi offers appealing features like decentralized governance, transparency, and rapid growth potential, establishing it as a strong contender. With its current price of $0.003 per SHIBI token, Panshibi is well-positioned for a successful market entry.

For those who are just catching on, the presale has already raised over $675,000, with an impressive 18,546% ROI from Stage 7 to the final listing price of $0.008. Each week, as Pablo “travels,” tokens are burned, reducing the total supply and adding an extra layer of scarcity. The more coins are burned, the higher the value of the remaining ones. This deflationary mechanism gives Arctic Pablo the potential to soar as it continues to captivate investors. 66% APY Staking: But it doesn’t stop there. Arctic Pablo also offers an enticing staking program with a massive 66% APY. That means you can stake your coins, watch your rewards accumulate, and be part of a growing adventure. The more you stake, the more you earn. But remember, your staked tokens will be vested for two months from the launch date—patience will pay off! Final Presale Price and Burn Mechanism: The presale is gradually building towards its final price of $0.0008 per token. Unsold tokens are burned each week, which keeps the environment deflationary and further drives up the potential for profits. As we get closer to the launch, every moment is an opportunity to grab a piece of the action before it explodes.

In 2028, SHIB can reach a maximum value of $0.000114. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach a minimum value of $0.000185 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem with significant growth and utility. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about its future price trajectory. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and solidify its position in the crypto market? Will SHIB ever reach $1? Overview Cryptocurrency Shiba Inu Token SHIB Price $0.00002154 Market Cap $11,010,939,337.5 Trading Volume $280,254,145.75 Circulating Supply 589,254,022,224,998.1 SHIB All-time High $0.00008845 (Oct 27, 2021) All-time Low $0.00000000008165 (Aug 31, 2020) 24-hour high $0.00001820 24-hour low $0.00001896 Shiba Inu coin price prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Volatility 7.31% 50-Day SMA $0.00002263 14-Day RSI 36.91 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 70 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.00001914 Shiba Inu price analysis: SHIB remains largely bearish as buyer interest grows TL;DR Breakdown SHIB is currently trading below its 50-day SMA. SHIB’s key support level is at $0.00001728. If SHIB breaks above $0.00001933, it may target higher resistance levels. Shiba Inu 1-day price chart: Minor bullish attempts exist amid a broader bearish trend The 1-day chart for Shiba Inu on January 30 shows the coin trading below the 20-day SMA at $0.00002066, reflecting a bearish trend. The MACD suggests ongoing bearish momentum, confirming that the slight bullish turn is not solid enough. Minor bullish attempts exist amid a broader Shiba Inu bearish trend The RSI at 41 indicates the asset is near the oversold region, hinting at potential consolidation or a mild recovery if buyers return at the bottom. A break above $0.00001933 could signal further upside, while a rejection risks revisiting lower support levels near $0.00001728. Shiba Inu 4-hour price chart: SHIB see short-term price uptick The 4-hour SHIB/USDT chart shows a slight uptick in price. The Bollinger Bands are still narrow, indicating reduced volatility and the possibility of range-bound price movement. The Balance of Power (BOP) at -0.50 signals growing bearish dominance unless a reversal occurs. Also, the CMF is slightly positive, suggesting some buying pressure despite a bearish takeover. Increased buyer interest and accumulation could see SHIB retest the upper Bollinger band at $0.00001925. Otherwise, SHIB could retest support at $0.00001728. Shiba Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00001981 SELL SMA 5 $0.00001940 SELL SMA 10 $0.00002039 SELL SMA 21 $0.00002106 SELL SMA 50 $0.00002263 SELL SMA 100 $0.00002300 SELL SMA 200 $0.00001948 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.00002067 SELL EMA 5 $0.00002106 SELL EMA 10 $0.00002160 SELL EMA 21 $0.00002234 SELL EMA 50 $0.00002318 SELL EMA 100 $0.00002240 SELL EMA 200 $0.00002083 SELL What to expect from Shiba Inu price analysis? SHIB shows slight signs of renewed buyer interest but still faces potential rejection around $0.00001925 – $0.00001933. A breakout above this range is needed to confirm a bullish recovery. If momentum holds, Shiba Inu could move towards $0.00002066 or dip further if it breaks its immediate support level. Is Shiba Inu a good investment? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has made strides with the launch of Shibarium, its Layer-2 blockchain, and a partnership with Chainlink, boosting cross-chain functionality and utility. The upcoming TREAT token – expected to play a significant role in Shiba Inu’s reward system and governance mechanisms – further expands its ecosystem. While promising, SHIB remains highly speculative and subject to market swings, so proceed cautiously as a trader or investor. Will Shiba Inu recover? Shiba Inu is experiencing fluctuations with a recent upward trend; there are signs of potential recovery. Will SHIB reach $1? Reaching $1 for Shiba Inu (SHIB) is highly unlikely due to its massive circulating supply and the unrealistic market cap. Significant demand increases and supply reductions would be necessary to approach such a price. Will SHIB reach $10 It is unlikely that SHIB will reach $10 due to its enormous circulating supply and the unrealistic market capitalization required to achieve this feat. Will SHIB reach $100? Reaching $100 for SHIB is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply and the astronomically high market capitalization it would necessitate. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on continued adoption, broader market adoption trends, and other cryptocurrency market space developments.

39713411,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=665697,1738281307,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39713411.jpeg,MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor graces the cover of Forbes: “The Bitcoin Alchemist”,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-graces-the-cover-of-forbes-the-bitcoin-alchemist/,"Michael Saylor is everywhere, and now he’s on the cover of Forbes in an issue released Jan. 30. The 59-year-old CEO of MicroStrategy was pictured grinning under the bold title, “The Bitcoin Alchemist,” an iconic and very fitting name. Michael came into the market just five years ago and quite literally devoured Bitcoin. Since then, he has accumulated 471,107 BTC worth around $50 billion, turning his company into the ultimate Bitcoin whale and himself into a $9.4 billion man. On New Year’s Eve, Michael hosted 500 elite guests at Villa Vecchia, his 18,000-square-foot mansion in Miami, Florida. Picture this the way Forbes described it in their issue: tangerine suits, golden bodysuits, and hors d’oeuvres stamped with Bitcoin’s iconic “B” logo. Michael Saylor’s Forbes cover Dancers swirled glowing orbs in Bitcoin’s signature orange hue. Outside, the 154-foot Usher yacht rocked against the Miami skyline, ferrying in institutional investors, crypto influencers, and executives. And get this, the main event wasn’t even the new year, it was Bitcoin breaking $100,000 for the first time ever. David Bailey, the CEO of BTC Inc. and publisher of Bitcoin Magazine, walked the scene, wearing a cap stamped with “Satoshi Nakamoto.” He was the one who brought Donald Trump to July’s Bitcoin conference, where Trump declared he’d turn America into “the crypto capital of the planet.” But oh no, this night belonged to Michael. The whole party felt less like a party and more like a coronation for the untitled King of Crypto, something he might have to fight El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele for. Though hey listen, this article is about Michael, not Nayib. And Michael strolled through the party in his black blazer, blue jeans, and a T-shirt branded with the Bitcoin logo. Selfie requests and handshakes piled up. Here, Bitcoin was a religion, and Michael was its high priest. The comeback of the century Michael’s relationship with money has always been a bit so-so. Anyway, he built MicroStrategy in 1989 as a data-mining company right out of MIT. By 2000, this genius was worth $13 billion, but the tech bubble popped, and so did his empire. The SEC accused him of accounting fraud, and MicroStrategy’s stock dropped like a rock—from $313 per share to under $1. His $13 billion net worth was gone overnight. “It was the darkest part of my life. When people lose money because they believe in you, that’s pretty much the worst,” he said. For the next twenty years, MicroStrategy limped along with unimpressive sales and a market cap around $1 billion. Then came 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic triggered massive global fiat printing, and Michael said he started seeing the dollar as “trash.” He didn’t see safety in dollars or bonds, but he saw safety in Bitcoin’s 21 million token limit. With $530 million in cash reserves and after months of contemplation, he made the call, said MicroStrategy would go all-in on Bitcoin. Over three years, MicroStrategy scooped up more Bitcoin than anyone else in the world, apart from Satoshi Nakamoto himself. After the SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock, Bitcoin’s price doubled, then smashed $100,000 in December after Trump won the election and gave the industry what he promised us. That spike pushed MicroStrategy straight into the Nasdaq 100. The company’s stock surged over 700% last year. Michael’s net worth went from $1.9 billion in 2024 to $9.4 billion in January 2025. Pretty crazy, huh? MicroStrategy is now worth $84 billion, despite having only $48 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Wall Street doesn’t really get it, but Michael does. “We put a crypto reactor in the middle of the company and spin it,” he said. “That volatility fuels everything.” How Michael Saylor weaponized volatility and became Wall Street’s King Now here’s the magic trick: Michael knew Wall Street thrives on volatility, the very thing traditional investors fear. In 2021, he began issuing billions in convertible bonds, offering investors the option to convert debt into shares of MicroStrategy. The implied volatility of MicroStrategy’s options skyrocketed as Bitcoin prices bounced wildly. Traders loved it. “People thought I was crazy,” Michael told Forbes. “How can such a small company have that liquidity? Because we created volatility on purpose.” MicroStrategy has issued six convertible notes since 2021, totaling $7.3 billion, with interest rates between 0% and 2.25%. Investors ate them up. Allianz and State Street grabbed huge chunks. The bonds delivered returns over 250%, making them one of the top-performing debt plays in the market. Even the $3 billion issued last November—with a 0% coupon—gained 89% in just a few months. With its stock price up 2,666% since 2020, MicroStrategy’s market frenzy rivals even Tesla and Amazon. Its shares jumped from 97 million to 246 million through secondary offerings and debt issuance. In January, shareholders approved increasing the authorized shares to 10.3 billion. His strategy is simple: raise debt, buy Bitcoin, drive prices up, issue more shares, and repeat. And just when Wall Street thought he was done, Michael introduced a new financial metric: Bitcoin Yield. It measures the growth of Bitcoin holdings relative to the company’s fully diluted shares. MicroStrategy reported a 74.3% BTC Yield for 2024. Wall Street couldn’t ignore the signal, even if it seemed arbitrary. So now those guys are knocking on Michael’s door, they want in on the action too. Michael’s financial engineering is now a template for others. Bitwise counts 90 public companies—Tesla and Block included—adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. In March 2025, Bitwise will launch a Bitcoin Standard ETF tracking 35 companies holding over 1,000 BTC each. MicroStrategy dominates the list. “Size is everything,” said Jeff Park from Bitwise. “MicroStrategy is the most liquid source for trading Bitcoin-related risks.” What happens if Bitcoin crashes? Here’s the question: What happens if Bitcoin drops like it did in 2018 or 2022? The answer is, according to Michael, MicroStrategy has time. Bitcoin would need to fall over 80% and stay there for two years before this hero would be in trouble. “Actually, there’s very little debt on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet,” said Jeff Park. The debt is unsecured, so there’s no forced liquidation of Bitcoin assets even if things go south. Michael isn’t worried. Trump’s crypto-friendly administration is back, and the US national debt keeps surging. “Cash is trash,” he said to Forbes, sticking to his mantra. Trump’s spending policies will for sure hurt the dollar, which will only strengthen Bitcoin’s appeal. Michael said, “The irony of my career is I invented 20 things, and I tried to make them successful, and I really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared, and now we just carry the torch. That, ironically, has made me more successful than me trying to commercialize every one of my own ideas. It is a lesson in humility.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-30 23:55:07

Ethereum ETFs Struggle & XRP Price Prediction Shows Rally,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-pick-for-2025-web3bay-shines-with-6000-roi-ethereum-etfs-struggle-xrp-price-prediction-shows-rally/,"The digital currency market is seeing high excitement, with investor enthusiasm and high valuations. Often, these periods have been followed by market dips, highlighting the importance of choosing cryptos with strong basics that can maintain value during downturns. XRP’s price forecast shows it nearing an important barrier at $3.30, suggesting possible growth, yet a market drop could still occur. Similarly, the Ethereum ETF managed by Fidelity has seen no new investments, indicating investor wariness amid market uncertainties. Amid these market trends, Web3Bay (3BAY) stands out as a strong investment choice. Its decentralized e-commerce platform is reinforced by a successful $980,000 presale and an anticipated return of 6,430%. This platform promises substantial long-term potential that transcends current market volatility. At the heart of Web3Bay is a commitment to innovation, presenting a solid opportunity for investors aiming to manage the complexities of the vibrant market with a project that is both innovative and focused on practical utility. Web3Bay (3BAY): A New Force in E-Commerce Web3Bay, known as the potential “Amazon Killer,” is transforming online shopping with its blockchain-based platform. This initiative addresses traditional e-commerce issues like high fees, transparency, and data privacy by empowering users. It provides secure and open dealings with added benefits such as a 5% savings on purchases using the 3BAY token. Its presale was a hit, with $980,000 raised and over 265 million tokens sold. With the current token price at $0.004562 in its third stage, it’s accessible for many. The token’s expected increase to $0.1959 could give early buyers a return of 6,430%. Web3Bay’s strategy includes innovative features like decentralized storage through IPFS, compatibility across blockchain networks like Ethereum and BNB, and plans for second-layer solutions to speed up and reduce transaction costs. Its community-led approach gives users a voice in the platform’s direction. With growing interest in its presale, Web3Bay is setting up to revolutionize e-commerce. This is your chance to get involved before it launches! XRP Price Prediction: Potential for Major Gains or a Pullback? The current analysis of XRP suggests it’s trading at $3.12 and facing a crucial resistance at $3.30. Overcoming this barrier could trigger a significant uptrend, potentially reaching $4.19, $5, or even $6.61. Despite a mixed track record recently and a 4% decrease over the last week, the support levels between $2.52 and $2.94 are robust, providing a solid foundation for those hoping for price appreciation. Conversely, these support levels offer a reliable fallback for purchasers. The recent breakout of XRP from a triangle formation on January 13 indicates potential for continued upward movement, though the current slowing momentum suggests it could soon reach a pivotal juncture. Investors should keep an eye on the $3.30-$3.40 range for signs of a possible ascent. While a surge could bring substantial rewards, there’s also a chance of regression to lower support zones in the near term. Ethereum ETF Faces Challenges with No Recent Inflows The Fidelity-managed Ethereum ETF has experienced no new inflows lately, indicating a stall in investor enthusiasm. This aligns with Ethereum’s price holding steady at $2,850 after a recent 1.2% decrease. The absence of fresh funds highlights investor caution, possibly due to a decline in trading volume and general activity within the Ethereum network. This ETF is now under close watch as investors assess how this trend might impact the broader market. Despite potential risks of market volatility, Ethereum’s established role in decentralized finance and smart contracts might still offer profitable scenarios for those willing to handle the current uncertainties. This market hiatus could serve as a potential opportunity for strategic investors eyeing Ethereum’s long-term growth. Summing Up! In a fluctuating crypto market, XRP, Ethereum, and Web3Bay each offer unique prospects, but Web3Bay stands out with its innovative approach and substantial ROI potential. While XRP might soon exceed $3.30 and Ethereum ETF is not seeing new money, Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce . It’s redefining the space with lower fees, privacy, and user governance, with its presale already achieving significant token sales and offering a 6,430% ROI. For those seeking impactful growth, Web3Bay is poised to lead the next wave of blockchain-based e-commerce, making it a top choice for future-focused investors.

Toncoin Eyes Potential Surge & HBAR Tests Key Support,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-tg-tap-miner-lands-on-okx-wallet-enhances-gamefi-toncoin-eyes-potential-surge-hbar-tests-key-support/,"The lines between gaming and blockchain are blurring, turning once simple in-game items into valuable digital assets. Projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have shown how GameFi can create new financial opportunities for players. But getting started with these games and accessing their full potential can be tricky, limiting their widespread appeal. BlockDAG ‘s TG Tap Miner offers a different path. It uses the familiar Telegram platform to provide a simple play-to-earn experience. Now, with its integration with OKX, accessing and managing in-game rewards and digital assets is easier than ever. Meanwhile, Toncoin’s recent price action and Hedera Hashgraph’s technical outlook remind us of the ever-present volatility in the crypto market. This volatility underscores the importance of GameFi projects like TG Tap Miner that prioritize user-friendliness. OKX Collaboration Accelerates BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner Into Mainstream Gaming BlockDAG’s recent partnership with OKX is a major step in its GameFi journey, highlighting its dedication to bringing gaming and decentralized finance closer together. TG Tap Miner, BlockDAG’s Telegram-based play-to-earn game, has already seen considerable interest. Its integration with OKX’s wallet system sets it up for widespread adoption. This move aligns with the broader rise of GameFi, where projects like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have shown how in-game items can become valuable, tradable assets. But TG Tap Miner stands out by providing a smooth user experience through Telegram, removing the usual hurdles to entry. BlockDAG’s presale success further demonstrates its momentum, raising over $186.5 million with 17.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Currently in its 27th batch at $0.0248 per coin, the project has seen an impressive 2,380% return since batch 1. With OKX integrating TG Tap Miner NFTs, BlockDAG is poised for even greater growth as more players gain easy access to in-game rewards and digital assets. Looking forward, BlockDAG could further improve its ecosystem with features like staking, allowing users to earn passive income on their BDAG holdings. NFT lending could let gamers borrow assets for gameplay, creating a more fluid in-game economy. A dedicated NFT marketplace could boost the value and trading of TG Tap Miner collectibles. As BlockDAG continues its rapid expansion, its partnership with OKX signals a new era where gaming and blockchain blend seamlessly, offering exciting opportunities for those who get in early. Is Toncoin’s Set For A Potential Surge? Toncoin (TON) is currently trading near $5.02, approaching a key resistance level at $5.30, with an all-time high of $8.24. The platform’s active development environment is attracting a variety of projects, fostering ecosystem growth. At the same time, recent U.S. political changes may lead to more crypto-friendly regulations, encouraging broader adoption—a significant shift given past regulatory uncertainties. TON’s focus on scalability and efficient transaction processing positions it well for mainstream use. Given these factors, analysts predict a potential rise to $54 in 2025, suggesting substantial returns for early investors. However, the crypto market’s inherent volatility means such forecasts should be approached cautiously. While TON’s technological strengths and favorable regulatory trends make it an appealing investment, thorough personal research and risk assessment are essential before making investment decisions. Hedera Hashgraph Tests Key Support Levels Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) recently tested its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) as a critical support level after a slight pullback. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests oversold conditions, hinting at a possible rebound. If the price maintains support at $0.2559, an upward push toward $0.3930 remains likely. However, breaking below this level could accelerate losses. From a technical perspective, the outlook leans bullish, with potential recovery driven by improved market sentiment. Moreover, a break above resistance could fuel further gains, strengthening HBAR’s position. Consequently, traders are watching for confirmation signals to gauge the next move. Meanwhile, the market’s response to external factors, including broader crypto trends, will play a role in determining whether the bullish scenario unfolds. While uncertainty persists, maintaining the above support could reinforce buying momentum. If buyers regain control, the upcoming sessions might witness renewed optimism, positioning Hedera Hashgraph for an extended rally toward key resistance levels. The Bottom Line As blockchain ecosystems grow, accessibility and utility are becoming crucial factors in driving long-term adoption. BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner stands out by simplifying the GameFi experience via Telegram, removing the obstacles that typically hinder wider participation. Thanks to its integration with OKX, players can now easily access in-game rewards, enhancing their position within the market. In parallel, Toncoin’s price fluctuations and Hedera Hashgraph’s technical trends highlight the ongoing volatility in the crypto space, affecting investor strategies. Looking ahead, projects like TG Tap Miner that focus on combining user-friendly interfaces with strong financial incentives are well-positioned to thrive, providing a smoother entry into blockchain-based gaming and decentralized finance.

Aptos is a fast-growing layer-1 blockchain network, and the biggest compliment to its reputation could be its “Solana killer” nickname. It claims to be an upgrade on existing blockchain platforms with its solutions to enhance scalability, security and user experience. The Aptos platform supports over 200 decentralized applications ( dApps ), with over $1 billion in total value locked (TVL) and a stablecoin market cap of approximately $780 million. USDT holds a 75% share of the stablecoin in circulation on the network. Before the integration, the USDC on the platform was bridged from other networks. Financial institutions can now also interact with USDC liquidity and benefit from Aptos’ network. USDC launch on Aptos Circle announced in November 2024 that it would launch on the Aptos network. Now, two months later, the company announced on its website that its stablecoin is now available on the Aptos mainnet. With the integration, USDC is now accessible to developers and users with no bridging required. USDC is the world’s largest MiCA-compliant dollar stablecoin. The token’s availability on the Aptos layer-1 network could open more growth opportunities for the Circle-issued stablecoin. Aptos has a $4.54 billion market cap, which is a reflection of its success in supporting developers to build apps for various use cases. Apps on the network include DeFi, peer-to-peer payments, cross-border remittances, and much more. Some of the top applications in the Aptos ecosystem include Aries Markets, Thala, KGen, and Cellana Finance. The Aptos network has a bridged form of USDC circulating known as IzUSDC. It is bridged from Ethereum through the AptosBridge. The growth of the bridged version is possible due to bridge providers such as Stargate. The popularity of IzUSDC was a major factor in Circle’s decision to bring native USDC to the Aptos mainnet network. At present, lzUSDC is not issued by Circle and is not compatible nor redeemable with Circle Mint. However, the Aptos team and bridge providers will be working to help facilitate the migration from lzUSDC to native USDC over time. Circle gains ground on Tether Circle, the stablecoin issuer has witnessed a recent boost in the European market due to several factors. High on the list is that it has achieved full compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. MiCA is a regulatory body that requires issuers of stablecoins to meet strict transparency, liquidity, and consumer protection standards. On the other hand, Tether’s USDT did not meet the MiCA standards required to continue operating in Europe. Tether’s market cap dropped from $140 billion to $137 billion following MiCA regulations implementation, which started on December 30, 2024. ` Circle’s collaboration with Aptos is an apparent move to close the gap on Tether’s USDT. Tether announced a similar integration last year, but with USDC on the “Solana killer” layer-1 network, USDT’s 75% dominance could be under threat.

For thousands of traders, that story is Bonk (BONK). Back in 2023, when Solana’s first major dog-themed meme coin launched, most people laughed it off as another flash-in-the-pan gimmick. Big mistake. At launch, Bonk was practically free, trading at microscopic fractions of a cent. But then it exploded. Within months, BONK surged over 4,500%, minting overnight millionaires. Investors who threw in a few hundred bucks early walked away with six-figure gains. And yet, most people ignored it—until it was too late. If you’re reading this, you probably weren’t one of the lucky ones. But here’s the good news: history is repeating itself. Another meme coin with sky-high potential is in its early stages, and this time, you don’t have to miss out. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the top new meme coin to join in February 2025 that’s poised to dominate the market. BTFD Coin (BTFD) – The Meme Coin Revolution You Can’t Ignore Meme coins aren’t just about hype anymore. The best ones are combining viral appeal with real-world utility, and BTFD is leading the charge. Unlike most meme coins that live and die by market sentiment alone, BTFD packs an arsenal of features designed to reward long-term holders and active community members. A Presale That’s Printing Future Millionaires If you’re looking for an early-stage play with a massive upside, BTFD’s presale is the golden ticket. The coin launched at just $0.000004 and is now sitting at $0.00016 in its 14th presale stage, with an expected launch price of $0.0006. That’s an easy 275% ROI waiting to happen just by getting in before the presale ends. Let’s put that into perspective. If you invest $20,000 in BTFD at its current presale price of $0.00016, you’ll snag 125 million BTFD tokens . Once it hits the listing price of $0.0006, your investment balloons to $75,000. Now imagine if BTFD pulls a Bonk-style rally—how high could your gains go? The “Bulls Squad” is Leading the Stampede BTFD isn’t just another faceless meme coin. It has a mascot-driven ecosystem called the Bulls Squad, featuring characters like Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull. These aren’t just cute icons—they represent the movement of traders who are sick of missing dips and are ready to take charge of their financial future. The Bulls Squad embodies the fearless spirit of early adopters. In other words, BTFD rewards those who grab opportunities before the crowd catches on. 90% APY Staking – Your Money Working for You Unlike most meme coins that sit idle in your wallet, BTFD lets you stake and earn a massive 90% APY. Whether you’re looking to stack more tokens passively or double down on your long-term bet, staking ensures that every BTFD holder is earning, even when the market takes a breather. Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game – Earn While You Play Launched on January 1, 2025, the BTFD Play-to-Earn (P2E) game lets users rack up rewards while enjoying the action-packed gaming experience. This isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a full ecosystem where holders can engage, play, and win. BTFD’s explosive growth is just getting started, and with over 9,900 holders already on board, it’s clear this is more than just hype—it’s a movement. Bonk (BONK) – The One That Got Away (For Some) Let’s rewind to late 2023. Bonk (BONK) was just another meme coin floating under the radar, and most people laughed it off as just another dog-themed gimmick. But while the skeptics laughed, early believers were banking serious cash. The Crazy Bonk (BONK) Surge Bonk went from being an airdrop token to a billion-dollar market cap meme coin. It saw massive gains, climbing over 5,000% in a few months. If you had thrown just $500 into Bonk in its early days, you could have easily turned that into $25,000 or more. The market didn’t take Bonk seriously at first, but when major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase listed it, things got wild. Bonk’s price skyrocketed, and suddenly, it wasn’t just a joke—it was the hottest meme coin of the season. Why You Might Have Missed Out Most investors ignored Bonk, thinking it was just another meme coin that wouldn’t last. Others thought they’d have more time to buy in. But by the time the FOMO kicked in, it was already too late—the biggest gains had already been made. And now, history is repeating itself. A fresh meme coin is rising, offering the same kind of early-stage opportunity, but with even more firepower behind it. Why BTFD is Your Second Chance at a Bonk-Style Payday Opportunities like Bonk (BONK) don’t come around often, and when they do, you have two choices: Get in early and reap the rewards, or hesitate and watch from the sidelines as others cash in. BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a strategic, community-driven project with a massive ecosystem designed to reward early adopters. If you missed Bonk, this is your moment to make things right. Referral Program – Get Paid for Spreading the Word BTFD isn’t just letting you invest—it’s paying you to bring in new buyers. Its referral system rewards both referrers and new buyers with extra BTFD tokens. Here’s how it works: Connect Your Wallet – Get a unique referral code. Share Your Code – Invite your friends, family, or crypto community. Earn Rewards – Your referrals get 10% extra BTFD , and you receive 10% of every purchase made with your code if you rank in the top 20 referrers. Track Your Earnings – Watch your BTFD stack grow in real-time. Passive income while you invest? Now that’s a game-changer. Final Verdict – Are You Going to Let This One Slip Away Too? Bonk (BONK) was the meme coin that made early believers rich, but most people didn’t take it seriously until it was too late. Now, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is presenting the same kind of massive opportunity—but with even more power, features, and earning potential behind it. The BTFD presale is in its 14th stage, with a price of $0.00016, already raising over $5.82 million. When it lists at $0.0006, early investors will see an easy 275% ROI—and that’s just the beginning. With 90% APY staking, a live Play-to-Earn game, and the unstoppable Bulls Squad movement, BTFD is the Top New Meme Coin to Join in February 2025 . So, will you Buy The Dip this time, or will you be kicking yourself six months from now? The choice is yours.

Ethereum MVRV Momentum Has Witnessed A Bearish Crossover As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has declined under its 160-day moving average (MA) recently. The “MVRV Ratio” refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Ethereum market cap and the realized cap. The realized cap here is a capitalization model that calculates ETH’s total valuation by assuming that the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the spot price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain.

This model could also be looked at as a representation of the amount of capital the investors as whole have put into Ethereum. In contrast, the market cap is the value that the holders are carrying right now. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is greater than 1, it means the market cap is greater than the realized cap. Such a trend implies the investors as a whole are sitting on unrealized gains. On the other hand, the metric being under the mark suggests the holders are carrying a lower value than they initially put in, so the average investor could be considered underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Ethereum MVRV Ratio, as well as its 160-day MA, over the past year: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum MVRV Ratio has registered a decline recently as ETH’s price has followed a bearish trajectory. The indicator is still above the 1 mark after this drawdown, suggesting the overall market remains in the green. The metric’s fall, however, has meant that it has slipped under its 160-day MA. The combination of the indicator’s daily value and its 160-day is known as the MVRV Momentum. In the chart, Martinez has highlighted what happened the last time the MVRV Momentum showed a similar pattern as recently.

It would appear that the MVRV Ratio crossing under its 160-day MA led to a 40% price correction for Ethereum last year. It now remains to be seen whether the negative momentum in the indicator would also prove to be bearish for the cryptocurrency this time as well or not. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $3,200, up more than 2% over the last seven days.
