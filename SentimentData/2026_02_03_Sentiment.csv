XRP continues to trade within a prolonged downtrend. Nevertheless, there are technical indications which suggest XRP could soon experience a positive movement. It has been observed, however, that the movement of XRP’s value is largely dependent on the movement of Bitcoin, as opposed to moving towards the establishment of its status as a payment token. As a result, savvy investors are seeking alternatives with a clearer path to short-term appreciation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an alternative which offers an attractive opportunity for investors. It has been newly introduced as a cryptocurrency with a focus on a workable product and a presale. As a result, MUTM has a strong case to achieve a significant milestone in 2026. XRP’s Trajectory Towards $5.00 The path towards an XRP value of $5 faces technical and value-related hurdles. XRP has fallen 7% in a single day and continues to trade within a clear downtrend. Although there has been an increase in ETFs for XRP, there has been a significant increase in the movement of tokens to exchanges, which could create a problem for XRP. As a result, there has been significant resistance built up. It has been observed that the movement of XRP’s value is largely dependent on the movement of Bitcoin, which means it has yet to establish itself as a payment token. As a result, as an investment vehicle, it could potentially take several years to establish itself as a payment token, which could mean waiting around for a significant period of time as opposed to a rapid and precise path towards a value of $5.00. Mutuum Finance Path to Exponential Gains In contrast, Mutuum Finance presents a quantified and time-bound window of entry for investors. The presale offers a clear path for early investors to secure tokens. Mutuum Finance is now on Phase 7, where investors can acquire tokens at $0.04. Phase 8 is expected to see a token value of $0.045 while launch will be higher at $0.06. This creates early pre-launch gains for investors buying today. Analysts estimate a 5x to 8x return on investment for Phase 7 investors immediately after the tokens are available on exchanges. Therefore, an investment of $250 today can secure 6,250 tokens, which can be equivalent to an investment of $2,000 based on a potential 8x return on investment. Dual Lending Model The value proposition of Mutuum Finance is based on its V1 protocol, now active on the Sepolia testnet . The V1 protocol establishes a dual lending system for users to earn yields on their assets. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables users to generate yields on their deposited assets. Therefore, an investment of $5,000 in stablecoins can generate a yield of 12% on investment annually, equivalent to $600 in passive income annually. At the same time, users can also earn yields through a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) market for customized loans on volatile assets such as Shiba Inu and Pepe Coin. The broad appeal of the platform will continue to drive demand for MUTM tokens and support its value. Security and Ongoing Rewards Safeguard Investment One of the main risks associated with any new project is security, which Mutuum Finance has already addressed. The project has also undergone an extensive security audit by Halborn Security, which has been one of the main shortcomings of many failed projects. Moreover, the project has also built an active community by offering instant rewards, such as a $100,000 giveaway with ten winners who will receive $10,000 each. The project also has a leaderboard where the top community member receives a daily bonus of 500 MUTM. A Definitive Path to a 2026 Moonshot While the anticipation for an XRP price breakout is based upon narrative, Mutuum Finance offers a definitive growth trajectory based upon the present reality of the presale being discounted, the fact the protocol is already live, and the strong incentives for holders. As such, many believe the MUTM opportunity represents a strong prospect for high returns for those seeking a moonshot opportunity with strong fundamentals.

The token’s drop below $100 shifted market attention from recovery narratives to damage control. Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Explode: $370 Million Stolen In January Alone: Researchers Traders are now closely watching whether upcoming support levels can halt a decline that has accelerated amid overall weakness in the crypto market. Although network activity and institutional interest continue to draw attention, short-term price movements have clearly shifted into a bearish trend. SOL's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: SOLUSD on Tradingview Solana Price Breaks $100 as Selling Pressure Builds Before bouncing back to the current $102 level, the Solana price dipped to around $98, marking its lowest point in nearly ten months and extending losses to nearly 20% over the past week and approximately 25% over the last month. Trading activity has thinned as prices fell, with spot volume and derivatives participation both declining. Data from CoinGlass shows falling open interest, suggesting long positions are being unwound rather than a surge in aggressive short selling. The move has not occurred in isolation. A wave of market-wide liquidations over the weekend, combined with thin liquidity, amplified downside moves across major cryptocurrencies. Macroeconomic concerns have also weighed on sentiment after renewed expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy following President Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair, a choice viewed as hawkish by markets. Technical Outlook Points to Lower Support Levels From a technical perspective, Solana’s structure has weakened. The break below $100 confirmed a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, with the Solana price hovering well beneath its declining short-term moving averages. Bollinger Bands are widening, and Solana price action remains near the lower band, suggesting downward momentum remains dominant rather than stabilizing. Momentum indicators underline the pressure. The daily relative strength index is hovering near 25, placing SOL deep in oversold territory. While this increases the probability of short-term bounces, it does not, on its own, signal a trend reversal. On the downside, traders are watching the $95 area closely, followed by a broader $92–90 zone. Below that, $85 and $80 stand out as larger historical support levels. Some on-chain and pattern analyses suggest that if selling accelerates, thinner support could expose deeper zones later in the year. Fundamentals Remain Active Despite Weak Price Action Despite the bearish price forecast, Solana’s underlying network metrics remain comparatively strong. January transaction counts rose sharply, and recent data shows continued growth in on-chain activity and stablecoin usage. Institutional interest has been mixed but not absent, with earlier January inflows offset by more recent Solana ETF outflows. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? CMT Reveals What Traders Need To See Now Currently, the technical picture dominates. Solana would need to reclaim $110 and hold above key moving averages to ease bearish pressure.

This Best 100x Crypto Presale Tips the Scale, Flipping Your $200K to Mega Gains",https://timestabloid.com/late-to-pepe-and-flokis-pump-this-best-100x-crypto-presale/,"Crypto fortunes don’t wait; they explode in minutes, not months, and hesitation can cost more than money; it can cost your shot at life-changing gains. Investors who watched Floki and Pepe skyrocket too late know exactly how brutal missed opportunities feel. Now, the moment to act has arrived.

With a precision-engineered presale structure, scarcity-driven tokenomics, and community-powered rewards, APEMARS isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a rocketship for ambitious investors in 2026. For anyone burned by missing Floki or Pepe, this is your chance to rewrite your crypto story. Timing is everything, and the window to secure $APRZ before mainstream attention hits is open, but it won’t stay that way for long. APEMARS ($APRZ): The Best 1000x Crypto with Explosive Presale Momentum APEMARS is not reacting to the market; it’s pulling it forward. The presale is live, Stage 6 is already in motion, and availability is tightening by the hour as demand continues to stack up. This window is hard-capped, the clock is unforgiving, and once the allocation disappears, the system advances without hesitation. No pauses. No rollbacks. No chance to re-enter at this level. At a Stage 6 entry of $0.00004634 and a targeted listing price of $0.0055, the upside is impossible to ignore. The project has already sold 5.89B tokens, generating $144K+ with 691 holders. Early participants at this level are staring at 11,768% potential returns, with projections stretching toward a staggering 18,200% upside as the presale progresses.

Its referral rewards model transforms every holder into a growth catalyst, unlocking bonuses through organic expansion rather than paid hype. Backed directly by its whitepaper, this design ensures APEMARS isn’t just another loud launch; it’s a momentum-driven ecosystem built to compound relevance long after day one. How to Secure APEMARS ($APRZ) Tokens Create a crypto wallet compatible with MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund it with a supported cryptocurrency (ETH, BNB, USDT). Connect to the official APEMARS presale platform. Select your $APRZ allocation and confirm your purchase. Track your tokens until public listing. Secure Position Before Recognition: $2,000 Early Advantage Markets often reward conviction only after awareness spreads. Stage 6 exists before that shift occurs.

Entering early allows value to mature quietly, ensuring gains are realized before demand reshapes valuation. Floki: The Meme Coin That Left Latecomers in Tears Floki entered the crypto scene quietly, almost under the radar, yet its viral appeal quickly turned it into a sensation. Early believers who recognized its potential secured extraordinary returns, sometimes multiplying their investments several hundred times within weeks. Meanwhile, many investors hesitated, waiting for confirmation or dismissing it as just another meme coin. By the time they realized its explosive growth, prices had skyrocketed, and entry points had vanished. The regret of missing Floki was sharp and immediate: what could have been a life-changing opportunity turned into a lesson in hesitation. Floki’s meteoric rise is now a cautionary tale in the crypto world, timing and decisive action often outweigh mere hype awareness. Those who sat on the sidelines were left staring at charts, watching others profit while wondering if they’d ever get another shot at a similar gain. Pepe’s Explosive Surge: Regret for Those Who Waited Pepe’s ascent was a whirlwind, fueled by viral community enthusiasm and meme-driven hype that no one saw coming. Investors who jumped in early enjoyed astronomical returns, as the token surged well beyond initial expectations. But for those who delayed, even by a few days, the opportunity had already evaporated. According to the best crypto to buy now , latecomers were forced to enter at inflated prices, drastically reducing potential upside. Watching Pepe’s price climb while holding out became a painful reminder of how fast fortunes can appear, and disappear, in crypto. The regret was not just financial; it was emotional. Investors who hesitated realized the cost of indecision: missing the exact moments that could have delivered outsized, life-changing returns. Pepe’s story underscores a consistent truth in the market: the crypto clock waits for no one, and hesitation often leads to permanent opportunity loss.

The company started looking for other options last year, and now it’s talking to AMD, Cerebras, and was even talking to Groq before that got shut down. This tension started getting real when OpenAI realized Nvidia’s chips weren’t fast enough for specific things like writing code and handling software-to-software tasks. One insider allegedly said OpenAI wants new chips to handle at least 10% of its inference needs going forward. That’s the part where the AI replies to users, not the part where it learns stuff. OpenAI wants faster chips for coding and user replies Most of OpenAI’s current work still runs on Nvidia, but behind the scenes, it’s testing chips that could make everything faster. This includes chips packed with SRAM, which helps speed things up by putting memory right next to the processor. Nvidia and AMD still use memory that sits outside the chip, which slows things down. People inside OpenAI pointed to Codex, the tool that writes code, as the place where the slowness was the biggest problem. Some staff even blamed the weak performance on Nvidia’s hardware. In a press call on January 30, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, “Customers using our coding models will put a big premium on speed for coding work.” Sam added that regular ChatGPT users don’t care about speed as much, but for developers and companies, every second counts. He said OpenAI had just signed a deal with Cerebras to help speed things up. At the same time, companies like Anthropic and Google are getting better results using their own chips. Google’s TPUs are built specifically for the kind of work inference needs. That’s made them faster at responding, especially for models like Claude and Gemini. OpenAI-Groq talks shut down after Nvidia license deal OpenAI was also in talks with Groq, another startup building fast chips, but those conversations didn’t go far. Nvidia came in and signed a $20 billion licensing deal with Groq. That gave Nvidia access to Groq’s designs and killed OpenAI’s plans to work with them. A source close to the situation said Groq’s chips were built exactly for what OpenAI needed. But once Nvidia locked in the deal, that door closed. Even though the license was non-exclusive, Groq is now focusing on cloud-based software, and Nvidia took some of Groq’s chip designers for itself. Cerebras, on the other hand, said no when Nvidia tried to buy them. Instead, they went ahead and made their own deal with OpenAI. Groq also got investment offers putting its value around $14 billion, but that’s now shifted since it’s tied up with Nvidia. OpenAI hasn’t walked away from Nvidia completely. In a public statement, a spokesperson said, “We rely on Nvidia to power the vast majority of our inference fleet,” and called their performance per dollar the best in the market. Nvidia also said, “Customers continue to choose Nvidia for inference because we deliver the best performance and total cost of ownership at scale.” $100 billion Nvidia investment deal still stuck in limbo Last year, Nvidia said it planned to invest up to $100 billion into OpenAI. That cash was meant to help OpenAI buy more advanced chips, and in return, Nvidia would get a stake in the company. Reuters said the deal was supposed to close in a few weeks. It still hasn’t. While that deal stalled, OpenAI went ahead and signed agreements with AMD and others to test chips that could compete directly with Nvidia’s. But as OpenAI changed its product plans, the kind of hardware it needed also changed. That slowed the talks even more, someone familiar with the situation said. On Saturday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked about the friction. He said, “That’s nonsense,” and insisted Nvidia still plans to invest big in OpenAI. But behind the scenes, it’s clear both sides are exploring their options. At the same time, Nvidia has been shopping for new chip ideas. It reached out to both Cerebras and Groq to see if they’d be open to getting bought. Cerebras turned that down and doubled down on its deal with OpenAI. Right now, OpenAI is using GPT4o to power most of its services. But the way things are going, at least some of that work will run on chips from AMD or Cerebras in the near future. The company isn’t trying to ditch Nvidia completely, but it’s clear it wants more control over how fast its systems work. Get seen where it counts.

Tether and Circle reportedly earn billions in interest on stolen funds instead of turning over the assets to the authorities or returning them to the victims. How does the GENIUS Act fail to protect cryptocurrency investors? In a letter to Congressional leaders , CNN reports that New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg argued that the GENIUS law is a “gift” to crypto companies that are effectively “profiting from fraud.” The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act was signed into law by President Trump in July 2025. It was designed to bring stability to stablecoins and requires companies to back up their coins with safe assets like cash or Treasury bills. However, prosecutors say the law is missing a critical rule that forces companies to give stolen money back to victims. According to the letter, this “loophole” allows the two biggest stablecoin issuers, Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), to keep control of funds even after they have been flagged as stolen. Notably, these companies hold billions of dollars in government bonds to back their coins, and as a result, they earn massive amounts of interest. Prosecutors estimate that in 2024 alone, both companies made roughly $1 billion in profit from these investments. Some of those profits come from the interest earned on money belonging to victims of hacks and “pig butchering” scams. Letitia James and Alvin Bragg pointed out that the GENIUS Act lacks “restitution” language. In traditional banking, if a bank is told by a court that funds are stolen, there are clear paths to return that money, but the GENIUS Act only focuses on making sure companies don’t go bankrupt, and barely touches on how to handle criminal proceeds. The prosecutors allege that when Circle freezes a wallet, it “hoards” the underlying cash instead of sending it to law enforcement or victims and continues to collect interest. As of November 2025, Circle reportedly held more than $114 million in frozen funds. Tether, on the other hand, helps law enforcement on a “case-by-case” basis. The company recently made headlines for freezing $182 million across five wallets on the Tron blockchain on January 11, 2026, but it also argues that it has no “blanket legal obligation” to follow state-level orders, only federal ones. This leaves many victims in New York with no way to get their money back, even if the police know exactly which digital wallet is holding it. Is the crypto industry doing enough to stop international crime? According to the 2026 Crypto Crime Report from Chainalysis, illicit addresses received a record $154 billion in 2025, a 162% increase from the previous year. The report also noted that stablecoins are now the “preferred rail” for criminals. In February 2025, Russian entities launched a ruble-backed token called A7A5 to bypass international sanctions. In less than a year, that single token processed over $93 billion. Nation-states like North Korea are also using stablecoins to hide the $2 billion they stole in 2025, including a massive $1.5 billion hack of the Bybit exchange in early 2025. In the case of local crime, the Brooklyn District Attorney recently indicted a 23-year-old for a $16 million scam where he used AI to impersonate Coinbase employees. These “AI-enabled” scams were found to be 4.5 times more profitable than traditional scams in 2025 because they are so convincing. Prosecutors argue that the GENIUS Act provides an “imprimatur of legitimacy” to the industry without providing the tools to stop these high-tech criminals. The White House Crypto Council is expected to meet with leaders from Coinbase, Ripple, and the American Bankers Association next week to discuss “stablecoin reward” and how to handle interest payments, which the GENIUS Act currently bans issuers from paying to customers. The NY prosecutors addressed their letter to influential Senators like Chuck Schumer and Mark Warner. Warner’s office already responded, stating that protecting victims is “paramount” and that Congress is evaluating if more laws are needed to make sure stolen funds are returned quickly.

His statement directly addresses mounting speculation and provides crucial clarity on exchange wallet mechanics during volatile periods. This development comes as the digital asset sector grapples with significant price corrections and seeks stable footing. Changpeng Zhao Addresses Bitcoin Sale Speculation Head-On Changpeng Zhao, commonly known as CZ, utilized the social media platform X to confront rumors directly. Community chatter had suggested Binance executed a massive, market-moving Bitcoin sell-off. Specifically, analysts pointed to blockchain data indicating large outflows from known exchange wallets. Consequently, many traders blamed these perceived actions for accelerating the sell-off. However, Zhao provided a critical technical explanation. He clarified that the speculation about a $1 billion Bitcoin sale actually stemmed from aggregated user transactions, not corporate action. Exchange wallet balances constantly fluctuate based on user deposit and withdrawal flows. Therefore, interpreting these flows as a single, deliberate sale by the exchange itself is fundamentally incorrect. This distinction is vital for understanding exchange liquidity operations. Market data from the weekend supports this user-driven narrative. On-chain analytics firms reported a synchronized spike in withdrawals across multiple major exchanges, not just Binance. This pattern typically indicates retail investor sentiment shifting rapidly, often in response to fear or external macroeconomic news. Furthermore, large “whale” wallets moved assets into cold storage, signaling a risk-off approach. The confluence of these independent user actions created the appearance of a coordinated sell-off from a single entity. Zhao’s clarification aims to separate exchange operation from user behavior, a nuance often lost in rapid market reporting. The Mechanics of Exchange Wallet Balances To understand Zhao’s rebuttal, one must grasp how centralized exchange wallets function. These wallets are essentially hot wallets that pool user funds for trading efficiency. When a user deposits Bitcoin, it moves into this pooled wallet. Conversely, a user withdrawal pulls from the same pool. The total balance of this wallet is a net figure. A large net outflow does not mean the exchange is selling its corporate treasury; it means more users are withdrawing than depositing. This technical reality is a cornerstone of CZ’s defense. Major analytics platforms sometimes misinterpret these net flows, leading to inaccurate conclusions about exchange intent. SAFU Fund Conversion Plan and Market Implications Beyond addressing the crash, Zhao detailed a significant strategic shift for Binance’s Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU). This emergency insurance fund, established in 2018, protects user assets in extreme scenarios. Zhao confirmed a pre-existing plan to convert the fund’s holdings from stablecoins to Bitcoin. The execution will occur over approximately 30 days. Importantly, the strategy involves incremental purchases on centralized exchanges with sufficient liquidity. This method aims to minimize market impact. The SAFU fund represents a multi-billion dollar pool, so its asset allocation signals long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition as a reserve asset. This conversion carries several implications. First, it demonstrates a institutional-grade treasury management strategy, moving from stable, low-yield assets into a perceived store of value. Second, the phased approach over 30 days shows operational prudence, avoiding a single large market order that could cause volatility. Finally, it aligns with a broader industry trend of crypto-native companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. The announcement, made amidst market turmoil, can be interpreted as a stabilizing signal. It suggests Binance leadership views the current price levels as a strategic accumulation zone for a core asset. Fund Purpose: SAFU is an emergency insurance fund for user protection. Asset Shift: Moving from stablecoins (e.g., USDT, BUSD) to Bitcoin (BTC). Execution Timeline: A 30-day, incremental purchasing plan. Market Strategy: Using liquid CEXs to prevent price disruption. Dismissing the “Supercycle” Narrative and Community Reaction Changpeng Zhao also dismissed a more abstract claim from certain community commentators. Some had suggested he personally “ended the supercycle”—a term referring to an extended, multi-year bullish period for cryptocurrencies. His response was characteristically pragmatic and slightly sardonic. Zhao remarked that if he wielded such singular influence over macroeconomic cycles, he could just as easily restart one. This statement underscores a frequent tension in crypto markets: the attribution of outsized power to individual figures. While founders like CZ are influential, his comment correctly reframes market cycles as products of complex, global factors far beyond any one person’s control. The community reaction to his posts was mixed but generally leaned toward appreciation for the transparency. Many analysts praised the direct communication during a period of high fear and uncertainty. However, skeptics continued to question the timing of the SAFU conversion announcement, wondering if it was meant to bolster market sentiment. Historically, Zhao’s public statements have moved markets, but this instance focused on correction rather than prediction. The episode highlights the intense scrutiny faced by major exchange executives, where every statement is parsed for its potential market impact. Context of the Weekend Market Downturn To fully assess Zhao’s statements, context is essential. The crash occurred over the weekend of March 15-16, 2025. Bitcoin fell over 15% in 48 hours, dragging down the entire altcoin market. Several factors likely contributed beyond any exchange-specific rumors: Potential Factor Description Evidence/Context Macroeconomic Pressures Rising global interest rates and inflation concerns. Traditional equity markets also showed weakness. Liquidity Crunch Thin weekend trading volumes amplify price moves. Common pattern in crypto markets; large orders have outsized impact. Derivatives Liquidations Cascade of leveraged long positions being force-closed. Data shows over $1B in long liquidations across exchanges. Regulatory Anxiety Uncertainty surrounding pending legislation in key markets. News flow from US and EU regulators increased that week. This multi-causal backdrop makes attributing the crash to a single entity’s actions reductive. Zhao’s comments serve to remove Binance from the list of direct catalysts, redirecting analysis toward these broader, systemic issues. Experts from firms like CoinMetrics and Glassnode have since published data corroborating the multi-factor explanation, noting that exchange net flows were just one piece of a complex puzzle. Conclusion Changpeng Zhao’s detailed rebuttal provides essential clarity in a market often driven by rumor. He successfully distinguishes between user-driven wallet flows and corporate exchange actions, explains a major strategic shift for the SAFU fund, and dismisses hyperbolic claims about personal market influence. For investors and observers, the key takeaway is the importance of scrutinizing on-chain data narratives and understanding the operational realities of major platforms like Binance. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, transparent communication from industry leaders during volatile periods remains a critical component of overall ecosystem stability and trust. The denial from Changpeng Zhao underscores this evolving standard of accountability. FAQs Q1: What exactly did Changpeng Zhao deny? Changpeng Zhao denied that Binance, as a company, sold a large amount of Bitcoin to cause the market crash. He clarified that observed wallet outflows were due to aggregated user withdrawals, not a corporate sell-off. Q2: What is the SAFU fund, and what is changing? The Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) is Binance’s emergency insurance fund. Zhao announced a plan to convert its holdings from stablecoins to Bitcoin over 30 days via incremental purchases to avoid market disruption. Q3: What did Zhao mean by “ending the supercycle”? Some community members jokingly blamed Zhao for ending a long-term bull market (a “supercycle”). He dismissed this, humorously noting that if he had that much power, he could restart it just as easily. Q4: What were the real causes of the crypto crash? Experts point to a combination of factors: thin weekend liquidity, a cascade of leveraged position liquidations, broader macroeconomic worries, and regulatory uncertainty, rather than actions by a single exchange. Q5: Why is the distinction between user and exchange actions important? This distinction is crucial for accurate market analysis. User withdrawals reflect crowd sentiment and risk management, while an exchange selling its treasury could indicate internal issues. Confusing the two leads to incorrect conclusions about market health.

The deal was confirmed Monday when the company published a memo from Elon Musk on its website. Elon wrote:- “SpaceX has acquired xAI to form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth.” This merger now officially links a dominant rocket company with an AI startup that’s still early in its development. Elon’s xAI is competing with OpenAI, Anthropic, and others that are already way ahead in building large language models. Now, by connecting xAI to SpaceX, Elon is bringing rockets, satellites, and artificial intelligence into one machine, and that machine just happens to be entirely his. The AI Wars continue to get more and more interesting. Elon plans to use space-based power for AI In his announcement memo, Elon said current AI demand for electricity can’t be handled by Earth-based data centers alone. He said space will be needed to scale AI further. Elon wants to build orbital data centers powered by solar energy collected in space. He’s been talking about this idea for a while on X and at events. Now, with this deal, the pieces are all in his hands. Elon claims that he has always believed the only way to build AI that can keep growing is to get it off Earth, so the plan is to collect power from the sun using satellites, then send that energy directly to computers running in space. Buying SpaceX shares pre-IPO is a nightmare for regular people Even though many want in on SpaceX ahead of the blockbuster IPO, investing in the company right now is nearly impossible. If you’re not an employee or early investor, you’re locked out. Your best shot is being rich. The U.S. only allows accredited investors to buy this type of stock. That means you need to earn over $200,000 per year for two years, or have a $1 million net worth not counting your house. And let’s say you do qualify. You’ll still need to find someone who already owns shares and is willing to sell. That might be a former employee or venture capitalist. Wealth managers at firms like UBS or Morgan Stanley might be able to help you track one down. But SpaceX often blocks these deals. The company doesn’t like letting in new people without screening them. Even if the seller agrees, SpaceX might say no. That’s why unrestricted shares sell at higher prices. They’re rare. The company also doesn’t like updating the registry when shares change hands. This makes private transactions harder. Special-purpose vehicles and public funds offer some exposure One workaround would be to buy into special-purpose vehicles, or SPVs. These are investment funds that hold large pools of SpaceX shares. People can buy small chunks of the fund. This lets you get exposure to the company without owning shares directly. But you’ll need at least $100,000 and will still pay management fees. It’s legal, but expensive. Platforms like Hiive and Rainmaker Securities let you browse nonpublic stocks. They vet sellers and buyers. You can compare prices and volume. But again, these shares might not be available when you look. And you’ll need six figures to play. If none of that works, some mutual funds like Ron Baron’s $9.7 billion Baron Partners Fund, which has put over 25% of its portfolio into the company. Interval funds also offer access. The $1.1 billion Private Shares Fund has nearly 14% of its assets in SpaceX. It charges a 1.9% fee and limits when you can pull money out. Cathie Wood’s ARK Venture Fund has about $500 million in assets and counts SpaceX as its top holding. That one charges 2.75% in fees and has similar limits. There are ETFs too. The ERShares Private-Public Crossover ETF, known as XOVR, went from $200 million to $1.6 billion after people found out it held a slice of SpaceX through an SPV. Baron also got an ETF called RONB, which has about 16% in SpaceX. If all of that fails, there’s always Tesla. Elon said in 2024 that he’d reward loyal shareholders if his private companies ever go public. We were there.

Here’s The Truth",https://bitcoinist.com/satoshi-nakamoto-sell-10000-bitcoin/,"A viral post on the social media platform X recently claimed that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, just sold 10,000 BTC. An attached screenshot purported to show on-chain data supporting the claim, and the rumor quickly garnered attention on the social media platform. The ramifications of such a sale are huge because Nakamoto’s stash is untouched going back to the earliest days of Bitcoin mining. However, a closer look into blockchain records tells a very different story. Investigating The Rumor Of Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin Sale According to a post on X by a crypto account with the username Discover, Satoshi Nakamoto recently moved 10,000 BTC from its long-dormant wallet. The report suggests that over $760 million worth of Bitcoin had been sold by its creator, a move that could cause further harm to its price action, which is already fragile and trading with prevailing bearish momentum. The image shared with the rumor appears to be taken from Arkham Intelligence, a popular on-chain analytics platform. The screenshot, which is shown below, highlights the outflow of 10,000 BTC into account ‘bc1qcj,’ with the last transfer being 12 years ago. However, the records in this screenshot do not align with the real ledger of Bitcoin transactions. Closer inspection of on-chain transactions on Arkham Intelligence shows there is no evidence of a single transfer of 10,000 BTC attributed to at least one known address linked to Nakamoto. The real data shows no outflow from Nakamoto’s wallets for over 12 years. Instead, small fractions of Bitcoin, almost negligible in the context of Satoshi’s holdings, have been flowing in. These tiny movements are likely dust or micro-transactions occurring as part of normal blockchain activity, with the last being an inflow of 0.0000329 six days ago. Why The Rumor? The identity and actions of Satoshi Nakamoto have always been a source of speculation among crypto investors. Nakamoto is the largest holder of Bitcoin, believed to have mined somewhere around 1 million Bitcoin in the early years of the network, but he has been quiet since April 2011. Therefore, any suggestion that those coins have suddenly started moving is enough to grab headlines and cause reactions. That context likely contributed to why this post attracted enough views quickly, even though the data was inaccurate. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows Nakamoto’s BTC wallets currently hold 1.096 million BTC, which are worth $84.3 billion. Notably, Bitcoin’s price itself has been trending through significant volatility. Over the past few days, Bitcoin has dipped to levels near this cycle’s lows, trading around the mid-$70,000 range, close to the lowest levels since April 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $76,872, having recently reached an intraday low of $74,591, according to data from CoinGecko.",Bitcoin News|Arkham Intelligence|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CoinGecko|Discover|Satoshi Nakamoto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|ARKM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-02-02 23:30:29

This amounts to an 11% drop in a matter of days, while PEPE’s current price means that it has declined by 14% in a week and by 31% in a month, while the meme token – currently the 57th-biggest coin in the market – has also suffered a 66% fall in the past year. These are hugely disappointing drops, but indicators are increasingly suggesting that PEPE is close to bottoming out, and that it could rebound strongly soon. This is evident with its MVRV long-short difference indicator , which is about to turn positive after several months in negative territory, as long-term holders begin to dominate its market once again. Pepe’s MVRV long/short difference chart up until the start of January. Source: Santiment A level above 0 indicates that long-term holders predominate in terms of profits, while it also implies a shakeout from which the PEPE price could regain strongly once again. When combined with the meme token’s enduring popularity and its other oversold indicators, the PEPE price prediction is starting to look very strong again. Pepe Coin Price Prediction: Price Looks Dead, But Smart Holders Are Taking Control Behind the Scenes As we can see from the PEPE price chart below, the coin has hit what looks like a real bottom, with its indicators having fallen more or less as low as they can go. Its relative strength index (yellow) has dropped to 30 in the past few hours, and PEPE has begun to show signs of bouncing back up already, having gained by 1% in the past hour. Source: TradingView Its MACD (red, green) is also at a low point, while we can see from its actual price action that it’s testing its long-term support of $0.0000040. There’s a very good chance that it could rebound from this level and make some quick gains, although further falls below this key area could predict a severe decline. However, as the aforementioned MVRV long-short difference indicator suggests, the balance is shifting back to long-term holders and accumulators, so eventually the only direction will be up. We could therefore see the PEPE price return to $0.00000450 within the next week, while its target for the end of Q1 is $0.0000070. Longer term, we could see it reach $0.000010 by H2 and then end the year at $0.000020.

This announcement, made public on April 2, 2025, signals the exchange’s continued exploration of emerging blockchain sectors, specifically artificial intelligence and real-world asset tokenization. Consequently, this development provides crucial visibility for the involved projects and offers investors a transparent window into Coinbase’s potential future offerings. Coinbase Listing Roadmap: A Gateway to Mainstream Adoption The Coinbase Asset Roadmap functions as a critical transparency tool within the cryptocurrency industry. Importantly, it does not guarantee a listing. Instead, the platform uses it to signal which digital assets it is actively evaluating for potential future support. This process involves rigorous technical, compliance, and legal reviews. Therefore, an addition to the roadmap represents a major milestone for any project, often leading to increased market attention and trading volume on other platforms. Historically, the roadmap has highlighted tokens across various sectors before their eventual listing. For instance, this mechanism has previously introduced decentralized finance (DeFi) and layer-2 scaling tokens to a broader audience. The inclusion of DEEP and WAL suggests Coinbase’s research teams are deepening their analysis of two distinct but growing niches: AI-driven blockchain infrastructure and tokenized real-world assets (RWA). Understanding the DEEP Token Project The DEEP token is intrinsically linked to a decentralized AI computing network. This platform aims to create a marketplace for GPU power, specifically designed for training and running large AI models. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project seeks to democratize access to expensive computational resources. Developers can rent necessary processing power, while hardware providers can monetize their idle GPUs. Key technical features of the DEEP ecosystem include: Decentralized Compute Marketplace: Connects suppliers of GPU power with AI developers and researchers. Proof-of-Compute Consensus: A mechanism that validates work done and facilitates secure payments within the network. DEEP Token Utility: The token is used for paying for compute services, rewarding hardware providers, and participating in network governance. The project’s backers often cite the explosive growth in AI demand as a primary catalyst. They argue that traditional cloud providers create centralized points of failure and cost. A blockchain-based alternative could offer more resilient and potentially cost-effective solutions. Coinbase’s evaluation of DEEP indicates institutional recognition of the convergence between AI and crypto. Examining the WAL Token and Real-World Assets In contrast, the WAL token operates within the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector. This project focuses on creating blockchain-based representations of physical assets, such as commodities, real estate, or treasury bills. The core proposition involves increasing liquidity, enabling fractional ownership, and improving transparency in traditionally opaque markets. The WAL protocol typically facilitates the minting, trading, and custody of these tokenized assets. Its architecture is designed to ensure regulatory compliance and accurate asset backing. The token itself often serves dual purposes: governing the protocol’s development and paying transaction fees associated with asset minting and transfers. The rise of RWA tokenization is supported by substantial data. For example, major financial institutions like BlackRock have launched tokenized funds on public blockchains. This trend validates the sector’s potential to bridge traditional finance with decentralized technology. Coinbase’s consideration of WAL aligns with its broader strategy to cater to institutional clients seeking exposure to tokenized traditional assets. Comparison of DEEP and WAL Token Fundamentals Feature DEEP Token WAL Token Primary Sector Artificial Intelligence & Compute Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Core Utility Pay for compute, reward providers, governance Protocol governance, pay transaction fees Market Trend Convergence of AI and blockchain Institutional adoption of tokenized assets Potential Impact Democratize AI development resources Unlock liquidity for physical assets Immediate Market Reaction and Analyst Perspectives Following the roadmap announcement, trading activity for both DEEP and WAL typically increases on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other supporting centralized platforms. Market analysts note that this “roadmap effect” can lead to short-term volatility. However, the more significant impact is the long-term credibility and liquidity a potential Coinbase listing can provide. Industry experts emphasize that Coinbase’s due diligence process remains stringent. A roadmap addition is merely the first step in a multi-stage review. The exchange must ensure the assets meet all security standards, legal requirements, and have sufficient market integrity. Furthermore, the final decision to list involves assessing liquidity depth, custody solutions, and overall customer demand. From a regulatory standpoint, evaluating tokens like WAL involves complex considerations around securities laws and asset custody. Similarly, DEEP’s model intersects with data privacy and computational law. Coinbase’s engagement with these projects demonstrates its commitment to navigating these evolving frameworks, potentially setting precedents for the wider industry. Strategic Implications for the Crypto Ecosystem Coinbase’s decision to highlight these two particular assets is not random. It reflects a strategic curation based on market research and future growth projections. The AI and RWA sectors are frequently identified in analyst reports as having substantial total addressable markets (TAM). By positioning itself early, Coinbase aims to capture trading volume from these emerging trends. This move also exerts a powerful influence on the development priorities of other blockchain projects. Seeing a major exchange reward innovation in specific sectors can incentivize developers to build in those areas. Consequently, the roadmap acts as a subtle but powerful signal that guides capital and talent within the crypto industry. It fosters a competitive environment where utility and real-world application become paramount for recognition. For retail and institutional investors, the roadmap provides a valuable research starting point. It highlights projects that have passed an initial, non-trivial filter from a regulated U.S. entity. Investors can then perform their own due diligence on these assets, understanding they are on the radar of a leading gatekeeper to mainstream finance. Conclusion The addition of DEEP and WAL to the Coinbase listing roadmap represents a forward-looking assessment of the cryptocurrency landscape. It underscores the exchange’s focus on assets that bridge blockchain technology with tangible, high-growth sectors like artificial intelligence and real-world finance. While a final listing is not guaranteed, the inclusion alone grants significant validation and visibility to both projects. Ultimately, this development highlights the ongoing maturation of the crypto market, where utility, compliance, and real-world impact increasingly dictate which assets gain access to premier trading platforms. The Coinbase listing roadmap continues to serve as a critical barometer for identifying the next wave of innovation within the digital asset space. FAQs Q1: Does adding a token to the Coinbase roadmap mean it will definitely be listed? A1: No. Addition to the roadmap indicates Coinbase is formally evaluating the asset for a potential future listing. The project must still pass technical, security, and legal compliance reviews, and listing is not guaranteed. Q2: What is the DEEP token used for? A2: The DEEP token powers a decentralized network for AI computing. Its primary utilities include paying for GPU compute resources, rewarding hardware providers, and participating in the network’s governance decisions. Q3: What does WAL tokenize? A3: WAL is associated with real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. This involves creating blockchain-based digital representations of physical assets like commodities, real estate, or financial instruments to enable fractional ownership and improved liquidity. Q4: How long does it take from roadmap addition to listing? A4: There is no set timeline. The evaluation period can vary significantly—from weeks to several months—depending on the complexity of the asset, regulatory clarity, and the outcome of Coinbase’s internal reviews. Q5: Why is Coinbase’s roadmap important for the crypto market? A5: The roadmap provides transparency into the exchange’s evaluation process, signals emerging sectors it deems promising, and offers a credibility boost to projects under consideration, influencing broader market attention and investor research.

The token recently dropped to $0.00000617, continuing a downward trend that has accelerated over the past week. The broader market has faced significant pressure, with liquidations in the past 24 hours reaching $2.45 billion. Long positions make up the majority of these losses, approximately $2.27 billion, while short positions accounted for $180 million. This difference in impact on long traders shows that many were caught off guard by the market’s sudden decline after weeks of relatively stable price action. Alongside the price drop, Shiba Inu’s open interest in derivatives markets also contracted. According to CoinGlass, SHIB’s open interest fell by 11% to $75.74 million. Futures trading volume experienced a sharp 193% decline within the same period, suggesting that traders are reducing their exposure and adjusting risk at a time of heightened volatility. The combination of thin weekend liquidity and declining trading activity has increased downward pressure, contributing to larger price swings. Price Movement Shiba Inu recently fell to $0.00000617, representing its lowest level in nearly three years. Since its January 5th peak of $0.00001008, the asset has steadily retraced, showing that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching oversold territory near 30. This technical indicator suggests that while the market remains weak, a short-term rebound could be possible. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In the event of a price recovery, potential resistance levels are located at $0.00000785, $0.00001008, and $0.00001047. On the other hand, if selling continues, immediate support is likely to be found around $0.0000055. Analysts note that these levels will be critical in determining the token’s next move. Sell-offs Follow Similar Patterns Lucie, a Shiba Inu team member, addressed the current market condition, highlighting the recurring nature of crypto sell-offs and how they often follow similar patterns. Lucie goes further to point out that navigating the crypto space requires a resilient community and consistent focus rather than trying to calculate every move. Shiba Inu is currently facing challenges from market-wide sell-offs, declining open interest, and reduced liquidity. However, the approaching technical support and potential for a short-term recovery encourage traders to monitor price action closely in the coming sessions for a possible cautious re-entry.

This move, reported by blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, immediately captures the attention of investors and analysts worldwide, prompting a deep dive into the context and potential implications for the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Consequently, the market watches closely for any signal from one of its most influential figures. Vitalik Buterin ETH Sale: Parsing the On-Chain Data Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain identified the transaction on February 21, 2025. The data shows the address transferred 493 ETH to a known exchange deposit address over an eight-hour period. Importantly, blockchain analysis often links wallets to public figures through patterns of historical transactions, public donations, or interactions with verified addresses. However, definitive, real-world attribution remains technically unconfirmed without a direct statement. Therefore, analysts rely on probabilistic clustering and behavioral heuristics. Market participants frequently monitor such high-profile wallets for several key reasons. First, they can signal personal financial strategy. Second, they may indicate perspectives on network health. Third, large sales can temporarily affect liquidity and sentiment. Historically, transactions from founder-linked addresses have caused short-term price volatility, though long-term impacts are often negligible. For context, Ethereum’s price showed minimal immediate reaction, suggesting a mature market response. Understanding Founder Token Movements in Cryptocurrency The movement of tokens by project founders is a common yet closely watched event in digital asset markets. Unlike corporate insiders in traditional finance, blockchain founders often hold substantial token allocations from a network’s inception. Their transactions are public, transparent, and analyzed in real-time. This creates a unique dynamic of radical transparency paired with intense speculation. Several legitimate reasons exist for such sales. Founders may diversify personal holdings, cover fiat-denominated expenses like taxes or operational costs, or make planned charitable donations. Vitalik Buterin has a documented history of using his ETH holdings for philanthropic grants and funding ecosystem development. A sale does not inherently reflect a negative outlook on Ethereum’s technology or price potential. Instead, it often represents routine portfolio management. Comparative Analysis of Historical Founder Sales Examining past data provides crucial context. The table below summarizes notable historical sales from high-profile cryptocurrency founders, illustrating that such activity is a normal part of the ecosystem. Founder / Figure Approximate Sale Value Year Noted Context Vitalik Buterin (This Event) $1.16 Million 2025 493 ETH sold via exchange deposit Vitalik Buterin (Previous) ~$4.4 Million 2023 Largely attributed to charitable giving Changpeng Zhao (Binance) Various Ongoing Regular, disclosed transactions as part of exchange operations Early Bitcoin Developers Varies Widely 2011-2017 Often related to early mining rewards and portfolio rebalancing This comparative view demonstrates that founder activity is neither novel nor necessarily alarming. The market has progressively matured in its interpretation of these events, moving from reactive sentiment to more measured analysis. Market Impact and Analyst Reactions to the ETH Transaction The immediate market impact of the $1.16 million ETH sale appears contained. Ethereum’s price saw only fractional movement following the news, indicating robust market depth and resilience. Major analysts from firms like CoinShares and IntoTheBlock provided quick commentary, generally downplaying the event’s significance for Ethereum’s fundamental outlook. They emphasized the relatively small size of the sale against Buterin’s known holdings and the total market capitalization of ETH, which exceeds $400 billion. Key metrics monitored after such events include: Exchange Netflow: Tracking if the sale increases selling pressure on exchanges. Social Sentiment: Analyzing social media buzz for fear or uncertainty. Derivatives Data: Reviewing futures funding rates for trader positioning. On-Chain Support Levels: Identifying major holder cost bases below the current price. Data from Glassnode and CryptoQuant showed no abnormal outflow patterns or depletion of exchange reserves following the transaction. This evidence suggests the sale was absorbed efficiently by market makers and buyers. Furthermore, the transaction’s transparency exemplifies the core blockchain principle of auditable activity, even for its most prominent creators. The Role of Analytics Platforms Like Lookonchain Platforms such as Lookonchain play a critical role in modern cryptocurrency markets. They provide real-time surveillance of blockchain activity, transforming raw transaction data into actionable intelligence. Their identification of this sale relies on sophisticated address labeling techniques and clustering algorithms. These tools track the flow of funds across millions of addresses, linking them to entities like exchanges, investment funds, and individuals based on behavioral patterns and publicly available information. This ecosystem of analysts ensures market transparency and informs participants, contributing to price discovery and efficient markets. Broader Context: Ethereum’s Development and Ecosystem Health To fully understand this event, one must view it within Ethereum’s current trajectory. The network continues to undergo significant development, most notably the completion of “The Merge” to Proof-of-Stake and ongoing scalability upgrades like proto-danksharding. Ecosystem health metrics remain strong, with consistent growth in: Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized finance. Daily Active Addresses on the network. Developer Activity and commits to core repositories. Layer 2 Adoption reducing mainnet congestion and fees. A single transaction from a founder, while newsworthy, does not alter these fundamental pillars. The Ethereum community and investment thesis are built on technological utility, decentralization, and network effects, not the personal portfolio decisions of any single individual. This resilience is a hallmark of a mature cryptographic network. Conclusion The reported Vitalik Buterin ETH sale of $1.16 million serves as a case study in blockchain transparency and market maturity. While the transaction draws immediate attention due to the founder’s profile, analysis reveals it as a likely routine financial maneuver within a vast and growing ecosystem. The muted market reaction, combined with strong underlying network fundamentals, suggests investors are increasingly focusing on long-term value drivers over individual transactions. This event ultimately underscores the transparent nature of public blockchains, where every move is visible, analyzable, and contextualized by a global audience of participants. FAQs Q1: Was this definitely Vitalik Buterin selling his ETH? A1: Blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain use sophisticated methods to link addresses to individuals based on historical transaction patterns. While strongly suspected to belong to Vitalik Buterin, absolute on-chain confirmation is impossible without a direct statement, as wallets are pseudonymous by design. Q2: Why would Vitalik Buterin sell Ethereum? A2: There are many common reasons, including personal financial diversification, covering tax obligations, funding living expenses, or allocating capital to philanthropic causes, which he has done extensively in the past. A sale does not automatically indicate a lack of faith in Ethereum. Q3: How did the Ethereum price react to this sale? A3: The market reaction was minimal. Ethereum’s price exhibited only minor fluctuations, demonstrating significant market depth and a mature investor base that weighs fundamental factors over individual transactions. Q4: How significant is a $1.16 million sale for the Ethereum market? A4: In context, it is a very small transaction. Ethereum’s daily trading volume regularly exceeds $10 billion, and its market capitalization is over $400 billion. The sale represents a tiny fraction of overall market activity. Q5: Should investors be concerned about founders selling their tokens? A5: Not inherently. Founder sales are a normal part of the lifecycle of digital asset projects. Investors should focus on broader ecosystem health, technological development, adoption metrics, and network usage rather than individual wallet activity.

Sitting in the Oval Office, he said, “I don’t know about it. I know that crypto is a big thing.” When pressed, he said, “My sons are handling that. My family is handling it. And I guess they get investments from different people.” The $500 million deal came just four days before Trump’s 2025 inauguration. People working for Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a powerful figure from the United Arab Emirates, signed an agreement with Eric Trump to buy a 49 percent stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto company linked to the Trump family. The Wall Street Journal said the first half of the payment, $250 million, had already been sent. Out of that, $187 million went straight to businesses connected to the Trump family. Money divided among Trump allies and crypto founders The rest of that first installment didn’t go to strangers. $31 million was funneled to a company tied to the family of Steve Witkoff, one of the company’s co-founders and a U.S. Middle East envoy. Another $31 million was paid to a group tied to Zak Folkman and Chase Herro, the other two co-founders of World Liberty Financial. This deal raised eyebrows in Washington. Sheikh Tahnoon has close ties with American officials. He also runs Group 42 Holding, a tech investment company. That firm got approval last year to buy high-end AI chips from Nvidia, AMD, and Cerebras Systems, after talks held with White House officials. A spokesperson for World Liberty Financial, David Wachsman, told Bloomberg, “Neither President Trump nor Steve Witkoff had any involvement whatsoever in this transaction and have had no involvement in World Liberty Financial since taking office.” He added, “The company made the deal in question for its own interest.” Wachsman went on to say, “The idea that, when raising capital, a privately held American company should be held to some unique standard that no other similar company would be held to is both ridiculous and un-American.” Trump pushes crypto message, says China would take over without U.S. leadership During the same press event, Trump made it clear he supports crypto. The 47th president was speaking while announcing the U.S. Strategic Critical Minerals Reserve. He was joined by Mary Barrow, the CEO of General Motors, and Robert Friedland, the co-chair of Ivanhoe Mines, along with several members of Congress and U.S. trade officials. Trump said , “Crypto is a big thing and they like it. A lot of people like it. The people behind me like it. My sons are handling that. My family is handling it. I guess they get investments from different people, but I’m not.” He continued, “I have all I can handle right now with Iran, Russia, Ukraine, and everything else we’re doing. So I don’t know. I don’t know exactly other than, I’m a big crypto person. I’m the one that probably helped crypto more than anybody because I believe in it.” He said the reason he believes in it is simple. “If we don’t do it, then China is going to do it. Right? If we don’t do crypto, then China is going to do it. And it’s just like AI. We’re leading AI by a lot. And if we weren’t leading, China would have led. They’re very capable. They’re very good.” Trump links crypto to stablecoin bills and U.S. digital power Trump also pointed to the legislation his team pushed to help the crypto world grow. “We did the Genius Act for stablecoins,” he said. He noted that people behind him at the event were working on the Clarity Bill, a law designed to make it easier for companies and developers to understand the rules around digital assets. “We’re bringing U.S. best practices to the new industry. Digital assets. Innovation. And it spreads everywhere. So the U.S. is leading,” Trump said. Then he looked back at the reporters and added, “And do you agree that if we didn’t do it, China and others would? But China would.” He finished that thought bluntly. “China would have had the lead. Then others around the world in terrible places would be doing it.” Throughout the entire press event, Trump focused on crypto, AI, and tech leadership. He barely mentioned the $500 million UAE investment again. When asked, he just repeated, “I don’t know about it.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

XRP Is Fast Approaching Its Realized Price In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about where XRP is currently trading with respect to its Realized Price. This on-chain indicator measures the cost basis or acquisition price of the average address on the blockchain. When the spot price of the cryptocurrency is trading above this metric, it means the investors as a whole can be assumed to be in a state of profit. On the other hand, it being below the indicator suggests the majority of the supply is underwater. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross That Last Preceded A 66% Drop Is Back Now, here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the XRP Realized Price over the last several years: As is visible in the above graph, the XRP spot price has been above the Realized Price since 2024, indicating that holders have been enjoying net unrealized gains. The degree of profitability, however, hasn’t been constant in this period. The asset’s price had the largest gap over the metric back in late 2024, owing to a fast bull rally. Then, over the first three quarters of 2025, profitability gradually dropped as tokens changed hands at higher levels, leading to an increase in the Realized Price. The indicator hit a plateau in the last quarter of the year, but the bearish shift in the asset meant that it was now the price’s turn to approach the line, cutting back on average investor profits further. This trend has deepened recently. Following the sector-wide crash during the past week, XRP has come dangerously close to the Realized Price, which now sits at $1.48. “The current market structure is very similar to that of April 2022,” noted the analytics firm. Back then, the asset was transitioning to a bear market and its price fell to the Realized Price. That retest failed, and what followed was a steep move down that eventually led to the cycle low. Given the proximity that the current XRP price has to the indicator, it now remains to be seen whether a retest will occur in the near future and if it would lead to further bearish action like in 2022.

In a new court filing , the creator of ChatGPT also claims that pivotal internal communications at xAI were deliberately erased just as they were getting closer to filing suit, putting OpenAI and other defendants at a disadvantage. In documents it filed on Monday in a U.S. federal court, OpenAI accused xAI of what it described as the “systematic and intentional destruction” of evidence. According to OpenAI, xAI directed its employees to use messaging tools that auto-delete messages after a set timeframe, even though the company was aware it was planning to file a lawsuit and thus had a duty to maintain records. OpenAI said those disappearing messages affected “every aspect of xAI’s business,” including talking points central to the antitrust case now before the court. Musk’s xAI challenges Apple and OpenAI over ChatGPT deal Musk’s social media platform X and xAI filed an antitrust lawsuit against OpenAI and Apple Inc. in August. Musk’s companies argue that by embedding ChatGPT directly into Apple’s devices, especially the iPhone, Apple has effectively given OpenAI a powerful advantage over competing chatbots. These include xAI’s own product, Grok , which is closely tied to the X platform. The suit seeks billions of dollars in damages and argues that smaller or newer AI companies are being locked out of crucial markets. OpenAI and Apple have denied the claims, arguing that integrating ChatGPT does not prevent other AI tools from competing or being accessed by users. Yet despite these denials, in November a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, decided the case could proceed, allowing the plaintiffs to pursue their arguments in court. In its latest filing, OpenAI also traced the lawsuit to a long-standing personal and professional feud between Elon Musk and OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman. Musk and Altman co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit research lab founded in 2015. Musk left OpenAI’s board in 2018, and the relationship between the two has soured since then, with Musk frequently criticizing the company’s direction and governance. The filing states that OpenAI had asked xAI for documents to support its argument that Apple’s partnership with OpenAI prevented xAI from entering the generative AI market. But OpenAI says it got nothing of substance. OpenAI launches standalone Codex app for Apple computers Despite the ongoing legal battle, OpenAI continues product development, announcing the launch of its Codex app for Apple computers on the same day as the court filing. The new app has a simple interface and is designed to serve as a “command center” that makes it easy for software developers to manage multiple AI agents at once, OpenAI said. An AI agent is a tool that can independently complete tasks, like writing code, on behalf of a user. Previously, Codex was primarily accessible to users via web-based tools or tools in other software. This standalone app is designed to provide developers and technical users with a closer, more focused experience, allowing them to focus on code on macOS devices. OpenAI notes that the app lets users interact directly with Codex on their desktops, making it easier to create code snippets, test applications, and explore various coding concepts without switching between tools. But with the app’s launch on Monday, OpenAI said it is also making Codex available to its free users and to its low-cost Go subscription tier for a limited time.

Traditional carbon credits have long relied on paper-based certificates and centralized registries, facing challenges in transparency, operational efficiency, and verifiability. Recently, Carbon Removal Credit (CRC) officially launched its Carbon Asset NFT framework, introducing on-chain digital identity mechanisms for carbon credits through blockchain technology. This initiative explores technical pathways to enhance transparency, traceability, and data consistency in carbon asset management. According to CRC, the core of its Carbon Asset NFT framework lies in mapping carbon emission reductions that comply with major international standards — such as VCS, Gold Standard, and ISO 14064 — into on-chain NFT assets. Each NFT corresponds to a specific volume of emission reductions and records key metadata on-chain, including project origin, certification body, reduction volume, and geographic information. This approach transforms carbon credits from traditional centralized records into digital assets with unique on-chain identifiers, enabling easier querying and verification by multiple stakeholders. CRC stated that introducing digital identities for carbon assets through NFTs represents one of its technical practices to enhance transparency and traceability. The immutability of blockchain technology helps reduce the risk of unilateral data modification, allowing project information and asset status to be stored and displayed on-chain in a more consistent manner, thereby providing clearer data references for market participants. On the CRC platform, Carbon Asset NFTs can be traded and transferred within a decentralized environment. Users may purchase and transfer carbon assets and utilize the “Retire” function to mark corresponding NFTs as used for carbon offsetting. These actions are recorded on-chain via smart contracts, generating queryable retirement records that reflect the usage status of each carbon asset. This mechanism helps reduce the risk of duplicate usage and provides enterprises with verifiable on-chain records for carbon neutrality and ESG disclosures. At the same time, CRC is exploring technical integration between off-chain monitoring data and on-chain assets. Through Oracle technology and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, monitoring data from selected carbon reduction projects may be synchronized on-chain to support the presentation of project operational status. The combination of off-chain data with on-chain assets helps enhance the completeness of carbon asset information, while continuing to operate in coordination with existing certification and audit frameworks. From a technical application perspective, introducing carbon credits in NFT form helps improve the identifiability and manageability of carbon assets in digital environments, providing new tools for the digital management of carbon markets. Enterprises, investors, and relevant institutions can use CRC’s on-chain explorer tools to query basic asset information, transaction records, and retirement status, thereby improving traceability in carbon asset usage processes. CRC also noted that the Carbon Asset NFT framework introduces additional technical possibilities for product design and application scenarios in carbon markets. Within existing compliance and regulatory frameworks, the tokenization of carbon credits may support more flexible digital management approaches, providing foundational infrastructure for exploring new operational models and system integrations. To date, Carbon Removal Credit (CRC) has connected with multiple carbon reduction projects and continues to advance on-chain digital management practices for carbon assets. CRC stated that it will continue to improve data standardization and on-chain management mechanisms under existing certification systems and regulatory frameworks, providing infrastructure-level technical support for the ongoing digitalization of carbon markets.

This figure, reported by data provider Alternative.me, represents a state of ‘Extreme Fear’ and underscores the persistent caution dominating digital asset trading floors worldwide. Consequently, understanding this critical sentiment gauge becomes essential for any market participant navigating the current landscape. Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a daily barometer for investor psychology within the digital asset space. Fundamentally, it quantifies the emotional temperature of the market on a scale from 0 to 100. A score approaching 0 signals ‘Extreme Fear,’ often correlating with potential buying opportunities from a contrarian perspective. Conversely, a score nearing 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed,’ which can precede market corrections. The index’s current position at 17, a mere three-point rise from previous lows, clearly signals that fear remains the dominant market force. This metric is not a simple survey; it is a composite index derived from multiple data-driven sources. The algorithm synthesizes these inputs to produce a single, digestible figure. The specific weightings, as defined by Alternative.me, provide a transparent view of its construction: Data Source Weighting What It Measures Market Volatility 25% Price swings and stability of major assets like Bitcoin. Market Volume & Momentum 25% Trading activity and the strength of price movements. Social Media Sentiment 15% Buzz and tone across platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys 15% Direct polling of community sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Bitcoin’s market share relative to all other cryptocurrencies. Trends & Search Volume 10% Public interest via Google search trends for crypto topics. Therefore, the current ‘Extreme Fear’ reading reflects a confluence of factors: likely elevated volatility, subdued trading volumes, negative social media chatter, and reduced public search interest. This multi-faceted approach helps validate the sentiment reading beyond any single metric. Historical Context of Extreme Fear Readings Placing the current 17 reading in historical context reveals its significance. Historically, prolonged periods in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone (typically below 25) have coincided with major market capitulation events. For instance, the index touched single digits during the bear market troughs following the 2018 bubble and the 2022 market collapse triggered by macroeconomic tightening and industry failures. However, these periods of peak fear have also often marked cyclical bottoms. Analysts frequently observe that sustained ‘Extreme Fear’ can indicate a washing out of weak hands and excessive leverage, potentially setting the stage for a more stable foundation. It is crucial to note that while the index is a powerful sentiment tool, it is not a direct timing indicator for a market reversal. Markets can remain fearful or greedy for extended periods, as seen in the prolonged bullish sentiment of late 2020 and early 2021. Expert Analysis on the Current Sentiment Climate Market strategists point to several converging factors sustaining the fearful climate in early 2025. Firstly, regulatory developments across major economies continue to create uncertainty, impacting institutional adoption timelines. Secondly, the broader macroeconomic environment, particularly interest rate trajectories and global liquidity conditions, remains a primary driver for risk assets like cryptocurrency. Finally, the memory of recent industry insolvencies still influences investor behavior, promoting a ‘wait-and-see’ attitude. “The Fear & Greed Index is flashing a classic contrarian signal,” notes a veteran market analyst from a major financial data firm. “While it reflects real pain and caution, historically, such uniform pessimism has not been a permanent state. The key for investors is to differentiate between cyclical fear driven by price action and structural fear driven by broken fundamentals. The current data suggests more of the former.” This analysis underscores the importance of using the index as one component of a broader research framework. Impact on Bitcoin and Altcoin Markets The pervasive fear sentiment exerts a tangible influence across different segments of the crypto market. Typically, in ‘Extreme Fear’ environments, investors exhibit distinct behavioral patterns. Bitcoin, often perceived as a relative ‘safe haven’ within the asset class, may see its market dominance index rise as capital flees higher-risk altcoins. This flight to perceived quality can suppress trading volumes and innovation in the altcoin space, as funding and attention dwindle. Furthermore, market mechanics are affected. Funding rates in perpetual swap markets often turn deeply negative, indicating that traders are paying to hold short positions. Additionally, exchange reserves may be scrutinized, as fearful holders might move assets to self-custody, a phenomenon colloquially known as ‘withdrawing to cold storage.’ These on-chain and derivatives metrics provide corroborating evidence for the sentiment captured by the Fear & Greed Index. Practical Implications for Investors and Traders For market participants, an ‘Extreme Fear’ reading should inform strategy rather than dictate it. Prudent investors might view this as a period for disciplined due diligence and potential dollar-cost averaging into fundamentally sound projects, acknowledging the high risk and potential for further downside. Traders, conversely, may adjust their strategies for a high-volatility, low-momentum environment, often characterized by sharp but unsustainable rallies (“dead cat bounces”) within a broader downtrend. Risk management becomes paramount. Key considerations include: Position Sizing: Reducing exposure to align with elevated uncertainty. Portfolio Rebalancing: Reviewing asset allocations that may have drifted due to asymmetric price movements. Scenario Planning: Preparing for both a prolonged fear phase and a potential sentiment shift based on new catalysts. Ultimately, the index is a measure of crowd psychology. Successful navigation often involves understanding this psychology while maintaining a focus on long-term technological adoption trends, network fundamentals, and macroeconomic drivers. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 17 offers a clear, quantitative snapshot of the prevailing ‘Extreme Fear’ in cryptocurrency markets. This sentiment stems from a composite of volatility, volume, social, and survey data, reflecting real investor trepidation. While historically such depths of fear have preceded market recoveries, they offer no guarantee of immediate reversal. For informed participants, this indicator serves as a crucial piece of contextual data—a gauge of market emotion that, when combined with fundamental and technical analysis, can guide more nuanced decision-making. As the market evolves through 2025, monitoring shifts in this index will remain essential for assessing changes in the collective market psyche. FAQs Q1: What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 17 mean? A score of 17 falls into the ‘Extreme Fear’ classification (0-25). It indicates that current market data from volatility, volume, social media, and surveys reflects overwhelming pessimism and risk aversion among cryptocurrency investors. Q2: Is the Fear & Greed Index a good buy signal? While not a precise timing tool, historically, sustained periods in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone have often coincided with market bottoms. Many contrarian investors use it as one factor to identify potential long-term buying opportunities, but it should never be used in isolation. Q3: How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily by its provider, Alternative.me. The website and various data aggregators typically display the most recent value, along with a short-term historical chart. Q4: Does ‘Extreme Fear’ only apply to Bitcoin? While the index incorporates Bitcoin-specific metrics like dominance, it is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. The data sources, especially social media and surveys, encompass discussion about major altcoins as well. Q5: What usually causes the index to move out of ‘Extreme Fear’? A sustained shift requires a change in the underlying data: decreasing volatility, increasing trading volume with positive momentum, improving social media sentiment, or a major positive catalyst (e.g., clear regulatory progress, a significant institutional adoption announcement) that alters market psychology.

Related Reading: With Bitcoin Below $80K, ARK Reframes The Narrative Around Gold The case, which is being handled by a Moscow court, has drawn attention to the risks facing large-scale crypto miners operating at the intersection of energy, regulation, and geopolitics. According to reports from Russian outlets RBK and Kommersant, Runets was detained late last week and formally charged with three counts of alleged tax evasion. Court filings indicate that the Zamoskvoretsky Court of Moscow ordered him placed under house arrest, a measure that restricts his movement while investigators proceed. His legal team has a limited window to appeal the ruling before it becomes fully enforceable. Court Case Adds Pressure On Bitriver Founded in 2017, BitRiver grew rapidly into Russia’s leading Bitcoin mining operator by building large data centers across Siberia. The company used the region’s cold climate and relatively low electricity costs to support its mining operations and to provide infrastructure services to corporate clients. At its peak, BitRiver operated thousands of mining rigs across multiple sites and accounted for a significant share of Russia’s legal crypto-mining capacity . Runets’ detention comes amid mounting challenges for BitRiver. The company was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in mid-2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, limiting its access to Western partners and financial systems. In 2023, Japanese financial group SBI exited its mining arrangement with BitRiver following its withdrawal from Russia, dealing a blow to the firm’s international business. Financial Strain And Legal Disputes Reports suggest that BitRiver began cutting costs and scaling back parts of its operations toward the end of 2024, leading to salary payment delays affecting employees. The pressure continued into early 2025, when regional electricity provider Infrastructure of Siberia filed two lawsuits, alleging that it had paid BitRiver for equipment that was never delivered. Despite these issues, Russia’s industrial mining sector continued to generate significant revenue in 2024, with BitRiver remaining the market leader. Bloomberg estimated Runets’ net worth at around $230 million in late 2024, largely tied to his role in the crypto mining industry. Wider Implications for The Crypto Sector The case against Runets highlights the growing legal and regulatory risks facing crypto executives, both in Russia and abroad. While authorities investigate the alleged tax violations, BitRiver must also manage ongoing litigation, strained partnerships, and scrutiny linked to sanctions.

This denial, however, arrives amidst a complex backdrop of concurrent U.S. government approvals for advanced technology exports to the same Middle Eastern nation, prompting members of Congress to voice serious concerns about potential conflicts of interest and national security implications that demand thorough investigation. Trump UAE Investment Denial and the WLFI Project Details President Trump’s recent comments directly address reports first published by major financial outlets. According to those reports, Aryam Investment, a firm backed by UAE royal and influential National Security Advisor Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, acquired a 49% stake in World Liberty Financial last year. The transaction’s value was reportedly $500 million. Consequently, Trump clarified that his adult sons, who are reportedly involved with WLFI, are handling the matter. This structure of family business operations separate from political office has been a recurring theme, yet it consistently attracts scrutiny regarding the separation of personal financial interests from public policy. World Liberty Financial positions itself as a next-generation DeFi platform. The decentralized finance sector aims to recreate traditional financial systems—like lending and borrowing—using blockchain technology, thereby operating without central intermediaries like banks. The involvement of a high-profile political family in such a technologically and financially complex venture is unusual. Furthermore, the scale of foreign investment from a nation with deep geopolitical ties to the U.S. introduces multiple layers of analysis for observers. Parallel Approval of Nvidia AI Chips to the UAE Simultaneously, and adding considerable weight to congressional concerns, the U.S. Department of Commerce approved the sale of hundreds of thousands of advanced Nvidia artificial intelligence (AI) chips to the United Arab Emirates. These chips, notably the H100 and A100 models, are critical for training sophisticated AI systems and are subject to export controls due to their potential dual-use applications in military and surveillance technology. Notably, some of these chips are reportedly destined for G42, an Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence firm. Sheikh Tahnoon, the same royal figure linked to the WLFI investment, chairs G42. This confluence of events—a major private investment in a Trump-family-linked project followed by a favorable U.S. government decision benefiting the investor’s other commercial interests—forms the core of the ethical debate. While no evidence suggests a direct quid pro quo, the timing and parties involved create an appearance that ethics experts find problematic. The table below outlines the key sequence and relationships: Timeline Event Key Entities 2024 Aryam Investment (UAE) acquires 49% of WLFI for $500M Sheikh Tahnoon, Trump Family, WLFI Early 2025 U.S. approves massive Nvidia AI chip sale to UAE U.S. Dept. of Commerce, UAE Tech Firms Early 2025 Reports link chips to G42, chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon G42, Nvidia, Sheikh Tahnoon Recent Trump denies knowledge of WLFI investment Former President Trump Expert Analysis on Political Ethics and National Security Governance and ethics specialists highlight that the situation underscores persistent challenges in U.S. conflict-of-interest laws, particularly regarding family members of public officials. “The modern financial and technological landscape creates new vectors for potential influence,” notes Dr. Evelyn Reed, a professor of political ethics at Georgetown University. “When a foreign government-linked entity makes a substantial investment in a company tied to a political figure’s family, and that same foreign entity subsequently receives sensitive technology approvals, it necessitates transparent and independent review. The principle at stake is the integrity of policy decisions, ensuring they are made solely for the national interest.” From a national security perspective, the dual threads of advanced AI and cryptocurrency intersect. DeFi projects can pose challenges for financial monitoring and sanctions enforcement. Meanwhile, advanced AI chips have clear strategic and military applications. The involvement of a UAE royal, who also serves as a top national security advisor, in both sectors simultaneously with the U.S. raises legitimate questions about long-term strategic alignment and technology transfer risks. Congressional Response and Legal Frameworks In response to these reports, bipartisan members of Congress have called for inquiries. Letters have been sent to the Departments of Justice, Commerce, and Treasury requesting reviews of the WLFI investment under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) framework and of the chip approvals under export control regulations. Key concerns cited include: Potential Emoluments Clause Violations: Constitutional provisions preventing presidents from receiving gifts or benefits from foreign states. Conflict of Interest: The apparent overlap between family business dealings and foreign policy outcomes. National Security: Whether the investment could influence or provide leverage over policy decisions regarding technology exports and Middle Eastern relations. Legal experts point out that proving a legal violation is complex and requires evidence of a specific exchange. However, the court of public opinion and historical precedent often judges such matters on the perception of propriety. The situation also tests the robustness of financial disclosure requirements for family members of political leaders, which many advocates argue need strengthening in an era of globalized digital finance. Broader Implications for Cryptocurrency and Foreign Policy This incident places the cryptocurrency industry under a different kind of spotlight. Typically, regulatory discussions focus on investor protection, market stability, and illicit finance. This case, however, introduces geopolitics and political ethics into the DeFi conversation. It demonstrates how blockchain-based projects can become entangled in high-stakes international relations, potentially attracting investment from entities with political motivations beyond pure profit. For U.S.-UAE relations, the matter is delicate. The UAE is a critical strategic partner in the Middle East, collaborating on security, intelligence, and economic initiatives. Balancing this partnership with rigorous enforcement of domestic ethical and legal standards presents an ongoing challenge for the administration. How Congress and relevant agencies handle this situation will signal the U.S.’s commitment to its own governance principles while managing vital international alliances. Conclusion The denial of knowledge by former President Trump regarding the $500 million Trump UAE investment in the family-linked World Liberty Financial DeFi project is merely the starting point of a multifaceted issue. The concurrent approval of advanced Nvidia AI chips to the UAE, benefiting firms connected to the same investor, has rightly triggered congressional scrutiny and public debate over conflicts of interest. This case sits at the intersection of political ethics, national security, and emerging technology, highlighting the urgent need for clear, modernized standards to govern the financial activities of public officials’ families in a globalized digital economy. The ongoing investigations will be crucial in determining the facts and restoring public confidence in the integrity of foreign policy and technology export decisions. FAQs Q1: What is World Liberty Financial (WLFI)? World Liberty Financial is a decentralized finance (DeFi) project that utilizes blockchain technology to offer financial services like lending outside of traditional banking systems. Reports indicate leadership ties to the Trump family. Q2: Who is Sheikh Tahnoon and why is he significant? Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan is a senior royal in the United Arab Emirates, serving as the country’s National Security Advisor. He also chairs G42, a major AI company, and is linked to the investment firm Aryam, which invested in WLFI. Q3: What are the main concerns raised by Congress? Members of Congress are concerned about potential conflicts of interest, violations of the Emoluments Clause, and national security risks stemming from the combination of a large UAE investment in a Trump-family project and subsequent U.S. approval of sensitive AI technology exports to the UAE. Q4: Has any illegal activity been proven? No. As of now, these are allegations and concerns based on reported events and their timing. Several government agencies have been asked to investigate to determine if any laws or regulations were violated. Q5: How does this affect U.S.-UAE relations? The situation creates diplomatic sensitivity. The UAE is a key strategic partner, but this incident tests the relationship by forcing a U.S. internal review of ethical standards and technology export controls related to a close ally’s influential figures.

This event has drawn attention from investors, prompting questions about the token’s short-term outlook. Dogecoin initially began last week on a high note, with gains that extended into Tuesday. However, the rally went off course mid-week after reaching a high of $0.127. This was due to increased selling pressure from traders scrambling to lock in profit. The token experienced further decline , which corresponded with the broader market downturn. Traders Opt For Low-Risk Investment Dogecoin’s recent trading activity reflects a reduced appetite for risk among traders across the global financial market. Investors have been seen shifting from higher-risk assets and investment vehicles, including cryptocurrencies. This new attitude of playing it safe has ultimately contributed to increased losses in the crypto market. According to the derivatives market, more than $509 million in crypto futures positions were liquidated during last week’s session. These liquidations represented a 57% increase compared to the previous trading day. A large portion of the liquidation involved long positions, indicating that many traders had been positioned for continued price appreciation before the market turned downwards. Although the U.S Federal Reserve’s decision to hold the interest rate steady was widely expected, investors were still eager to play it safe by moving away from riskier assets, resulting in increased selling pressure across the crypto market. According to data from CoinMarketCap , Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.1059, reflecting a slight daily gain of 0.24% and a 12.56% decline in the past week. Monthly performance also remains negative, with no evidence of the recent upward momentum. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Reduced Whale Activity Signals Loss of Confidence CoinGlass data shows Dogecoin open interest at $1.27 billion, signaling a 4.86% increase from its initial 1.38% loss on the 28th of January. Before this week’s increase, Dogecoin’s whale activity dropped by 94.6%, showing large transactions of over $1 million dropping from 109 to 6 in the last month. Similarly, Dogecoin’s spot trading volume fell by 13% during last week’s session, and it remains down by roughly 12% at the time of writing. Despite negative trends across most Dogecoin metrics , futures activity showed a significant exception. CoinGlass reported that futures volume on BitMEX surged over 10,000% in a 24-hour window during last week’s trading session, reaching approximately $200.98 million. From a technical perspective, immediate support levels are at $0.11 and $0.10 if prices continue to decline, while a potential rebound could face resistance near $0.133, aligned with the 50-day moving average. Dogecoin is currently showing mixed signals. When the negative on-chain metrics and spot trading are compared to increasing futures volume, it signals uncertainty in the token’s short-term outlook. This uncertainty reinforces the need for careful observation and risk management. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This two-point drop from the previous day’s reading underscores a persistent trend that has defined the first quarter of 2025, moving the market further from the threshold of an official ‘altcoin season.’ Analysts scrutinize this data point as a crucial barometer for investor sentiment and capital rotation within the volatile crypto ecosystem. Decoding the Altcoin Season Index Drop to 30 The Altcoin Season Index serves as a quantitative measure for market cycles. CoinMarketCap calculates this metric by comparing the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The platform excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens from this analysis to focus purely on speculative assets. A reading above 75 signals an ‘altcoin season,’ where a majority of major altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Conversely, a reading of 30 firmly indicates a ‘Bitcoin season.’ This current reading suggests that only a small fraction of the top altcoins have managed to outpace Bitcoin’s price action over the last three months. Historically, periods of Bitcoin dominance often correlate with macroeconomic uncertainty or moments when investors seek the perceived safety and established network effects of the largest cryptocurrency. The index’s decline is not an isolated event but part of a broader narrative involving regulatory developments, institutional investment flows, and shifting risk appetites. The Mechanics Behind the Metric Understanding the index requires a look at its components. The calculation is straightforward yet powerful: Benchmark: Bitcoin’s 90-day price percentage change. Comparison Group: The 90-day price change of each of the top 100 non-stablecoin assets. Output: The percentage of assets in the comparison group that outperformed the benchmark. Therefore, an index of 30 means approximately 30 out of 100 leading altcoins have beaten Bitcoin’s returns since early December 2024. This data provides a more nuanced view than simply observing Bitcoin’s dominance percentage, which measures market cap share rather than relative performance. Historical Context and Market Cycle Implications Bitcoin seasons and altcoin seasons typically alternate in multi-year market cycles. For instance, the bull run of late 2020 into early 2021 saw the Altcoin Season Index reach and sustain readings above 75 for extended periods, characterized by explosive growth in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects. Conversely, the bear market of 2022 was predominantly a Bitcoin season, where BTC often demonstrated relative resilience during sharp downturns. The transition between seasons is rarely abrupt. It usually involves a period where Bitcoin leads a market recovery, attracting initial capital and confidence. Subsequently, as investor confidence grows and narratives around specific blockchain use cases gain traction, capital begins to ‘rotate’ from Bitcoin into altcoins, pushing the index higher. The current low reading suggests this rotation has either stalled or reversed. Several factors contribute to this environment: Institutional Focus: Recent approvals and inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have directed massive institutional attention and capital almost exclusively toward Bitcoin. Macroeconomic Pressure: In times of economic tightening or geopolitical tension, crypto investors often exhibit a ‘flight to quality’ within the asset class, favoring Bitcoin. Regulatory Clarity (or Lack Thereof): While Bitcoin has achieved certain regulatory milestones, the landscape for many altcoins, particularly those deemed securities, remains uncertain, dampening enthusiasm. Expert Analysis on the Current Reading Market analysts interpret the Index at 30 as a sign of consolidation and selectivity. ‘This isn’t necessarily a negative signal for altcoins universally,’ notes a report from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. ‘It indicates a market that is rewarding specific, proven narratives and punishing speculative excess. Bitcoin is acting as the bedrock.’ The performance gap is not uniform across all altcoin sectors. For example, while many meme coins and smaller-cap projects have struggled, certain segments like blockchain infrastructure or real-world asset (RWA) tokenization have shown more resilience relative to Bitcoin, though not enough to shift the aggregate index. Data from other platforms corroborates this trend. The ‘Bitcoin Dominance’ chart, which tracks BTC’s share of the total crypto market capitalization, has risen steadily alongside the falling Altcoin Season Index. This parallel movement confirms that capital is not only performing better in Bitcoin but is also allocating a larger portion of the total market value to it. Comparative Performance: A Snapshot The table below illustrates a hypothetical snapshot of performance comparisons driving the index, based on common market observations when the index is low: Asset Type 90-Day Performance vs. Bitcoin Typical Impact on Index Bitcoin (BTC) Benchmark (e.g., +15%) N/A Major Large-Cap Altcoins (ETH, BNB) Slightly Underperforming Contributes to lower reading Mid-Cap DeFi/Smart Contract Tokens Moderately Underperforming Significantly lowers reading Small-Cap & Meme Coins Sharply Underperforming Drains index reading down Niche Outperformers (e.g., specific L1s, RWA) Outperforming Provides the ~30% positive reading What a Low Altcoin Season Index Means for Investors For traders and long-term holders alike, this metric offers actionable intelligence. Firstly, it highlights the current risk-reward profile. Investing in altcoins during a strong Bitcoin season generally carries higher relative risk, as the broader trend does not support blanket altcoin appreciation. Secondly, it emphasizes the importance of fundamental research. In such an environment, altcoin projects with strong utility, clear revenue models, and robust ecosystems are more likely to be among the 30% that outperform, separating them from purely speculative assets. Furthermore, a low index can present accumulation opportunities for patient investors. Historical data shows that periods of extreme Bitcoin dominance often precede eventual altcoin rallies. Savvy investors may use this time to research and strategically build positions in fundamentally sound projects at lower relative valuations, anticipating a future cycle shift. However, this strategy requires a long time horizon and tolerance for volatility. The Path Forward: Monitoring for a Shift Market participants will watch for catalysts that could reverse the trend. Key indicators include a stabilization or decline in Bitcoin dominance, a surge in positive altcoin-specific news flow (such as major protocol upgrades or regulatory green lights), and increased trading volume in altcoin pairs independent of Bitcoin’s movements. The Altcoin Season Index itself will be the primary gauge. A sustained climb above 50 would signal weakening Bitcoin dominance, while a move above 75 would officially declare a new altcoin season. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index reading of 30 provides a clear, data-driven snapshot of the current cryptocurrency market structure, unequivocally signaling a Bitcoin season. This phase underscores Bitcoin’s role as the market leader and a relative safe haven during uncertain times. While challenging for broad altcoin portfolios, this environment encourages disciplined investment strategies and highlights the performance of individual projects with substantive fundamentals. As the market evolves, this index will remain a critical tool for gauging the delicate balance of power and performance between Bitcoin and the diverse universe of altcoins. FAQs Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 30 mean? An index reading of 30 means that only about 30% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This firmly classifies the current period as a ‘Bitcoin season,’ where BTC is the dominant performer. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? CoinMarketCap calculates the index by comparing the 90-day price performance of each of the top 100 coins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance over the same period. The percentage that outperforms BTC becomes the index reading. Q3: Is a low Altcoin Season Index bad for the crypto market? Not necessarily. It indicates a phase in the market cycle. Bitcoin seasons often involve consolidation, establish a stronger price floor, and can precede periods where capital rotates into altcoins. It reflects current investor preference for the largest, most established asset. Q4: Can some altcoins still do well when the index is low? Yes. An index of 30 explicitly indicates that roughly 30 out of 100 major altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. This highlights a selective market where projects with strong fundamentals, specific catalysts, or niche utility can still thrive even in a dominant Bitcoin trend. Q5: What typically causes the index to rise again into an altcoin season? A shift usually requires a combination of factors: Bitcoin’s price stabilizing or consolidating after a rally, increased investor risk appetite, the emergence of compelling new narratives or technologies in the altcoin space, and broader capital inflows into the crypto market that begin to seek higher beta opportunities beyond Bitcoin.

Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, recently outlined a scenario where Bitcoin’s price could test the $58,000 level. This analysis follows Bitcoin’s breakdown of key technical support, triggering substantial market liquidations and raising concerns about medium-term trajectory. Consequently, investors and traders are closely monitoring on-chain metrics and macroeconomic signals for directional clues. Bitcoin Price Analysis Points to Key $58,000 Level Alex Thorn’s assessment, shared via social media platform X, identifies the 200-week moving average near $58,000 as a critical potential target. This long-term technical indicator has historically acted as a major support zone during previous market cycles. Thorn’s prediction stems from a confluence of negative factors currently pressuring the market. Firstly, Bitcoin has already declined approximately 15% since late January. This drop precipitated over $2 billion in long position liquidations across derivatives exchanges, according to data from Coinglass. Such liquidations often exacerbate downward momentum by forcing the closure of leveraged bets. Furthermore, on-chain data reveals a troubling statistic: roughly 46% of the total Bitcoin supply is now held at a loss. Analysts frequently compare this metric to past bear market environments. For instance, during the 2022 crypto winter, similar supply-in-loss percentages preceded extended periods of price consolidation or decline. The current situation suggests a broad base of holders are underwater, which may increase selling pressure if prices fail to recover promptly. Understanding the Catalysts for Selling Pressure Thorn’s analysis cites three primary drivers for the potential continued weakness: weak on-chain data, macroeconomic uncertainty, and a lack of upward catalysts. On-chain activity, measured by metrics like active addresses and transaction volume, has shown stagnation. This stagnation indicates reduced network utility and speculative interest. Simultaneously, global macroeconomic conditions contribute to the uncertainty. Central bank policies, inflation data, and geopolitical tensions influence investor risk appetite across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Notably, the market currently lacks a clear, positive catalyst to reverse the trend. The initial euphoria surrounding the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States has largely subsided. While these funds continue to see inflows, their impact on price has diminished. Thorn suggests that without a new, powerful demand driver or a significant improvement in macroeconomic sentiment, selling pressure may persist. He does, however, acknowledge the possibility of temporary sideways movement. This consolidation could occur within a 10% range of the average spot BTC ETF purchase price, which analysts estimate near $84,000. The Role of Institutional Analysis in Crypto Markets Galaxy Digital’s research carries significant weight due to the firm’s established position in the digital asset ecosystem. As a publicly-traded cryptocurrency-focused financial services firm, its analysts have deep access to market data and institutional flows. Their reports often incorporate insights from trading desks, venture capital portfolios, and macroeconomic research. This institutional perspective provides a crucial counterpoint to retail-driven sentiment often found on social media. Therefore, Thorn’s warning serves as a data-backed assessment for a market frequently swayed by speculation. The current price action also reflects broader trends in the digital asset sector. Altcoins have typically shown even greater volatility, often magnifying Bitcoin’s moves. A sustained drop in Bitcoin’s price would likely pressure the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. Market participants are now evaluating key support levels below the current price. The $58,000 figure represents not just a moving average but a psychological threshold that, if breached, could trigger another wave of risk-off behavior. Historical Context and Market Cycle Comparisons Examining past Bitcoin cycles offers valuable context for the current prediction. The 200-week moving average has played a pivotal role in several major market bottoms. For example, during the 2018-2019 bear market, Bitcoin price found a long-term floor at this indicator. Similarly, in 2022, the price revisited this zone before beginning its subsequent recovery. A return to this level in 2025 would align with historical patterns of deep retracements within bull markets. However, each cycle possesses unique characteristics. The introduction of spot ETFs represents a fundamental shift in market structure. These products provide a regulated, accessible conduit for traditional capital. Their sustained inflows or outflows now represent a new form of demand and supply. The “average purchase price” for these ETFs becomes a relevant metric for large-scale support or resistance. If the price remains below this average for an extended period, it could indicate that institutional buying interest is waning. The table below summarizes key differences between the current environment and previous cycles. Market Factor Previous Cycles (e.g., 2020-2021) Current 2025 Cycle Context Institutional Access Limited; via futures ETFs or direct custody. Broad; via multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Macro Environment Extremely low interest rates, quantitative easing. Higher for longer rate potential, quantitative tightening. On-chain Metrics Strong growth in active addresses and hash rate. Mature network with slowing growth in some metrics. Regulatory Clarity Low; significant uncertainty. Improving but still evolving, especially globally. These structural differences mean historical price patterns may not repeat exactly. Nevertheless, technical analysis tools like moving averages remain widely followed by both retail and institutional traders. Their collective belief in these levels can become a self-fulfilling prophecy as buy and sell orders cluster around them. Conclusion In conclusion, the Bitcoin price analysis from Galaxy Digital highlights a cautious outlook for the premier cryptocurrency. The convergence of technical breakdown, weak on-chain fundamentals, and a challenging macroeconomic backdrop presents clear headwinds. The $58,000 level, defined by the 200-week moving average, emerges as a critical zone to watch in the coming weeks and months. While temporary consolidation is possible, the absence of a strong positive catalyst suggests the path of least resistance may be lower. Market participants should monitor ETF flow data, macroeconomic announcements, and Bitcoin’s ability to hold key support levels. This Bitcoin price analysis underscores the importance of risk management and a long-term perspective in a volatile asset class. FAQs Q1: What is the 200-week moving average and why is $58,000 significant? The 200-week moving average is a long-term technical indicator that smooths out Bitcoin’s price data over 200 weeks (nearly 4 years). It has historically acted as major support during bear markets. Analyst Alex Thorn identifies it near $58,000 as a potential target if current selling pressure continues. Q2: What does “46% of Bitcoin supply at a loss” mean? This on-chain metric indicates that nearly half of all existing Bitcoin was last moved at a price higher than the current market price. These holders are currently sitting on unrealized losses. A high percentage can signal broad market stress and potential selling pressure if holders capitulate. Q3: How did the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals affect this analysis? The ETF approvals in early 2024 provided a massive upward catalyst. However, that bullish effect has dissipated. The analysis now focuses on the lack of a new catalyst to drive demand, with the average ETF purchase price (~$84,000) now acting as a potential resistance area. Q4: What are the main reasons for the predicted selling pressure? Thorn cites three core reasons: 1) Weak on-chain data showing reduced network activity, 2) Growing macroeconomic uncertainty affecting risk assets, and 3) A lack of new, positive catalysts to drive investor enthusiasm and fresh capital inflows. Q5: Is this prediction a certainty? No, this is an analysis of potential risk based on current data. Financial markets are unpredictable. The analysis outlines a plausible scenario if current conditions persist, but unexpected positive news or shifts in macro policy could alter the trajectory. It serves as a warning for risk assessment, not a guaranteed forecast.

This surge represents not just a numerical milestone but a powerful testament to the asset’s evolving role in the global financial landscape. Consequently, market analysts are scrutinizing the confluence of factors driving this rally, from institutional adoption to macroeconomic currents. Bitcoin Price Reaches Unprecedented $79,010 Data from Bitcoin World and other major market monitors confirms the breakthrough. This price point establishes a new ceiling for the world’s first cryptocurrency, building on gains observed throughout the previous quarter. The move past $79,000 follows a period of consolidation and signals renewed bullish momentum across crypto markets. Specifically, trading volume on major exchanges like Binance has spiked significantly, indicating strong buyer participation. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced volatile cycles. For context, its journey to this level can be traced through key phases: Period Approx. Price Key Catalyst Early 2023 $20,000 Post-FTX collapse recovery Q4 2024 $60,000 Spot ETF approvals & institutional inflow March 2025 $79,010 Macro hedge demand & network maturation Several technical and fundamental elements support the current valuation. Firstly, the Bitcoin network’s hash rate continues to hit record highs, underscoring robust security and miner commitment. Secondly, the circulating supply held by long-term investors remains near historic levels, reducing sell-side pressure. Therefore, the market structure appears fundamentally stronger than during previous peaks. Analyzing the Drivers Behind the Cryptocurrency Rally The rally to $79,000 is not an isolated event. Instead, it reflects broader financial trends. Macroeconomic conditions, particularly concerns about currency debasement and inflation in several major economies, have renewed interest in Bitcoin’s fixed-supply model. Simultaneously, regulatory clarity in pivotal markets like the European Union and parts of Asia has provided a more stable operating environment for institutions. Key factors contributing to the surge include: Institutional Adoption: Continued inflows into U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs demonstrate sustained professional capital allocation. Network Upgrades: Recent protocol improvements have enhanced transaction efficiency and programmability, broadening use cases. Global Liquidity: Anticipated shifts in monetary policy by major central banks are driving asset reallocation. Market Sentiment: The Fear & Greed Index has moved into “Greed” territory, reflecting positive retail and institutional momentum. Moreover, the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional equity markets has shown signs of decoupling recently. This suggests investors may increasingly view crypto as a distinct asset class for portfolio diversification. Evidence from on-chain analytics firms shows substantial accumulation by large wallet addresses, often called “whales,” throughout the climb from $70,000. Expert Perspectives on Sustainable Growth Financial analysts emphasize the changed landscape from previous bull markets. “The current appreciation is underpinned by tangible infrastructure, not just speculation,” notes a market strategist from a leading crypto research firm. “The approval and success of regulated investment vehicles have created a new, compliant channel for capital that did not exist in 2021.” This structural shift is critical for understanding potential sustainability. Risk assessments, however, remain paramount. Volatility is an inherent characteristic of the asset class. Experts consistently advise investors to consider personal risk tolerance and conduct thorough research. Regulatory developments worldwide continue to evolve, potentially impacting market dynamics. For instance, upcoming legislation in key jurisdictions could affect liquidity or trading practices. Historical Context and Future Market Trajectory Bitcoin’s journey past $79,000 marks its latest record in a 16-year history of disruptive innovation. Each cycle has introduced new participants and strengthened the network’s resilience. The previous all-time high near $69,000 in November 2021 was followed by a prolonged bear market, testing investor conviction. The current environment differs due to improved institutional custody solutions and clearer accounting standards for corporate holders. Looking forward, several metrics warrant observation: Miner Behavior: Will miners increase selling to cover operational costs, or will they continue holding? Derivatives Market: Open interest and funding rates in perpetual swap markets can indicate leverage levels. Macro Indicators: Interest rate decisions and geopolitical stability will influence global risk appetite. On-chain Activity: Growth in active addresses and settlement volume reflects genuine network utility. Technically, the $80,000 psychological level presents the next immediate resistance. A sustained break above could target higher valuations, while failure to hold support near $75,000 might signal a consolidation phase. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition remains tied to its adoption as a decentralized store of value and settlement network. Conclusion Bitcoin’s ascent above $79,000 signifies a major achievement for the cryptocurrency sector. This milestone, driven by institutional adoption, macroeconomic factors, and network maturation, highlights Bitcoin’s growing integration into mainstream finance. While volatility persists, the underlying market structure exhibits increased robustness compared to previous cycles. Investors and observers should monitor both on-chain data and broader economic trends to navigate this evolving landscape. The Bitcoin price movement past this threshold reaffirms the asset’s enduring significance and its potential to reshape financial systems. FAQs Q1: What does Bitcoin trading at $79,010 mean? It means that on the Binance exchange, using the USDT stablecoin pair, one Bitcoin can be bought or sold for that price. This represents a new all-time high valuation for the asset, indicating strong market demand. Q2: What are the main reasons Bitcoin price is rising? Primary drivers include sustained institutional investment through ETFs, Bitcoin’s perceived role as a hedge against inflation, positive regulatory developments, and overall growth in cryptocurrency adoption and infrastructure. Q3: Is Bitcoin’s price surge sustainable? While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, the current rally is supported by deeper institutional involvement and stronger network fundamentals than some previous cycles. However, cryptocurrency markets remain volatile and subject to rapid change. Q4: How does this price affect the broader crypto market? Bitcoin often sets the tone for the wider digital asset sector. A strong Bitcoin price typically boosts sentiment and capital inflow into altcoins and the broader blockchain ecosystem, though correlation levels can vary. Q5: Where can I find reliable Bitcoin price information? Reputable sources include data aggregators like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase for live trading data, and on-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode for deeper market insights.

This Bitcoin price prediction comes amid heightened market volatility and provides crucial insights for investors navigating the current bear phase. According to the bank’s research note, obtained exclusively by CoinDesk, specific price zones now represent significant technical levels that could determine Bitcoin’s trajectory through 2025. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyzing the $60K Support Zone Compass Point’s analysis identifies the $60,000 to $68,000 range as Bitcoin’s next substantial support level. The investment bank bases this Bitcoin price prediction on concrete data showing that approximately 7% of long-term holders acquired their positions within this price band. These long-term holders, defined as investors holding Bitcoin for over six months, typically represent more resilient market participants who resist selling during temporary downturns. Consequently, their concentration in this price range creates natural buying interest that could stabilize prices. Market analysts generally consider support levels where significant buying historically occurred. When prices approach these zones, investors often perceive value and increase purchasing activity. This dynamic potentially creates a floor beneath falling prices. Compass Point’s research team utilized on-chain data analysis to identify these accumulation patterns, providing empirical evidence for their Bitcoin price prediction. The methodology examines wallet addresses and transaction histories to determine where different investor cohorts entered the market. Resistance Levels and Market Structure Analysis Simultaneously, Compass Point identifies the $81,000 to $83,000 zone as a formidable resistance level. Resistance represents price points where selling pressure historically overwhelmed buying interest, creating barriers to upward movement. The bank’s analysis suggests this range contains substantial sell orders from investors seeking to exit positions at breakeven or with minimal losses. Breaking through this resistance would require significant buying volume and positive market catalysts. Between these critical levels lies what Compass Point terms an “air pocket” – the $70,000 to $80,000 range. Here, the order book appears remarkably thin, with less than 1% of long-term holders having purchased Bitcoin within this band. This scarcity of historical buying creates vulnerability where prices could decline rapidly with minimal support. Market structure analysis reveals these gaps often result from rapid price appreciation periods where investors hesitated to purchase at seemingly elevated valuations. Historical Context and Technical Analysis Framework Technical analysts employ various methodologies to identify support and resistance levels. These include: On-chain analysis: Examining blockchain data to identify where coins last moved Volume profile: Assessing trading volume at specific price points Order book analysis: Evaluating current buy and sell orders on exchanges Historical price action: Reviewing where prices previously reversed direction Compass Point’s approach combines these methodologies, creating a multi-faceted Bitcoin price prediction. The bank’s analysts compared current market structure to previous Bitcoin cycles, noting similarities in how support zones formed during prior bear markets. Historical data shows Bitcoin typically establishes support where long-term investors demonstrate strong accumulation patterns, similar to the current $60,000 to $68,000 zone. Potential Downside Scenarios and Risk Factors Should Bitcoin break below the $60,000–$68,000 support zone, Compass Point identifies $55,000 as the next potential support level. However, the bank emphasizes this scenario would likely require multiple negative catalysts converging simultaneously. These include a U.S. stock market correction or crash combined with bankruptcies at major cryptocurrency firms. Such events could trigger cascading liquidations across leveraged positions, creating downward momentum that overwhelms normal support levels. The interconnectedness between cryptocurrency markets and traditional finance has increased substantially since 2020. Many institutional investors now hold both traditional assets and digital assets, creating correlation during risk-off periods. Additionally, several cryptocurrency firms maintain significant exposure to traditional markets through treasury management strategies. This interconnectedness means developments in conventional markets increasingly impact cryptocurrency valuations. Market Psychology and Investor Behavior Patterns Market cycles typically progress through distinct psychological phases. Compass Point’s analysis suggests the cryptocurrency market currently approaches the final stages of its bear phase, characterized by declining enthusiasm but potential accumulation opportunities. During this phase, retail investors often demonstrate fear or apathy while experienced investors identify value. The bank’s identification of specific support levels helps investors understand where this value might emerge. Long-term holder behavior provides crucial insights during market transitions. These investors typically demonstrate different psychology than short-term traders, often viewing price declines as accumulation opportunities rather than reasons for panic. Their concentration in specific price ranges creates natural support that can stabilize markets. Monitoring their behavior through on-chain metrics offers predictive value for identifying potential turning points. Comparative Analysis with Previous Market Cycles Bitcoin has experienced four major market cycles since its inception, each featuring distinct support and resistance formations. Comparing current market structure to historical patterns provides context for Compass Point’s Bitcoin price prediction. The following table illustrates key support levels during previous bear market phases: Cycle Bear Market Bottom Support Formation Recovery Time 2014-2015 $152 13-month accumulation 24 months to new high 2018-2019 $3,122 11-month consolidation 18 months to new high 2022-2023 $15,476 9-month base building 14 months to new high Current (2024-2025) $60,000 (projected) Ongoing formation To be determined Each cycle demonstrates progressively shorter recovery periods and higher nominal support levels. This pattern reflects Bitcoin’s growing market maturity and increasing institutional participation. The current projected support around $60,000 represents a substantially higher floor than previous cycles, even when adjusting for inflation and market capitalization growth. Regulatory Environment and Macroeconomic Factors Beyond technical analysis, regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions significantly influence cryptocurrency valuations. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission continues developing cryptocurrency regulations while global jurisdictions implement varied approaches. Clear regulatory frameworks typically support market stability by reducing uncertainty for institutional investors. However, restrictive regulations could negatively impact market sentiment and trading volumes. Macroeconomic factors including interest rate policies, inflation data, and geopolitical developments also affect cryptocurrency markets. As alternative assets, cryptocurrencies often respond to changes in traditional monetary policy and risk appetite. The Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions particularly influence investor behavior across all risk assets. Compass Point’s analysis considers these factors when evaluating potential downside scenarios requiring multiple negative catalysts. Institutional Adoption and Market Maturation Since 2020, institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets has increased substantially. Major financial institutions now offer cryptocurrency services while publicly traded companies allocate portions of their treasuries to digital assets. This institutionalization changes market dynamics, potentially reducing volatility over time while increasing correlation with traditional markets. Compass Point’s analysis accounts for these structural changes when identifying support and resistance levels. The approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024 marked a significant milestone for institutional adoption. These investment vehicles provide regulated access to Bitcoin exposure without requiring direct custody of digital assets. ETF flows now represent a substantial component of Bitcoin demand, with institutional allocations potentially creating more predictable buying patterns around certain price levels. Conclusion Compass Point’s Bitcoin price prediction provides valuable insights for investors navigating current market conditions. The identification of $60,000 as a potential bottom, supported by data on long-term holder accumulation patterns, offers a data-driven framework for decision-making. Simultaneously, the recognition of resistance at $81,000-$83,000 and vulnerability in the $70,000-$80,000 range creates a complete picture of Bitcoin’s technical landscape. While downside risks exist, particularly if multiple negative catalysts converge, the analysis suggests the cryptocurrency market approaches the final stages of its bear phase. This Bitcoin price prediction ultimately highlights the importance of technical analysis, on-chain data, and understanding investor psychology when evaluating digital asset markets. FAQs Q1: What methodology did Compass Point use for their Bitcoin price prediction? Compass Point employed on-chain data analysis examining where long-term holders acquired positions, combined with order book analysis and historical price action evaluation. This multi-method approach identified accumulation patterns and order concentration at specific price levels. Q2: Why is the $70,000 to $80,000 range considered an “air pocket”? This range contains minimal historical buying activity with less than 1% of long-term holders having purchased Bitcoin here. The thin order book means limited buy orders exist to support prices if they decline into this zone, potentially creating rapid downward movement. Q3: What would need to happen for Bitcoin to fall below $60,000 according to the analysis? Compass Point suggests breaking below $60,000 would likely require multiple negative catalysts converging, such as a U.S. stock market crash combined with bankruptcies at major cryptocurrency firms creating cascading liquidations. Q4: How do long-term holders differ from other market participants? Long-term holders maintain positions for over six months and typically demonstrate different psychology than short-term traders. They often view price declines as accumulation opportunities and provide natural support in zones where they previously purchased. Q5: How does this analysis compare to previous Bitcoin market cycles? Current market structure shows similarities to previous cycles in how support forms where long-term investors accumulate, though the nominal support level ($60,000) is substantially higher, reflecting Bitcoin’s market maturation and institutional adoption since earlier cycles.

At this meeting, passionate crypto insiders, who significantly outnumbered the bankers, observed that banks were unnecessarily slow to reach agreement on the crypto market structure. Following this argument, sources close to the situation, speaking anonymously because the meeting was private, disclosed that the White House had established several objectives for the two key players in the crypto industry. The main goal was for them to strike a deal on stablecoin yields before the beginning of March. While the White House pushes this agreement forward, reports indicate that the primary focus for individuals in the crypto industry remains the US Senate. At this moment, they expressed eagerness to await the Senate’s vote on the full crypto market structure bil l. However, the individual claimed that further delays in the vote decreased the likelihood of passage this year. Discussions surrounding the fate of the crypto market structure bill spark concerns Just recently, Patrick Witt, the Executive Director of the President’s Council of Advisors on Digital Assets at the White House, led a White House meeting with crypto firms and Wall Street bankers. The main topic of discussion was whether stablecoins should offer yields and rewards. To arrive at a prudent decision effectively, policy experts from both the crypto industry and Wall Street banks participated in this meeting. They met in the Diplomatic Reception Room for more than two hours to discuss fixes for the most challenging parts of the crypto market structure bill. Given the intensity of the situation, sources noted that the talks will proceed with a smaller group. Moreover, the White House has instructed them to prepare to strike an agreement on specific amendments to the bill’s wording. In the meantime, one insider, whose identity was concealed, revealed that banking representatives play a crucial role in trade associations and may require their members’ approval before initiating any negotiation strategy. Responding to this claim, banking representatives issued a joint statement expressing their willingness to continue collaborating to help formulate thoughtful, effective policy . In a statement, the bank groups stressed that, “We need to make sure that any new laws help local lending to families and small businesses because this helps the economy grow and keeps our financial system safe.” Notably, the groups include the American Bankers Association and the Financial Services Forum, representing leading Wall Street financial leaders. Cody Carbone views the White House meeting as a game-changer in the ecosystem Regarding the White House meeting between crypto firms and Wall Street bankers, reports from reliable sources said Cody Carbone, who heads the Digital Chamber that advocates for crypto policy in Washington, was pleased with this move. Carbone argued that the meeting represented the kind of progress needed to address one of the most significant challenges preventing comprehensive legislative advancements on market structure, despite the lack of an immediate agreement on yields. “We can’t afford to do nothing. We are ready to get to work and ensure that new laws do not harm innovators or consumers who view digital assets as a key part of their financial future,” he said immediately after the meeting.

As seen in the latest data from the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, the indicator is at 14 and in the “extreme fear” zone. Fear is spreading across the market as more people rush to sell Bitcoin Bitcoin prices have been declining over the last month, making many investors anxious . The prices have dropped by 13% over the last 30 days, making it the fourth consecutive month of decline for the cryptocurrency. The decline is similar to last year, when prices dropped steadily, and investor sentiment weakened. The decline in prices over the weekend heightened concerns, especially after they dropped to $74,500, a level not seen since before $80,000. Many traders closed their positions, and prices only recovered to $78,500. As prices declined, losses quickly cascaded through the derivatives market . In just 24 hours, more than $2.2 billion in leveraged crypto positions were liquidated. Long traders had to sell their assets as prices fell to meet margin calls, further fueling the decline. Traders immediately reduced risk due to apprehensions about tariffs, economic conditions, and other issues in the global market. Investors are not only withdrawing from cryptocurrencies but also from other risky investments. Not even safe assets in hard times have been able to save investors. Gold declined 12 percent in a single day, and silver fell 30 percent as investors quickly shifted away from risk. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has remained in extreme fear for a while now, at 14, unchanged from the previous day. This level is much lower than last month’s 29. These signals include price movements, trading volume, social media, market share, and search trends. All these factors indicate a market that is being cautious and defensive, not one that is confident or willing to take risks. The charts warn traders that Bitcoin could fall even lower Traders are being very cautious as prices continue to fall. Although there was a bit of a bounce after the weekend selloff, people are not seeing this as a sign that the market has reversed. This is also confirmed by the technical indicators, which suggest that selling pressure will remain strong. The trend indicators also show that short-term confidence is still not back. The 50-day exponential moving average is below the 200-day moving average. The Average Directional Index is above 30 on the daily chart and above 57 on the four-hourly chart, indicating that markets are moving with conviction. In this case, the markets are moving downwards. At the same time, the momentum indicators suggest the selling might be overdone. The Relative Strength Index has fallen to 30, indicating that the market is oversold. This does not necessarily mean that a trend reversal is underway. The fact that Bitcoin has risen from around $74,500 implies that buyers are defending that level, but the recent price action has been unfavorable, with gains unable to sustain, suggesting that confidence remains low. If Bitcoin fails to sustain above this level the next time it’s tested, it’s assumed that if the price goes below $74,000, the next significant level, which will be targeted for the next potential decline, will be $69,000. The change in market sentiment can also be seen from prediction markets, where currently, the odds are at 67.9% that Bitcoin will fall to $69,000 before rallying to $100,000, a significant change from just two weeks ago, when predictions were pointing towards another rally. On a positive note, the road to recovery remains narrow, with the cryptocurrency seen facing initial resistance at $80,600, followed by a significant level at $91,350, before a recovery rally can be initiated.

57683142,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=268105,1770082811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Whale Awakens: Dormant $19.15M BTC Deposit to Gemini Sparks Market Intrigue,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-dormant-gemini-deposit/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Awakens: Dormant $19.15M BTC Deposit to Gemini Sparks Market Intrigue In a stunning on-chain event that captured the cryptocurrency community’s attention, a long-dormant Bitcoin whale abruptly ended an eight-year slumber to deposit a staggering 243 BTC, valued at approximately $19.15 million, to the Gemini exchange. This significant transaction, originating from address ‘3BTqd…’, immediately triggered intense speculation and analysis among traders and blockchain analysts worldwide regarding its potential market implications. Bitcoin Whale Emerges From Eight-Year Hibernation The blockchain analytics platform Onchain-Lense first detected this monumental movement about thirty minutes before public reporting. Consequently, the transaction sent ripples through market sentiment channels. A wallet remaining inactive since approximately 2017 represents a relic from a different crypto era. Furthermore, such prolonged dormancy often indicates a steadfast holder, commonly called a ‘Bitcoin maximalist’ or early adopter. These entities typically accumulate assets during bear markets or early bull cycles. Their subsequent actions, especially large deposits to exchanges, frequently serve as critical signals for market analysts. Historically, movements from vintage wallets can precede notable volatility. For instance, the activation of Satoshi-era wallets (from 2009-2010) often causes market anxiety. However, this 2017-era whale operates from a period when Bitcoin’s price navigated from under $1,000 to nearly $20,000. The holder evidently weathered the subsequent 2018 crash and the multi-year bear market. Their decision to move funds now, therefore, demands scrutiny within the current macroeconomic and regulatory landscape. Analyzing the Destination: The Gemini Exchange Context The whale’s choice of Gemini as a destination adds a compelling layer to the narrative. Gemini, founded by the Winklevoss twins, is a regulated cryptocurrency exchange and custodian operating primarily in the United States. Importantly, the platform emphasizes compliance with U.S. securities and financial regulations. A deposit of this magnitude to a U.S.-regulated entity could suggest several strategic intents from the whale. Liquidity for Trading: The most straightforward interpretation involves preparing for a sale or trade. Depositing to an exchange wallet is typically the final step before executing a market order. Institutional-Grade Custody: The whale might seek the enhanced security and insurance offerings of a regulated custodian, signaling a long-term hold under new stewardship. Regulatory Preparedness: Moving assets to a compliant platform may indicate anticipation of or response to evolving cryptocurrency tax or reporting regulations. This action contrasts with simply transferring between private wallets. It represents an intentional engagement with the traditional financial bridge that Gemini provides. Expert Angle: Interpreting Dormant Whale Movements Blockchain analysts consistently monitor dormant supply metrics. According to data from sources like Glassnode, the percentage of Bitcoin supply inactive for over five years remains near all-time highs. The sudden movement of even a fraction of this supply can impact market psychology. Analysts often debate whether such moves indicate distribution at a market top or simply portfolio rebalancing. For example, a whale might diversify into other assets, fund a venture, or realize gains for tax purposes. Without additional context from off-chain sources, the exact motive remains opaque. However, the transaction’s sheer size and timing provide fertile ground for data-driven hypothesis. Market participants now watch order books on Gemini and other exchanges for corresponding sell pressure. They also monitor for any similar activity from other aged wallets, which could signal a broader trend of old hands taking profits. The Ripple Effect on Market Sentiment and On-Chain Metrics Immediate market reactions to whale movements are often psychological. The fear of a large sell order can induce short-term price dips. Conversely, some interpret the unlocking of old coins as a necessary step for healthy market liquidity. This particular event occurred amidst a complex macroeconomic backdrop featuring fluctuating interest rates and geopolitical tensions. Therefore, its impact intertwines with these larger forces. On-chain metrics provide deeper insight than price alone. Analysts will examine the wallet’s transaction history, the UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) involved, and the fee paid for the transfer. A high fee suggests urgency, while a low fee may indicate no immediate rush. Subsequent flows from the Gemini deposit address will be tracked meticulously. If the BTC moves to a Gemini hot wallet, a sale is more likely. If it goes to a Gemini cold storage address, custody might be the goal. Historical Context of Major Dormant Whale Movements Year BTC Moved Approx. Value Then Subsequent Market Trend (30 Days) 2020 1,000 BTC $9M Sideways, then upward 2021 5,000 BTC $250M Short dip, then consolidation 2023 2,000 BTC $60M Minor volatility 2025 (This Event) 243 BTC $19.15M To be determined Conclusion The awakening of a dormant Bitcoin whale and its $19.15 million deposit to Gemini serves as a powerful reminder of the blockchain’s transparent and immutable nature. This single transaction provides a case study in on-chain analysis, market sentiment, and holder behavior. While the immediate market impact may be nuanced, the event underscores the importance of monitoring foundational blockchain data. It highlights the ongoing narrative between long-term believers and active market participants. The cryptocurrency community will undoubtedly keep a close watch on address ‘3BTqd…’ and its future activity, as the story of this Bitcoin whale continues to unfold. FAQs Q1: What is a “Bitcoin whale”? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a sufficiently large amount of Bitcoin. Their transactions can potentially influence the market price due to the size of their holdings. Q2: Why is a dormant wallet moving funds significant? Movement from a long-dormant wallet is significant because it changes the supply dynamics. Coins that were effectively out of circulation re-enter the liquid supply, which can signal a change in conviction from a long-term holder and potentially precede increased selling pressure. Q3: Does depositing to an exchange always mean selling? Not always. While depositing to an exchange is a prerequisite for selling on that platform, large holders also use exchanges for secure custodial services, to earn yield, or as a gateway to other financial products like loans. Q4: How do analysts track these transactions? Analysts use blockchain explorers and specialized analytics platforms (e.g., Onchain-Lense, Glassnode, Arkham) that monitor network activity, cluster addresses to identify entities, and flag transactions from wallets with specific histories, like long dormancy. Q5: What was the price of Bitcoin when this whale likely acquired these coins? Based on the eight-year dormancy period, this wallet was likely active around 2017. Bitcoin’s price in 2017 ranged from roughly $1,000 at the start of the year to nearly $20,000 by December, meaning the whale’s acquisition cost and unrealized gain are substantial.
