The 10-month cross-border project, which was conducted with 37 media partners in 35 countries, gathered hundreds of wallet addresses connected to scams, theft, sanctions violations, and other illicit activity, and traced tens of thousands of transactions across public blockchains. Criminal Cash Across World’s Biggest Exchanges The investigation found that money launderers working for drug traffickers, Southeast Asian scam networks, and North Korean hacking groups routinely used leading exchanges to move their funds. An important finding revealed that Huione Group, a Cambodian financial institution designated by US authorities as a “primary money laundering concern,” sent around $1 million worth of USDT per day to accounts at Binance as recently as July 2025. This contributed to more than $408 million in total transfers from July 2024 to July 2025. These flows continued even while Binance operated under two court-appointed monitors as part of its November 2023 plea deal for violating US anti-money laundering laws, which required the company to pay $4.3 billion. The investigation also found that more than $226 million entered customer accounts at OKX from Huione in the five months after OKX pleaded guilty in the US in February 2025 to operating an unlicensed money transmitter and agreed to pay over $504 million in penalties. According to ICIJ, these transfers persisted despite Huione’s designation in May as a major laundering concern. Reporters also examined how so-called cash desks and courier services operating in cities such as Hong Kong, Toronto, London, and Istanbul allow users to anonymously cash out large sums of cryptocurrency outside regulatory oversight, forming another channel through which illicit proceeds reach or exit exchanges. The report additionally documented how scam victims across 12 countries saw their stolen funds move through these same major platforms. To highlight the scale of criminal activity using crypto infrastructure, the investigation detailed the alleged pyramid and Ponzi scheme led by Vladimir Okhotnikov, who was accused of stealing at least $340 million from investors between 2020 and 2022 via a manipulated cryptocurrency investment platform and continuing to run similar schemes from Dubai. Anonymous Wallets and “Swappers” While blockchain records provide transparency, ICIJ reported that criminals use anonymous wallets and tools such as “swappers” to complicate tracing, creating major tracing challenges for exchange compliance teams. More than a dozen former compliance workers at companies including Binance and OKX told ICIJ they struggled to keep up with increasingly sophisticated laundering techniques. Regulators globally have imposed at least $5.8 billion in fines and penalties on crypto exchanges, but oversight remains fragmented, even as US authorities estimate $9.3 billion in crypto-related losses in 2024.

The update lets people join others inside photorealistic VR replicas of real rooms captured with Hyperscape. The tech giant launched Hyperscape Capture (Beta) during this year’s Meta Connect event. Users now have a quick way to turn real rooms into immersive digital replicas. Meta’s Hyperscape lets eight people join at the same time According to a blogpost by Meta, friends can enter a shared VR space through a shared link. Up to eight people can join simultaneously using a Meta Quest 3/3S headset or the Meta Horizon app on any iOS or Android device. Sharing a Hyperscape world is simple. Users can generate a link via the “invite” or “share” button to share through chats or messaging apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. Only people aged 18+ with the link can join, and users can reset access anytime. Meta simplifies the creation of immersive digital replicas with Hyperscape Capture (Beta). Users equipped with a Quest 3 or 3S headset can transform real spaces into photorealistic VR environments in just minutes. No costly camera equipment is required. Meta offers several inspiring examples to showcase the potential of Hyperscape Capture. Users can explore digital replicas of Gordon Ramsay’s home kitchen, Chance the Rapper’s live room, Happy Kelli’s Crocs room, or the UFC Apex arena in Las Vegas, either solo or with friends. Source: Meta website. Meta to roll out Hyperscape Capture this week Meta is gradually rolling out the ability to share those captured spaces and hang out with others on Meta Horizon starting this week. Users who haven’t gained access to share their Hyperscape worlds yet are advised to wait, as the update is being deployed. Meanwhile, previously captured Hyperscape worlds will remain accessible exclusively through the Hyperscape Preview app. In addition, the tech giant is utilizing the Meta Horizon Engine for on-device rendering, enabling lower latency and travel features. Audio lets users feel present with friends anywhere. “Some days you might want to immerse yourself in an otherworldly adventure, which is where our vast library of VR apps and worlds comes into play. And other days, you might want to visit a digital replica of a physical space you might not have the opportunity to see otherwise,” wrote Lisa Brown Jaloza from Meta. With Thanksgiving near, Meta hopes that users will capture the holiday spirit and invite family who can’t be with them. Meta pushes ahead with its AR and VR product lineup Meta will launch its next-gen AR glasses this fall. These glasses are made with Luxottica, Ray-Ban’s parent company. The tech company has not shared sales data for the first version, and little is known about user adoption or the second-generation smart glasses. Meta plans a 2025 smart glasses model with a viewfinder to read texts, translate, and scan QR codes. The company is developing a “neural interface” band to control smart glasses with hand gestures. Meta is also working on a smartwatch to complement its smart glasses as an optional upgrade to the neural interface band. In 2022, Meta’s Reality Labs reported a $4.28 billion operating loss in Q4, pushing its total losses to $13.72 billion. Some past reports indicated that users may not be keen to revisit some of Meta’s VR experiences after their initial trial. Shares of Meta Platforms, Inc. (Ticker: META) ended Friday’s session at $594.25. The stock gained 0.9% as investors reacted positively to forecasts of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated in December.

These big players in crypto aren’t holding back for momentum to return to ETH, opting to make their portfolio adjustments by diversifying their investments in cryptos with stronger levels of accumulation, cleaner growth, and significantly better reward/risk ratios in these market conditions. These big players have unexpectedly brought forward a new market frontrunner, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . In contrast to many new cryptos, MUTM is actually on the move due to genuine demand, with its ongoing presale now in Phase 6 for just $0.035, significantly over 95% sold out, with support from more than 18,120 holders contributing in excess of $19M to date. It’s no wonder why these big players are now pointing to MUTM, with its increasing DeFi applications and testnet launch on the horizon, as their new safety hedging mode and one of the top crypto options for investors while Ethereum remains vulnerable. Ethereum Holds $3,000 Support as Traders Eye Next Move Ethereum (ETH) is now displaying its first signs of short-term market stability, rising 2.17% in the last 24 hours to range closer to $3,076, with buyers tentatively re-entering in the region of $3,020–$3,050. On its 4H chart, ETH is forming a small base above $3,000 after bouncing from its lower Bollinger Band, trying to break through to the middle band levels. Still, it’s below its EMA group with a negative slope, indicating bears are in charge, albeit with decreased momentum. Breaching levels above $3,140–$3,180 could lead to subsequent action in the region of $3,250–$3,300, or slide back into its support region at $2,980–$3,020, which has behaved like a magnet for market participants. And with market direction yet to be determined for ETH, some market participants have begun to examine other projects with better short-term market momentum, such as Mutuum Finance, the top crypto now drawing major investor focus. MUTM Presale Phase 6: It’s a Critical Time for Early Investors Mutuum Finance is steadily growing in prominence in the DeFi world of cryptocurrency, with Phase 6 of its presale drawing to close. With sales exceeding 95% in Phase 6, tokens now cost $0.035, which will be the last chance to invest before increasing to $0.04 in Phase 7. Already, over 18,120 participants have registered for the presale, with an astonishing $18.85 million raised, which is a testament to the market demand for the platform. What’s remarkable about Mutuum Finance, however, is that there is more to its success in presales than this; it’s not just any platform with real-life applications, new technology, or an appropriately balanced credit market in the decentralized environment. It’s what puts MUTM in the ranks of promising cryptos with tremendous market value, enough to break through the $1 barrier, making it the crypto to buy now for investors seeking early-stage gains and long-term DeFi utility. Sepolia Testnet, Previewing the Capabilities of Lending One of the most crucial steps on the timeline is the launch of the V1 protocol on the Sepolia network, which is expected in Q4 2025. It will be the launch of the first full-scale version of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing protocol . Users will be able to lock their collaterals in ETH/USD and borrow money based on it. Moreover, the testnet network will enable the development team to improve their risk management tools, interest rate models, and loan processing mechanisms to ensure that the platform is secure, efficient, and ready for deployment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already onboarded more than 18,120 investors, having raised $18.85 million, with Phase 6 being over 95% sold out for $0.035 tokens. Ethereum (ETH) is finding it hard to retain support levels above $3,000, giving investors the push to invest in MUTM before Phase 7, which will see token prices go to $0.04. Considering its upcoming testnet launch, real-life applications in DeFi lending/borrowing, and rising popularity with whales, MUTM is indeed the top crypto to focus on and the crypto to buy now for savvy investors.

Yet, one giant stands defiant in the green zone. Tron (TRX) has bucked the bearish trend entirely while other top-10 assets struggle to find support. This resilience highlights Tron’s unique position in the ecosystem, driven by massive network activity and its dominance in the stablecoin sector. This performance isn’t just empty speculation; the fundamentals are stronger than ever. Tron officially hit a staggering $1 billion in revenue this year, cementing its status as a cash-flow positive powerhouse. As investors flock to this outperforming asset to protect their capital, the need for secure storage has never been more critical. This is where the GeeFi wallet becomes essential, offering a sophisticated, non-custodial solution for managing high-performing assets like TRX without the risks of centralized exchanges. The Risk of Centralized Storage in a Volatile Market Market divergence creates opportunity, but it also exposes hidden risks. When one asset rallies while the rest of the market falls, volatility spikes and liquidity can dry up on exchanges. Holding your TRX on a centralized platform during these times is a gamble. Platforms can freeze withdrawals, suffer outages during high traffic, or worse. The only way to truly secure your gains is through self-custody. GeeFi is built on the unshakeable philosophy that if you don’t hold the keys, you don’t own the coins. It provides non-custodial key ownership , meaning you have absolute authority over your wealth. There are no intermediaries to block your access or mishandle your funds. In an unpredictable economy, this level of sovereignty is the ultimate safety net for your digital portfolio. A Rare Opportunity at $0.05 Powering this ecosystem is the GeeFi Token (GEE) . The presale has just launched, and the market response has been electric. In just the first 24 hours, the project raised over $250,000 , selling more than 5.3 million tokens . This rapid influx of capital suggests savvy investors see massive potential in this utility-driven project. The presale is live right now at a price of $0.05 per token . Opportunities to enter a high-utility infrastructure project at this valuation are incredibly rare. Looking back at the early days of major wallet tokens, the growth potential here is undeniable. Early backers are positioning themselves for what could be the next breakout story in the crypto space. A Fortress of Security Features The wallet’s security architecture goes far beyond simple key management. GeeFi employs a robust multi-factor system , combining biometric data with a unique passphrase. This creates a fortress around your assets, ensuring that even if someone gains physical access to your device, your crypto remains untouchable. Advanced privacy controls further ensure your financial data stays yours alone, shielded from prying eyes. Beyond active defense, GeeFi ensures you never lose access to your fortune through human error. The wallet features configurable auto-backups and innovative social recovery options . If you lose your device or forget a password, you have a secure, decentralized path to regain entry. This removes the single point of failure that often scares investors away from self-custody solutions. Simplifying the Complex Crypto Landscape Managing a diverse portfolio is often a chaotic experience, but GeeFi brings order to the chaos. It provides a unified, cross-chain portfolio view that supports not just Tron, but also Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano, Solana, Sui, Avalanche, and Shiba Inu. You can track every asset in real-time from a single dashboard without constantly switching between different apps. The user experience is designed to eliminate the anxiety typical of crypto transactions. Human-readable addresses and clear transaction notes mean you never have to second-guess where your money is going. Furthermore, built-in risk flags and scam link detection actively monitor for threats, shielding you from the phishing attempts and malicious contracts that plague the industry. Tools for the Smart Investor For active traders, GeeFi offers powerful utilities to maximize returns. A gas and fee optimizer ensures you never overpay for network costs, keeping more profit in your pocket. Additionally, a pre-trade price impact preview alerts you to potential slippage before you execute a swap, preventing costly surprises in volatile markets. The roadmap is equally ambitious, promising to turn the wallet into a comprehensive financial hub. The team is developing an integrated DEX for instant swaps, fiat on/off-ramps for easy liquidity access, and native staking to grow your holdings passively. An upcoming crypto card will soon allow you to spend your assets anywhere, bridging the gap between digital finance and the real world. Conclusion As Tron continues to generate revenue and outperform the market, smart investors are taking profits and securing them. GeeFi offers the perfect vessel for that wealth: ironclad security combined with a high-growth investment opportunity. Don’t watch from the sidelines as the next cycle begins. Secure your keys and your future with GeeFi today.

The excitement surrounding institutional access to XRP has grown quickly in recent weeks, especially as filings and inflow reports hint at rising interest from funds preparing to scale their exposure. A market commentator known as Chad Steingraber presented a projection showing just how intense ETF accumulation could become if issuers adopt an acquisition strategy similar to what was seen in Bitcoin ETFs. The estimates outline an aggressive period of accumulation that could reduce XRP’s available supply far faster than many expect, and here are the numbers. Related Reading: Trump’s WLFI Moves To Contain Wallet Breach While Federal Inquiry Looms A Breakdown Of Steingraber’s Projection Steingraber’s first scenario examines a modest but steady accumulation model where 12 Spot XRP ETF issuers acquire an average of 3million XRP per day. His projection is based on focusing on the average rather than trying to predict which fund accumulates the most, because the combined impact is what ultimately matters for XRP’s market price. Under this setup, daily inflows would reach up to 36 million XRP. Over a standard five-day trading week, that accumulation would climb to 160 million XRP. Over the course of a month, the amount absorbed by ETFs would increase to 720 million XRP. By the end of a full year, this single projection implies that as much as 8.64 billion XRP could be removed from public circulation and locked into ETFs. Of course, these numbers only take into account the possibility of consecutive net inflow days and no net outflow days. Although these figures are hypothetical, the pace aligns with the early patterns seen in Bitcoin ETFs, where strong averages across issuers created a sustained demand for Bitcoin. A More Aggressive Scenario Based On Recent Activity In another post, Steingraber offered a more forceful accumulation model using the activity of Bitwise’s Spot XRP ETF as a benchmark. Data shows that the Bitwise XRP ETF received inflows of about 5.82 million XRP in its first trading day. In this second scenario, the projected daily acquisition rate is doubled to about 6 million XRP per issuer. If 12 funds follow this pattern, the combined accumulation could hit 72 million XRP every day. Extending the same five-day cycle, the weekly total would rise toward 360 million XRP, while monthly totals would reach approximately 1.44 billion XRP. Over a full year, this more aggressive model ends with 17.28 billion XRP absorbed into ETF products. “The entire XRP public supply will be gone UNLESS THE PRICE GOES ASTRONOMICALLY HIGH,” Steingraber said. Related Reading: $2 Billion Gone In Minutes: Bitcoin Slide Shakes Crypto World The projections serve as a wake-up call on how quickly XRP’s supply ecosystem might change once ETF inflows stabilize and larger issuers like Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin, 21Shares and WisdomTree get in on the action. However, BlackRock, which oversees the largest Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, is yet to make any move on a Spot XRP ETF. The company had confirmed in August that it has no immediate plans to file for one.

Security metrics have reached unprecedented heights, with the mining hash rate hitting 23.6 exahash per second in the third quarter of 2025. This surge in raw computing power is a clear signal that infrastructure providers are doubling down on the network’s long-term viability. Simultaneously, TradFi adoption is accelerating , pushing cryptocurrency assets firmly into the mainstream financial conversation. This institutional embrace is occurring alongside significant technical evolution. Developers are actively exploring the proposed OP_CAT and OP_CTV upgrades , which are designed to dramatically enhance Bitcoin’s programmability and scaling capabilities. These changes promise to unlock complex functionality previously reserved for smart contract platforms. Navigating this increasingly sophisticated landscape requires advanced tools, which is why the GeeFi Team engineered GeeFi to serve as the ultimate interface for this new era. The Command Center for Multichain Finance GeeFi is a high-performance, non-custodial mobile wallet designed to give you absolute sovereignty over your digital wealth. Since development began in 2023 , the focus has been on creating a secure environment for the modern investor. Publicly released in 2024 , the application supports a vast array of major networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more , ensuring you are never restricted to a single ecosystem. The platform functions as a comprehensive crypto hub. It features essential tools like built-in swaps , cross-chain bridging , and on/off-ramp services that allow for easy movement between fiat and digital currencies. Security is paramount, with integrated AML protocols and WalletConnect support for safe interaction with decentralized applications via the Web3 browser . The app is available now for Android , with an iOS version currently in development. Future-Proofing with the GEE Token The ecosystem is powered by the GEE token , an ERC-20 utility asset with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 . Holding GEE unlocks the full potential of the platform, including benefits within the upcoming HUB, DEX, and GeeFi Card which are currently in development. The tokenomics are designed to be deflationary, creating long-term value retention mechanisms for holders who participate in the ecosystem’s growth. The presale structure is designed to reward early conviction. There are 400 million tokens allocated for the public sale, distributed across 10 phases . Prices increase through tranches from $0.05 to $0.12 , meaning the earliest participants secure the best possible entry. The market has responded aggressively to this structure, as over $250,000 was raised in the first 24 hours of its presale launch .

The company reported that the transfers recorded as high-volume movements on-chain were maintenance operations that had been planned long in advance . Coinbase clarified that the migration is not related to a breach, external threat, or response to existing market conditions. Large on-chain transfers expected during migration The wallet rotation involved transferring the assets from the old Coinbase-managed addresses to the new internal wallets, which were connected to the exchange’s personal custody. By then, blockchain intelligence services had already identified most of the source wallets, making it simple to monitor outgoing operations. Coinbase disclosed that it is also in possession of the new wallets and that they are part of an internal quality assurance overhaul. According to the company, this process implied that customers would witness large BTC and ETH transfers throughout the network. The exchange, however, explained that the movements do not indicate operational instability. The migration encompasses assets stored in Coinbase’s internal systems and does not affect any user deposits or withdrawal addresses. Coinbase also reported that it would not have to put its services offline, stating that trading and transfers would not be impacted during the process. The exchange further confirmed that the update has nothing to do with the changing market prices or industry developments. Warnings issued over potential phishing risks With the visibility of large on-chain transfers generally raising user curiosity and discussion on social media, Coinbase posted an independent notice warning against possible impersonation. The company warned that fraudsters may take advantage of the migration process and impersonate Coinbase employees, seeking access to logins or requesting that customers transfer money. The company stated that it will not call users to request passwords, two-factor authentication codes, seed phrases, or instructions to transfer assets. The exchange declared that it will not issue new deposit addresses for customers to use during the migration, and they should disregard any unofficial messages that may recommend otherwise. Coinbase emphasized the use of urgency created by manufacturing as one of the foundations of phishing attacks, which scammers can exploit by mentioning the wallet rotation. Migration framed as part of broader security architecture According to Coinbase, wallet transitions have become one of the key aspects of its long-term strategy to establish a secure infrastructure supporting managed digital assets. The migration was based on the company’s use of institutional-grade architecture. It has been considered a common practice to change internal wallets to minimize long-term exposure regularly. The operational update follows the acquisition of Vector.fun, integrating technology that enables Coinbase to add newly launched Solana assets immediately and broaden user access to emerging markets. Coinbase clarified that the wallet update strengthened the existing security system of the exchange and did not introduce any customer-facing features or policy changes.

The 730-day simple moving average ( SMA ), a two-year trend gauge that has historically marked transitions into Bitcoin bear markets, now sits at roughly $81,250, according to insights shared by cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on November 22. Bitcoin investor tool. Source: Glassnode According to the analysis, Bitcoin’s recent price action has pushed it below this level, a move that in past cycles has preceded extended periods of downward or sideways market performance. The indicator, often referred to as an “investor tool,” overlays Bitcoin’s multiyear price trajectory with the 730-day SMA and its five-times multiple. Previous cycles show that losing the lower band has typically aligned with major cyclical peaks already being set and market sentiment gradually turning risk-off. The latest reading reinforces that pattern, where with Bitcoin trading around the mid-$80,000 range, the breakdown signals weakening momentum after a long-running uptrend. Notably, the two-year SMA functions as a structural line of support during bull phases, and falling beneath it has historically flagged macro exhaustion. While not a guarantee of deeper losses, the move suggests the market may now be entering a prolonged cool-down phase, especially as broader risk sentiment remains fragile and liquidity trends soften. Bitcoin key price levels to watch This outlook comes as Bitcoin attempted to reclaim the $85,000 level after a week of heavy selling. Analysis by Ted Pillows in an X post on November 22 suggested that failure to recover the $85,000 resistance zone could send Bitcoin back toward $80,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows According to the analyst, the next critical zone to watch for Bitcoin is the $85,000–$86,000 area following a sharp multi-week sell-off. The region, which previously acted as a demand zone, is now being retested from below as the market attempts to stabilize after a steep drop from above $100,000. His outlook outlines multiple potential rebound paths if Bitcoin can close back above this band, with upside targets clustering around $89,000, $92,000, and $95,000, levels that served as support throughout the year before breaking down in November. If buyers fail to defend the $85,000–$86,000 region, the technical picture turns considerably weaker. The next visible support sits just above $80,000, and losing that level could trigger a fast move into the $78,000–$79,000 range highlighted in green. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $84,239, down approximately 0.3% in the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, the asset has declined by over 11%.

Company Shares Game Plan,https://bitcoinist.com/will-strategy-be-forced-to-sell-its-50b-bitcoin-company-shares-game-plan/,"Strategy, a business intelligence company founded by Michael Saylor , has released new data outlining how its Bitcoin (BTC) position holds up under current market conditions. This disclosure raises the question of whether the company could ever be forced to sell its $54.59 billion in Bitcoin holdings . Its latest internal projections, shared publicly, highlight the firm’s expectations for long-term sustainability while also inviting scrutiny of its historic aggressive accumulation strategy . Strategy Confirms BTC Reserves Cover Dividends For Decades The Strategy team stated on X this Thursday that with Bitcoin trading below $85,000 , the company has more than enough coverage to maintain its dividend obligations for 71 years even if the price remains flat. Additionally, if Bitcoin’s price grows by more than 1.41% annually, that growth alone would completely neutralize the firm’s dividends without requiring additional funds. Strategy shared its internal credit dashboard, which tracks details such as debt maturities, durations, interest exposure, and Bitcoin risk. The report shows a total debt of $8,214 and a matching cumulative national value. Most of this comes from the company’s Bitcoin-linked preferred instruments, including various STR-series tranches, totaling $7,779 and with a combined notional value of $15,993. Durations across these instruments range from under 2 years to nearly 10, with BTC risk concentrated in the low single digits. Overall, the combined debt and preferred structure totals $15,993. The company’s model also assumes a Bitcoin price of $87,300, a volatility of 45%, and an expected annual return of 30%. According to Strategy, these numbers indicate that the firm has plenty of financial flexibility. The company has shown that its dividend security does not rely on aggressive Bitcoin price growth. Although its balance sheet is tied to BTC’s market performance , Strategy’s internal credit analysis suggests it can withstand extended periods of sideways price action without liquidating its core holdings. Saylor Faces Criticism For Persistent Bitcoin Buys In a separate update, Strategy highlighted its actions during the 2022 crypto winter , which was marked by a widespread market collapse. When the price of Bitcoin dropped to $16,000, roughly 50% of Strategy’s then-average cost basis of $30,000, the firm increased its position rather than pulling back. This reminder resurfaced longstanding criticisms from market participants who argue that the company’s approach relies too heavily on constant averaging up. The CEO of SwanDesk, Jacob King, criticized Saylor, claiming that the Strategy founder has not shown any real investment ability. King pointed out that since Saylor’s first BTC purchase at around $11,000, the cryptocurrency has surged roughly 1,000%. In contrast, Strategy has generated only a 22% return over five years, equating to about 4.4% per year. King described this performance as “horrible,” attributing it to the firm’s seemingly flawed strategy of persistently buying Bitcoin at higher prices. The SwanDesk CEO also highlighted Saylor’s history in the tech sector, noting that he had wiped out nearly 99% of his net worth during the dot-com era by chasing underperforming tech stocks and restating the firm’s financials under the scrutiny of the US SEC .

A rising-wedge breakdown has driven price straight into a key support zone just as BTC prints its first major post-ATH drawdown of over 33%, a level that has historically signaled prolonged weakness and heightened volatility. With technical pressure colliding with a historically significant threshold, the market now faces a decisive moment. Rising Wedge Break Sends Bitcoin Lower Into Key Support Zone Crypto analyst The Boss, in a recent breakdown of Bitcoin’s daily chart, highlighted the formation of a rising wedge pattern. As expected, Bitcoin has broken down from this wedge, sending the price sliding into what is considered a strong support zone. This level has historically acted as a turning point, making its current test a crucial moment for the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows A Clear Momentum Reset — Is A Trend Reversal Coming? According to the analyst, this area could trigger a potential upward reaction, as buyers often step in when the price reaches such well-established support levels. However, the possibility of a rebound is not guaranteed. The structure must show early signs of strength before any meaningful recovery can be considered reliable. Momentum indicators paint a cautious picture as they remain notably weak, showing no clear signal of bullish pressure returning to the market. At the same time, trading volume remains lower than necessary for a confident reversal, suggesting that buyers have yet to step in. Without stronger participation, any bounce may be shallow or short-lived. Due to these factors, the analyst emphasized that Bitcoin’s current level must be closely monitored. While a short-term reaction from support is possible, a failure to hold this zone would open the door to further downside and potentially expose deeper support areas. BTC Hits 33% Drawdown Threshold: A Historically Significant Signal According to a recent update shared by Crypto Patel, Bitcoin has now recorded a 33% drawdown from its all-time high, marking a correction significant enough to grab the market’s full attention. This is more than a routine pullback; it represents a level of decline that has historically signaled deeper shifts in market sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces A Negative Correlation Trend And Still Holds Strong — Here’s Why Looking back through previous cycles, every instance where BTC retraced beyond 33% after a peak has been followed by prolonged periods of weakness, increased volatility, and continued downside pressure. These drawdowns often served as transitional phases, where momentum reset before the next major trend could establish itself. The market now sits in a critical phase, with traders and analysts watching closely to see whether Bitcoin repeats its well-known historical behavior or breaks the cycle with a stronger-than-expected recovery.

This development represents a significant shift in the federal government’s approach to AI regulation and could have far-reaching implications for how artificial intelligence is governed across the United States. What Prompted This Dramatic Shift in AI Regulation Strategy? The Trump administration had been aggressively targeting state-level AI regulation, with President Trump declaring in a social media post that the industry needs “one Federal Standard instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.” This stance followed the removal of a 10-year ban on state AI laws from Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” by the Senate in a nearly unanimous 99-1 vote. The administration then reportedly drafted an executive order to create the AI litigation task force specifically designed to challenge state AI regulations through lawsuits. Understanding the Proposed AI Litigation Task Force The now-paused executive order would have established a powerful mechanism to enforce federal AI policy supremacy: Mission to challenge state AI laws through legal action Authority to threaten states with loss of federal broadband funding Power to create uniform federal standards across all states Ability to override conflicting state-level regulations Why Did Republicans Oppose This Federal AI Policy Approach? The proposed AI regulation strategy faced significant opposition from unexpected quarters, including Republicans who had previously criticized the moratorium on state regulation. This internal party conflict highlights the complex political dynamics surrounding artificial intelligence governance. The resistance suggests that even within the Trump administration ‘s own political base, there are concerns about federal overreach in technology policy. Silicon Valley’s Divided Stance on State AI Laws The debate over AI regulation has created deep divisions within the technology industry: Some industry figures, particularly those aligned with the Trump administration, have attacked companies like Anthropic for supporting AI safety legislation California’s SB 53 has become a focal point of controversy Industry leaders are split between favoring uniform federal standards versus state-specific approaches The debate reflects broader tensions between innovation and safety concerns What This Means for Future Federal AI Policy The pause in establishing the AI litigation task force suggests several important developments in federal AI policy : Potential recognition of state rights in technology regulation Acknowledgment of the political challenges in overriding state laws Possible shift toward collaborative federal-state approaches Increased uncertainty for AI companies operating across multiple states The Road Ahead for AI Regulation in America This development represents a critical juncture in how the United States will approach AI regulation . The pause allows for: More time for stakeholder consultation Potential compromise between federal and state interests Opportunity for more nuanced policy development Space for industry input on the optimal regulatory framework Frequently Asked Questions What companies are most affected by these AI regulation changes? Companies like Anthropic and other AI developers operating across multiple states face significant regulatory uncertainty. Who in the Trump administration is driving AI policy? While specific officials aren’t named in the report, the administration’s approach appears coordinated through executive channels, potentially involving President Trump directly. What state AI laws are currently most controversial? California’s SB 53 has emerged as a particularly contentious piece of legislation that has drawn criticism from administration-aligned industry figures. How might this affect international AI companies? Foreign AI companies operating in the US now face a more complex regulatory landscape with potential state-by-state variations in requirements. This stunning reversal in the Trump administration ‘s approach to AI regulation marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of artificial intelligence governance. By pausing the establishment of an AI litigation task force that would have challenged state AI laws , the administration has opened the door for a more collaborative approach to federal AI policy . This decision acknowledges the political realities of overriding state authority while creating space for more nuanced policy development that balances innovation with necessary safeguards. To learn more about the latest AI regulation trends, explore our article on key developments shaping AI policy and institutional adoption.

The whales have consistently been absorbing the supply during any dip, further squeezing market liquidity in preparation for explosive ascents in the final stages of market consolidation. But while Bitcoin is on course for its next monumental move, market participants are widening their scope to promising new growth opportunities, which have progressed at breakneck speeds, much to market shock. And in such market contexts, one token stands out: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With its presale having broken into Phase 6, MUTM is now priced at $0.035, with no less than 18,120 participants contributing to its presale. Bitcoin Makes Attempt to Stabilize as Buyers Protect Key Reaction Area Bitcoin is attempting to lock in support after a strong correction, with buyers re-entering in the region of the $87K–$92K reaction point, which has acted as a bullish reversal point in several macro corrections in the past. It is mostly interacting with its channel support levels, which remains slightly bullish as long as support at this region is secured. But failure could again unlock deep levels for sell pressure to re-enter before any recovery is likely to happen. This is an opportune moment for BTC, but some market participants are also looking at early-stage projects with more pronounced levels of accumulation, in an atmosphere in which sentiment is leaning towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM), recognized as a top crypto and an innovative new crypto coin. MUTM Presale: Creating Market Momentum Mutuum Finance is fast on its way to becoming one of the biggest DeFi launches. Presale phase 6, in which tokens cost $0.035, marks the final stage before prices go to $0.04 in Phase 7. MUTM has made it simpler to participate in its platform by introducing support for Credit/Debit Card payments on its website, thereby allowing for seamless participation for all participants, whether beginners in investing in cryptocurrency or professionals in the market. MUTM’s solid fundamentals, coupled with its adoption, has placed it in pole position to be considered the top crypto and a standout new crypto coin to move to $1. Sepolia Testnet for Lending and Borrowing Protocol An important upcoming milestone will be the launch of Mutuum Finance’s first production-grade lending and borrowing protocol on the Sepolia testnet, which is slated to happen this quarter. Initially, support for ETH, USDT, mtTokens, debt tokens, and an automated liquidation process will be included in Mutuum Finance’s functionality, with additional assets to be added in due course. What this launch shows is that Mutuum Finance is not simply a presale—it is an operational DeFi space with real-life use, long-term growth, and token-based value, cementing MUTM’s status as one of the top crypto for sustainable growth and the new crypto coin with tangible utility. Buybacks and Rewards The MUTM token economy is secured by a buy-back system, whereby platform charges are used for the purchase of MUTM tokens to reward mtToken holders, in effect ensuring that value in MUTM tokens grows based on real activity on the platform, not on hype. To encourage more engagement, Mutuum Finance also runs a leaderboard contest on a daily basis, rewarding participants with $500 in MUTM tokens for being the best contributor each day (starting from 00:00 UTC). Such efforts not only encourage regular engagement on the platform, MUTM, but also solidify its stance as the new crypto coin with tremendous growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has cumulatively raised over $18.85M, with more than 18,120 participants, with Phase 6 being over 95% sold out at just $0.035 per token. Phase 7 raises the value to $0.04, which marks the end for early adoption in particular. With its testing network for lending, borrowing, credit, debit cards, and its buyback reward process on track, MUTM is looking to be one of the top cryptos in 2025.

The network is banking on massive infrastructure upgrades like Firedancer and Alpenglow to redefine its capabilities. Firedancer, a new validator client, aims to potentially boost transaction throughput to over one million transactions per second (TPS) , a figure that would rival traditional financial networks. A Record Surge in Developer Talent The strength of any blockchain lies in its builders, and Solana is excelling, now boasting a record 17,000+ active developers and achieving an impressive 29.1% annual growth in developer activity. This surge marks a dramatic recovery and rapid expansion, fueled by improved tooling and a robust support network that continues to attract top coding talent from across Web3. This influx of developers is creating a diverse range of applications, from decentralized finance protocols to consumer-facing apps. However, while the technology becomes faster and more sophisticated, the ability to actually spend these digital assets in the real world remains stuck in the past. This practical limitation is exactly what the GeeFi Team set out to resolve with their comprehensive payment ecosystem. The Disconnect Between Speed and Spending While Solana works to process transactions in milliseconds, converting those assets into a cup of coffee or a grocery run often takes days. The traditional route involves moving funds to a centralized exchange, selling them for fiat currency, and waiting for a bank transfer to clear. This friction renders even the fastest crypto impractical for daily life. GeeFi eliminates spending barriers entirely: the platform was engineered to turn digital assets into spendable money just as easily as cash. Development began in 2023 , and after months of innovation, GeeFi made its public launch in 2024 . The team’s solution empowers crypto to be used anywhere, without losing the core security of blockchain. True Ownership with Global Reach At the core of the GeeFi experience is a commitment to user sovereignty through a secure non-custodial wallet . Unlike centralized exchanges that hold your assets, this wallet ensures you maintain exclusive control over your private keys and funds. You are the only one with access to your wealth, eliminating the risks associated with third-party custodians. This secure wallet pairs directly with the GeeFi Card , which operates on the expansive VISA and Mastercard networks. This integration enables you to spend your crypto balance in real time at millions of merchants globally. There is no need to pre-load funds or manage complex conversions; the transaction happens instantly at the point of sale. Continuous Innovation and Access The platform is designed for accessibility and constant improvement. The GeeFi app is currently live on Android , allowing users to manage their cards and wallets immediately. The team is also actively working on an iOS version , which is currently in development, alongside a schedule of continuous wallet updates to enhance functionality and security features. We are witnessing a shift from speculative investment to tangible utility, a transition that historically rewards early participants. The GeeFi presale has already raised over $250,000 by selling more than 5.3 million tokens , offering a strategic entry into this new financial paradigm. The GEE token is currently priced at $0.05 , with this price scheduled to increase after the first phase ends , rewarding those who act quickly. Rewards for Participation and Growth Owning GEE is about more than governance; it unlocks direct financial benefits. Users can stake their tokens to earn high-yield returns, with an APR ranging between 45–55% . Additionally, stakers gain access to a tiered rewards system that provides cashback on card spending and reduced platform fees, maximizing the value of every transaction. To foster a strong and active community, GeeFi has implemented a robust referral program. By sharing your unique personal link, you can earn a 5% bonus in GEE tokens on every purchase made by your referrals. This incentivizes users to help grow the network while adding to their own holdings.

After losing almost 28% of its value this November, the flagship cryptocurrency looks set for the onset of a full bearish cycle. Interestingly, recent on-chain data has been released, which explores a few key metrics to explain the landscape of liquidity pushing Bitcoin’s price, with implied mentions of what to realistically expect in the near term. Available Liquidity Tapers As Long-Term Demand Rises In a QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, analytics platform Arab Chain highlights the growing divergence between Bitcoin’s seasoned investors and its ‘smart money’ market players. The DeFi firm begins its report with readings obtained from the Total Sell-side Liquidity metric, which tracks the amount of Bitcoin available to be sold into the market, based on the behavior of parties that usually serve as liquidity sources. Per Arab Chain, this metric’s reading has recently dropped to about 975,000 BTC, indicating a decline in the amount of coins available for sale by active market participants. In tandem, the Accumulator Address Demand indicator has shown a surge above 355,000 Bitcoin. For context, this metric reveals how much persistent buying pressure is coming from reputable Bitcoin accumulation wallets over an extended period of time. A surge to 355,000 and levels above reflects a growing accumulation appetite amid the premier cryptocurrency’s strongest holders. Typically, a positive accumulation behavior displayed by market participants helps foresee a sustainable price action in the long term. On the other hand, Arab Chain also cites a confluence of two indicators, the Liquidity Inventory Ratio and the ETF Demand. The first, which is a measurement of how long extant liquidity can sustain market activity, shows a reading of 2.74 months, thus indicating there is slower replenishment of active supply. The latter metric, which indicates the net outflows from US spot ETFs, has dropped to -51,000 BTC, indicating sustained net outflows. Taken together, both metrics point to weakening institutional demand, which stands in clear contrast to the rising on-chain accumulation seen elsewhere. Notably, Binance data reveals that there has been a visible downturn in the price-to-net buying correlation. At the time of the DeFi firm’s report, when Bitcoin was around $83,000, the correlation had seen a decline to as low as 0.72. A weakening correlation typically signals declining inflows relative to price action, thereby implying that the market’s movement is based only on the increasingly fragile liquidity available. Historical data points out that in such conditions, a slight introduction of downward pressure could trigger an exaggerated price crash.

Delayed for more than a month by the government shutdown, new September retail figures are expected to be released this week by the Census Bureau. The figures are likely to indicate slowing momentum in consumer spending — perhaps an indication that, after months of being clobbered by inflation, households may have reached their limit. Retail sales are projected to rise by 0.4% in September, a more modest increase than the 0.6% rise in August, analysts say. The slight dip may be the initial sign of a more sustained pullback after solid summer spending. That support is unlikely to continue as financial strains intensify, economists said: The earlier spike in demand buoyed third-quarter economic growth. High prices are driving shoppers to cut back Inflation has moderated from the extremes of 2022, but prices for many everyday staples are stubbornly high. For millions of Americans, this has translated into budget constraints at a time when wages have been slow to keep pace. Groceries, rent, gas, and household utilities still account for a greater share of household income than they have in 50 years; there is barely any substance left for discretionary spending. New research from the University of Michigan now highlights this stress. Consumers are now reporting the gloomiest outlook for their personal finances since 2009, driven by a combination of high prices and stagnant savings. Worries about job loss, too, have risen to a five-year high — an indication that households may be close to shifting from cautious spending to full-on belt-tightening. The gap between incomes is growing. Wealthier consumers, buoyed by a booming stock market, remain comfortable spending. Retail behemoths like Walmart and Gap have posted robust quarterly sales, in part by drawing more affluent customers who appreciate value or discounts. However, for those at the lower end of the income scale, the situation is quite different. Home improvement retailers, including Home Depot, say customers are delaying larger purchases and putting off home renovations. Together, the trends tell a clear story: Even if Americans want to spend, many cannot afford to stretch their budgets further. Labour market woes to hurt spending growth The American labor market, a key source of economic strength, is cooling down. Hiring is slowing as business owners become more cautious. Several firms are cutting costs by slowing down hiring and investment, or using automation to reduce labor costs. The release of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book later this week, which covers October and early November, is expected to confirm the softening of the economy. Analysts anticipate reports of more tepid hiring, a pullback in business activity, and increased wariness in numerous sectors. Economists at Bloomberg write that labor conditions edged up slightly after hitting a low point in the summer. However, the partial shutdown of the federal government in October created a new hole in hiring and consumer spending. These disappointments have reignited calls for the Fed to lower interest rates at its December meeting, and some experts argue that a rate cut may help support an increasingly vulnerable recovery. There will also be several important economic indicators on the calendar. The producer price index for September, durable goods orders, and weekly jobless claims will provide a more comprehensive view of the economy’s health as it enters the Thanksgiving holiday. Now, retailers are preparing for Black Friday — that one day that is likely the biggest shopping day of the year. While big brands gear up for a sales spike, early signs suggest that consumers may be entering the holiday season with unease not seen in recent years. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

In the past week, the premier cryptocurrency recorded another 10% price decline, trading as low as $80,800, before experiencing a modest bounce. Bitcoin now stands 32.79% below its all-time high, with distribution taking preference over accumulation for most investors. However, popular analyst Gert Van Lagen has unveiled an on-chain trend that postulates an impending revival of the bull market. Related Reading: Saylor’s Strategy Under Threat: Index Status At Risk With $8 Billion On The Line Bitcoin Historical Post-Halving Movement Indicates Bullish Hope In an X post on November 21, Gert Van Lagen outlines a positive Bitcoin price prediction based on data from the previous post-halving movement. The renowned analyst explains this forecast, using a long-term logarithmic chart of Bitcoin’s price vs Bitcoin block height, which highlights a regression channel the digital asset has followed since 2009. According to Van Lagen, Bitcoin has followed a similar pattern after every halving, which usually begins with pushing above the midline of this long-term regression channel. Thereafter, the premier cryptocurrency accelerates into a blow-off top (orange spikes) at the channel’s upper boundary as seen in 2013, 2017, and 2021. For all its price exploits in the present market cycle, Bitcoin presently trades just below the midline of the regression channel, suggesting there is ample space for price appreciation. However, Van Lagen notes some unusual price behavior in that Bitcoin has experienced rejection thrice at this midline, each time resulting in a bounce off the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement line. Nevertheless, the analyst still expects the premier cryptocurrency to maintain the 15-year historical trend and eventually secure a decisive move above the midline resistance. If this price development occurs, Van Lagen also predicts Bitcoin to rise to around $350,000 – $400,000, a price range target that aligns with the upper boundary of the regression channel. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Crash To $85,000 Is Actually Good News: Jeff Park The ‘Genuine’ Bearish Market Despite the heightened fears of a bearish market at the moment, Van Lagen explains that the much-dreaded crypto winter only commences after Bitcoin reaches its upper boundary target, establishing a market top. Based on the presented analysis, the market expert predicts Bitcoin will crash from this market peak to retest the 210,000 block SMA, i.e, the lower trend line of the regression channel. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $84,300 after a 2.36% price loss in the past day. In the last month, the crypto market leader has experienced a 21.96% price devaluation, suggesting a rather volatile and cautious market condition.

As the trading week draws to a close, BTC is on track to post its worst weekly performance in over a year. Will This Week Mark A Capitulation Point For Bitcoin? Bitcoin is now firmly on track to log its worst weekly performance in over a year, and it’s also shaping up to become its second-worst November in history. A full-time crypto trader and investor, Daan Crypto Trades, has mentioned on X that historically, November is the best-performing month in terms of average returns. This sharp deviation from the norm is a significant disappointment for many, making 2025 a challenging year so far for the crypto market. Daan believes that BTC will shine again in the decade to come. These unexpected downturns in the market may not always be enjoyable, but they are essential in the long run. The most crucial thing you need to do is survive. It is worth noting that red rectangles usually come with a lot of green rectangles. Thus, Daan claims investors need to endure the red for long enough. The CEO of SwanDesk Financial, Jacob King, has highlighted that one of the biggest red flags signaling the Bitcoin bubble was about to burst when Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, suddenly flipped bullish on BTC earlier this year. For years, Dimon told investors to stay away from BTC, calling it a giant fraud. The reality is that these Wall Street banks probably bought billions worth of BTC early on and needed more time to accumulate their positions quietly, without driving up the price against themselves. At the peak, when they need exit liquidity, they would promote it to their customers to buy, and push extreme price targets to draw in fresh demand. King stated that “Wall Street is sleezy, and anything they say should be taken as a direct cue to expect the opposite, especially when it comes to crypto.” A Capitulation Event Bitcoin Has Never Seen Before An analyst known as the Master of Crypto has offered insights into investors’ action, noting that short-term Bitcoin holders are experiencing pressure at a level the market has never recorded before. During the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, when BTC swiftly slipped to about $3,850, roughly 92% of recent buyers were sitting on losses. Fast forward to the devastating fallout from the FTX collapse in November 2022, and that number rose to roughly 94% as BTC tumbled to the $16,000 mark. The current data show an even sharper shock as over 99% of all short-term holders are in the red near the $89,000 level. Analysts across the board are calling this the most intense wave of capitulation that the BTC market has ever experienced.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|CoVid-19|Daan Crypto Trades|FTX|Jacob King|Jamie Dimon|JPMorgan|Master of Crypto|SwanDesk Financial,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-23 00:30:05

The revelations have sparked renewed concerns over ideological bias, misinformation, and the ethical governance of AI-powered knowledge platforms. A nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, Public Citizen, ignited heated debates among individuals concerning Elon Musk’s Grok AI. This was after the group disclosed new proof indicating that the chatbot depended on neo-Nazi and white-nationalist websites for information as its trusted sources. The group stated that the behavior should disqualify Grok from any federal use and renewed calls for the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to intervene, as it had been months without a response. The existence of Grok ignites concerns among individuals Grokipedia, launched by Musk’s xAI in late October 2025 , aims to serve as an AI-powered alternative to Wikipedia. The platform claims to generate and review content via Grok, Musk’s large language model chatbot. According to xAI, the encyclopedia project is “fact-checked by Grok” and is designed to correct perceived bias and provide more context than traditional encyclopedias. Regarding Public Citizen’s new findings, the group reported that the encyclopedia project often displays extremist websites, such as Stormfront, according to a recent study from Cornell University. The findings also raised earlier concerns when it mentioned that the model called itself “MechaHitler” in July on Tesla’s CEO’s platform, X. After thoroughly looking into the provided discovery, sources noted that these results demonstrated what advocates described as a pattern of racist, antisemitic, and conspiratorial actions. Following the analysis, Joshua Branch, an advocate for big-tech accountability at Public Citizen, weighed in on the situation during an interview. Branch claimed that Grok has repeatedly displayed these kinds of breakdowns, whether it is an antisemitic outburst or a racist one, that have primarily been driven by conspiracy theories. The recent alert was issued after Public Citizen and 24 other groups advocating for civil rights, digital rights, the environment, and consumer protection forwarded letters to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in August and October. In these letters, the organizations requested that the agency implement effective measures to stop Grok from being accessible to federal departments via the General Services Administration, an independent agency that oversees federal property and procurement. However, after some time, the group revealed that it did not receive any replies from their outreach efforts. They also uncovered that Grok’s impact on the government has increased over the past year despite encountering several incidents. To explain the origin of the AI chatbot, r eports from sources stated that xAI struck a deal worth $200 million with the Pentagon in July this year. Afterwards, the General Services Administration added Grok to a list of large language models that were readily available to all federal agencies. These included Gemini, Meta AI, ChatGPT, and Claude. This move took place when U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a ban on “woke AI” in federal contracts. Advocates call for the authorities to take serious measures against Grok Advocates contended that the actions reported against the AI chatbot built into his social network, X, increased the urgency to review carefully, particularly as fears mounted regarding the chatbot’s training data and its dependability. “Grok started as restricted to the Department of Defense, which was already concerned because of the sensitive information that the department holds,” Branch said. “Allowing it access to the entire federal government raised an even greater concern.” According to Branch, the AI chatbot built into his social network X’s behavior can be attributed partly to its training data and also to the design decisions made by Musk’s companies. “There’s a noticeable difference in terms of quality between Grok and other language models, and some of that is because of its training data, which includes X,” he said. “Musk has mentioned wanting Grok to be an anti-woke option, and that shows in some of its harsh responses.” Join a premium crypto trading community free for 30 days - normally $100/mo.",Tech|Elon Musk|Grok,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-23 00:45:35

That announcement was made just days after the U.S. Department of Justice accused the company and its chief executive officer, Firas Isa, of operating a multimillion-dollar money-laundering operation. The company operates machines that enable customers to buy and sell Bitcoin and other digital assets nationwide. Crypto Dispensers stated that it had hired advisors to research strategic options, including a full sale. One of the company’s largest areas, it noted, was the digital-asset infrastructure sector, which is rapidly changing and consolidating. It aims to determine whether the platform will gain more value by selling, merging, or restructuring its assets. The company emphasized that the review is not merely a response to the legal matter, but rather a measure of its broader perspective on its next phase of growth. Firas Isa, CEO of Crypto Dispensers, stated that the company is also considering additional developments to gain a competitive edge in the cash-to-crypto business. However, pinpointing the timing is difficult. This announcement comes less than a week after government agents unveiled charges against the private firm for illegally dealing with the profits of crime. Critics say the criminal case will prompt negotiations regarding the sale or even a valuation. CEO and company respond to federal allegations Federal prosecutors have claimed that Crypto Dispensers and Isa handled at least $10 million related to such crimes as wire fraud and narcotics trafficking. Customers made cash deposits at the company’s ATMs, the investigation stated, which were subsequently converted into cryptocurrency. Isa allegedly transferred that crypto through a network of digital wallets to conceal its origins, prosecutors say. According to the DOJ, Isa didn’t comply with or circumvent the anti-money-laundering rules that had been enforced, including the provision of identity verification. There was a possibility, prosecutors argue, that despite its know-your-customer (KYC) rules, the company allowed high-risk trade to flow freely through its systems. Isa and Crypto Dispensers both have pleaded not guilty. They face a single charge, that of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison. They could also be forced to forfeit company money if they were found guilty. The government is requesting that the asset be transferred to the Federal District Court and that all actual assets, which they claim were part of the conspiracy, including Bitcoin ATMs, be forfeited. If not, the prosecutors may demand other property. Crypto market turbulence pressures the company The potential sale would add to the turmoil in cryptocurrency investing as a whole. After a blistering ascent earlier in the year, the price of Bitcoin has now been falling for several weeks. The decline has been severe enough to wipe billions of dollars off the market and rattle the confidence of retail and institutional investors. All of this has led to a ripple effect throughout the industry. Companies that rely on high trading volumes — such as exchanges, payment processors, and ATM operators — are being pressured. As fewer users purchase and sell crypto, transaction volumes are plummeting, for businesses like Crypto Dispensers, which generate revenue from every transaction, a small increase in profit is directly impacted by any decline in transaction volume. At the same time, the pressure from U.S. regulation is mounting. Federal agencies have increased the demands placed on crypto companies, resulting in sharper scrutiny of issues related to anti-money laundering controls, consumer protection, and fraud. Firms such as Crypto Dispensers now need to invest more in compliance systems, personnel, and reporting tools to ensure regulatory compliance. This additional expense is becoming increasingly unmanageable for smaller or mid-sized businesses. Industry analysts say that all of this combined pressure — market volatility, weaker revenues, and tougher regulation — is driving many crypto companies to merge, be acquired, or close down.

Reeves’ decision aims to ensure the market for clean vehicles remains stable amid escalating concerns about a new pay-per-mile tax. Following the Chancellor’s plans, set to be outlined in next week’s budget , reports from sources claim that drivers in the country can obtain government subsidies to reduce the cost of buying a new electric automobile until 2030. Reeves makes clear her intentions to back the EV sector with increased subsidies When Reeves’ decision was announced, experts in the EV sector expressed their excitement about the news of extra funding. However, they warned that the Treasury might discourage potential buyers with its plan to impose an additional 3p tax for every mile driven on top of the current road taxes. Following these concerns, the government issued a statement highlighting its intention to support the emerging electric vehicle sector in the country with a £1.5 billion package aimed at reducing upfront costs, accelerating the rollout of charging points, and creating jobs and opportunities for individuals. Therefore, according to the government, individuals will find it easier to choose green options and contribute to national growth. Ginny Buckley, founder of the EV review site electrifying.com, weighed in on the topic of discussion. Buckley acknowledged that the government’s efforts to increase subsidies for EVs are great news. She argued that this move was adopted after the authority realized that the initial funds allocated were insufficient. “The rules about electric vehicles (EVs) are really confusing. You can’t encourage people to buy EVs while also suggesting pay-per-mile charging. Potential buyers feel like they get the green light to purchase a new car, only to face a roadblock in the form of a pay-per-mile tax,” Buckley added. On the other hand, reports from sources revealed that the government’s plan for EVs required car makers to ensure that one out of every three vehicles sold in 2026 produces zero emissions. Notably, this requirement is predicted to increase to 80% in 2030. Meanwhile, during the spending review held earlier this year, Reeves launched a £400 million grant initiative for electric automobiles. This program was introduced to help reduce the initial cost of new EVs by up to £3,750. To illustrate its effectiveness, sources noted that this initiative has already enabled 35,000 drivers to purchase a new electric vehicle. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly popular, and it is expected to run out in two years. Reeves’s next week’s budget set to spark optimism in the EV ecosystem Reeves demonstrates her commitment to supporting the emerging EV sector. Sources mentioned that the chancellor is expected to propose adding an extra £1.3 billion to this fund and extending its availability until 2029-2030 next week. She will also set aside an additional £200 million for more charging stations since many potential owners cite range anxiety as a major reason for not purchasing an EV. At the same budget, Reeves is also likely to reveal a plan for a new pay-per-mile system, which may raise the average yearly cost of owning an electric vehicle by £276. This tax could generate around £375 million for the Treasury each year, based on the current number of EVs on the road. The purpose of this scheme is to fill the budget gap that has emerged due to a drop in fuel duty as more drivers switch from petrol and diesel cars. However, experts warn that it might slow down the growth of the EV market. Reeves will also announce a review looking into the costs of charging vehicles on the street. This comes as there are demands for the government to lower the 20% VAT rate that only applies to roadside charging.

54771190,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90403,1763861456,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected Worth of 1000 XRP By 2030,https://timestabloid.com/projected-worth-of-1000-xrp-by-2030/,"The question of what 1,000 XRP might represent by 2030 has become increasingly common within the XRP community. Discussions range from moderate price expectations to highly optimistic projections, with each scenario offering a different estimate of the potential future value of a 1,000-token holding. At the current market price of $1.94, a 1,000 XRP position is valued at $1,940. However, analysts and commentators present a wide range of price forecasts for the coming years, and these outlooks significantly influence how investors perceive the long-term potential of this amount. Diverging Analyst Expectations Some influential community members, including Duefe and Edo Farina, argue that holding less than 1,000 XRP is insufficient for investors who believe in the asset’s long-term prospects. Their stance is based on the expectation that XRP could eventually achieve valuations in the triple- or even four-digit range. These views sit on the most optimistic end of the projection spectrum. More restrained perspectives point to lower but still notable targets. Telegaon, for example, proposes that XRP could reach a maximum of $20 by 2030. Should this occur, a 1,000 XRP investment would rise to $20,000, producing substantial gains without approaching the highest predictions currently circulating. A commonly discussed benchmark is the possibility of XRP reaching $100. Technical analyst 24hrscrypto1 recently suggested that market conditions could allow the asset to achieve this valuation sooner than expected. Under this scenario, 1,000 XRP would be valued at $100,000, placing it well above the moderate projections. On the far end of the spectrum are estimates from figures such as Dom and Phil Kwok of EasyA , as well as analyst Matthew Brienen. These analysts argue that XRP could climb toward the $1,000 level by the end of the decade. At that valuation, a 1,000-token holding would exceed $1 million, representing a dramatic increase from its current worth. Even more aggressive price modeling has emerged from Valhil Capital through the Athey and Mitchnick valuation method, which has assigned theoretical values approaching $4,813 per XRP by 2030. Although such projections are considered speculative and rely on ambitious assumptions, they reflect the confidence some institutional analysts place in XRP’s long-term utility. Factors Supporting Long-Term Optimism Several arguments underpin these higher forecasts. XRP has seen renewed institutional attention following the resolution of its regulatory issues in the United States. With legal clarity established , asset managers and hedge funds have begun assessing opportunities beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, placing XRP among the assets considered for broader investment strategies. Developers have also shown increased interest in building on the XRP Ledger as market activity grows. Advocates argue that rising prices tend to bring greater developer participation, which then leads to increased network usage. This combination, expanded attention, new development, and deeper liquidity, is frequently cited by supporters of higher price targets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additionally, XRP’s role in areas such as cross-border payments, tokenization infrastructure, settlement operations, and potential ETF expansion remains central to the bullish viewpoint. Supporters believe that broad adoption across these sectors could justify higher valuations. Evaluating the Practicality of These Estimates Despite the enthusiasm, the feasibility of the most ambitious predictions remains debatable. A price of $100 would require a market capitalization of more than $6 trillion, while a $1,000 valuation would imply a market cap exceeding $60 trillion. Though skeptics argue that these levels are difficult to justify under current global market conditions, proponents contend that large-scale institutional adoption could make them possible. For now, the outlook remains divided. Whether XRP ultimately approaches $25, $100, or far higher levels by 2030 will depend on regulatory progress, institutional participation, network growth, and broader market dynamics in the years ahead.

He said in an interview with Swiss broadcaster SRF , br oadcast on Saturday. Switzerland is ready for the change , Parmelin said. The U.S. will take a little longer to adjust, he said. Once the new tariff system is approved, the lower rate will need 10 or 12 working days to be reflected in the system, he told Aargauer Zeitung, a Swiss German-language daily newspaper. He refused to specify a date, citing ongoing American preparations. Preliminary deal opens door to more negotiations On 14 November, Switzerland and the U.S. signed an initial protocol containing a liability provision, committing them to reduce the level of the U.S. tariff from 39% to 15%. The 39% rate was the highest imposed in August on any European country, and it quickly began to take its toll on Swiss exporters. The early agreement is an initial effort to mitigate trade tensions. It also features a significant pledge from Swiss companies to invest $200 billion in the United States by 2028, spread across chemicals, machinery, and high-tech sectors. The next step, Parmelin added, is a “real conversation about implementation,” so that the decrease is fully enacted and not just on paper. Parmelin suggested that Switzerland, too, could seek additional waivers beyond the 15% rate agreed upon. The tariff decrease is expected to bring some relief for Swiss sectors that have been affected by the 39% rate introduced in August last year. Some of the hardest-hit sectors include machinery, watches, chemicals, and drugs. The high tariffs had driven up costs for U.S. importers, slowing demand and snarling supply chains. Lowering the tariff to 15% would bring Swiss exporters in line with those of the European Union, making them more competitive for a larger slice of the U.S. market. Experts warn of remaining hurdles Expert observers hailed the lowering of tariffs, but noted that it still leaves much to be desired in resolving the overall challenges of Switzerland’s trade. Swiss National Bank Chairman Martin Schlegel observed that 4% of Swiss exports fell directly to the U.S. tariffs: a beneficial consequence, however, in that some sectors cannot benefit substantially from a reduction. The provisional deal still must be ratified through ongoing negotiations between Switzerland and the United States, he added. And its full binding will probably need parliamentary approval in both countries. There is considerable ambiguity regarding exactly who stands to gain and what that full picture would entail. Parmelin also had to counter complaints from those who said that Switzerland had given too much in its agreement. The government had exercised realpolitik, he said, and had done so prudently and strategically to safeguard the nation’s long-term economic and political interests in an objective way that did not come at the price of its sovereignty. Even with these caveats, though, a reduction in tariffs could be a boon for Swiss exports to the United States, particularly in industrial machinery, watches, precision instruments, and high-end products. A symbolic reiteration of Swiss–U.S. trade relations that had been strained since the 39% tariffs were initially placed. However, the true economic impact can vary depending on several factors, analysts note. That is the smooth passage of the reduction in tariffs into law, and Swiss and American officials working together to solve problems rather than stoke them, and letting Swiss firms request further exemptions to high duties for sensitive products in the future. Swiss companies and industry groups have praised the deal as a strong signal that trade relations with the US can no longer be taken for granted. For many, it is one of the cornerstones of long-term investment, offering the possibility of increased investment, followed by cooperation and greater access to the market for Swiss products.

Compounding the bearish pennant formation is the strong selling pressure, which stands in stark contrast to the overwhelming entry of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Concerning Cardano (ADA), attention is now on a new DeFi crypto garnering significant market interest for depicting a notable 72X return on investment potential during presale, describing what is possibly the greatest opportunity for investment in crypto. Cardano’s Technical Foundation Weakens The price action of Cardano has broken through key support level. This support level had withstood pressure for the last few years. This level had also supported price action that had recently carried into three significant rally movements. This included a rally move of 80% in late June to present. Cardano has collapsed through the level of support that acted historically as a floor. This collapse will open Cardano to new risks and a downward bearish trend, with resistance created in new levels. Over the last 4 hour periods, resistance levels created by price action rejections from $0.50 have created a bearish pennant. The selling bearish pennants have been consistent and with recently created formations. This has led to price deterioration. Deterioration has increased to the level that is have caused the movement of capital into more bullish projects. Mutuum Finance Presale Shows Unmatched Traction Unlike Cardano, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is exhibiting remarkable confidence in the marketplace. Their current presale record of just under $19 million is a staggering achievement, having $18,850,000 in sales and 18,120 unique holders, and entering 6 stages where the presale token value stands at $0.035. Phase 6 is 95% full, after which phase 7 will kick off at $0.04. MUTM will launch at $0.06 awarding early investors up to 500% ROI. Community Incentives and Smooth Accessibility Mutuum Finance attracts customers more than ever because of the initiatives being implemented deriving from the community. Users can take part in a live, 24-hour leaderboard in which the top contributor of the day earns part of a 500 USD bonus in MUTM. Retail and whale players alike are incentivized to participate as engagement resets every day. The top buyers in the last 24 hrs had $1759.68 followed by $1,370.70, $1,283.28, and $1128.64. To further engagement, the project is currently running a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 winners receive 10,000 USD. This simultaneously rewards established participants and attracts others. The addition of a feature allowing the purchase of a card streamlines the previously slow process for people looking to invest. All of these factors make for consolidated and compelling evidence supporting the claim that MUTM is one of the best cryptos to invest in; one that combines a growing financial model with a hyperactive, growing community. A Defining Moment for Strategic Investors In the cryptocurrency world, the difference between Mutuum Finance’s presale success and the other competitor, Cardano, is overwhelming. Cardano is working to recover from a downtrend. In contrast, Mutuum Finance is offered in a floating, limited time offer, enticing low risk and promising massive profit opportunity. In the cryptocurrency landscape, providing such a calculated offer is a breath of fresh air. Mutuum Finance is the best to buy crypto and reap big rewards.

This follows the launch of two ‘33 Act XRP ETFs, including Bitwise’s fund , with more set to launch next week. Why XRP Could Soon Witness A Supply Shock In an X post , Cobb declared that a supply shock is coming for XRP. This came as he noted that the market is not pricing in the impact the XRP ETFs could have, like they did with Bitcoin and Ethereum . Notably, BTC had rallied to new highs following the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs last year. ETH also saw a significant price increase this year, as Ethereum ETFs experienced a massive spike in inflows. Cobb’s statement came in response to crypto pundit Chad’s prediction of the funds taking in a net inflow of a billion daily, with 500 million of the altcoin sent to storage daily. He stated that the token’s price won’t remain at $2 as that happens. It is worth noting that there are currently two existing ‘33 Act spot XRP ETFs issued by Canary Capital and Bitwise. SoSo Value data shows that these two funds haven’t come close to recording daily net inflows. So far, their highest daily net inflows have been $245 million, which was what Canary recorded on the first day of trading. However, since then, the daily net inflows have dropped despite the launch of Bitwise’s fund earlier this week. The drop in net inflows for the funds comes amid the crypto market decline, which may be contributing to this development. Notably, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg had predicted that the funds could take in $10 billion in inflows in their first month, depending on the market conditions. More Funds Set To Launch More XRP ETFs are set to launch, which could further boost the inflows into these funds as a group. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas revealed that Grayscale has received approval from the NYSE Arca to launch its fund on November 24. Meanwhile, his colleague James Seyffart had earlier stated that Franklin Templeton was also likely to launch its fund next Monday. Asset manager 21Shares has also filed a Form 8-A for its fund and could begin trading as soon as next week once it gets certification from CBOE. Crypto pundit Chad recently claimed that the altcoin’s price could rally to as high as $220 as these funds continue to accumulate more coins. He noted that BTC’s price nearly doubled following the launch of Bitcoin ETFs and expects the impact of the funds on XRP to be far more significant. At the time of writing, the altcoin’s price is trading at around $1.91, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",XRP|21Shares|bitcoin|Bitwise|Bloomberg|CBOE|Chad|Cobb|Coinmarketcap|Eric Balchunas|Ethereum|Grayscale|James Seyffart|NYSE Arca|ripple|SoSo Value|Spot Bitcoin ETFs|Spot XRP ETFs|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-11-23 02:00:11

Grayscale Moves To List Dogecoin And XRP Reports have disclosed that both ETFs received approval to be listed, and the paperwork was filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Grayscale Dogecoin ETF $GDOG approved for listing on NYSE, scheduled to begin trading Monday. Their XRP spot is also launching on Monday. $GLNK coming soon as well, week after I think pic.twitter.com/c6nKUeDrtI — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 21, 2025 Market Activity Up Ahead Of Launch Trading activity in related derivatives climbed in the lead up to the announcement. Dogecoin derivatives volume increased by more than 30% to roughly $7.22 billion, based on exchange data. XRP derivatives surged as well, jumping about 51% to around $12.74 billion. Based on reports, these spikes reflect traders positioning for potential price swings around the ETF debut. Spot ETFs do not promise higher prices, but they do change who can buy the assets. Brokers, retirement plans, and funds that avoid direct crypto custody may now step in. That could affect liquidity in both the tokens and their markets. At the same time, the overall crypto market has seen pressure; reports say the launches come during a roughly six-week downturn. DOGE market cap currently at $21.4 billion. Chart: TradingView Questions Remain Over Demand And Flows Product fees, custody details, and how the trusts convert into ETF shares will shape investor appetite. Past launches of crypto ETFs showed brisk early flows for some products, while others saw muted interest. What matters for prices is not only listings, but inflows and outflows once trading begins. Related Reading: $2 Billion Gone In Minutes: Bitcoin Slide Shakes Crypto World Investors and analysts are likely to watch the first days of trading for clues. High volume and tight spreads would suggest strong demand. Low turnover or wide spreads could signal tepid interest. Based on reports, market participants will also monitor whether the ETFs draw the same sort of speculative trading that has driven derivatives volume in recent days. The listing of both GDOG and GXRP on the same date marks a notable step for mainstream crypto products. According to exchange filings, the funds are structured as spot ETFs that hold the underlying tokens via custodians. While that does not remove price risk, it does make buying these assets simpler for a broad group of investors.

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $86,076 on the Binance USDT market, marking one of the most impressive Bitcoin price surge events in recent months. This breakthrough has captured the attention of investors worldwide and signals potential new opportunities in the digital currency space. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Surge? The current Bitcoin price surge didn’t happen overnight. Several key factors have contributed to this remarkable upward movement. Market analysts point to increased institutional adoption, positive regulatory developments, and growing mainstream acceptance as primary drivers. Moreover, the limited supply of Bitcoin continues to create scarcity value that attracts both retail and institutional investors. Recent weeks have shown consistent buying pressure across major exchanges. The Binance USDT market, where BTC reached $86,076, has been particularly active. This sustained demand indicates strong investor confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition despite market volatility. How Does This Bitcoin Price Surge Compare to Historical Performance? When we examine historical data, this Bitcoin price surge represents one of the most sustained upward trends in 2024. To put this in perspective, consider these key points: This marks the highest trading level since the previous all-time high The current rally has shown more stability than previous rapid spikes Trading volume has increased consistently alongside the price movement Market sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive among major analysts The current Bitcoin price surge demonstrates maturing market dynamics where both retail and institutional players are participating actively. This balanced participation often leads to more sustainable growth patterns compared to previous cycles dominated by speculative retail trading. What Should Investors Consider During This Bitcoin Price Surge? While the current Bitcoin price surge presents exciting opportunities, investors should approach with careful strategy. Market conditions can change rapidly, and understanding risk management becomes crucial during such significant movements. Here are some important considerations: Diversification remains key to managing cryptocurrency portfolio risk Technical analysis suggests watching key support and resistance levels Fundamental factors like adoption rates and regulatory news continue to influence price Market sentiment indicators show cautious optimism among experienced traders The ongoing Bitcoin price surge reflects growing confidence in digital assets as legitimate investment vehicles. However, remember that cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility, and what goes up can experience corrections. Future Outlook: Where Does Bitcoin Go From Here? Looking ahead, the trajectory of this Bitcoin price surge will depend on several macroeconomic and industry-specific factors. The upcoming halving event, institutional investment flows, and global economic conditions will all play significant roles in determining whether this momentum can sustain. Many analysts believe that the current Bitcoin price surge could establish new support levels that provide a foundation for future growth. The breaking of psychological barriers like $86,000 often creates positive momentum that can carry prices to even higher levels, provided market conditions remain favorable. Frequently Asked Questions What caused Bitcoin to surge above $86,000? The Bitcoin price surge resulted from combined factors including increased institutional adoption, positive regulatory developments, and growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin? While the current Bitcoin price surge presents opportunities, investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance. Cryptocurrency investments carry volatility risks regardless of current market conditions. How high could Bitcoin price go from here? Predicting exact price targets is challenging, but breaking through key resistance levels often creates momentum for further gains. However, market conditions can change rapidly. Should I be concerned about a price correction? Price corrections are normal in cryptocurrency markets. The current Bitcoin price surge doesn’t eliminate the possibility of pullbacks, so risk management remains important. What’s the best platform to track Bitcoin prices?

Despite entering 2025 with considerable strength, XRP has struggled to maintain its earlier performance, prompting renewed debate about its long-term value. At the beginning of the year, XRP had risen significantly, advancing more than 580% from November 2024 and reaching a high of $3.40 in January . The asset has since retreated toward the $2 range and recently slipped below that threshold. Analysts expect that a recovery could occur once broader market conditions improve, though the timing remains uncertain. Regulatory Clarity and Market Transition In its latest analysis , Forbes contributor Zennon Kapron argues that XRP entered a new period in 2025 following the resolution of its long-running dispute with U.S. regulators. Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to withdraw their appeals in August 2025, preserving the 2023 court ruling that held XRP’s exchange-based transactions outside the scope of securities regulation. According to Forbes, the removal of this legal uncertainty has shifted attention away from regulatory risk and toward practical utility. Kapron notes that XRP will now need to demonstrate sustained real-world usage, supported by deeper liquidity, expanded payment corridors, and broader integration with traditional financial services. These elements, he asserted, will heavily influence any credible long-range price assessment. Key Drivers That Could Influence XRP’s Outlook Kapron identified several factors that could support future growth. One of the most significant is the global remittance market. Data cited in the report indicates that low- and middle-income countries received about $685 billion in remittances in 2024, with average fees near 6%. These costs reduce the funds available to families relying on international transfers, creating demand for more efficient payment rails. According to the analysis, XRP’s ability to facilitate cross-currency transactions without requiring pre-funded accounts positions it as a viable option for reducing transfer expenses. However, Kapron emphasizes that regulators and financial institutions will play a central role in deciding whether solutions based on XRP, stablecoins, or central bank digital currencies become dominant by 2030. Liquidity remains another critical component. Citing Kaiko’s market data, Forbes highlighted a measurable improvement in order-book depth during late 2024 and early 2025. This development supports stronger execution quality, which is essential if major institutions consider incorporating XRP into their operations. At the time Kapron conducted the analysis, XRP was trading near $2.96 with a market capitalization of roughly $176 billion. The asset has since fallen to $1.93, lowering its valuation to about $117 billion. Growing Utility Through Ripple’s Network Kapron also examined developments within Ripple’s payment ecosystem. The report highlighted SBI Remit, which facilitates real-time transactions to several Asian markets, including the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia, using XRP as a settlement asset. Additionally, Onafriq, a payments provider active in 27 African nations, has adopted Ripple’s technology to support regional transfers. Forbes indicates that broader participation from banks, fintech companies, and payment processors could materially increase XRP’s transaction volume over time, strengthening its underlying demand profile. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Forbes’ 2030 XRP Projection For its 2030 forecast, Forbes referenced a Finder panel that estimated an average XRP price of $5.25 by the end of the decade. The same panel predicted a value of $2.80 by the end of 2025. These estimates sit well below the expectations of analysts who believe XRP could reach double-digit levels or higher. For example, Changelly’s outlook places XRP at a potential $25 by December 2030. The report also acknowledges that new investment products could affect future valuation. Spot XRP ETFs are viewed as a potential catalyst for increased retail access and institutional inflows. Several firms have submitted filings, and interest has grown following the introduction of recent products. Canary Capital launched its XRP ETF on November 13 and has already attracted more than $300 million in inflows. Bitwise followed with its own offering on November 20, while Grayscale’s product is scheduled for release on November 24. Kapron concluded that XRP’s long-term performance will largely depend on how much payment activity ultimately relies on the token. Forbes noted that although XRP now operates with more regulatory certainty than in prior years, it still faces competition from stablecoins and central bank digital currencies, which could shape its adoption trajectory through 2030.

A recent post by crypto enthusiast ScamDetective5 drew focus to this issue by referencing the official ISO website’s clarification on the widespread misuse of the phrase “ISO 20022-compliant cryptocurrencies.” His remarks, combined with responses from other X users, revived an ongoing dispute over how ISO standards apply to cryptocurrencies and whether certain narratives have misrepresented the facts. Congratulations you did it!! ISO 20022 is now fully live. Not only did nothing happen but on the ISO 20022 website they decided to call out all the people spreading misinformation. They should have tagged @SMQKEDQG tbh pic.twitter.com/QuPieklvVc — 𝕾𝖈𝖆𝖒𝖘 𝖆𝖗𝖊 𝖇𝖆𝖉 (aka. ScamDaddy𐦐) (@ScamDetective5) November 22, 2025 ISO’s Position on Cryptocurrency Compliance The material shared by ScamDetective5 highlights a direct statement from ISO explaining that cryptocurrencies are not inherently ISO 20022 compliant. According to the text he posted, ISO emphasized that information circulating online describing specific digital assets as compliant with the messaging standard is incorrect. The organization noted that cryptocurrencies are neither managed nor registered under ISO 20022. It further stated that the appropriate standard governing Digital Token Identifiers is ISO 24165, distinguishing it from the financial messaging framework often referenced in crypto conversations. ScamDetective5 used the release of this updated clarification to underline his long-held view that narratives about cryptocurrency compliance with ISO 20022 have been exaggerated or misrepresented. His comment said that the system went fully live without any of the anticipated market effects that some social media figures, such as SMQKE, previously suggested. Community Reactions and Disputes Following the post, responses from other users focused on whether certain individuals in the community had contributed to spreading inaccuracies. Jordan, one of the commenters, challenged the suggestion that the ISO clarification was directed at the researcher mentioned. He stated that the researcher regularly shares documents and sourced material he believes to be accurate, and he requested a clear explanation of what specific misinformation was being attributed to him. Another participant in the conversation, Augie, responded by stating that the researcher in question has repeatedly presented assets, such as the XRP token, as ISO 20022 compliant . He stressed that such claims are incorrect because no cryptocurrency can meet compliance criteria for a messaging standard intended for financial institutions rather than independent digital assets. This exchange reflected differing interpretations of how ISO standards apply and what it means for a digital asset to be integrated, supported, or referenced in a system used by traditional financial institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Context Surrounding the Researcher Mentioned The researcher referred to in the discussion, known on X as SMQKE, is recognized for sharing documents and commentary related to the XRP ecosystem and the broader financial landscape. His posts often gather attention because they combine historical references with technical documentation. The debate resurfacing around his content reflects the challenge of maintaining accuracy within fast-moving online crypto communities, particularly when discussing regulatory frameworks or international standards. ScamDetective5’s post, supported by the official ISO information he shared, reinforces a critical distinction between the adoption of ISO 20022 by financial institutions and claims about cryptocurrency compliance with the standard. The reactions it generated underscore the importance of precision when discussing international technical standards, especially in a sector where interpretations can quickly influence public narratives.

This decline in confidence is the opposite of the trend of the presale for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is showing a rapidly increasing inflow of total presale investment. With a total sellout of Phase 6 in sight, its presale, best positions the DeFI project as one of the strongest cryptos to invest in now relative to the meme currencies. Data About Dogecoin Signal Changing Conviction Recent on-chain data analysis of Dogecoin has flagged some troubling changes in the market behavior of Dogecoin. For the Reserve Risk indicator which evaluates the relationship between a market’s price and the cumulative opportunity cost of holding the price has crossed some strategic threshold zones. Historical data from the metrics green zone has shown periods of strong positive long-term holder conviction and significant value while moves into the metrics red zone have shown hyper-elastic market cycles. Based on the present data, some activity in holder changes is being noticed, which has likely pushed the coin into a new price phase, along with weakening holder stability. Seeing some weakening conviction in market potential from the long-term market potential holders is creating some core market concern for Dogecoin. Mutuum Finance Presale As Dogecoin dwells in uncertainty, one other cryptocurrency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is seeing unprecedented levels of demand in its presale, inflating its presale raise to $18,850,000 and its number of holders to over $18,120. Now in its 6th stage of presale, holders can purchase $MUTM for $0.035. While this represents a 250% increase from presale stage $0.01, investors anticipate a token launch to $0.06, equating to 400% profit from presale purchases. Unfortunately, this stage presale is over 95% sold out, leaving a small window of time for buyers to purchase coins before they increase in price to $0.04 in stage 7. The rapid progression in presale demand is what most consider is a sign of a new cryptocurrency that is on the verge of exploding. Dual-Market Lending & Imminent Launch Mutuum Finance’s investment thesis is attractive, in that it relies on its unique and innovative model. It is specifically built to maintain its dual market lending model with support for Peer to Contract (P2C) pool-based liquidity, along with Peer to Peer (P2P) customized lending support, in order to provide efficiency on widely utilized assets like ETH or USDT, while having flexibility on other, less common, tokens. Development progress is validated with V1 Protocol, which shall launch on Sepolia testnet in Q4, 2025. It marks an operational achievement, which shall enable users to utilize core functionality like liquidity pools, mtTokens, thereby transforming from being an idea to an operational platform, solidifying its reputation in being the most useful cryptocurrency to invest in. Dynamic Community Incentives The community behind Mutuum Finance is just as important as the technology since the project team offers participation incentives that keep the community engaged. A $500 MUTM bonus is offered daily to the highest contributor on the 24-hour leaderboard. This has been a positive motivator on the platform. In addition is a $100,000 giveaway , divided among 10 $10,000 worth MUTM token winners. Initiatives like this create positive momentum and reward the first supporters of the project. This creates a network effect that makes participation on the presale soar and makes the token a viable candidate on the best cryptos to invest in. There is a clear difference between the presale growth of Mutuum Finance and the stagnation of Dogecoin. Mutuum Finance is a relatively safe investment in a DeFi project that has a functioning product, and value proposition which is on a time constrained offer at current prices. For carefully building portfolios, the MUTM token is a clear opportunity and likely candidate for the next big crypto. It is currently available at a reasonable price with a great potential upward spike on prices in the future.

54778266,632719,1763874032,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/54778266.jpeg,Top Bitcoin Bull Identifies Key Force Driving BTC’s Sharp Decline,https://bitcoinist.com/top-bitcoin-bull-identifies-key-force-driving-btcs-sharp-decline/,"Fundstrat’s Tom Lee disclosed in a recent interview that last month’s flash event is still echoing through crypto markets, and that those ripples help explain Bitcoin’s recent slide. According to Lee, the shock on October 10 damaged key market makers—firms that provide trading liquidity—forcing them to pull back and tighten activity. That pullback, he said, has fed a slow drip of selling that continued into November as investors reassessed risk. Market Maker Strain Triggered By Trading Glitch Based on reports, Bitcoin traded near $125,000 on October 6 and held around $120,000 days later before tumbling to the mid-$80,000 range by November 20. Lee pointed to a technical fault on one exchange where a stablecoin briefly lost its $1 peg amid thin liquidity and internal pricing errors. That misquote was used by the exchange to price trades, which set off Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) events and a chain of forced liquidations across venues. The result: several market makers saw their balance sheets weaken, and their reduced activity helped sustain selling pressure rather than absorb it. ETF Outflows And Macro Forces Add Pressure The market hit has not been only structural. Reports show Bitcoin fell about 23% this month, while ETF outflows have approached $3 billion, giving traders another reason to step back. A stronger US dollar and talk of more Federal Reserve tightening have also weighed on sentiment, making it harder for risk assets to hold gains. Technical indicators picked up by analysts show an RSI around 25.47, which many read as oversold, while MACD readings remain in bearish mode. That mix leaves traders divided between bargain hunters and cautious sellers. Why Traders Might See A Swift Turnaround Lee argued that past episodes of forced selling tended to reverse once pressured accounts were exhausted and patient buyers reentered the market. He suggested Bitcoin could test $77,000 and that Ether might fall toward $2,500 before any steady rebound. Based on his view, the repair of market-making systems and code fixes should stop similar cascades from repeating. Some funds, he noted, are holding large cash positions and are waiting for clearer signs that liquidity has returned. A Narrow Window For Recovery Or Further Downside Investors should watch several things in the coming days: the behavior of large funds, ETF flows, and whether exchanges change how they source prices for margin events. Reports have disclosed that when automatic systems rely too heavily on internal quotes during low-liquidity moments, risk can amplify rapidly. Lee thinks volatility isn’t done, though he also argues that once the market’s core problems are patched up, the rebound toward old highs could race ahead of the recent slide.

He highlighted how Hamilton described XRP’s early purpose. Hamilton said Bitcoin developers designed the XRP Ledger. He stated that they understood Bitcoin’s limits and built a system that addressed them. He noted that one of its first use cases was to “ tokenize Bitcoin .” This supported X Finance Bull’s point that XRP did not launch as a rival but as a tool to make digital value move at scale. Scalability Takes Center Stage Hamilton focused on performance. He pointed to Bitcoin’s low throughput of 10 transactions per second. He explained that global usage would overwhelm that capacity. He also noted that fees will rise as block rewards fall. He stated that “the everyday person is just simply not going to be able to afford to transact on Bitcoin.” He argued that users will need layers that shift away from Bitcoin’s original qualities, which weakens the claim that Bitcoin can function independently as a global payments system.

XRP offers fast settlement and stable performance. The clip gave its supporters direct comments from a former Ripple developer who connected those features to design decisions made more than a decade ago. Hamilton said the XRP Ledger was “the first blockchain to have a DEX” and the first to support tokenization . This detail aligned with the post’s message that XRP solved real issues early in its development. Prioritizing Facts and Performance X Finance Bull described this as a turning point for the XRP vs Bitcoin debate. The debate is starting to move from emotion to direct evaluation of network performance and sustainability. Relying on facts shows XRP’s superior design . Hamilton delivered clear technical observations that Jeremie could not refute. X Finance Bull used this to argue that XRP now holds a stronger position in conversations about real-world utility.

Bitcoin price rose to $86,500 from last week’s low of $80,000. Other top cryptocurrencies were also in the green, with Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Chainlink rising by over 3% in the last 24 hours. As a result, the market cap of all coins is nearing the important milestone of $3 trillion. So, is this the end of the recent crypto crash or is it a dead-cat bounce? Top cryptocurrencies rebounded today Why the crypto market is going up today Bitcoin and most altcoins are rising today, Nov. 23, for several reasons. First, there are signs that investors are buying the dip after most coins moved to the oversold levels. It is common for tokens to bounce back whenever this happens as investors buy the dip. Second, cryptocurrencies are going up as investors start deploying leverage again. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the futures open interest rose by nearly 4% on Sunday morning to $126 billion. Rising open interest is often a good thing as it points to more demand among investors. Third, there was less forced selling pressure in the market as liquidations tumbled. Total liquidations dropped by 88% in the last 24 hours to $208 million. Data shows that 115k traders were liquidated in the same period, with the biggest one being a $3 million HYPE trade on Hyperliquid. The falling liquidations is a good thing because the recent surge partially explains why Bitcoin and most altcoins tumbled. However, it is worth noting that liquidation data often plunge during the weekend when many people are not trading. The crypto market rally is also happening as traders wait for more altcoin ETF launches. Some notable listings to watch will be on coins like XRP and Dogecoin. These launches come as data shows that the there is robust demand for altcoin ETFs. Is this the end of the crypto crash? Bitcoin price has jumped by 7.3% from its lowest level this year, while other tokens like Ether and Solana have done better. The main risk is that this rebound is a dead-cat bounce (DCB). A DCB is a situation where an asset in a freefall bounces back briefly and then resumes the downtrend. It is often known as a bull trap because it mostly affects retail investors. One way to avoid being caught up in a dead-cat bounce is to wait for Bitcoin to move above key moving averages. Also, one can wait for the formation of a pattern like a double-bottom to confirm that a new bull run is happening. Still, there are signs that the end of the ongoing crypto market crash is near. For one, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index remains in the extreme fear zone of 11. Historically, most crypto bull runs start when there is a sense of fear in the market. Also, there are signs that whales are aggressively buying the dip. A good example of this is Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which spent over $800 million in accumulation last week. He has hinted that he continued buying the dip. Tom Lee’s BitMine has also continued buying Ethereum in the past few weeks. In his statement, he argues that the ongoing sell-off is part of volatility, which is a normal part of the crypto market.

Market pressure has pushed the asset lower, despite the recent launch of a spot XRP ETF . As a section of the market is bearish, ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA), a well-known technical analyst, has offered a different reading of current conditions. Cointelegraph’s Warning on XRP Cointelegraph released a brief market update that presented a sharp view of potential downside. The outlet noted XRP’s 11% decline from last week. It then pointed to a descending triangle pattern and a bearish RSI divergence that could force a continued decline. These raised the risk of a deeper move toward $1.55. The report framed the situation as a firm threat to the next stage of price action. It portrayed the technical picture as fragile and suggested that momentum had weakened. $XRP : 1) The Descending Triangle breakdown has already met its target. 2) A bullish divergence is forming on the daily timeframe. 3) No structure has been lost —these headlines are misleading https://t.co/up199hZCo7 pic.twitter.com/k1UHyMmvu1 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) November 20, 2025 ChartNerd Rejects the Bearish Interpretation ChartNerd responded with a detailed rebuttal. He posted his own assessment and offered three key points to explain why he believed Cointelegraph misread the chart. His first point was that the descending triangle breakdown has met its target. He attached a chart showing XRP’s decline, which pushed it below the bottom trendline of the triangle. The triangle has already reached completion, and any claim of extended breakdown pressure does not apply. ChartNerd also revealed that a bullish divergence is forming on the daily timeframe. This pattern often signals exhaustion in a downtrend. It also refutes reports of a bearish RSI divergence and strengthens ChartNerd’s bullish stance. He then added that “No structure has been lost.” He referred to the headlines as misleading. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What Comes Next for XRP? ChartNerd believes that XRP now sits at a point where traders should monitor momentum shifts. XRP is trading at $1.96, but ChartNerd is confident in his analysis. He treated the decline as a closed event. His focus now rests on whether the bullish divergence strengthens in the coming sessions. If it does, the asset may consolidate and attempt a rise toward previous levels. He did not make any guarantee or offer a specific target, but the chart does not signal fresh structural damage. XRP’s recovery will also be supported by institutional interest. While ETFs have not impacted the price, more products are launching. Institutional interest is rising, and XRP could experience a notable surge as ETFs begin to see more inflows.

According to Van Eck, Bitcoin will likely perform poorly in 2026, consistent with its historical cycle. Van Eck stated that they continue to advocate for Bitcoin's inclusion in portfolios, but that price cycles shouldn't be ignored. Recalling that the company has declared Bitcoin a long-term investment vehicle since 2017, Van Eck said, “We've seen Bitcoin experience a negative year after the halving cycle, which occurs every four years. There's a high probability that 2026 will be a similar year.” He added that this is why many investors are selling after the peak seen in October. Related News: Has the Bitcoin Decline Ended, or Is There More to Come? Here's What Analysts Say Van Eck noted that Bitcoin's rise this cycle has been more limited compared to previous bull periods, adding that this situation creates expectations that the potential decline could also be more limited. However, he noted that macro liquidity conditions and on-chain data continue to be decisive in investment decisions. Van Eck also addressed the security and privacy issues currently being debated within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The CEO noted that quantum computing could pose risks to cryptographic infrastructures in the future, and that this is why some Bitcoin maximalists are interested in projects like Zcash (ZEC), which offer greater privacy. Nevertheless, Van Eck maintained that his Bitcoin thesis remains strong, saying, “If the fundamental argument breaks down, we'll move away from Bitcoin, but we don't see that happening right now.” *This is not investment advice.

The BTC collected through tax payments would be allocated to the United States’ planned Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The proposal is designed to let the U.S. benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. Bitcoin Tax Payments Without Capital Gains Liability On Thursday, Republican Congressman Warren Davidson introduced legislation that would allow Americans to pay their federal income taxes in BTC without incurring capital gains liability. The bill would also direct these payments into the proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The Bitcoin for America Act aims to strengthen the country’s long-term financial resilience and position the United States as a global leader in digital assets. The bill states: “By authorizing the acceptance of Federal income taxes in Bitcoin and the deposit of such funds into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the United States will diversify its national wealth into a non-inflationary asset that serves as a long-term store of value, thereby strengthening the Nation’s financial resilience against currency devaluation, economic instability, and global market volatility.” The legislation also emphasizes that countries such as China and Russia are “actively acquire Bitcoin to diversify their reserves and hedge against global financial instability,” warning that the United States risks falling behind in this strategic arena. Benefits of Adding Bitcoin Payment Options Allowing federal tax payments in Bitcoin offers several advantages. Bitcoin’s decentralised, permissionless network broadens financial access, enabling more people - including unbanked Americans - to participate in the financial system and meet federal tax obligations. Adding BTC to the Strategic Reserve would further diversify U.S. holdings and provide a durable store of value. BTC’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, combined with the Bitcoin halving cycle, creates structural scarcity that may lead to long-term appreciation – unlike inflationary fiat currencies such as the US dollar. The bill argues that placing BTC in the Strategic Reserve—an asset expected to grow in real value over time—would establish a “self-sustaining fiscal mechanism that reduces reliance on debt-based financing, enhances the Nation’s balance sheet, and provides a robust financial foundation for future generations.” A press release announcing the bill notes that Bitcoin’s independence from inflationary monetary policy would help the Strategic Reserve to “protect against dollar erosion and long-term economic risk.” In the press release, Rep. Davidson stated: “The Bitcoin for America Act marks an important step toward modernizing our financial systems and embracing the innovation that millions of Americans already use every day.” He added: “By allowing taxpayers to pay federal taxes in Bitcoin and having the proceeds placed into the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the nation will benefit by having a tangible asset that appreciates in value over time—unlike the U.S. dollar, which has steadily lost value under inflationary pressures. This bill will give the American people more choice in paying their taxes as well as give our government a stronger financial foundation. The Bitcoin for America Act will position our country to lead—not follow—as the world navigates the future of sound money and digital innovation.” Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve During his election campaign, President Trump expressed strong support for digital assets and pledged to reinforce U.S. leadership in the sectors – a stance that resonated deeply with voters. Since taking office, Trump has moved swiftly to deliver on these commitments. Early in his presidency, Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and mandated the creation of a U.S Digital Stockpile . Shortly after, Republican Congressman Nick Begich introduced legislation to formally create the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The bill includes a commitment to purchase 200,000 BTC over the next five years, and contains a provision that would prevent future administrations from overturning this measure. It also mandates a minimum 20-year lockup period before any BTC held in the Reserve may be sold. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The pace of its decline has created a setup that many traders view as a crucial test. CasiTrades (@CasiTrades), a well-known analyst, recently outlined her short-term expectations with detailed charts from Coinbase and Binance. Her focus on price levels forms a clear roadmap as XRP approaches what she identifies as a likely bottom. However, she believes the current corrective phase is “extremely close.” Get Ready! XRP Likely to test the Macro .618! XRP has officially broken below its .5 retracement on Coinbase, and just like I said in my last update, if that level fails, the next target will be the extended Wave 3 support around $1.84. We’ve now reached that perfectly and… pic.twitter.com/tSQdVAlpdY — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) November 21, 2025 Break Below the 0.5 Level Sets the Tone CasiTrades notes that XRP fell through its 0.5 retracement on Coinbase. She explains that this shift set up the move into extended Wave 3 support near $1.84. XRP’s price action met that level. Binance moved in sync and tagged its own macro 0.5 at $1.88. She highlighted this alignment across major exchanges because it confirmed the structure she tracks on higher time frames . XRP bounced after the drop, yet she does not view that reaction as the start of a trend reversal. She stated that it forms a subwave 4 bounce, not a shift in direction. Her charts show resistance in the $2 to $2.09 zone. She expects XRP to test that area before rolling into the final leg of the correction. In her words, the asset still needs “another wave lower.” She points to the 0.618 macro support near $1.65 as the next target. She calls this level the spot she believes will “mark the bottom” on Coinbase and Binance. Her structure shows the decline completing at that point before momentum flips . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Coordination With Bitcoin Shapes the Outlook Her analysis links the final XRP move with Bitcoin. BTC approached its own macro 0.382 retracement but did not touch it. She expects BTC to complete that move as XRP slips into $1.65. She identifies this as a synchronized moment for both assets . BTC’s level sits near $80k, which she believes will complete its correction cleanly. The timing across the two charts supports her view that both assets remain in structured declines, not trend breaks. She states that once those prices hit, BTC should begin its Wave 5 toward new highs. That transition would mark the shift from corrective action to trend continuation for the largest crypto asset. XRP would then enter its Macro Wave 3 with the altcoin market. She adds that they will move together but with different strengths due to their positions in the cycle.

The snap showed a new category called ISO 20022 coins, with XRP in the first position. The post placed clear focus on XRP’s spot in the category. He noted that the asset is leading the pack. The update arrived at the same time as the global ISO 20022 shift. Many market participants want to understand how digital assets may connect to that change. BOOOOOOOOOOOM CoinMarketCap just activated an ISO 20022 category… and guess who’s sitting at the top? $XRP leading the pack EXACTLY where it belongs. The migration is here. The shift is real. pic.twitter.com/Ki7dDl5C2Z — XRP Update (@XrpUdate) November 22, 2025 The Transition to ISO 20022 ISO 20022 is a modern messaging standard for financial transactions, including payments. Banks and payment providers are transitioning from older MT messages to new MX messages, which carry more structured data. This move improves payment accuracy to build a clear format for instructions, account details, and reporting. SWIFT’s deadline for this transition was November 22. This transition is expected to continue across the financial world. Banks must adopt the new format to avoid failed messages. Many experts now see this transition as XRP’s path into the global monetary system. ISO 20022 and XRP The standard does not alter how a blockchain works. It only affects how institutions send and receive payment messages. Ripple built its technology to match ISO 20022 requirements . RippleNet can send messages that follow the new format, which prepares the system for banks that complete their migration. XRP itself is not ISO 20022 compliant. No cryptocurrency is . However, the compliance of Ripple’s systems creates a path for XRP to move within financial systems that use the standard. It also supports possible interaction with SWIFT-linked networks that expect ISO 20022 messaging. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Role Within Payment Networks Ripple developed its tools to help institutions move money across borders speedily and at low cost, while XRP was built to solve the global payment problem for banks. These tools can use XRP as a bridge asset. When banks use Ripple’s technology, they can send ISO 20022-ready messages, which helps them stay aligned with global standards. This gives XRP a possible place in future payment flows. It also explains why the asset stands out when people discuss the shift to structured messaging. XRP Update’s post highlighted the asset’s position at the top of CoinMarketCap’s new category. The image also showed several other tokens. Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Internet Computer (ICP), Algorand (ALGO), and Quant (QNT) make up the list. These networks each build features that support enterprise or payment activity. However, XRP is the closest asset to ISO 20022 compliance, which explains its position at the top. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The bottom, so far, occurred on Friday, when it plunged below $81,000 for the first time since April, and bitcoin has since regained roughly $5,000. However, Ali Martinez outlined a more painful picture, claiming that he asset has previously bottomed between the green and blue Pricing Bands. If that happens again now, it would mean another crash of up to 50% if BTC dumps to $44,700, where the blue one sits. Bitcoin $BTC has often bottomed beneath the green and blue Pricing Bands over the past seven years. Those levels are now at $55,900 and $44,700, respectively. pic.twitter.com/TaiWFb2KTf — Ali (@ali_charts) November 22, 2025 What could be further troubling for the largest cryptocurrency is the behavior of certain investors. As reported earlier, some whales have been disposing of significant quantities of their assets, including a few OGs. Those utilizing the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have also been offloading their assets. More than $1.2 billion left the funds in the past week alone despite the more positive Friday. BlackRock’s IBIT has been on a particularly violent streak. Furthermore, Martinez said the number of BTC sent to exchanges in the past week has skyrocketed to 20,000 units. This substantial stash, worth almost $2 billion, is likely transferred to trading platforms with the intent to sell. Additionally, the popular analyst warned that capital inflows into the entire crypto market have slumped from $86 billion just three months ago to $10 billion now.

The ecosystem pushed swift upgrades to restore consensus, while Charles Hoskinson urged the community to stay unified during the incident. Chain Partition Triggered by Malformed Transaction Cardano developers confirmed that today’s disruption came from a malformed transaction that exposed a bug in a core software library. The fault caused the network to split into competing chains, slowing block production and creating visible delays across services. At the same time, Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) reported divergence in block histories, prompting immediate coordination among engineering teams and ecosystem contributors. The split increased the urgency for a synchronized fix as nodes running older versions struggled to converge. Intersect, the Cardano member-based organization, said upgrades to node versions 10.5.2 and 10.5.3 began restoring full network alignment. They emphasized that the healthy chain is already becoming dominant as operators adopt the updated software. Cardano Mainnet Incident Update. Source: Intersect / X Coordinated Response Pushes Network Toward Full Recovery According to Intersect, ecosystem teams mobilized quickly once the partition appeared. Engineers, SPOs, exchanges, and infrastructure providers coordinated in real time to stabilize the chain and ensure the patched clients were deployed across major operators. A dedicated working group is now reconciling ledger discrepancies and validating block histories as part of the stabilization effort. Their goal is to confirm full convergence across all nodes before issuing a detailed after-action review. Intersect stated that the initial report is already available, noting that further technical detail will follow once data reconciliation and reliability checks are complete. Hoskinson Urges Calm and Unity After Overnight Incident Charles Hoskinson addressed the community at around 3 a.m., calling for unity during what he described as a serious but recoverable event. He acknowledged the stress on operators but stressed that Cardano’s resilience depends on cooperation during moments of pressure. In his remarks, Hoskinson said Cardano “is not going to fail” and emphasized that the ecosystem has repeatedly shown the ability to recover from unexpected setbacks. He pointed to the rapid response from engineers and contributors as proof of the network’s core strength. Charles Hoskinson Unity Call. Source: ALLINCRYPTO / X However, he noted that long-term success is not guaranteed and must be earned daily. He said progress requires “a positive attitude and a genuine belief” that the ecosystem can work through disagreements and philosophical differences to achieve shared goals. Cardano Community Rallies as Full AAR Expected Intersect thanked SPOs, exchanges, and community contributors for responding quickly under pressure. They said the collaborative effort demonstrated the network’s maturity and capacity to handle disruptive events. The organization also confirmed that a comprehensive after-action review will be published once all technical evaluations are finalized. It will outline the root cause, the system behavior, and the steps taken to prevent similar incidents. For now, developers continue monitoring the upgraded nodes as the patched chain becomes fully dominant.

The cryptocurrency ETF market has entered a new era with the launch of Bitwise and Canary's XRP and Solana ETFs. Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Analyst James Seyffart spoke with Coin Bureau's Nic about the record-breaking inflows of these new-generation crypto funds and the future of the industry. According to James Seyffart, XRP and Solana-based ETFs have performed “extraordinarily well” since their launches. Seyffart noted that Bitwise's Solana ETF and Canary's XRPC ETF were the top two ETF launches in the US by volume of the year. He noted that this success is evidence of strong retail investor demand for altcoins despite challenging market conditions. For example, Canary's XRPC continued to see approximately $15 million in daily inflows, excluding its $240 million initial capital on launch day. Related News: A 1-in-180-million Event Occurred in Bitcoin: Here Are the Details Seyffart noted that with the SEC restarting its operations after the government shutdown, the next wave of ETFs is on the way, with Dogecoin and Chainlink ETFs set to be the next assets to be launched. Grayscale's Chainlink Trust will likely be converted into an ETF on December 2, while Bitwise's Dogecoin ETF is expected to launch on November 26. He also noted that BlackRock's application for an ETF offering the option of staking the asset Ethereum (ETH) is a “unique strategy” due to potential tax implications for investors. Speaking about the current state of the altcoin market, Seyffart suggested that “altcoin season” may have already occurred, but that this interest is directed not directly at altcoins, but rather at Digital Asset Trusts (DATs) and crypto mining companies. He added that with this market maturation, investors seeking high beta/leverage now have the option of turning to structured financial products like options on Bitcoin ETFs instead of altcoins. Seyffart predicted that in the long term, the market will shift its focus to “basket products” (index ETFs) containing multiple altcoins, rather than individual altcoin ETFs. He argued that these basket products will facilitate entry into the crypto market by spreading risk for institutional investors and advisors. *This is not investment advice.

He stated that “Holding XRP is basically owning a seat on the lifeboat before everyone realizes the ship is sinking.” His statement gained traction because he sees XRP as an asset that can withstand a sharp reset in financial markets. He added that “When the debt bubble pops and the speculation layer collapses, XRP won’t follow the market, it will separate from it.” He believes that XRP will act as an asset with unique resilience during periods of financial stress. His comments also suggest that XRP could become a major tool in global finance after this reset. Holding XRP is basically owning a seat on the lifeboat before everyone realizes the ship is sinking. When the debt bubble pops and the speculation layer collapses, XRP won’t follow the market, it will separate from it. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) November 21, 2025 Expanding XRP’s Role In Finance Ripple advanced several initiatives in 2025 that increased confidence among its supporters. The company launched upgrades to the XRPL. Developers gained access to new features that improved asset issuance and liquidity tools. They also have access to smart contracts through an EVM-compatible environment . Ripple also integrated prime brokerage services after it acquired Hidden Road. Hidden Road has since been rebranded to Ripple Ripple Prime . This effort shows an intent to deepen XRP’s role in institutional settlement. These moves strengthened the view that XRP can support high-volume payment activity. They also backed Aljarrah’s argument that the digital asset holds value through utility rather than speculation. Rising Institutional Interest in XRP XRP ETFs expanded in the U.S. this year. The REX Osprey fund marked the first launch, followed by new products from Canary Capital and Bitwise.

He believes that utility-driven assets can gain attention during uncertain periods. Many experts believe a major global financial reset is coming . They also think that the digital asset will dominate the new system once the dust settles. XRP has hit many new milestones in 2025.

Binance Coin price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding ongoing market events. The coin’s price also increased to $843.5 as buying interest surged once again. If traders continue buying, the BNB price might see a further increase and break above $867. On the other hand, a failure in attracting buying demand might result in a correction. In such a case, the price of BNB might head toward the immediate support at $828. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $8,519.96 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB found resistance, and the price moved toward $843.5, as bulls target $867. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 1.42 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $1000? The BNB price has already crossed $1000 in 2025, and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 by the end of 2026, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $8,519.96 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB reached the $1,079.07 mark. In October, it hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $1,369.99 and is trading near the $1,100 mark in November.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-23 08:27:58

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin ETFs saw nearly $1.2 billion in weekly outflows, marking their third-largest withdrawal event since launch. Despite a steep six-week price drop, several funds reversed course on Friday with strong inflows led by Fidelity’s FBTC. Analysts like Eric Balchunas stress Bitcoin’s resilience, noting it has rebounded from even deeper drawdowns to reach new highs. The heavy withdrawals persisted even as markets staged a partial recovery on Friday. Data from Farside Investors shows that November’s outflows hit $3.79 billion by Thursday, matching the previous monthly record set in February. Bitcoin ETFs Log Second-Biggest Daily Outflow at $900M The pressure continued into Friday, despite a brief rebound across risk assets. Thursday alone saw more than $900 million in redemptions, marking the second-largest single-day exit for the category. The sharp moves come during a six-week slide in Bitcoin’s price, which briefly touched $81,000 early Friday, its lowest level since April. Bitcoin has now fallen roughly 33% from its October peak above $126,000, dragged down by shifting macro expectations, including fading hopes for a third Federal Reserve rate cut in 2025, and renewed anxiety over stretched valuations in the artificial intelligence sector. The largest hit came from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which saw more than $1 billion withdrawn over the week. Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC followed with outflows of $172 million and $116 million, respectively. But Friday brought a change in tone. Fidelity’s FBTC added $108 million in fresh capital, the strongest daily inflow among the group. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and GBTC also bounced back, posting $61.5 million and $84.9 million in inflows. Despite the downturn, some analysts remain unfazed. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, commenting on X, pushed back against pessimistic predictions, noting Bitcoin’s long history of recovering from deep corrections. “This asset has survived half a dozen drawdowns worse than this, only to hit new highs every time,” he wrote, comparing Bitcoin’s durability to top-performing stocks like Apple and Amazon. In a separate post, he joked that Bitcoin “should definitely be treated as hot sauce.” I get the haters dunking on btc's slide (enjoy, this is your time) but what I don't get is the obituaries being written. This asset has survived like half a dozen drawdowns worse than this only to hit ATHs every time. The only other things w that Rocky-esque record are stud… — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 21, 2025 New Altcoin ETFs Steal Spotlight as Bitcoin Funds Struggle The turbulence in Bitcoin funds coincides with the rollout of a wave of new altcoin ETFs. Over the past month, issuers have launched products tied to Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin, with more XRP and Dogecoin funds set to list next week. The Canary Capital XRP ETF (XRPC) debuted with $58 million in net inflows, the highest opening-day haul for any ETF this year, edging out the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), which launched with $57 million. BSOL has quickly become one of the early success stories of 2025, accumulating over $660 million in assets within three weeks and avoiding a single day of outflows. As reported, the New York Stock Exchange has approved the listing of Grayscale’s XRP and Dogecoin exchange-traded funds, clearing both products to begin trading on Monday. NYSE Arca, the exchange’s ETF-focused subsidiary, filed certifications on Friday confirming the listing and registration of the Grayscale XRP Trust ETF Shares and the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust ETF Shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

54785937,https://cryptonews.com/?p=455074,1763887182,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54785937.jpeg,"No “Big Crash” in Sight for Bitcoin, Says Macro Analyst Lyn Alden",https://cryptonews.com/news/no-big-crash-in-sight-for-bitcoin-says-macro-analyst-lyn-alden/,"Bitcoin’s latest pullback has sparked fresh debate across the market, but macro analyst Lyn Alden says fears of a deep collapse are misplaced. Key Takeaways: Lyn Alden says Bitcoin is unlikely to face a major crash because the market hasn’t reached euphoric conditions. She argues the traditional four-year cycle is weakening as institutional demand and macro forces reshape Bitcoin’s rhythm. Alden expects Bitcoin to reclaim $100,000 by 2026, cautioning that investors shouldn’t assume every downturn leads to an immediate bull run. Speaking on the What Bitcoin Did podcast , Alden argued that the current environment lacks the hallmarks of a major washout. “We haven’t hit euphoric levels in this cycle; therefore, there is less of a reason to expect a kind of major capitulation,” she said, noting that Bitcoin’s trajectory is being shaped less by its traditional halving rhythm and more by broader macro forces. Alden: Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycle Is Losing Its Grip Alden pushed back on the idea that the well-known four-year cycle still dictates Bitcoin’s path. Instead, she suggested that growing institutional interest and shifting economic conditions may stretch the cycle longer than many expect. Her comments echo recent remarks from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who said the market may be entering “a good few years” rather than a compressed boom-bust pattern. Alden argued that markets rarely deliver the extremes investors prepare for. “It’s usually not as good as people expect and it’s usually not as bad as people expect,” she said. The debate comes at a tense moment for traders. Bitcoin has been in retreat since setting an all-time high of $125,100 on Oct. 5, sliding to $80,700 on Thursday before rebounding to around $85,700, per CoinMarketCap data. Sentiment has cooled sharply as earlier predictions for a strong year-end finish fade. Some analysts, including BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, had predicted a run toward $250,000. The recent downturn has fueled fresh speculation about when the next surge might begin, but Alden cautioned against assuming that every dip precedes a guaranteed breakout. “People get in their mindset where they are owed a bull market. No one is owed a bull market,” she said. Looking ahead, Alden expects Bitcoin to reclaim $100,000 in 2026 and either print new highs that year or in 2027. Coinbase says rate-cut bets were “mispriced” In a note on Friday, Coinbase Institutional argued that futures markets have been underestimating the chances of a rate reduction. “We believe the odds for a rate cut are actually mispriced,” the firm wrote, citing new tariff research, private-sector data, and real-time inflation trackers. Coinbase said traders shifted from expecting a 25 bps cut to assuming the Fed would hold rates steady after inflation reports earlier this quarter raised concerns. However, tariff effects, the firm noted, often reduce inflation and raise unemployment in the short term, effectively acting as a drag on demand and strengthening the case for cuts. As reported, Bitcoin may remain stuck between $60,000 and $80,000 through the end of December if the Federal Reserve leaves interest rates unchanged at next month’s FOMC meeting, according to new analysis from XWIN Research Japan. Analysts say a cautious Fed, still facing inflation near 3%, would likely maintain tight conditions, which historically weigh heavily on equities and crypto. If no cut arrives, XWIN expects the market to remain range-bound, with risk appetite muted until macro clarity returns.

54786118,https://cryptonews.com/?p=455077,1763887583,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/54786118.jpeg,"Investors Focus on BTC as “Digital Gold,” Not Payments: BlackRock Exec",https://cryptonews.com/news/investors-focus-on-btc-as-digital-gold-not-payments-blackrock-exec/,"Bitcoin may inspire bold visions of a global payments network, but that’s not what is driving the bulk of institutional money into the asset today, according to Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets. Key Takeaways: Institutional investors are treating Bitcoin primarily as a store of value, not a future payments network. Mitchnick says Bitcoin’s payments role remains speculative and would require major scaling progress to become practical. Stablecoins are rapidly gaining ground in payments, prompting analysts like Cathie Wood to trim long-term Bitcoin forecasts. Speaking in a podcast interview released Friday , Mitchnick said large asset managers’ clients remain far more interested in Bitcoin as a store of value than as a future payments rail. “For us, and most of our clients today, they’re not really underwriting to that global payment network case,” he said, adding that the payments thesis is viewed as “out-of-the-money option value” rather than a core investment rationale. BlackRock Exec: Bitcoin Payments Use Case Still “Highly Speculative” Mitchnick didn’t dismiss the possibility of Bitcoin eventually gaining traction in payments but said that narrative is still “a little bit more speculative.” He noted that significant progress would be needed across Bitcoin’s scaling stack before such a shift could occur. “A lot needs to happen in terms of Bitcoin scaling, Lightning, and otherwise to make that possible,” he said. His comments follow an August 2024 report from Galaxy Research, which argued that most Bitcoin layer-2 networks, especially rollups, may struggle to remain viable over time despite being promoted as a solution for cheaper, faster transactions. While Bitcoin’s payment future remains uncertain, Mitchnick highlighted that digital assets are already transforming money movement through stablecoins. “Stablecoins have been hugely successful in the payments sector,” he said. “They have massive product market fit as a way of moving value around efficiently.” According to him, stablecoins are poised to expand their reach well beyond crypto trading and DeFi into retail remittances, corporate cross-border flows and even capital market settlement. Mitchnick added that Bitcoin might find a foothold in retail remittance use cases, but he still considers that outcome speculative for now. His views echo a growing industry conversation about stablecoins outpacing Bitcoin in the payments race. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently said that the rapid growth of stablecoins is the main reason she reduced her 2030 Bitcoin price forecast. Wood, who once projected BTC could hit $1.5 million by the end of the decade, said that stablecoins have taken over some of the roles she previously expected Bitcoin to dominate. She now sees that long-term forecast dropping by roughly $300,000. Bitcoin Approaches ‘Fire Sale’ Zone As reported, Bitwise researcher André Dragosch has warned that Bitcoin may still have room to drop before hitting its true cycle bottom, pointing to a “max-pain” zone between $73,000 and $84,000. He argued that this range represents “fire sale” levels tied to the cost bases of major players such as BlackRock’s IBIT ETF at $84K and MicroStrategy’s latest purchases near $73K. According to Dragosch, Bitcoin’s final bottom is “very likely” to form somewhere within this band. His comments landed as traders continue debating whether the market has already seen capitulation following Bitcoin’s slide from its October peak near $125,000. Some argue that institutional investors will not allow a deeper crash that could harm their own clients, while others say the market has not yet fully flushed out leverage. The discussion reflects mounting tension as Bitcoin trades in what many view as a fragile range.

He posted images that show two key approval letters from NYSE Arca. The letters confirm that Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP ETF and the Grayscale XRP Trust ETF both secured approval for listing. The announcement arrives at a time when interest in regulated XRP investment products is rising rapidly. These products were approved on November 21, 2025, and outline direct confirmation from NYSE Arca to the SEC. The market has waited for this step for months, so the confirmation carries weight for investors monitoring XRP’s position in the expanding ETF landscape.

They now move from the filing phase into the listing stage. Franklin Templeton has positioned its XRP ETF as part of a broader expansion into digital asset products. Market participants initially anticipated the launch on November 18, but the 20-day timeline before listing elapses on November 24 . Grayscale’s product is expected to launch on November 25 , as the firm plans to convert its existing trust to an ETF. The approval letter supports its exit from the trust-only structure. The shift prepares the product for a more competitive position in the market as ETF liquidity features come into play. The confirmation from NYSE Arca strengthens confidence in both launches. The exchange has become a primary venue for spot crypto ETFs in the U.S., and this rapidly growing market could impact XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Importance of XRP ETFs These new ETFs help XRP by offering regulated, on-ramp exposure. Through these products, U.S. investors can now gain exposure directly without holding tokens. This approach boosts XRP’s legitimacy and institutional demand. Several XRP products have already launched. Canary Capital’s XRPC began trading on November 13. Bitwise’s XRP ETF went live on November 20 . There’s also XRPM, a 3% monthly premium income ETF from Amplify. Grayscale and Franklin Templeton are set to join this growing list of ETF issuers. Together, these products create multiple entry points for different types of investors. They support traders, long-term holders, and yield seekers. That inflow could tighten XRP’s supply and deepen liquidity. This could push up its price over time as capital pours into regulated XRP vehicles.

Regulated fares, including season tickets and off-peak returns, will remain frozen until March 2027. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce the freeze in this week’s budget. She and Prime Minister Keir Starmer are relying on measures such as keeping train fares steady and energy-bill support to cushion the blowback of some of the tax increases. Commuters could save more than £300 in a year A rail freeze will reduce hundreds of pounds from the cost of season tickets, keep travel prices stable, and help grow town centre economies throughout the country. Commuters save upward of £300 ($392) per year on some of the priciest routes. Rail fares are usually increased in January, based on a formula of July’s RPI plus 1%, but there have been some exceptions. Since 2021, rail fares have been adjusted in March, not January. The last price hike occurred in March of this year, at a rate of 4.6%. A government insider suggests that unregulated fares may also rise, but will generally track those of regulated fares. Over the year to March 2025, unregulated fares increased 5.5%, compared with a 4.4% rise in regulated fares, resulting in a total increase of 1.1%. The Rail Delivery Group, the body representing UK rail operators, viewed the move as “good news for customers,” expressing a commitment to working with the government to ensure that rail reforms genuinely improve the customer experience. But experts say freezing fares could put even more financial pressure on rail operators that are already facing rising maintenance and staffing costs. Several operators have reported that revenue challenges stemming from changes in travel habits have arisen since the pandemic, as more people now work from home and reduce their weekly commutes. It has been unclear whether the government will offer additional subsidies to operators to help offset the freeze. With transport accounting for 14% of household spending, this cost-saving measure will provide real financial relief, in line with the government’s promise to support working families. It will also help ease inflation by keeping a vital expense in check. Reeves even remarked that the measure will “ease the pressure on household finances and make traveling to work, school or to visit friends and family that bit easier.” CEO of Campaign for Better Transport Ben Plowden also added: “As well as helping households with the cost of living, this will enable more people to choose rail, reducing traffic on our roads, benefiting the economy, helping the environment, and connecting communities across the country.” Starmer believes he will remain in office until 2034 Starmer told reporters in South Africa he wants the UK budget to prioritize growth and stability. Reeves will outline on Wednesday the tax increases she plans to implement to address a projected £20 billion ($26 billion) shortfall in the government’s budget. She may raise £7.5 billion ($9.8 billion) by holding income tax thresholds steady, along with billions more through smaller actions like ending tax relief on salary sacrifice pensions and taxing EVs. Recently, more citizens have been voicing their criticism of Starmer’s leadership. With the expected budget, the PM knows he must win over both markets and consumers to stay in power. Nonetheless, the UK leader believes he will stay in power until 2034. Overall, ministers are preparing for voter backlash over the planned tax increases, but the Prime Minister and Chancellor hope that freezing rail fares will help soften the blow.

At the same time, analysts outlined the next potential moves and the most important support and resistance lines. If Ripple’s token continues its ascent, the next major sell wall is situated at $2.6, according to CW. To reach those levels, though, XRP needs to decisively overcome the current sell wall located between $2.00 and $2.10, which is now being tested. CRYPTOWZRD supported this narrative, indicating that the asset needs to decisively close above the current range to change the negative sentiment and send it higher. However, they warned that if XRP fails to reclaim the $2.08 level, it could head further south. If it does, then the first line of defense could be at around $1.75 – just inches below the recent bottom. According to Ali Martinez, 1.8 billion tokens were accumulated at approximately that level, which makes it a “key support area.” 1.80 billion $XRP were previously acquired around $1.75, making it a key support area. pic.twitter.com/gjZCdVApuA — Ali (@ali_charts) November 22, 2025 Crypto Tony was also on the bearish side, suggesting that Ripple’s cross-border token could be heading for another correction.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022, as per crypto market data. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and it was trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February. In March 2025, Tron (TRX) dipped to $0.212, but it recovered to the $0.23 range in April and $0.278 in May, while it observed its yearly high price of $0.370 on August 14. In October, Tron started its descent and fell below $0.30 by the end of the month. At the start of November, Tron is trending below the $0.30 range, maintaining its price above $0.27, as the current Tron sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX|USDT|RESEARCH|BNB|USDD|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-11-23 09:15:00

What Exactly Has Been Approved? SMQKE reports that the approved change request, submitted by the Mojaloop Foundation, a global payments and settlement initiative, was greenlit in late 2024. Notably, the proposal directly references Ripple’s Interledger Protocol, laying the groundwork for seamless interoperability between Ripple’s blockchain-driven settlement layer and SWIFT’s expansive ISO 20022 messaging network. Importantly, ILP isn’t just a conceptual protocol; it already works with Ripple’s existing infrastructure. SMQKE shared documents showing that ILP uses XRP as a bridge asset for value settlement, with final reconciliation happening on the XRP Ledger. Why This Matters — Especially “Just in Time for the Migration” SWIFT’s transition to ISO 20022 is a major structural shift. By early 2026, as much as 90% of SWIFT’s messaging traffic is expected to fully adopt ISO 20022 standards. Against this backdrop, ILP’s formal inclusion in the ISO 20022 framework could dramatically boost Ripple’s relevance to banks making the transition. Rather than being a fringe blockchain play, Ripple may find itself more deeply embedded in the foundational rails of global finance. Bigger Implications for Cross-Border Payments Interoperability: This approval suggests that payments could flow seamlessly between traditional banking systems on SWIFT and Ripple’s blockchain-based network. Efficiency: Using ILP could reduce friction, improve settlement times, and lower costs by leveraging XRP as a bridge asset. Institutional adoption: By aligning with ISO 20022, the global messaging standard for cross-border payments, Ripple strengthens its appeal to banks and financial institutions. SMQKE argues that the ISO shift isn’t just a technical upgrade but a strategic opening for blockchain-based payment rails. Caveats & Context An approved request does not necessarily mean full, immediate integration. This change request is a formal step, not a full-scale deployment. ISO 20022 compliance pertains to messaging, not necessarily to all aspects of Ripple or XRP. As several analysts note, it’s the messaging layer, not the token itself, that is being certified in this context. Adoption will depend on how many banks and financial institutions actually choose to leverage this ILP-SWIFT rail in practice. Therefore, SMQKE highlights an approved ISO 20022 request for Ripple’s Interledger Protocol, signaling a potential turning point where blockchain and traditional finance seamlessly interoperate. As SWIFT finalizes its ISO migration, Ripple could emerge as the bridge between legacy systems and distributed ledgers, redefining global money flows. Conclusion The ISO 20022 approval of Ripple’s Interledger Protocol isn’t just a technical milestone, it signals a turning point in global finance. As SWIFT completes its migration to modern messaging standards, Ripple positions ILP at the nexus of traditional banking and blockchain innovation. This paves the way for faster, cheaper, and truly interoperable payments worldwide. While institutional adoption will determine the speed of integration, Ripple is no longer on the sidelines, it is being woven into the core of the global financial system.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-11-23 09:32:03

By press time, XRP’s market capitalization stood at $122.49 billion, up from $115.30 billion just 24 hours earlier, marking a sharp $7.19 billion increase that helped propel the token to $2.03. XRP 24-hour market cap chart. Source: CMC The rebound comes at a pivotal moment for the asset, coinciding with mounting investor excitement ahead of the Grayscale XRP ETF launch. Grayscale confirmed that its spot XRP ETF (GXRP) will debut on NYSE Arca on November 24, 2025, following SEC approval and the conversion of its existing trust into a publicly traded product. The development mirrors the ETF wave that reshaped Bitcoin ( BTC ) markets in early 2024, when BTC rallied more than 80% after spot ETFs opened the door to regulated inflows. The ETF narrative is also feeding into expectations of a potential supply squeeze. Analysts argue that ETF demand could eventually absorb up to 500 million XRP per day, thereby reducing the amount of XRP circulating on exchanges. While this projection is speculative, Grayscale’s entry is expected to expand institutional access significantly. Current inflows remain moderate, with the strongest to date being the $245 million peak into Canary’s XRP fund, but the market is watching closely to see whether GXRP accelerates demand.

The Indian investor, based in Hyderabad, registered a complaint with the Hyderabad Cyber Crime Police. The police have since launched an investigation into the case. According to the Indian police, the 38-year-old victim, who hails from Basheerbagh, was added to a Telegram channel in October by the administrators posing as stock market analysts. The criminals claimed they worked for a firm based in Singapore, promising to help their new investors make money from the stock and digital assets market. After a while, other members started flooding the chat with screenshots of their return on investment, a ploy to further convince their recruits. Indian investor scammed of $188K According to the complaint , the Indian national mentioned that the fraudsters then asked them to register on a platform that shared the same look as a trading portal. After registering, they were also asked to complete an online KYC, another move to fully capture their details. The victim told the police that he first deposited money through UPI on October 15, and two days after, he was able to withdraw his earnings, a move that gave him confidence to pour in larger sums. The Indian man noted that after his first withdrawal, he went through the next few months making huge deposits on the platform. He claimed that he deposited more than Rs. 1.68 crore through 21 transactions, sending it to the different bank accounts provided by the criminals. The criminals, whom he only identified as Steven, Viswanath, and Mary, assured him that he was accruing profits through his wave of investments in their products. The victim also mentioned that another move that sold him on the program was that they manipulated their website to show that his investments were yielding profits. He highlighted that he was confident he was in the right investment program because he was making profits, which were shown on his portal on the website. However, trouble started when he wanted to withdraw his funds from the platform. The Indian investor claimed that he started encountering challenges. Police kickstart investigations into cybercriminals The investor mentioned that after he tried to withdraw without success, he referred the administrators to the problem. However, they only told him that he had to pay some fees to be able to withdraw his funds. “They refused withdrawals unless I paid successive taxes and compliance deposits,” the victim said. The victim claimed he realized he was being defrauded after the criminals demanded Rs. 60 lakh as the additional amount towards the payments. He added that things started becoming fishy after they reduced his payment to Rs. 30 lakh after he expressed his inability to come up with the payment. The Indian police has registered the case under Sections 66-C, 66-D of the IT Acts and Sections 111(2)(b) (Organized crime), 318(4) (Cheating), 319(2) (Cheating by personation), 336(3) (Forgery for purpose of cheating), 338 (Forgery of valuable security, will, etc.) and 340(2) (Using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). Meanwhile, the Indian police have reiterated their claim to go after cybercriminals and crypto thieves. According to a recent Cryptopolitan report , the ED blew its investigation into a nationwide operation against cyber fraud. The agency identified a large money laundering network that routed criminal proceeds through layers of traditional banking channels and cryptocurrency platforms. In addition, it attached funds held in about 92 bank accounts and wallets on CoinDCX as part of its operation. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

By February, it recorded more than 1.56 million weekly active addresses, positioning the network as one of the fastest-growing L1 environments of the year. As the cycle progressed, however, that trajectory began to reverse. Engagement levels weakened, total value locked contracted and on-chain earnings declined, signaling a broader loss of ecosystem momentum heading into the final quarter of 2025. These metrics have become increasingly relevant for investors evaluating whether an asset’s foundation can sustain long-term participation. As Aptos activity continues to cool, analysts are turning toward systems with predictable economics, transparent governance and revenue-based rewards rather than throughput narratives. XRP Tundra — now in its accelerated launch window following an institutional acquisition — has become a principal beneficiary of this shift. Aptos Activity Trends Indicate a Loss of Network Momentum Recent data shows that Aptos’ active-address count has fallen to its lowest range since late 2024, settling near a seven-day moving average of 644,000. The decline represents a drop of more than 40% from the February peak of 1.56 million users. Analysts point to diminishing application usage and inconsistent fee generation as the primary drivers of this contraction. The ecosystem’s total value locked has slid below the $650 million threshold, marking a retreat from earlier growth periods. Weaker on-chain earnings further reflect a slowdown in transactional intensity within the network. While Aptos experienced a short-lived price recovery on November 18, broader market analysis indicates that momentum remains fragile as user participation continues to fall across multiple metrics. Institutional Oversight Has Accelerated Tundra’s Path to Market XRP Tundra’s operational direction shifted after a major institution initiated an acquisition of the project. This event triggered a comprehensive due-diligence cycle and resulted in the launch being accelerated to December 15. The institution created a fixed pricing framework that maintains a final $0.01 retail window before institutional tiers replace it permanently. Verification measures expanded substantially during the review process. The system now operates with open-source contracts and no administrative minting capabilities. Independent audits include the Cyberscope report , Solidproof audit and FreshCoins verification , complemented by team KYC via Vital Block . Any unsold tokens will be burned at launch, reflecting the controlled governance structure shaping the project’s development. Tundra’s Dual-Chain Architecture Strengthens Its Long-Term Execution Model Analysts highlight Tundra’s architecture as one of the reasons it is gaining traction in late 2025 allocation strategies. The system separates governance and execution into two specialized layers: TUNDRA-X on the XRP Ledger and TUNDRA-S on Solana. TUNDRA-X manages reserves and policy, while TUNDRA-S handles high-throughput staking operations and fee routing. GlacierChain — an XRPL-connected L2 scheduled for later rollout — will unify these elements into a single environment with cross-chain coordination and scalable liquidity distribution. Industry coverage by Crypto Show underscores how this architecture positions Tundra for multi-year adoption. Revenue Channels Sustain Tundra’s Staking Distribution Model Tundra’s traction is supported by a reward structure grounded in ecosystem activity rather than emissions. The Cryo Vaults distribute revenue drawn from four primary channels: Operational fees across swaps, lending flows, derivative routes, bridging and future GlacierChain settlement Frost Key NFT sales and secondary-market activity contributing directly to the revenue vault Treasury accumulation via scheduled market purchases of TUNDRA-X permanently locked in reserve Hard-capped supply, with no emissions or mint functionality The system incorporates open-source verification, third-party audits, on-chain revenue tracking and DAMM V2 liquidity controls to support consistent fee generation from initial launch through expansion. This creates a reward structure that adjusts with usage rather than speculative demand. Tundra’s Stability Profile Strengthens Its Position Against Declining L1 Activity As Aptos navigates weakening engagement, analysts note that ecosystems relying on active-address volume often face inconsistent revenue windows. Tundra, however, ties its returns to protocol-level execution rather than user fluctuation. With TUNDRA-S scheduled to list at $2.50 and TUNDRA-X at $1.25, the final $0.01 entry window creates a clearly defined valuation position for early participants under institutional parameters. Aptos’ contraction in active addresses, TVL and earnings signals a period of cooling for the ecosystem, raising questions about its next growth cycle. XRP Tundra’s accelerated launch, dual-chain structure, verified governance and revenue-based staking provide an alternative framework focused on sustainable long-term outcomes. As allocation strategies shift toward systems with predictable economic foundations, Tundra’s model stands out as one of the most credible in the current market.

Even with these new positive cash flows to the coin, it still is losing value. Meme coins, and Shiba Inu, especially during bearish trends such the one the industry has been experiencing over the past few weeks, will continue to decline when other coins cash out and reserve their bags. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is exhibiting outstanding durability and performance for the industry. With a presale with more than $18.9 million, with the demand infinitely higher than what memes coins can produce, it will more than likely be able to generate 20x more than almost any other established token in the industry. Shiba Inu Meets Realities of the Market Recently, Shiba Inu struck a marketing agreement with Bitgert that offers customers a zero-fee payment card, as well as a massive free giveaway of SHIB tokens in attempts to encourage adoption and stimulate payment use. But the new marketing strategies did nothing to alleviate the selling pressure that has characterized the SHIB market throughout September and into early October. On-chain data shows over 60 billion SHIB were moved to the exchanges, and this has always been the preamble to big selling events as large SHIB holders turn to cash and dump their positions. This inactivity has taken place during this quota period, during which an ‘Extreme Fear’ market sentiment has taken hold, resulting in the capital bypassing high-risk meme and other utility-light coins. SHIB currently trades well below its most important moving averages. In fact, SHIB shows the most bearish momentum of any of the major altcoins, so the risks are skewed to the downside. Certainly, the scenario is a reminder of the high instability of cryptocurrencies that are largely meme-driven. Hence, for investors genuinely looking for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in based on utility such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). These will, of course, be the most reliable for steady sustainable growth. Mutuum Finance Presale: Last Chance To Get Ground Floor Pricing! In contrast to Shiba Inu’s challenges, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a well-structured investment opportunity. Currently in Phase 6 of presale, the $MUTM token is currently valued at $0.035. Prices have increased from the original price in Phase 1 by 250%. Even with the current Phase 6 price, the presale is a good investment to get value at, considering the proposed multiple uplifts. Phase 6 is currently 95% filled. Therefore, this price presale is available shortly. Phase 7 of the presale will increase prices to $0.040, a nearly 20% increase. As such, current Phase 6 is the final opportunity to position at the current price. Additional phases of the presale, coupled with the positive advancements of the projects, has created a sense of urgency. For individuals considering what crypto to buy, this presale is a prime opportunity with a well-charted plan. Unlike many other digital currencies, Mutuum Finance has the presale with a strong roadmap. Furthermore, the Mutuum Finance team has removed any barriers by allowing unlimited purchases of $MUTM tokens through Debit and Credit Cards. Therefore, the buy will be easy for anyone interested to get. Value-Creating Innovation Mutuum Finance isn’t just a token. Mutuum Finance is a Complex DeFi protocol that is designed with real-life use cases. One of the main innovations is a dual-market lending system consisting of Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools with high liquidity assets such as ETH, USDT, and Peer-to-Peer customized lending. This provides efficiency and adaptability among a large array of users. In addition, the protocol has a one-of-a-kind buy-and-distribute mechanism where a proportion of fee revenue from the protocol is used to buy MUTM on the open market while distributing those purchased tokens to strakers. This mechanism includes a direct and sustainable closed loop that fundamentally supports long-term value. For investors looking for the best crypto to invest, this real-life use case and built-in economical model is in stark contrast to the rewards mechanics of the Shiba Inu giveaway, whose rewards are inflationary. In addition, MUTM has a live dashboard that displays a leaderboard for the top 50 contributors for the day. The largest buyer then receives $500 MUTM; this fosters a competitive and active community. Investing In An Asset In Its Growth Stage Presale phase 6 is not that far away from selling out completely and closing the early investment window. Investors have the chance to buy $MUTM at $0.035. Those that do will have the chance to realize a 400% ROI at the token launch price of $0.06 – a return that is greatly superior to the returns of the high risk meme coin assets. Successful presale sell outs are a historical indicator of strong investment interest. Combined with the soon to be released definitive protocol, Mutuum Finance is positioned to be the next cryptocurrency to go off and explodes to its deserved valuation. Cheap crypto MUTM price will soon be a thing of the past. Don’t miss out.

54788720,https://timestabloid.com/?p=90330,1763892001,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,What Crypto to Invest While BTC Dips? A New Cryptocurrency That Reminds Analysts of Early ETH,https://timestabloid.com/what-crypto-to-invest-while-btc-dips-a-new-cryptocurrency/,"Bitcoin dips often redirect attention to alternative assets with strong narratives. During market pullbacks, early-stage high-utility tokens have historically delivered outsized rebounds. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a new crypto coin that fits this profile. Analysts are observing MUTM closely, seeing early patterns similar to Ethereum’s ICO era. While BTC retraces, investors will increasingly seek the next crypto to explode, and MUTM is positioned to capture that interest. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Presale Phase 6, with 95% of 170 million tokens already sold. The project has raised approximately $18.9 million across all presale phases and has over 18,100 holders. The total supply is 4 billion tokens, and the current presale price stands at $0.035. This rapid uptake reflects growing confidence and mirrors the velocity early ETH experienced during its initial offering. Investors allocating capital now will access MUTM at a discounted level before Phase 7, priced at $0.040, while the protocol continues to develop its robust infrastructure. Dual Lending System Sets MUTM Apart One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s key differentiators is its dual lending architecture. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system allows users to supply liquidity to protocol-controlled pools. Borrowers will draw from these pools, generating automated activity and predictable returns. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system will enable direct lender-to-borrower matching, allowing custom terms and flexible interest rates. Together, these models will balance risk and reward, attracting both conservative and advanced financial participants simultaneously. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced on its official X account that the V1 of its protocol is scheduled to debut on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This initial rollout will showcase the core mechanics of the ecosystem, including the liquidity pool, the mtToken and debt-token framework, and an automated liquidator bot designed to maintain platform stability and security. In this phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and provide ETH or USDT as collateral. Launching V1 on the testnet allows the community to experiment with the protocol ahead of its mainnet release. This step-by-step launch strategy helps build transparency, encourages early participation, and provides the development team with meaningful feedback for fine-tuning the system. As more users explore and interact with the testnet features, broader interest in the platform is expected to strengthen, ultimately contributing to sustained demand for the MUTM token. Stablecoin Architecture & Potential Listing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a stablecoin designed to preserve a $1 value. Minting will occur only when users borrow against collateralized assets like ETH. Tokens will burn when loans are repaid or liquidated. Only approved issuers will mint, each with set caps. Governance-controlled interest rates will maintain the peg, while arbitrage mechanisms will stabilize value across markets. Overcollateralization safeguards the system against volatility. The stablecoin will act as the foundation for Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2C and P2P lending systems, enabling ongoing borrowing and lending activity while keeping liquidity circulating within the platform. As stablecoins are widely regarded as essential to DeFi, a secure, overcollateralized version could help maintain steady demand for MUTM over time. Strong presale performance, combined with utility-driven design and a clear development roadmap, positions MUTM for potential future listings on Tier-1 or Tier-2 exchanges. Exchange exposure will introduce the project to millions of new users, increasing liquidity, trust, and market participation. Early presale entry at $0.035 will offer investors the advantage of securing tokens before broader market demand accelerates. Price Discovery Enhances Trust and Adoption Accurate pricing is essential for safe lending and borrowing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on Chainlink USD and multi-asset price feeds, supported by fallback oracles, aggregated sources, and DEX-based time-weighted average prices. Correct liquidation timing, minimized manipulation risks, and loan health monitoring will be enabled by these systems. Increased reliability will encourage institutional-scale lending, driving recurring fee flow and strengthening MUTM’s internal economy. Crypto predictions suggest that well-structured price discovery will make MUTM an attractive token for diverse investors. A respected crypto analyst, known for forecasting growth cycles of assets such as SOL and DOGE, predicts that MUTM could mirror early ETH expansion. With Phase 7 set at $0.040, the analyst projects a post-listing price of $0.50. A $1,000 presale investment will grow to $14,000 following this trajectory, highlighting the power of entering the token during this phase. Security Measures Strengthen Confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing security through a CertiK audit with Manual Review and Static Analysis. Token Scan Score is 90.00, and Skynet Score is 79.00, with the timeline updated from February 25 to May 20, 2025. The platform also offers a 50,000 bug bounty program with rewards by severity: Critical issues up to $2,000, Major $1,000, Medium $500, and Low $200. These measures will maintain a secure environment and incentivize the community to participate actively in safeguarding the protocol. Phase 6 is already 95% sold out, and the price will rise to $0.040 in the next phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering one of the final opportunities to secure tokens at $0.035. With dual lending models, innovative stablecoin architecture, reliable price oracles, and potential exchange listings, MUTM will be a compelling choice for investors seeking the next crypto to explode. Entering during this presale will ensure early exposure to a high-utility token before broader adoption amplifies demand.

According to an official, the operation specifically targets cybercriminals for their alleged involvement in several Interstate fraud modules that defrauded victims of more than Rs. 254 crore (approximately $28 million). According to reports, the arrests were made during the raids linked to Operation CyHawk. During the operation, which lasted 48 hours, the Delhi police arrested more than 800 accused linked with various cybercrimes. According to an official, more than 509 individuals have also received notices in connection with cybercrimes during the operations’ duration. While addressing a press conference, Rajesh Gupta, the Joint Commissioner of Police (Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations), gave details about the operation. Delhi police arrests more suspects In his press conference, Gupta mentioned that the individuals apprehended or sent notices were connected to fraud, such as job fraud, investment fraud, work-from-home fraud, with many call centers involved in scamming people also being raided. Meanwhile, the newly arrested parties have been linked to 23 registered FIRs and 377 NCRP complaints. In addition, three laptops, two computers, 43 mobile phones, 17 passbooks, two cheque books, 14 debit cards, and about $178K in cash were also recovered from the raid. The police highlighted that the crackdown also targeted criminals involved in ATM fraud, digital arrest scams, USDT laundering, digital marketing fraud, and large mule accounts operating across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Haryana. Technical analysis of mule accounts carried out by the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Center (14C) flagged suspicious activities in four private bank accounts in Kishangarh. The accounts were linked to several fraud cases registered across Kolkata and Mumbai. The Delhi police have also registered a case regarding the development. The investigation led to the arrest of Asgard Ali and Ankit Singh, who were both high-profile mule account suppliers. Police shed light on the arrests After interrogating the suspects, they led the Delhi police to the alleged mastermind, Ravi Kumar Singh, who was arrested after a seven-day chase across Noida, Delhi, and Ghaziabad. The police claimed that Ravi allegedly operated fraudulent call centers in Noida and Kotla Mubarakpur, luring his victims through fake job advertisements for private airlines. He also routed proceeds of his criminal activities with the help of another accused, Ravi Mishra. The police also apprehended three additional suspects, Rajan Singh Negi, Kamlesh Pal, and a 24-year-old anonymous woman. They were all arrested from a functioning call center in Kotla Mubarakpur. The police seized ten mobile phones, five smartphones, two laptops, a computer, and a register containing all the details of their fraudulent transactions. The criminals are expected to be processed before they face the court for their bail hearing. In another case, an FIR was registered after police discovered that bank accounts in the name of Rajesh Kumar were used to withdraw fraud proceeds in at least six NCRP complaints. The police carried out raids across Mandawali and Najafgarh, leading to the arrest of Rajesh and three other accomplices, Sajan Kumar, Akash Kumar, and Gopal Yadav. The police also recovered 17 passbooks, eight debit cards, three mobile phones, and more than $177K in cash. The Delhi police also highlighted another case where a current account opened in the name of Dynamic Dreams was found linked to 244 cybercrime complaints involving losses of more than Rs. 186 crore. The case was registered, and one of the account holders was arrested after a raid in Nilothi. Five bank accounts linked to Gayatri Kumari were also linked to 23 cybercrime complaints. Gayatri was arrested from Dabri Extension, and her interrogation led to the arrest of Aman Bhardwaj, whom police accused of converting illegal proceeds into USDT.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/top-trader-xrp-price-will-explode-like-never-before-heres-why/,"A prominent crypto expert in the community, known as UnknowDLT, has issued a forceful warning. He stated that institutions acquiring XRP via newly launched spot ETFs could trigger the biggest supply shock in the token’s history. He claims that Ripple disallowed the XRP price discovery phase to enable this institutional buildup. Institutions Are Buying, Exchanges Are Draining Multiple spot XRP ETFs have launched in recent weeks. Among them, Canary Capital’s XRPC made a splash on November 13, recording $58 million in day‑one volume . Then Bitwise joined the fray with its ETF listing on November 20 . These ETFs offer regulated, on‑ramp exposure for large investors. Meanwhile, data shows XRP reserves on exchanges are falling sharply. This mass outflow coincides with the ETF launches, reinforcing UnknowDLT’s thesis of a structural supply squeeze. Wake up, people, they are going to cause the biggest supply shock in history. That is why Ripple has NOT allowed XRP to enter discovery price, so that institutions can do so with ETFs, which further amplifies the supply shock. The price IS GOING TO EXPLODE LIKE NEVER BEFORE. — {x} (@unknowDLT) November 21, 2025 XRP Supply Shock Is Real UnknowDLT argues that when institutions begin buying via ETFs, they will pull significant XRP off the market. This will dramatically reduce the available supply. This is not a normal drain, but a supply shock in the making. While Ripple does not control XRP’s price, the pundit believes it has managed the token’s listing to preserve this opportunity. Ripple has kept a large portion of the supply in escrow and out of active markets, waiting for the right moment. When ETFs went live, institutions could step in. That demand could compress the float quickly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why This Matters for XRP’s Price If his thesis plays out, XRP’s price could surge. A supply shock means fewer tokens are available to trade freely, while demand from regulated funds remains strong. That imbalance could send XRP to new highs, according to UnknowDLT. He insists that XRP’s price will explode due to this supply shock. Long-term holders, whales, and now institutions are aligned in locking up XRP. These players are not trading for quick gains. They are accumulating. Combined with shrinking exchange inventories , that could set the stage for rapid and sustained price growth. Potential Risks Despite the bullish thesis, risks remain. ETF flows may not continue at the same rate, or some speculators may take profits after the hype. Regulatory shifts could also change how ETFs operate. And while exchange reserves are down now, they could recover over time. Still, UnknowDLT’s warning resonates widely among XRP believers. He sees this as a rare moment. Institutional capital is flowing in, the supply is shrinking, and XRP is positioned not just as a speculative token but as a serious asset for regulated finance.

This reflects an estimated decline of around 16% over the period. The overall momentum remains weak, signaling that sellers continue to maintain control of the market. As of today, PEPE shows a strong intraday recovery, rising from around $0.00000407 after early volatility to about $0.000004182. The price action reflects a clear shift from bearish movement to steady upward momentum throughout the day. At press time, PEPE was trading at $0.000004182, reflecting a modest 3.41% increase over the past 24 hours. PEPE price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap PEPE Breakdown Eyes $0.00000185 Target After Pattern Confirmation PEPE breaks down from a head-and-shoulders pattern near $0.0000044, confirming a major bearish reversal signal. The chart clearly outlines the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder formation, followed by a clean breakdown below the neckline, an area that had previously acted as strong multi-month support. Once this level failed, selling pressure intensified, showing that bulls were unable to regain control or defend any nearby support zones, reinforcing the bearish shift in momentum. Source: X According to recent data by Ali Martinez, the completion of this pattern now opens the door to lower Fibonacci extension targets, with the most important one sitting at $0.00000185. This aligns with the 1.618 extension, often used to project full downside completion after a confirmed reversal structure. As long as PEPE remains below the neckline and continues forming lower lows, the technical outlook points toward an extended decline into this zone. Unless buyers reappear and reclaim key resistance levels soon, the trend suggests PEPE may drift further toward this target before any meaningful recovery attempt. PEPE Extends Weekly Downtrend as Momentum Continues to Fade The weekly chart clearly shows that PEPE remains stuck in a decisive downtrend, with price action forming consistent lower highs and lower lows ever since the major blow-off top. Each rebound has grown progressively weaker, signaling fading bullish strength and a lack of conviction from buyers. This kind of structure is typical when a macro trend has shifted from expansion to distribution, and the highlighted zones on the chart reinforce how momentum has steadily drained from the market. Source: X As PEPE continues to slide, there’s still no meaningful reaction from any strong support zone, which keeps the bearish outlook intact. The next demand area will be crucial; if buyers fail to defend it, the token could drift even lower in the coming weeks.

The approvals come at a time of heightened interest in digital assets among institutional and retail investors. The NYSE listing of ETFs from two of the world’s most respected financial firms signals growing confidence in the cryptocurrency sector from traditional finance. Franklin Templeton, a global investment leader, and Grayscale, a pioneering crypto asset manager, are set to boost XRP’s credibility and liquidity. Analysts predict their NYSE listings will draw both seasoned investors and newcomers seeking regulated crypto exposure without directly holding digital assets. ETFs provide a streamlined path for investors to access specific assets under the regulatory safeguards of traditional markets. Unlike buying crypto directly, XRP ETFs can be traded through standard brokerage accounts, offering familiar protections and compliance. This accessibility, coupled with Bitwise and Canary Capital’s existing XRP ETFs, is poised to expand XRP’s appeal, particularly among institutional investors who previously faced custody and compliance hurdles. ETFs provide a regulated, convenient way to invest in assets like XRP through standard brokerage accounts, bypassing the compliance and custody challenges of direct crypto purchases. This accessibility is poised to boost XRP’s appeal, particularly among institutional investors, building on the precedent set by Bitwise and Canary Capital’s XRP ETFs. Therefore, tomorrow NYSE Arca might witness the debut of landmark XRP ETFs, a pivotal moment set to redefine institutional participation in digital assets. Conclusion With Franklin Templeton and Grayscale set to launch XRP ETFs on the NYSE Monday, this milestone goes beyond a new investment product, it marks a major step toward mainstream crypto adoption.
