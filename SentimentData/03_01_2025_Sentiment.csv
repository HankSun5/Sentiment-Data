Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-half-pump-could-send-xrp-to-27-heres-how/,"Crypto analyst Egrag Crypto recently shared a detailed update on XRP’s price trajectory, focusing on pivotal technical indicators and potential price targets. The analysis highlights both bullish and bearish scenarios, emphasizing the importance of key levels and formations in determining the asset’s next move. #XRP – Half Pump Could Lead to $27 (UPDATE): For a deeper understanding, check out my post from December 18, 2024: [Full Details Here] https://t.co/Nbpn96U2OW What’s Next for #XRP : 1️⃣ Fib Channel Break: #XRP has broken the 0.236 Fib Channel, but we still have 6 hours left for… https://t.co/SLTvnaV79E pic.twitter.com/b09i95BuDH — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 30, 2024 Current Analysis and Short-Term Outlook Egrag’s latest update highlights the following critical elements for XRP’s price movement: Fibonacci Channel Break: XRP has recently broken the 0.236 Fibonacci (Fib) Channel, a significant development. However, Egrag notes that the close of the daily candle will be crucial in determining whether this break is sustainable. The next six hours will clarify whether XRP can maintain this level or if a retracement is likely. Critical Bounce at $2.12: A bounce above $2.12 is essential for XRP to sustain bullish momentum. Closing the daily candle above this level would reinforce positive sentiment and mitigate risks of crashing further. Triangle Formation Breakdown: The systematic triangle formation observed on the chart has broken to the downside. The measured move of this breakdown points to a potential target of $1.67, suggesting caution in the near term. Equilibrium Levels: The equilibrium zone between $1.75 and $1.64 is a critical area to watch. Price consolidation within this range could provide clues about the next significant move. SRSI Accumulation: The Stochastic Relative Strength Index (SRSI) accumulates and signals preparation for a significant price move. While the exact direction remains uncertain, this setup warrants close attention. Long-Term Perspective Egrag’s December 18 analysis offers a broader view of XRP’s potential trajectory across multiple time frames, including monthly, weekly, and daily charts: Monthly Time Frame: The $0.75 zone was identified as a key price expansion target. XRP’s penetration of the 0.236 Fib Channel on the monthly chart is a bullish signal. A monthly candle close above this level would pave the way for targeting the 0.382 Fib Channel, potentially unlocking a rally toward $27 in the long term. Weekly Time Frame: Key weekly candle close levels are critical to XRP’s trajectory . If the price closes below $2.44, the chances of revisiting $2.05 increase significantly. Conversely, a close above $2.60 would enhance the likelihood of testing all-time highs (ATH) and could mark the beginning of a sustained bullish rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Daily and 3-Day Time Frames: On shorter time frames, XRP appears to be forming patterns with mixed implications. While the daily chart shows the potential for bullish and bearish outcomes, the 3-day chart hints at a bullish ascending triangle that could break out between December 25 and December 28, targeting $3.288. Implications for XRP Egrag’s analysis underscores the importance of monitoring critical price levels and technical formations. A close above $2.12 in the short term could mitigate bearish risks and restore bullish momentum. However, failure to hold key levels, such as $1.75-$1.64, may lead to further downside. For long-term investors, the monthly and weekly time frames suggest significant upside potential if key resistance levels are breached. The possibility of reaching $27 hinges on sustained momentum and favorable market conditions. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

38446464,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=636373,1735856843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38446464.jpeg,Could PEPE become the next Dogecoin?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/could-pepe-become-the-next-dogecoin/,"PEPE is following the path of Dogecoin, which it might replace at some level. With Elon Musk’s endorsement and the community’s support, PEPE is ready for the 2025 rally, which looks eerily similar to Dogecoin in 2021. Dogecoin was initiated in 2013 as a joke based on the “Doge” meme, which had a picture of a Shiba Inu dog. For many years it was niche cryptocurrency with no serious backing or purpose, but this all changed with Elon Musk’s involvement. In 2021, Musk began to tweet about Dogecoin, calling it the “people’s crypto” and even gave himself the title of “DogeFather.” Instantly, the price of Dogecoin increased. However, Musk didn’t stop at social media instead, he stepped forward to make Dogecoin useful in real life. Tesla, his electric car company, began to accept Dogecoin as a payment for its merchandise. The space exploration company also did the same. All these developments took Dogecoin from just being a meme into an actual currency which people can use to settle transactions. After Dogecoin, Musk’s influence is now on PEPE. The inspiration for this new meme coin is the “Pepe the Frog” meme, which has been an internet icon for many years. The PEPE token is newer and has a smaller market cap than Dogecoin. He shared a meme of Pepe the Frog, where he stated, “ Explaining Constitutional Amendments.” After that PEPE coin had quickly gained popularity after launching in April. Can PEPE Reach Dogecoin’s Heights? The big question now is whether PEPE can rise to the same level of success as Dogecoin. While PEPE’s market cap is currently much smaller, the coin has been able to show very rapid growth because of Musk’s involvement. In fact, if Musk were to officially back PEPE, this coin would easily be catapulted into astronomical levels of popularity and price, which is a thing that happened to Dogecoin. Some continue to speculate t hat Tesla would accept PEPE as a way to pay for services, bu t until now, there is nothing concrete, although this happening would significantly increase PEPE’s credibility and visibility. However, in all probability, it might require more than the influence of Musk to sustain PEPE. Once again, the hype surrounding the coin is what will make or break PEPE, as in the case of Dogecoin. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that because of the gaffe, PEPE climbed 54.7%. The official PEPE Twitter account even quoted Musk’s tweet, adding a comment about “seizing the memes of production.” Elon Musk’s influence is deemed as crucial since his tweets can cause tremendous price movements in the crypto market. For instance, another meme coin, Milady Meme Coin (LADYS), surged 12,056% in price after Musk’s tweet about it. Another meme coin that shot up due to the influence of Musk was the Kekius Maximus abbreviated as KEKIUS, which rocketed by more than 3,000% since Musk put that name on his Twitter. However, the price of KEKIUS has decreased significantly since Musk changed his profile name. In short, Elon Musk’s tweets and actions frequently send meme coins soaring in price, but can drop just as quickly when the billionaire’s focus turns elsewhere. That Pepe is up 34% since its low in mid-December, with a big boost coming after Elon Musk changed his X profile picture to Pepe the Frog in gladiator attire. This shift from Dogecoin to Pepe increased the coin’s price, from $0.0000144 on December 24 to a high of $0.00002828. It’s now trading around $0.00002025 Analyst comparing it to Dogecoin and predicting it could grow a lot in the 2025 bull market, possibly reaching $40 to $125 billion in value. The coin is even now trading more than Dogecoin in terms of volume, with $3.8 billion in 24-hour trading, compared to Dogecoin’s $1.9 billion. As Pepe’s popularity rises, other Pepe-themed coins are also emerging, like Pepe Unchained, which is launching tools for creating memecoins without coding, and Wall Street Pepe, which is building a platform for memecoin trading and offering rewards. Wall Street Pepe’s presale raised $38.5 million in its first month, benefiting from the hype around Pepe. Analysts are very bullish on PEPE coin, comparing it to Dogecoin’s price action during the 2021 bull run. They believe PEPE is following a similar pattern, with its price rising while Bitcoin breaks its all-time high, and predict that PEPE will continue to climb higher, just like Dogecoin did in 2021. Last year, PEPE’s price movement was similar to Dogecoin’s in 2020, and since then, PEPE’s market cap has skyrocketed from $600 million to over $8 billion. With a year-to-date gain of 1,400%, the rally is just getting started. Crypto analysts are also optimistic, with some pointing out that PEPE is forming a “bull flag” or “bullish pennant” on its chart. These patterns suggest PEPE could keep rising, possibly reaching up to $0.000038 in the near future. Currently, PEPE is cooling off a bit but still trading at around $0.00002017.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD gaining 1.5% on the day, recovering from earlier dips to monthly lows. “Christmas Range has swept both sides for liquidity now,” trader Daan Crypto Trades observed, adding that the $95.8K mid-range level had acted as resistance during recent tests. Accompanying charts highlighted increased trading volume at the range lows, which some traders saw as a bullish signal. Daan Crypto Trades advised keeping an eye on range breakouts to anticipate Bitcoin’s movement over the next couple of weeks. Similarly, trader Jelle noted parallels between this year’s price action and last year’s, suggesting a potential upside resolution. “The similarities are there, with or without another sweep of the lows,” Jelle commented, forecasting a breakout to $130,000–$150,000. Entrepreneur Jason Williams shared a comparable outlook, describing the current price range as an accumulation zone. “$BTC has re-entered the accumulation zone,” Williams posted on X, predicting, “$131.5K+ by Q1 2025 feels inevitable. See you there.” His chart compared the current range to Bitcoin’s behavior after reaching all-time highs in March last year, which eventually led to a significant breakout after several months of consolidation. Market sentiment has turned bullish amid optimism about the return of traditional finance traders. Cole Kennelly, founder of crypto volatility index service Volmex, forecasted a renewed push for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. “My gut tells me the market goes full risk-on and a lot of money piles into crypto, now that end-of-year logistics/rebalancing/etc. is over,” Kennelly stated, anticipating a strong start to the year.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO’s price trend is bullish and the fear and greed index shows greed among investors. Data analysis, however, shows rising activity in decentralized finance applications and stablecoin demand. Why is ALGO up? ALGO is trading at previous highs set in 2022, the recovery could be attributed to the crypto market’s general bullish sentiment which saw its market cap rise above $3.2 trillion. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending 2028. Will ALGO reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending 2030. Will ALGO reach $100? At $100, Algorand market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorancd is highly unlikely to reach $100. Does ALGO have a good long-term future? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term. Recent news The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) now offers blockchain education training to 24,000 personnel worldwide, including UNDP, UN Volunteers, and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). The training for the academy is in partnership with the Algorand Foundation , an organization focused on enabling an inclusive, decentralized, and borderless global economy.

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history: Coinstats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.4 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to Coinmarketcap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.637 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.3 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It now trades at $0.13. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 dropping to the $0.4 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-02 23:06:08

Trump 2025 (TRUM2025), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUM2025 is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump 2025 can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump 2025 could become the next viral memecoin. Trump 2025 launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump 2025 on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump 2025 by entering its contract address – 5K2ESM1q2SjZFybttofLFpbbW8yF3isBRW3ZxDPUVfVY – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUM2025. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-02 23:19:00

On this premise, Circle’s Policy Head Patrick Hansen took to X to clear a few of the misconstrued takes. Crypto Exchanges, Travel Rule and MiCA The Circle executive admitted to seeing several post from people who were mixing up EU’s Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) Travel Rule and the newly implemented MiCA . The former mandates financial service providers to gather and exchange customers data amongst others. The Travel Rule also came into force on December 30, 2024, the same day as MiCA. As a result of its implementation, Hansen said Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) like custodian and brokers are now required to request for more information from users. This applies to both sender and receiver in any transactions. In addition, he added that CASPs are at liberty to exchange this information within themselves. The Circle Policy Head said this info exchange might take place through encrypted channels or travel rule networks like Trust or Notabene. The aim is to ensure that customers are not exposed to scams while trying to complete their crypto transactions. CASPs can also take some more delicate steps, depending on the amount of funds involved. Quick addition since I am seeing a ton of people mixing up EU crypto regulations (MiCA & TFR): Yes, since end of last year, the EU implementation of the travel rule (TFR) is in force as well. The application date (December 30th) was the same as for MICA. Exchanges and other… https://t.co/FYn2RN8Ei7 — Patrick Hansen (@paddi_hansen) January 2, 2025 Specifically, Hansen said CASPs would request that a customer verify ownership of his self-custody wallet once the transaction tops €1,000. Noteworthy, TFR or Travel Rule, like MiCA is designed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. However, Hansen stated clearly that both rules are entirely unrelated, the major miscommunication among users. MoonPay Secures Approval Under New Regime Several crypto asset service providers are making efforts to ensure that they are not left out of the new crypto regulation dispensation in the EU. Renowned crypto infrastructure service provider MoonPay is one of firms that has taken a monumental stride by securing MiCA approval . By all means, the move aligns with the firm’s expansion plans in Europe. Meanwhile it has also positioned MoonPay as a crypto regulation-compliant entity in Europe. In the past, it has gained significant traction while empowering crypto payments across the region. With this achievement and the continuous bull cycle in 2025, MoonPay is likely to capture more EU market share.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin whales buy millions while adding PropiChain, a hidden altcoin, for significant gains. Table of Contents Dogecoin whales acquire 270 million DOGE Why whales are flocking to PCHAIN’s presale PCHAIN for massive gains in 2025 Dogecoin whales are taking advantage of the recent dip to accumulate DOGE at low prices. They are splashing millions on DOGE and PropiChain (PCHAIN), a real estate tokenization platform. PropiChain’s ongoing presale has attracted smart money and retail investors. After raising over $1 million, PropiChain is set to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. As whales prepare for 2025, DOGE and PCHAIN have emerged as the best altcoins to invest in. Dogecoin whales acquire 270 million DOGE Dogecoin whales spent nearly $90 million buying 270 million DOGE in 96 hours. Large acquisitions typically occur during market consolidation or price dips, allowing major investors to capitalize. Dogecoin dipped below $0.3, offering whales the opportunity to accumulate. DOGE has since risen to $0.3198, marking a 12.4% increase in the past week. Analysts are optimistic Dogecoin could reclaim the $0.35 mark in Q1 2025. However, others have sounded the alarm, claiming that DOGE has reached its local top and could see further selling pressure. Why whales are flocking to PCHAIN’s presale Dogecoin whales have joined smart money and retail traders in investing in PropiChain during its ongoing presale. The real estate altcoin is on course to surge 30,000% in 2025, making it a top crypto to invest in. At only $0.011, PCHAIN has an attractive point as it is near its possible lowest-ever price. This makes it easy for early investors to earn substantial gains after listing on exchanges. Yet, PCHAIN’s appeal lies in its value proposition. As a real estate tokenization platform, PropiChain will support fractional ownership of properties. This will allow multiple investors to own a single property, opening the industry to many investors. PropiChain’s users can also sell portions of their properties to raise capital. Investors are also impressed by PCHAIN’s use of AI to simplify property investing and management. The platform will use AI to conduct predictive market analysis, enabling users to identify patterns and predict future market behaviors. This will give them an edge over their peers as they can easily make data-driven, smart decisions. The platform will also take property valuations to the next level using automated valuation models (AVMs). AVMs will provide accurate valuations of properties, enabling buyers and sellers to get fair deals.

This process will remove manual work and third-party intermediaries, making transactions cheaper and faster. The project has had its smart contract audited by BlockAudit to make it safe for investors and users. Another important feature that investors appreciate is remote property tours using the metaverse. This allows investors to view and stage properties virtually, making it easier for them to make buying decisions. Dogecoin whales are betting on PCHAIN because they expect the real estate altcoin to be the biggest winner in 2025. Its growing community of investors highlights its strong potential for long-term growth. On the other hand, Dogecoin has already experienced significant upside, meaning it has limited room for an explosive rally. PCHAIN for massive gains in 2025 In the past week, whales have accumulated PCHAIN during its ongoing token presale. The real estate altcoin has already progressed to the second round, earning early investors a 200% gain. The project is on course to surge 30,000% in 2025 thanks to its tokenomics, incentives, and value proposition. The project secured a CoinMarketCap listing , adding layers of transparency and credibility. With over $1 million raised during the presale, PropiChain is expected to bring more investors on board.

Many have already developed STO platforms in anticipation of imminent approval. But they have found themselves frustrated as Yoon’s government ran into trouble with a disastrous showing in last year’s midterm elections and corruption allegations. The FSC appears ready to take up the mantle, however, with lawmakers “pausing” crypto legislation talks until the political turmoil abates . “We will institutionalize STOs to diversify the securities issuance and distribution system. […] We will reorganize the entire system. That will let comprehensive financial investment businesses perform their original role of providing corporate finance and venture capital.” Financial Services Commission Chairman Kim Byung-hwan “Last year, our capital market experienced considerable difficulties. The growth potential of our companies weakened due to the contraction of the domestic economy and an export slowdown. The market showed considerably sluggishness compared to major countries due to global conflicts and domestic political events.” Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo The FSC chief appealed to lawmakers, the ruling People’s Power Party, and corporate stock market investors to work together toward a common goal. He urged: “Although we are starting this year in difficult circumstances, the government, the National Assembly, and corporate investors should all work together. As one, we can make 2025 the year when both the overseas and South Korean investors who have exited our market make their return.” Late last year, Jeong said it was time for regulators to remove obstacles to adoption and called for South Korea to “institutionalize” crypto .

Toncoin’s December performance and future TON is showing promise this December, with analysts suggesting it could break resistance at $7.198 and push toward $8. Investor confidence is rising as TON’s exchange supply has dropped from 1.91 million to 1.85 million, indicating lower selling pressure. Technically, TON has recovered well, with its RSI bouncing back to 47 from a low of 18 earlier in the month. Analysts point to TON’s rising social and market activity as a key driver of its bullish momentum. Topping engagement charts in December, this surge reflects increased interest within the crypto community. Such heightened activity often precedes strong price action, suggesting TON could maintain its upward trajectory into 2025. Conclusion LINK and TON show potential but face mixed prospects. Lunex Network, with its token buybacks and burns, actively reduces LNEX supply, boosting long-term value for investors. Its innovative features make it a standout choice. Lunex is worth exploring and can transform each investor’s crypto trading journey.

Here Are The Major Support And Resistances To Watch Out For,https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-to-0-000045/,"Technical analysis shows that Shiba Inu is currently at a critical juncture where it could either rebound to new multi-year highs or face declines to retest a few support levels. In light of this, a recent analysis on TradingView has highlighted crucial support and resistance levels that could dictate SHIB’s short-term movements. This analysis was made on the daily candlestick timeframe chart of SHIB against Tether (USDT), which reveals the potential for a substantial rally toward $0.000045 if key resistance levels are broken. Major Support And Resistance Levels For Shiba Inu According to the analysis, two significant resistance levels are important in SHIB’s path to the upside. The first is at $0.00003239 and represents an immediate hurdle that could attract sellers or trigger profit-taking. This is more revealing, considering it acted as resistance in December 2024. A decisive move above this level would signal bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Flag Pattern Says Crash Is Far From Over Despite Crash To $91,000 The second resistance level is at $0.00004563 and is considered a psychologically significant barrier that might test the strength of market optimism. This is because this price level serves as the peak of Shiba Inu’s price movement in early 2024. If the bulls were to complete a successful move above $0.00004563, it could signal a move that would push Shiba Inu to challenge its current all-time high. On the downside, there are also two critical support levels that could prevent further SHIB price declines. The first notable support is at $0.00001035. Shiba Inu rebounded quite a few times on the upper end of this support zone in 2024, with the most notable bounce taking place on August 5. Historically, this level has demonstrated strong buy interest, making it a potential floor for the current trend. However, if the price fails to hold above this critical support level, the situation could shift significantly. A break below $0.00001035 would likely diminish buyer confidence, paving the way for SHIB to test even lower levels of support. Technical Indicators And SHIB Trading Strategy The analysis notes that key indicators, such as the MACD and RSI, currently suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment for Shiba Inu. The MACD is flat with minimal momentum, while the RSI hovers near 40, slightly below the midpoint. These indicators, coupled with subdued trading volume, suggest that traders are awaiting a decisive breakout or break below the Shiba Inu price.

Conversely, a break below $0.00001035 could reinforce a bearish scenario. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00002239 and is up by 8% in the past 24 hours. According to a similar support level analysis by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the $0.0000215 to $0.0000193 support zone must hold in order for Shiba Inu to stay bullish.

This includes securities fraud and money laundering conspiracy, all brought upon him by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. Since the crypto firm plunged in 2022, Kwon has been accused of playing a major role in misleading investors. Do Kwon Misled Crypto Investors He failed to reveal the true state, stability, and security of the US dollar-pegged stablecoin TerraUSD. Instead, he informed unsuspecting investors that TerraUSD’s price slip could be addressed by an algorithm known as the “Terra Protocol.” To cover up for his deceit, Kwon allegedly allied with a high-frequency trading firm to inject millions into the ecosystem to sustain TerraUSD’s value artificially. Unfortunately, it did not turn out as he expected. TerraUSD crashed intensely and left the broader cryptocurrency industry in a huge deficit. In other words, it rippled over and led to the devaluation of Luna and widespread disruptions across the cryptocurrency market. Do Kwon’s Extradition Causes a Ruckus So far, the Terraform Labs executive has been faced with a series of legal proceedings. A few back and forth have occurred in the past few months concerning his extradition. While he committed fraud in South Korea, Kwon was arrested in Montenegro for traveling on a fake passport. Hence, many discussions have been held about his extradition. Last week, Montenegro’s Constitutional Court reportedly dismissed his appeal , citing some legal inconsistencies. For background, Do Kwon appealed his extradition to Montenegro and accused the court of procedural unfairness and violations of his rights. Montenegro Court Rules in Favour of US In the following days, Montenegro’s Justice Minister, Bojan Božović, signed off on Kwon’s extradition in favor of the US. The authorities have devoted time and resources to evaluating requests from both the United States and South Korea. As part of this review, factors like the seriousness of the crimes and the order of requests were considered. Do Kwon’s extradition add to the growing list of legal actions levied on top crypto leaders? Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is serving his 25-year jail term at a federal prison in Mendota, California. Though he pleaded “not guilty,” his conviction could lead to an extension of his prison sentence.

Both platforms have been making significant progress—Render by incorporating AI cryptocurrency technologies in decentralized GPU rendering and Injective by pioneering new DeFi scalability solutions. The rising price of Injective is a clear barometer of its increasing acceptance in finance-related applications. Yet, amidst these technological strides, Web3Bay shines as a high ROI cryptocurrency with vast potential for the long haul. Positioned to revolutionize Web3 commerce, Web3Bay melds decentralized e-commerce with groundbreaking payment options and user governance. Its strategy to integrate DeFi, NFTs, and cross-chain functionalities provides a utility that may surpass other contenders. For investors hunting for both profitability and practicality, Web3Bay’s blueprint for decentralized shopping distinguishes it as an exceptional choice. Web3Bay: The High ROI Crypto Transforming Web3 Commerce Web3Bay is laying the groundwork for a revolutionary shift in e-commerce by harmonizing blockchain technology with the simplicity of online shopping. Tailored for both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and mainstream consumers, it seeks to remove intermediaries, reduce fees, and secure transactions. Its versatile dual payment system, accepting both crypto and traditional methods like PayPal, broadens its appeal. For those keen on enriching their portfolio with a high ROI crypto, Web3Bay promises enduring value through a dynamic mix of functionality and forward-looking design. The active presale of Web3Bay’s 3BAY token aims to offer exponential returns for early investors. Launching at $0.003 per token, the price is set to climb by 15% in each successive stage, targeting $0.1959 in the final round. This pricing model has captured significant attention, with early participants potentially reaping returns exceeding 6430%. So far, the presale has sold over 56 million tokens and has raised more than $183,000, with the tokens now priced at $0.00345. As a governance token, 3BAY not only powers transactions but also empowers owners to influence the platform’s evolution, boosting its attractiveness as a high ROI crypto. Looking ahead, Web3Bay plans to incorporate NFTs, DeFi staking, and cross-chain functionalities. These enhancements aim to cement its status in the decentralized commerce arena. By marrying long-term utility with immediate financial upside, Web3Bay is gaining notice among both investors and crypto aficionados. Render Network: Leading AI Crypto Innovations Render Network is spearheading decentralized GPU rendering, offering a cost-effective platform for creators across film, gaming, and virtual reality sectors. By integrating AI cryptocurrency technologies, it efficiently utilizes dormant GPU power, making intricate rendering tasks more manageable and economical. Its Burn and Mint Equilibrium (BME) model ensures economic stability by balancing token supply with demand, facilitating predictable pricing for rendering and AI operations. The network is broadening its ecosystem, having recently partnered with major players like Stability AI and incorporating tools such as Blender’s Cycles. Users now benefit from the convenience of downloading completed projects directly to storage services like AWS. Priced at $6.88, the RNDR token reflects Render’s commitment to scalability and AI cryptocurrency applications, positioning it as a versatile choice for content creators and developers. Injective Price Grows with DeFi Expansion Injective is bolstering its position within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, providing a scalable layer-1 blockchain suited for derivatives, prediction markets, and broad financial services. Priced at $20.61, the Injective token reflects its rising adoption, fueled by innovations like the inEVM layer-2 solution, which integrates Ethereum-based applications seamlessly. The introduction of tokenized real-world assets and yield-generating stablecoins like USDM expands its user base. Recent developments, including the Helix Institutional platform, target financial entities by offering secure environments for trading derivatives, indices, and more. Injective’s strategy to blend DeFi with AI cryptocurrency ventures opens avenues for automated, intelligent trading systems, indicating strong potential for enduring growth. In Conclusion Render and Injective are blazing trails in blockchain innovation with their respective focuses on AI cryptocurrency and DeFi. Render’s commitment to decentralized GPU rendering and Injective’s scalable financial solutions underscore their respective strengths. However, Web3Bay offers a distinctive advantage with its practical applications in Web3 commerce. As a high ROI cryptocurrency , it merges potential profitability with sustainable growth through initiatives like its 3BAY token presale and forthcoming DeFi and NFT integrations. For those seeking utility and robust returns, Web3Bay’s approach to decentralized commerce presents it as the superior option over its peers.

SUI’s trading volume surged to $10.45 billion in December, marking its seventh consecutive all-time high and showcasing a strong trend in decentralised trading. Meanwhile, anticipation builds for the potential approval of a Solana ETF in 2025, signaling a pivotal moment for alternative cryptocurrency investment tools. Lastly, BlockDAG (BDAG) is redefining engagement with its TG Tap Miner game and X1 Miner app, which together boast 405K active users. Named the best crypto miner app, the X1 Miner enables users to earn BDAG effortlessly. This coin has already risen by 2240% and shows immense potential for growth in 2025. SUI Trading Volume Reaches New Heights in December SUI trading volume reached an impressive $10.45 billion in December, setting a new all-time high for the seventh consecutive month. This achievement reflects sustained activity in decentralised trading, bolstered by a 21% price increase during a challenging market period. With key resistance at $4.80 and support at $3.00, traders are closely monitoring potential breakout opportunities. This surge in SUI’s trading volume highlights a strong trend in investor engagement, with 77% of dYdX traders taking long positions. While technical indicators suggest short-term adjustments, the consistent growth in trading volume points to the potential for continued upward movement in SUI’s valuation. Insiders Anticipate Solana ETF Approval in 2025 The approval of a Solana ETF is widely anticipated for 2025, as industry experts, including ETF Store President Nate Geraci , cite potential regulatory shifts in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While applications for a Solana ETF were submitted earlier this year, no launch occurred in 2024. This delay positions 2025 as a pivotal year for the introduction of this financial product. The demand for crypto ETFs remains robust, evidenced by eight of the top ETF launches in 2024 being crypto-related. A Solana ETF could further establish its ecosystem, which has already seen increased activity and competitive trading volumes. Earning Made Easy with BlockDAG’s TG Tap Miner & X1 App BlockDAG combines engaging gameplay and accessible mobile mining to create a vibrant ecosystem for its users. The TG Tap Miner fosters community participation, with over 105,000 active players earning Tap Points through a fun and straightforward Telegram game. Players burst different types of balls, with rarer balls offering higher points, creating a competitive and rewarding experience. These points hold real value, as they can be converted into BDAG coins once the BlockDAG blockchain goes live. Taking a step beyond gaming, the BlockDAG X1 Miner app provides a simple way to earn BDAG coins daily. With over 300,000 active users using the app, it is widely regarded as the best crypto miner app—available on iOS and Android. The app allows users to mine up to 20 BDAG coins per day through a user-friendly interface. Its innovative Proof-of-Engagement algorithm rewards daily activity with features like a lightning button to boost mining rates. Unlike traditional mining setups requiring extensive hardware, the X1 Miner is lightweight and energy-efficient, making crypto mining accessible to anyone. Together, these apps create a seamless link between user activity and coin accumulation. The coins earned through these platforms represent a significant opportunity, as BDAG’s presale has raised $174.5 million. With a 2240% increase in value since its first batch, BDAG has grown from $0.001 to $0.0234, supported by a passionate community. Over 17.6 billion coins have been sold, making this the largest presale in the market. As the blockchain launch nears, the TG Tap Miner game and X1 Miner promote adoption and position BlockDAG as a leader in the decentralized movement. Final Thoughts As the SUI trading volume continues its record-breaking streak, its growing decentralised activity signals a promising upward trajectory for the token. The anticipated approval of the Solana ETF in 2025 could open new doors for alternative crypto investments, solidifying its market presence. However, BlockDAG shines brightest with its TG Tap Miner game on Telegram and X1 Miner app on iOS and Android, widely regarded as the best crypto mining app in the market. With BDAG’s value skyrocketing by 2240% and its presale already the largest in the market, these mining tools provide early access to the BDAG coin, which is poised for significant growth in 2025.

Its appeal fluctuates with market trends, but its growing popularity highlights the power of online communities to shape the crypto landscape.

The BabyDoge AI image generator allows users to create AI-generated BabyDoge characters, memes, and images without design experience; users can pay in BabyDoge to mint these images into NFTs. The project has donated over 81,000 pounds of dog food, holding an official world record for helping save dogs. BabyDogeSwap.com offers features like AMM, farms, token locker, burn portal, card, AI image generator, NFTs, and more. The coin’s focus on community and technology may attract interest in the current market cycle. CATSLAP: Challenging the market CATSLAP introduces the SLAP token as an aggressive entrant in the meme coin sector. Aiming to surpass established meme coins symbolized by frogs and dogs, SLAP seeks to capture attention with its unique approach. The platform encourages users, known as “Slappers,” to compete for high scores and elevate their country’s ranking on the “Slapometer.” This gamified aspect engages the community and adds a competitive edge. In the current market cycle, CATSLAP’s strategy to differentiate itself may appeal to those interested in emerging technologies within the crypto space. Conclusion While BabyDoge and SLAP may have less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale and triple utility features — governance, rewards, and staking — Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the battle against crypto villains and reach new heights together.

Table of Contents Rollblock: Revolutionizing the $450B gambling sector through crypto Analyzing Dogecoin as a buy for 2025 Rollblock going strong into 2025 Trump’s presidency has positioned the crypto market for a major rally at the close of 2024. One decision, however, gave Dogecoin an edge over other coins: the establishment of the D.O.G.E. department in collaboration with Elon Musk. This department ignited Dogecoin’s surge, making it one of the top performers of 2024. Despite this, analysts predict that Rollblock is set to outshine Dogecoin in 2025. Rollblock: Revolutionizing the $450B gambling sector through crypto Rollblock’s main goal is to bring blockchain technology into the $450 billion gambling industry, removing issues that have plagued the industry for decades. Instead of dealing with hacks, the misuse of funds and fixed bets, Rollblock uses blockchain’s transparency and security to enhance the gaming experience. The project is already succeeding, raising over $8 million during its presale. Unlike other Web3 casinos, Rollblock takes security and compliance to a whole other level. With a Gaming Anjouan and a SolidProof audit, Rollblock can assure maximum security for both regular players and investors. The GambleFi protocol offers more than 7,000 games from more than 10 gaming providers, as well as newly introduced sports betting on major markets such as soccer, golf, and MMA. RBLK powers Rollblock’s ecosystem. The GambleFi protocol will use up to 30% of its revenue to buy tokens from the open market. From those tokens, 40% will be used as rewards for staking, and the rest will be burned to make RBLK deflationary. Currently in its ninth presale stage, analysts predict a bright future for the token. Some say that once RBLK hits the market, early investors will see a 100x return from its current price of $0.044. This prediction is fueled by Rollblock’s focus on utility.

Despite this, the token has remained resilient, and many analysts maintain a bullish outlook for its future. Currently trading at $0.30930, Dogecoin has experienced a remarkable 245% gain in 2024, with hopes for further growth heading into the new year. A prominent market commentator, Ali Martinez, has consistently reiterated his ambitious price target for Dogecoin, forecasting a potential rally to as high as $18. While such a projection seems extraordinary, it’s grounded in the token’s previous price action. DOGE saw massive gains in the past, rallying 5,000% in 2017 and 12,000% in 2021. However, reactions from the market have been mixed, with critics arguing that an $18 price point would require a market capitalization of $2.65 trillion, far exceeding the market cap of Bitcoin. Nevertheless, even more conservative predictions of $4 still represent substantial upside and reflect the growing optimism for Dogecoin’s future. Rollblock going strong into 2025 Compared to Dogecoin, which lacks fundamental value and relies solely on capital gains, Rollblock is integrated into a robust ecosystem that leverages a market expected to reach $750 billion by 2028. This makes Rollblock a stronger contender for the 2025 altcoin season, offering far greater utility and significantly increasing the potential for a 100x return. With tokens currently priced at $0.044, this could be the perfect time to seize this opportunity before prices rise in the coming weeks.

Table of Contents Shiba Inu set for massive surge, analysts eye $0.000081 with rising burn rate Rexas Finance to yield 26,050% returns through real-world asset tokenization momentum Conclusion As 2024 comes to a close, there has been significant excitement in the crypto community. A leading analyst has made a bold prediction for 2025, suggesting that two tokens — Shiba Inu and a SHIB alternative focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization — could experience a surge of up to 26,050%. The new token in question is Rexas Finance , currently in its presale stage 11. Each token is priced at $0.175; in the next stage, the price will increase to $0.20. Shiba Inu set for massive surge, analysts eye $0.000081 with rising burn rate While trading at around $0.00002313, Shiba Inu still has room to push higher, and analysts have their hopes up. According to the analysis, SHIB can surge 234%, with a target price of $0.000081. This optimism comes with increased trading volume and a massive spike in the token’s burn rate. #ShibaInu Rebounds Strongly, Analysts Predict 234% Surge Toward $0.000081 $SHIB https://t.co/cvX6q1Mrmq — ChainAffairs ⚡ (@ChainAffairs) December 25, 2024 Rexas Finance to yield 26,050% returns through real-world asset tokenization momentum From the world of asset tokenization, Rexas Finance is carving out its niche in crypto. Currently, in Stage 11 of its presale, RXS is at $0.175, with the next stage bumping the price to $0.200. This presale has gained broad interest, already making $33,569,339 out of its $41 million goal. Platforms like Rexas Finance can fully meet the needs of investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolio further and enter the sphere of real estate or art. However, RWA tokenization has a market opportunity of one trillion dollars so that RXS could be at the confluence of this change. The exciting thing about RXS is the innovation and the huge potential gain. Since RXS is valued at $0.175 right now and historical data from other similar projects indicates that with rising adoption and changing market dynamics, projects of this nature could yield profits greater than 26050%, several experts believe this is a highly likely outcome. As blockchain technology breakthroughs continue to evolve, Rexas Finance is committed to helping improve liquidity and accessibility within the crypto ecosystem. If more and more investors understand that real-world assets can now be tokenized and tradable, demand for RXS may skyrocket. Additionally, RXS recently had an audit carried out by Certik and is now listed on leading trading platforms such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, making it increasingly visible to potential investors. Conclusion Analysts are coming out with predictions that SHIB could surge by 234% ROI and Rexas Finance a whooping 26,050%. It is clear that RXS investors stand to gain more than Shiba Inu. With its presale making alot of momentum, completing stages before its schedule, buying the presale at stage 11 could be a great addition to crypto portfolios.

They’ve evolved from internet inside jokes to legitimate financial opportunities, and the buzz? Oh, it’s louder than ever. Among the sea of LOL-worthy tokens, a few stand out as the best meme coins to buy today: BTFD Coin, Popcat, and Moo Deng. Trust me, you don’t want to sleep on these. Let’s start with the headliner, BTFD Coin . This one’s not just about memes — it’s about a lifestyle. As of now, BTFD Coin is in its 13th presale stage, priced at $0.000142.

Enter Popcat and Moo Deng, two coins that bring their own flavour to the mix. Stick around as we break down why these three projects are stealing the spotlight. BTFD Coin: Owning the Meme Coin Scene BTFD Coin isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a rallying cry. BTFD Coin’s P2E game, in its entirety, is live, enabling players to experience the game and receive rewards. The name stands for “Buy The Dip,” and it’s here to remind you to seize the moment in market downturns. But this isn’t your average meme coin — it’s packed with utility and rewards that make HODLing worth it.

Popcat: A Meme Coin That’s Purr-fectly Unique Next up, we have Popcat. If you’ve ever wasted hours on the viral Popcat game, you already know the drill. This token takes inspiration from the meme-famous feline with its signature wide-mouthed “pop.” But don’t let the silliness fool you — there’s more to this coin than adorable nostalgia. Popcat’s entire ecosystem revolves around fun. The developers have integrated mini-games and leaderboards into their platform, rewarding active players with tokens. Think of it as the Pokemon Go of crypto — except instead of catching Pikachu, you’re stacking Popcat tokens. What sets Popcat apart is its community.

The project’s roadmap includes partnerships with influencers and limited-edition NFT drops, keeping the excitement purring along. If you’re into playful vibes but still want a project with serious potential, Popcat is the one to watch. Moo Deng: The Bull Market’s New Bestie Lastly, let’s talk about Moo Deng, a meme coin with a name that’s a cheeky nod to farming and finance. This cow-themed crypto isn’t just about cute bovines; it’s also packed with features that make it a top-tier contender. Moo Deng integrates farming-inspired terminology with real-world decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. Users can “graze” their coins in liquidity pools, earning passive rewards while the tokenomics do their magic. The team behind Moo Deng knows how to milk (pun intended) the meme potential. From hilarious Twitter campaigns to viral TikToks, they’ve turned their marketing strategy into an art form. One thing that sets Moo Deng apart is its commitment to sustainability. The project donates a portion of its proceeds to environmental causes, making it a feel-good investment for eco-conscious crypto fans. Moo Deng proves that even in the world of memes, there’s room for meaningful impact. Final Words: Why These Three Are the Best Meme Coins to Buy Today When it comes to meme coins, it’s all about finding the balance between fun and functionality. BTFD Coin, with its robust rewards program and skyrocketing presale stats, is the clear leader. Popcat brings a playful twist with its gamified ecosystem, while Moo Deng combines humour with heart through its DeFi features and eco-friendly initiatives.

Leading the pack are meme favorites Pepe and DOGS, which continue to gain momentum with their strong community backing and robust market performance. Adding to the excitement is the low-cap gem Lightchain AI , a platform looking to merge blockchain and AI. With its Lightchain AI presale offering discounted tokens, the project is set to disrupt decentralized AI with unique features and scalability. These altcoins combine hype, utility, and early adoption potential, making them standout picks this month. Pepe and DOGS: Promising meme coins for January 2025 As of December 2024, both PEPE and DOGE have demonstrated significant growth, positioning them as promising meme coins for January 2025. PEPE coin Launched in April 2023, PEPE is an ERC-20 token inspired by the popular “Pepe the Frog” meme. Despite its humorous origins, PEPE has garnered substantial attention, reaching a market capitalization exceeding $11 billion by December 2024. This surge is attributed to its strong community support and viral appeal. Analysts predict that PEPE could experience further appreciation, potentially reaching $0.00002 in the first quarter of 2025 and $0.00005 by year’s end. DOGE Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has evolved into a widely recognized cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of approximately $23.3 billion as of November 2024. Its enduring popularity is largely due to its active community and endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. DOGE’s low transaction fees and fast processing times have also contributed to its adoption as a payment method by various businesses. Investment considerations While PEPE and DOGE have shown impressive growth, it’s important to recognize that meme coins are highly speculative and volatile. Their value is often driven by market sentiment and social media trends rather than fundamental utility. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before considering investments in these cryptocurrencies.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. 1Fuel’s vision sets a new standard, challenging the dominance of PEPE and XRP. Table of Contents Why 1Fuel is a game changer in the crypto world PEPE’s viral appeal XRP’s institutional use cases vs. 1Fuel’s vision Conclusion The story of meme coins in 2024 would not be complete without mentioning the viral rise of PEPE, which hit its all-time high in December. In other news, the institutional use cases Ripple (XRP) offers have maintained the demand for the coin as one of the best cryptocurrencies. However, there is a new sheriff in town, 1Fuel. The presale for 1Fuel is already gathering steam as analysts predict the new token to grow up to 100x in 2025. Investors are paying attention because of its multi-chain technology and attractive presale prices which position it among the best cryptocurrencies to buy. Why 1Fuel is a game changer in the crypto world 1FUEL aims to simplify cryptocurrency access by eliminating technical barriers and providing a wallet that automates complex processes, ensuring top-tier security and privacy. It is designed to enhance the cryptocurrency experience for both novice and experienced traders. 1FUEL’s one-click solution will allow users to select the coin they wish to buy or transact with, eliminating the need to hold multiple cryptocurrencies for transactions on different networks. The unique features, advanced security protocols, privacy enhancements, peer-to-peer exchange, and seamless integration with traditional financial systems make it a transformative and accessible wallet on the market. Interested investors can secure 1Fuel tokens via presale. PEPE’s viral appeal As a deflationary meme coin, PEPE was launched on Ethereum. By enacting a tax-free policy and being transparent about its lack of utility, PEPE appeals to the cryptocurrency community and maintains its meme coin simplicity. On November 13th, the 24-hour trade volume of PEPE reached a massive $15.69 billion. The institutional utility that 1Fuel is expected to provide is absent with PEPE. The project is based on strong utility and a distinct cross-chain transaction vision. It distinguishes itself from the meme currency craze with its creative privacy mixer, cold storage options, and P2P exchange, providing investors with actual benefits. XRP’s institutional use cases vs. 1Fuel’s vision Ripple, a blockchain-based digital payment project, has developed a network and protocol using the cryptocurrency XRP and the XRP Ledger. XRP’s institutional collaborations and contribution to the easing of cross-border payments have long been acknowledged. In 2025, Japanese banks are expected to adopt XRP, which would simplify cross-border payments and remittances while lowering consumer expenses. Approximately 80% of all Japanese institutions will adopt Ripple’s XRP for cross-border payments and remittances. However, a strong alternative is provided by 1Fuel’s multi-chain technology with staking incentives of up to 30% APR. Individual investors are given full ownership over their assets by 1Fuel, whereas XRP concentrates on financial institutions. 1Fuel’s smart contracts, which have been independently verified for security, will provide a smooth and reliable experience. Conclusion 1Fuel’s virality in 2025 has been predicted by analysts. This, coupled with its multi-chain vision, makes it among the best cryptocurrency to buy in 2025.

This development marks a collaboration between traditional financial institutions and decentralized blockchain ecosystems, offering users a stable and yield-bearing digital asset option. BlackRock BUIDL Fund Becomes Backing Asset for frxUSD The Frax community has passed FIP-418, a governance proposal that enables BlackRock’s United States Dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) as collateral for the frxUSD stablecoin. The vote which took six days garnered full support from the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). To this end, Frax Finance stated that BUIDL will function as the ‘custodian asset’ for the creation and creation of frxUSD. The Fund, however, invests in fairly liquid instruments including cash, U.S Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Frax founder Sam Kazemian said; “frxUSD is a bridge between the blockchain world with its openness and programmability and BlackRock’s prime treasury products with their credibility.” BlackRock’s BUIDL fund, which has as of now more than $648 million in AUM, expects to minimize counterparty risk while maximizing frxUSD holders’ yield opportunities. This decision is in line with the recent development in the stablecoin market that has seen the adoption of real-world asset (RWA) backing. Features of the Frax Finance’s frxUSD Stablecoin The newly launched frxUSD stablecoin is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 ratio which forms a good condition for price stability for the users. Frax Finance has integrated with Paxos in order to allow the conversion of frxUSD directly into fiat currency. Furthermore, the frxUSD holders shall receive distribution from the yield generated from the underlying assets within the tokenized fund. The initiative comes as part of the Frax Finance’s strategy to bring traditional finance products into the world of decentralized finance. The company also unveiled its intention to apply for access to the US Federal Reserve Master Account that would make frxUSD useful in the regulated markets. Growing Adoption of BUIDL-Backed Stablecoins Frax’s frxUSD is the newest in a line of stablecoins whose value is anchored to BlackRock’s BUIDL token. Ethena Labs has introduced its own asset-backed stablecoin, USDtb, in December 2024 to be backed by BUIDL. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $70 million and is intended to mitigate the volatility associated with synthetic dollar offerings in volatile market conditions. Similarly, in the decentralized exchange, Curve Finance, users have been able to mint Elixir’s deUSD stablecoin using BUIDL as collateral. Such advancements suggest that more tokenized funds are being used, particularly for the collateral of stablecoins such as BUIDL. On the same note, the introduction of frxUSD is timely given that the stablecoin market is in the process of transformation following shifts in the regulatory environment. The Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) regulation of the European Union came into force in its entirety on December 30, 2024, and has set new standards for stablecoin issuers. At the same time, BlackRock’s participation in the tokenized assets market proves that traditional financial institutions are gradually stepping in to connect Web3 and traditional finance. With $10.4 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock’s participation in the digital asset space inclusive of Bitcoin ETF record achievements is viewed as a step toward broader institutional acceptance of blockchain-based financial products.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA.

As Bitcoin approaches this key level, data shows that the top crypto has shown mixed signals across key market indicators, reflecting a subtle yet significant shift in investor sentiment. Particularly, analysts have identified specific patterns in funding rates and premium metrics, which serve as vital tools for interpreting market sentiment and predicting potential price movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decline Continues: Is $86,800 The Level To Watch? Bitcoin Current Funding Rates And What It Signals A notable observation by CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet highlights how funding rate movements reflect retail investor sentiment. According to Mignolet analysis, funding rates, which represent the cost of holding long or short positions in perpetual futures contracts, are exhibiting nuanced movements. Historically, during moments of strong resistance, funding rates tend to decline, signaling subdued sentiment and caution among investors. In late October 2024, when Bitcoin was approaching its all-time high, funding rates showed similar behavior, reflecting investor hesitation despite rising prices. However, the current scenario presents a contrasting sentiment. The analyst disclosed that while corrective price movements have emerged, investors are viewing these pullbacks as buying opportunities rather than reasons for fear or contraction. This subtle psychological difference could influence market dynamics significantly, potentially paving the way for sustained upward momentum. Mignolet wrote: Similar corrective candles have appeared, and from a technical perspective, this position might seem even more precarious. However, the sentiment is different. People now view this as an opportunity and believe it’s a reasonable position to buy. I believe this subtle difference in sentiment has the potential to produce very significant results. Coinbase Premium Indicator Reaches Historic Low Another key observation comes from the Coinbase Premium Indicator, a metric that measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase (a US-based exchange) and other global exchanges.

The pseudonymous trader known as Altcoin Sherpa says that he thinks the Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) will still go up, but he notes that he has some concerns. “I decided to lower my size on this one yesterday and am going to be patient with Fartcoin from here on out. I still think it’s an amazing meme and it’s going to go much higher but I would like to see it chop around more and make sure it doesn’t suffer the same fate as the other big memes that just had perpetual futures on Binance. Virtual and aixbt are promising but I feel like that’s a bit different than this. Going to watch but will consider adding more later.” Fartcoin is trading at $0.954 at time of writing. The 122nd-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 9% in the past 24 hours but up more than 3,750% since it launched in late October. Altcoin Sherpa also outlines his strategy for investing in artificial intelligence (AI) tokens. “Most all crypto AI is going to do pretty well this cycle; you just have to choose your horses.

Its data center sales are expected to rise from $110 billion to $200 billion by 2025, with dominance in AI technology. Nvidia was among the greatest Wall Street successes of 2024 as its market valued more than $2 trillion, which is $3.28 trillion at year-end. This made Nvidia the world’s second most valuable company, ranking after Apple with a value of nearly US$4 trillion. Nvidia largely deserves its exponential increase in demand because it’s playing a big role by driving AI-related technology through their chips. Nvidia’s AI dominance Nvidia’s market growth has been rapid, mainly driven by the rising demand for AI. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) have become essential for creating and running AI technologies, like ChatGPT. These GPUs are the core of AI models, making Nvidia’s hardware crucial to the AI revolution. With the rise of generative AI technologies, companies like Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and Cohere turned to Nvidia for its specialized chips to train and run complex AI models. This surge in demand for AI-powered technologies boosted Nvidia’s revenue and market value. From $1.2 trillion at the end of 2023, Nvidia’s market value more than doubled to $3.28 trillion by the end of 2024 with strong investors. This made Nvidia to have competitors like Microsoft and Google. Its stock price soared as investors sought to profit from the booming AI market. As Apple continued to lead in market value, approaching a $4 trillion valuation, driven by its planned AI improvements to boost iPhone sales. By the end of 2024, Microsoft was in third place with a $3.1 trillion market value, while Alphabet and Amazon were valued at about $2.3 trillion each. These major tech companies helped raise global stock indexes in 2024, with the S&P 500 up by 23.3% and the Nasdaq rising by 28.6%. Nvidia stands out from its competitors because of its combination of advanced hardware, software capabilities, and strong business partnerships. Other companies, like Amazon and Google, are making progress in AI, but they lack the complete ecosystem Nvidia has built. Nvidia’s data center sales are expected to rise significantly, from $110 billion in 2024 to $200 billion in 2025, while competitors like Broadcom and Marvell are projected to generate much smaller sales. Strategic investments and Acquisitions strengthen Nvidia However, Nvidia’s success in 2024 wasn’t just about responding to demand it also made strategic investments and acquisitions to solidify its leadership in AI technology. By 2024, Nvidia had allocated more than $1 billion in strategic investments to AI start-ups and corporate deals, growing 15 percent year over year. The company put money into 50 start-ups, including xAI (Elon Musk’s AI venture) and OpenAI and made a few key acquisitions, such as Run.ai, specializing in AI, as well as CoreWeave, an AI cloud computing provider. This involvement of Nvidia with AI is not just about investment in start-ups. CoreWeave was valued at $7 billion a year ago; it is now estimated at $35 billion. This, of course, was mainly because of the investment by Nvidia. Besides that, Nvidia bought companies like Deci, Shoreline.io, and Brev.dev. These purchased companies enhance Nvidia’s portfolio in medical technology, gaming, drones, and even humanoid robots. Nvidia’s growth was fueled not just by the high demand for GPUs, but also by its strong presence in various industries that rely on AI. By supporting AI start-ups through its Inception program and investing in new technologies, Nvidia became a key player in the AI revolution. However competitors like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, are working on creating their own alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs, which could hurt Nvidia’s business. The company also faces scrutiny from regulators in the U.S., Europe, and China. Despite the challenges and competitions, Nvidia stays on top with its AI and semiconductors, where it leverages hardware, software, and strategic partnerships.

Robert Kiyosaki Says Bitcoin Will Surge to $175K-$350K In 2025 In a post on X , Robert Kiyosaki reiterated his bullish outlook on Bitcoin, predicting that the cryptocurrency could climb to $175,000 or even $350,000 in 2025. He attributed this to the growing market demand and the enhanced usage of Bitcoin as an investment instrument. Bitcoin, the world’s largest crypto by market capitalization, surged 121% in an year and hit a record high of $108,135 in mid-December. As of the time of this writing, Bitcoin has made a sharp recovery: from the low of $94,280, the cryptocurrency has managed to rise above $96,900. The price increase represents a 2.72% gain within the last 24 hours, with trading volumes spiking by 87.07% to $45.93 billion. This rally shows a rising market sentiment as Bitcoin price nears the $97k mark and increasing the market capitalization near $2T. Similarly, in December, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author warned of an impending global economic depression, highlighting downturns in Europe, China, and the U.S. Robert Kiyosaki advised individuals to protect their wealth by investing in assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Therefore, he stressed the need for self-custody of Bitcoin and discouraged investors from focusing on the institutional investment products such as ETFs. Interestingly, Kiyosaki did not change his stand that Bitcoin price could reach $350,000 by 2025. Bitcoin Price Actions and Other Analysts’ Predictions Other market experts have echoed Robert Kiyosaki bullish sentiments for Bitcoin. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee has projected a target of $250,000 for Bitcoin in 2025, while Galaxy Digital anticipates the cryptocurrency could surpass $150,000 within the first half of the year. Analysts point to growing institutional interest and macroeconomic conditions as drivers for these projections. Additionally, an economist, Alex Krüger, suggests that a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve in 2025 could act as a catalyst for BTC price rally. He explains that reduced interest rates may create a risk-on environment, boosting assets like Bitcoin. Krüger also notes that a strong equities performance in March or April could further amplify Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Moreover, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, suggested that Bitcoin could reach $1 million in 2025. However, he cautioned that this would depend on the implementation of a U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which he estimated has less than a 10% chance of occurring. Market optimism remains high, fueled by Robert Kiyosaki’s predictions and prospect of enhanced adoption and regulatory clarity.

Canada appears to be taking notes as its own crypto industry seeks greater recognition. While Canadian politicians still sideline crypto discussions, the country’s crypto industry hopes this will shift with the federal election just months away. Canada’s crypto sector wants to emulate the US’s industry During campaigns, Donald Trump painted himself as the “crypto candidate,” claiming his administration would implement favorable policies for the industry. He even hinted at the possibility of a national Bitcoin reserve, currying favor with crypto supporters and investors. After his election victory, Trump made an effort to nominate digital asset supporters to his administration, and even more so, BTC prices have surged by more than 40%, crossing the $100,000 mark for the first time. In addition to Trump’s active role in boosting crypto’s influence, political contributions from key industry figures further amplified the movement. The crypto sector contributed about $135 million to support candidates, with Crypto’s Fairshake PAC and affiliated super-PACs receiving funding from giants like Coinbase, Ripple Labs, and Andreessen Horowitz. In Canada, however, crypto has yet to stir much controversy in the political arena, especially given the many restrictions on candidate donations. Nonetheless, Dean Skurka, CEO of WonderFi Technologies Inc., believes it is much easier to have crypto discussions now than a month ago. He expects the current momentum to continue even if crypto players can’t make that many donations to political groups or candidates. He added : We’re hopeful, but it hasn’t quite played out that way in Canada historically, and obviously in the US, this is the first time that it’s really become an election issue. Hopefully, the positive response that it has seen will be a signal to Canadian politicians to take it seriously. ~ Dean Skurka Not to mention, Canada’s crypto industry hopes that crypto will have a larger wave and impact on its elections, similar to the United States. Some of Canada’s crypto regulations have discouraged crypto exchanges from operating there Canada has been keen to institute policies that efficiently govern and manage the crypto industry. However, some crypto institutions felt they could not meet the regulatory requirements, shying away from the Canadian market. Binance , Bybit , dYdX, Paxos , and OKX are just some of the institutions that closed their operations in the country in 2023. The Canadian government is still adding regulations to the crypto space, but only time will tell whether or not those rules will be favorable for the crypto industry. The Crypto Asset Framework, for starters, will take effect in 2026. The framework obligates all digital asset brokers, exchanges, and ATM operators to reveal their full transaction data annually. It also requires service providers to disclose client-specific information, such as names, residential addresses, and taxpayer identification numbers. Moreover, according to Sophia Cote, head of public policy at Montreal-based crypto trading platform Shakepay Inc., the Canadian government is still looking for ways to regulate stablecoins.

This decline has triggered a wave of sell-offs by Dogecoin millionaires seeking to hedge their funds in the rapidly growing AI altcoin market. One notable beneficiary of this shift is PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an AI-powered altcoin making waves with its innovative approach to real estate investment. Market analysts are forecasting an impressive 45,309% ROI after the AI altcoin listing, which is anticipated to end soon. Dogecoin Price Activity Amid Whale Movements Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture attention as whales remain active despite the market’s current downtrend. On December 30, over 816 million DOGE were shuffled across two massive transactions, totaling a staggering $260 million. These whale activities have raised speculation about potential market shifts as the meme coin struggles to regain bullish momentum. The first transaction involved a transfer of 466.89 million DOGE ($150 million) to a new wallet, while another whale moved 350 million DOGE ($109.9 million) shortly after. Despite these shifts, Dogecoin’s price continues its descent, trading near $0.3103, a 2% drop in 24 hours. This price decline has not deterred optimistic analysts, who point to Dogecoin’s historical fractal patterns as a sign of potential explosive growth, with some predicting a climb to $23 this cycle. With its continued bearish movement, whales have moved significant amounts to RCO FInance (RCOF) as a hedging option. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Improving Real Estate Investments with AI and Blockchain PropiChain (PCHAIN) is more than just another altcoin; it represents a leap for the global real estate market. Designed as a decentralized platform, PropiChain uses Artificial Intelligence (AI), NFTs, and blockchain to address the inefficiencies and barriers in the real estate markets. PropiChain tokenizes physical real estate assets into digital NFTs, enabling secure and transparent ownership transfers. This approach eliminates the need for physical documents, third-party intermediaries, and cumbersome processes, streamlining property transactions. The NFT-based system also allows fractional ownership, making high-value properties accessible to a broader audience. Investors can seamlessly diversify their portfolios across multiple assets and trade ownership shares, bringing liquidity to a traditionally illiquid market. PropiChain stands out by integrating AI to simplify and enhance real estate investment strategies. Its AI-driven tools analyze market trends, predict property valuations, and provide actionable insights for investors. For example, the platform’s Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) use historical data and economic indicators to deliver real-time property valuations, ensuring accurate and transparent pricing. These features empower investors to make data-driven decisions, reducing risks and maximizing returns. PropiChain takes property investment further by integrating the metaverse into its ecosystem. Through the “Propiverse,” users can explore properties in immersive 3D environments, eliminating the need for physical site visits. This feature allows buyers to interact with properties more engagingly and in a more detailed way, providing a comprehensive understanding of their value. Sellers, in turn, can use the metaverse to enhance their marketing strategies, connecting with a global audience like never before. PropiChain transactions are recorded on a decentralized ledger called the “Title Contract,” which provides unparalleled transparency and security. This system eliminates risks such as fraud and corruption, common in traditional real estate markets. PropiChain significantly reduces transaction costs and accelerates the buying and selling process by removing intermediaries like brokers and government officials. Smart contracts, audited by BlockAudit, simplify operations by automating lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals, providing tamper-proof transactions. The PropiChain ecosystem is powered by its native altcoin, the PCHAIN AI altcoin, which is the foundation for all platform functionalities. AI altcoin holders gain access to features such as purchasing property NFTs, using AI-driven market tools, and participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Current PCHAIN AI Altcoin Presale The ongoing PropiChain (PCHAIN) presale is the perfect chance for Dogecoin millionaires to participate in the ecosystem at a low price. With AI altcoins priced at just $0.011 each during this presale phase, current investors anticipate a listing of $0.032, which translates to over 890% ROI. Currently listed on CoinMarketCap , experts anticipate that those who invest now could see returns as high as 450x once the PCHAIN AI altcoin is fully listed on trading platforms. For instance, if growth projections hold true, an investment of $100 could yield an astonishing return of approximately $450,000 by Q2 2025. As more investors flock to this promising altcoin amid Dogecoin’s decline, PropiChain stands out as an alternative and a revolutionary AI altcoin poised to reshape how we think about property ownership and investment. With the presale running fast, now is the perfect time to visit the platform and stake your position in the future of real estate with the PCHAIN AI altcoin.

XRP is reinventing global transactions with unmatched speed and affordability, while Solana pioneers in rapid blockchain transactions. In contrast, Web3Bay is redefining e-commerce by leveraging blockchain’s transparency and decentralization, focusing on user-centric benefits, making it a formidable rival to conventional platforms. The 3BAY token presale is a cornerstone of this transformation, promising substantial returns and vibrant community involvement, setting Web3Bay apart by focusing on tangible user benefits. Web3Bay’s 3BAY Token: A Promise of 6430% ROI Web3Bay is transforming e-commerce by marrying the convenience of cryptocurrencies with the spirit of blockchain’s community ethos. Picture a marketplace where the power lies in the hands of the users, free from intermediaries and exorbitant fees, positioning Web3Bay to disrupt giants like eBay. This platform is more than just a marketplace; it’s a movement rewarding users financially and functionally. At the core of this ecosystem is the 3BAY token, serving as both currency and a voice for the community. With tokens priced at just $0.00345 in the presale’s second stage, early adopters are on the brink of a potential windfall. Each presale stage sees a 15% price increase, peaking at $0.1959, offering an impressive potential return of 6000% for early participants. The presale has so raised more than $183,000, underlining its strength in the long-term. This opportunity is not just an investment but a chance to actively shape the platform’s governance and future growth. With cryptocurrency adoption for online purchases increasing by 34% in 2023, the user base has expanded to 580 million. Young adults, especially those aged 26-35, are keen on using crypto for their digital transactions, with 39% planning to boost their spending in this area. Web3Bay seamlessly integrates crypto payments with conventional methods, bridging user enthusiasm with practicality, thus offering a promising hybrid shopping and investment platform ensuring security, transparency, and data ownership. XRP’s Potential Leap to $50 by 2025: Grounded Optimism? XRP, Ripple’s flagship, is under scrutiny with forecasts suggesting a surge to $50 by 2025, thanks to its utility in enhancing global payments efficiently and affordably. With capabilities like processing transactions in seconds and handling thousands per second at minimal costs, XRP is a favorite among financial bodies worldwide. Nevertheless, XRP’s trajectory is heavily influenced by its legal entanglements with the SEC, which has dampened its potential. Yet, a hopeful outlook persists that regulatory clarity, possibly under a pro-crypto SEC chair in 2025, could catalyze substantial institutional adoption and boost XRP’s valuation. Can Solana Hit the $1,000 Mark by 2030? Known for its swift transaction capabilities and low costs, Solana has made significant strides in the blockchain arena with its unique Proof-of-History consensus. Despite market fluctuations, Solana’s role in DeFi has seen its Total Value Locked grow significantly, signaling strong adoption and trust in its technology. Analysts are pondering whether SOL can achieve the ambitious $1,000 target by 2030. Factors like continued technological advancements, ecosystem expansion, and increasing blockchain integration will play crucial roles. Despite challenges in scalability and market competition, Solana’s active developer community and strategic innovations could thrust it towards this significant milestone. Concluding Insights As blockchain technology permeates various sectors, entities like XRP, Solana, and Web3Bay provide fresh insights into its capabilities. XRP excels in enhancing global payments, Solana in scaling DeFi solutions, and Web3Bay in innovating e-commerce through a user-driven approach. Together, they exemplify the transformative potential of blockchain, merging technical innovation with practical applications to reshape how industries operate.

This price weakness in the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has caused concern among investors and market enthusiasts. Despite its robust ecosystem and dominance in decentralized applications, the Ethereum price struggles have left the door open for competing altcoins to capture the spotlight. This downturn has fueled skepticism about ETH’s near-term performance and sparked a renewed interest in an emerging AI altcoin, PCHAIN . According to leading market analysts, this AI altcoin is poised to outrun Dogecoin as we head into the 2025 bull run. The token’s unique value proposition and growing real-world utility in the $600 trillion global real estate market has set it miles ahead of other digital assets. In a market heavily influenced by speculative trends and shifting sentiment, this emerging AI altcoin stands out by addressing critical gaps that Dogecoin and similar tokens often fail to fill. Analysts project the token will capitalize on the Ethereum price slump and capture the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The Ethereum Price Struggles The Ethereum price has faced downward pressure recently due to macroeconomic factors, network congestion, and competition from rival blockchains. While the ETH blockchain remains the dominant ecosystem for decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), its high transaction fees and scalability challenges have left room for alternatives to gain traction. Investors have grown increasingly concerned about the Ethereum price movement. This perceived weakness in the Ethereum price has led to a rotation of capital into an emerging AI altcoin, PCHAIN, which promises faster growth potential than the legendary Dogecoin. The Rise of the AI Altcoin, PCHAIN, Amid Ethereum Price Struggles The AI altcoin sparking interest amid the Ethereum price struggle is PCHAIN, an RWA altcoin and the utility token of PropiChain, a blockchain-powered real estate platform. Unlike Dogecoin, which relies on its community and celebrity endorsements for value, this altcoin uses cutting-edge technology and a unique value proposition to carve out a niche in the market. This AI altcoin combines the appeal of memecoins with tangible utility, making it a hybrid asset that bridges the gap between speculation and functionality. As an RWA altcoin, PCHAIN bridges the gap between the traditional real estate market and the blockchain. Why PCHAIN Could Outpace Dogecoin Leading market analysts project this AI altcoin will outrun Dogecoin based on its solid fundamentals and value proposition in the multi-trillion-dollar global real estate market. Initially created as a joke, Dogecoin has defied expectations to become one of the most well-known crypto assets. However, over-reliance on market hype leaves it vulnerable to market cycles. While Dogecoin has benefited from the support of notable figures like Elon Musk, this reliance on external factors could hinder its long-term sustainability. In contrast, PCHAIN’s focus on utility and innovation provides a more robust foundation for growth. The token’s integration with the world’s number one asset class, real estate, makes it an attractive option for investors seeking assets with intrinsic value, especially now that the Ethereum price is witnessing downward pressure. PropiChain, PCHAIN’s parent project, is primed to take at least 1% of the $600 trillion global real estate market. The platform is on course to become a $6 trillion ecosystem, potentially driving the value of the AI altcoin even higher. Additionally, the RWA tokenization market is projected to hit $16 trillion , with real estate the biggest beneficiary. As an RWA altcoin that bridges the gap between the real estate market and the blockchain, the demand for PCHAIN is set to witness an unprecedented surge beyond the 2021 legendary Dogecoin rally of over 12,000%. PropiChain Powering the Future of Global Real Estate With Cutting-Edge Technologies PropiChain is transforming the global real estate market by integrating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), smart contracts, the Metaverse, and Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. Using smart contracts, PCHAIN optimizes key processes such as property leasing and lease renewals, significantly simplifying property management operations. These automated workflows eliminate the need for intermediaries, lower transaction costs, and enhance transparency and efficiency in managing real estate assets. Real estate investors can take advantage of 24/7 support from AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots. These assistants and chatbots provide personalized guidance at every stage of the real estate investment process, ensuring a seamless and informed user experience. Moreover, the platform’s advanced AI-driven predictive algorithms deliver detailed market insights and future trend analysis, enabling investors to identify and capitalize on profitable opportunities in the real estate sector. Another standout feature of PropiChain is its integration of the Metaverse to facilitate immersive virtual property tours. Using virtual reality and 3D visualization, investors can explore properties from anywhere in the world, eliminating the need for physical site visits and offering an engaging, interactive way to evaluate potential investments. Additionally, PropiChain is also revolutionizing the investment landscape through property tokenization. The platform enables fractional ownership by converting real estate assets into digital tokens, allowing investors with smaller budgets to invest in high-value properties. This innovation opens real estate investment opportunities to a broader audience, democratizing access to lucrative markets. Conclusion The Ethereum price weakness has created an opportunity for investors to explore new horizons in the crypto space, and the AI altcoin, PCHAIN, presents the ideal opportunity for massive gains. With analysts projecting it will outrun Dogecoin, PCHAIN’s growth potential could become one of the best in the crypto space. While the Ethereum price struggles, analysts strongly project that your $1000 investment in the ongoing PCHAIN presale would yield a massive $236,000 profit within Q1 of 2025. The first presale round raised over $1.3 million, and the ongoing second presale round has crossed the $590,000 mark. Join the PCHAIN presale now to enjoy unprecedented returns on your investment. After the second presale round, the token price will increase from $0.011 to $0.023. PCHAIN is listed on CoinMarketCap , reiterating the Project’s readiness to do bigger things in the crypto space. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security firm, audited the Project’s smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities.

Showing signs of strength daily, the asset looks poised for a leg up but is currently facing a resistance line. Last month’s correction seriously reduced XRP’s price, as it lost roughly 10% of its valuation in three weeks. This led to a small bearish phase, and the crypto ended the year 2024 on a weak note. However, it started the new year on a recovery note and is now showing signs of strength on the daily chart. The asset is still facing small hurdles under $0.25, but we may see a breakup in the coming days. The latest positive actions suggest a potential bullish move for XRP following a noticeable increase in the buying volume level since yesterday. Although the bullish signal is yet to be confirmed until the price breaks out of the previous monthly high. A continuous rejection at the falling resistance line could subject the market to a brief consolidation phase before rallying hard. Otherwise, it may roll back to a nearby support before activating bullish at full speed. That said, the overall market structure remains bullish on a macro level. The price must dip below the $0.4 level before we can start to consider a bearish move. XRP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that has reacted positively to the latest surge across the market, it is facing resistance at $0.25. Scaling through this resistance could bring a full recovery to $2.9 with a potential breakout to $3.3. If the price plunges through $2.15 to the holding $1.9 support, the lower level to consider for a breakdown is $1.63, followed by $1.28.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 02:10:00

The pressure is currently low but we can expect a big price movement when volume increases. The past week’s trading was uninteresting for many traders as Avax entered a serious but brief consolidation mode due to volatility shrink. But things have turned out a bit positive amid rising volume in the past 48 hours, and as we can see on the daily chart, the crypto is slowly climbing back with a surge to the $40 level – which is currently rejected. This surge came after mounting support above the $33 level during last month’s correction. Looking at the market from a technical standpoint, the correction appears to have ended on the daily chart. A full recovery to the top should bring the bulls back in control. But for now, the demand level appears low. If the asset loses grip again, Avax may resume correction until it finds a solid ground. Currently, it shows no signs of weakness on a daily scale as the bulls commit strongly to the price. While volume is slowly flowing back in the market, a break above the previous high could feature a bigger upward rally in the coming days. Avax’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The $42 level is an immediate resistance to watch in the latest surge. An increase above this level could bring more recovery to the $48.1 and $55.5 levels with a potential break out. Aside from the $33.6 level that acted as support during last month’s drops, Avax currently trades above $39. If the mentioned support level fails to hold, lower levels to consider for drops would be $29.9 and $23.9.

The market is flooded with options, but few projects stand out with the substance to match their hype. Qubetics, Ethereum, and Monero represent a trio of innovative projects redefining what blockchain technology can achieve, both now and in the future. Qubetics ($TICS) is taking real-world asset tokenization to new heights, allowing access to investments that were previously out of reach for many. Ethereum’s powerful ecosystem continues to serve as the backbone for decentralised applications, while Monero leads the charge in privacy-focused transactions. These three cryptos bring unique strengths that make them the best cryptos to invest in for long term success. Qubetics Reshapes Investments Through Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is pushing boundaries in the world of blockchain by turning physical and digital assets into tokenized investments. Imagine owning a share of a valuable property, a rare commodity, or even intellectual property—all via fractional ownership enabled by Qubetics’ tokenization technology. This groundbreaking approach democratises access to wealth-building opportunities that were once reserved for the elite. For example, consider a small business owner looking to invest in real estate but lacking the capital to purchase a property outright. Through Qubetics’ marketplace, they can buy a fraction of a commercial property and earn proportional returns. Similarly, a creative entrepreneur could tokenize their intellectual property, like music or patents, and trade them efficiently on the platform. Beyond access, Qubetics also addresses long-standing challenges like limited liquidity and market inefficiency. Its secondary market simplifies the trading process, ensuring that investors can buy, sell, and manage assets with ease. The Qubetics presale has already captured attention, with over 395 million $TICS tokens sold, raising $8.5 million and counting. The current presale stage offers $TICS tokens at $0.0414, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. Each presale stage lasts seven days, creating urgency for those looking to join early. If you’re curious about the potential of real-world asset tokenization, watch this video to learn how Qubetics is reshaping the investment landscape. Ethereum Powers Innovation in Decentralised Applications Ethereum is widely regarded as the foundation of decentralised finance and smart contract technology. From DeFi platforms to NFTs and beyond, its ecosystem supports thousands of applications that have revolutionised the blockchain space. With its unparalleled versatility, Ethereum remains a cornerstone for long-term investors seeking reliable and innovative projects. One of Ethereum’s standout features is its adaptability. Developers can build and deploy decentralised applications (DApps) across a range of industries, from gaming to finance. Imagine a digital marketplace where you can purchase items with cryptocurrency or a financial application that lets you earn interest without needing a traditional bank. These are just a few of the many possibilities Ethereum enables. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0 further enhances its appeal. With the move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ethereum has become more energy-efficient, scalable, and secure. These upgrades not only strengthen its network but also make it an attractive option for developers and users alike. Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand, proving its resilience and adaptability in an ever-changing market. For investors looking for a blockchain that supports endless innovation and real-world applications, Ethereum remains a strong contender for the best cryptos to invest in for long term growth. Monero Pioneers Privacy in Blockchain Transactions Monero has carved a niche for itself as the go-to cryptocurrency for privacy. Unlike most other cryptos, Monero’s blockchain is designed to be untraceable, providing users with unparalleled confidentiality in their transactions. This makes it a favourite among individuals and businesses who value financial privacy in an increasingly transparent digital world. For example, consider an individual who wants to send funds without exposing sensitive personal details, or a business that needs to safeguard its transaction history from competitors. Monero’s technology ensures that all transactions are private by default, using advanced cryptographic techniques to obscure sender and receiver identities as well as transaction amounts. Despite its focus on privacy, Monero is also highly practical. Its network processes transactions quickly and securely, making it a viable option for everyday use. Moreover, its community-driven development ensures that the blockchain remains robust and secure over time. Monero’s dedication to privacy and usability has earned it a loyal following, positioning it as a top choice for those who prioritise confidentiality.

This marks Aave’s new all-time high (ATH) in net deposits since 2021. Aave Hits $35 Billion In Net Deposits – What’s Ahead? In an announcement made yesterday, the leading DeFi lending protocol Aave revealed that it had reached a new ATH in net deposits since 2021. With $35 billion in net deposits, Aave has solidified its position as the largest DeFi protocol at the time of writing. Related Reading: AAVE Price Soars 26% In A Single Week — Will Rising FOMO Lead To A Bust? To put this into perspective, Aave’s net deposits were $5.5 billion at the end of 2022, increasing to $10 billion by the close of 2023. The current figure of $35 billion at the end of 2024 reflects an astounding surge of over 535% in just two years. The year 2024 proved to be transformative for Aave, with the protocol experiencing heightened user adoption across multiple blockchains. Throughout the year, Aave added support for five new markets, including BNB Chain, Scroll, ZKsync Era, and Ether.fi. According to the announcement, Aave is poised to expand further by potentially adding support for six additional blockchains. These include Mantle, Sonic, Linea, BOB, Spider Chain, and Aptos, pending approval by the Aave decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). For the uninitiated, a DAO is a blockchain-based entity governed by smart contracts and decentralized voting, where decisions are made collectively by token holders without any central authority. DAOs enable transparent, democratic management of protocols in a trustless environment. In addition to expanding to new blockchain markets, Aave launched its latest protocol upgrade, Aave V4. This upgrade introduces significant improvements, such as enhanced modularity, reduced governance overhead, optimized capital efficiency, and innovative features like the Hub and Spoke liquidity architecture. Moreover, Aave’s decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin GHO is set to witness increased adoption. Plans are in motion to expand its cross-chain support across various smart contract platforms, including Coinbase’s Base and Avalanche (AVAX), by early 2025. DeFi To Make A Comeback In 2025? Following Donald Trump’s victory in the November 2024 U.S. presidential election, DeFi tokens have experienced a significant surge, driven by optimism surrounding favorable cryptocurrency regulations under the new administration. Related Reading: Chainlink And AAVE Surge After Trump’s Crypto Project Invests In Both Additionally, DeFi protocols have become increasingly secure, fostering greater user trust and leading to higher deposit volumes and a larger total value locked (TVL). A recent report highlighted that DeFi exploits decreased by 40% in 2024 compared to 2023, signaling improved security across the ecosystem. In addition, Q1 2025 is expected to be bullish for Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and home to the largest DeFi ecosystem. A positive price action for ETH is expected to benefit major DeFi tokens such as AAVE, Curve (CRV), Compound (COMP), and others. That said, the Solana (SOL) DeFi ecosystem is rapidly gaining traction and catching up with Ethereum in terms of adoption. This development could propel Solana-based DeFi tokens, such as Orca (ORCA) and Raydium (RAY), to reach new highs. At press time, ETH is trading at $3,461, up 4% in the past 24 hours.

This allows Binance to expand services, including securities distribution and EMI issuance, in Brazil. The approval underscores Binance’s strong commitment to compliance with AML and CFT standards. Binance crypto exchange in terms of trading volume has obtained approval from the Central Bank of Brazil to buy Sim; Paul, a licensed broker-dealer. Binance is the first crypto exchange that has received a broker-dealer license in Brazil, the biggest country in Latin America in population and economy. A Big Win for Binance This is Binance’ s 21st regulatory milestone across the globe. Thus, the company continues on its way toward attaining a standard of highest compliance. In Brazil, beyond just trading in cryptocurrencies, the exchange can provide distribution of securities and issue EMI. Binance, henceforth, is set to be an integral part of the regional financial sector. Binance CEO Richard Teng called this approval a major milestone for the company. He said, “ Brazil is home to a vibrant and forward-thinking crypto community. This approval reflects our commitment to compliance and security, and we’re excited to bring innovative financial services to users in Brazil.” Brazil is one of the leaders in the adoption of cryptocurrency worldwide and ranks 10th globally, according to Chainalysis. The country’s Central Bank and IRS have set out clear guidelines for the crypto industry, but have also been looking for public and business input on how to create fair and effective regulations. In 2024, for the first time in history, Brazil authorized its first-ever spot Solana ETF, shows digital assets into traditional finance. The same year, the Brazil crypto transactions market crossed the record $90.3 billion barrier, that shows how much Brazil really matters to global crypto space. Binance Expands to Latin America This approval made Binance’s position in Latin America. The company has already gained regulatory approval in countries like Argentina, and its new license in Brazil supports its mission to promote responsible crypto adoption worldwide. Internationally, Binance holds licenses in critical markets such as Dubai, France, El Salvador, and Japan. These licenses show that Binance is committed to regulatory compliance. Binance’s compliance program follows global standards, including strong anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) measures. It features thorough identity verification processes (KYC and KYB) and a top-tier Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) unit. This unit helps law enforcement investigate crypto-related crimes and improve security across the ecosystem. With its broker-dealer license and the acquisition of Sim;paul, Binance is to play a much bigger role in Brazil’s crypto industry. As Brazil continues embracing crypto with clear rules and innovation, Binance has the best opportunities for advanced financial solutions and supporting the country’s growing digital economy. With its new broker-dealer license, Binance can now provide advanced financial services and support Brazil’s growing use of digital assets. Bionance is yet to hire 1000 compliance staff and contractors, ensuring crypto ecosystem’s growth sufficiently and responsibly globally.

For certain transactions, such as NFT sales, costs have exceeded $165, leaving many users frustrated by the high expenses. What’s Causing the Spike? The primary driver behind the rise in gas fees is network congestion. Ethereum currently has 151,751 pending transactions and a network utilization rate of 64.53%. This congestion creates intense competition among users to have their transactions processed, leading to higher fees. The spike in activity is tied to a range of use cases, including NFT sales, DeFi protocols, and general user transactions. As more people engage with Ethereum’s ecosystem, the strain on the network grows, pushing gas prices upward. Solutions in Progress Ethereum developers are actively working on solutions to improve scalability and reduce gas fees: 1. Layer 2 Solutions: Technologies like Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups allow transactions to be processed off-chain, reducing congestion on the mainnet. 2. EIP-4844 Update: A planned network upgrade, EIP-4844 aims to further optimize Ethereum’s efficiency and scalability. What Can Users Do Now? In the short term, users can adopt strategies to minimize costs: – Transact During Off-Peak Times: Gas fees tend to drop during periods of lower network activity. – Utilize Layer 2 Networks: Platforms like Arbitrum and Optimism offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to the Ethereum mainnet. Ethereum Gas Fee Surge: Causes and Solutions – about 80 gwei The recent rise in @ethereum gas fees is directly tied to network congestion and increased user activity.

This collaboration offers users yield-bearing opportunities and bridging decentralized finance (DeFi) with institutional financial systems. Recently, the newly launched stablecoin by Frax Finance will be collateralized with the BlackRock’s United States Dollar Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, colloquially called BUIDL. It is a step toward to integrating traditional financial products into the decentralized ecosystem, aligning with the growing trend of stablecoin tokenization backed by real-world assets. Collateralization by BlackRock’s BUIDL Fund The Frax community passed governance proposal FIP-418 , which allowed BUIDL to be collateralized for the frxUSD stablecoin. BUIDL, tokenized by BlackRock, now has over $648 million in assets under management and invests mostly in liquid instruments such as U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. The tokenized fund is dedicated to decreasing counterparty risks and maximizing yields on frxUSD for holders, taking them to sources of financial opportunity in traditional markets of finance. Features of frxUSD The frxUSD stablecoin will maintain a peg at 1:1 against the U.S. dollar. Yield-bearing opportunities for the holder are also possible through the benefits accrued to the holder by virtue of the underlying assets within the BUIDL fund. Another thing, Paxos has been partnered with Frax Finance in a manner where it enables direct conversion of the stablecoin, frxUSD, into fiat currency for easy redemption into the stablecoin of the U.S. dollars. Frax also intends to apply for access to the U.S. Federal Reserve Master Account, so frxUSD can be used in regulated markets, which will further increase its legitimacy and usability. BUIDL-Backed Stablecoins Frax’s frxUSD falls under a more recent trend of RWA backings in the stablecoin market. Other stablecoin projects include Ethena Labs, with BUIDL-backed stablecoins such as USDtb, whose emphasis is placed on reducing volatility within synthetic dollar issuance. Decentralized exchange Curve Finance now accepts BUIDL as collateral to mint the Elixir’s deUSD stablecoin, thus a growing tendency for tokenized funds to back stablecoins. Accelerating this trend have seen changes in the regulatory environment. For example, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation of the European Union, adopted in December 2024, sets new standards for the issuers of stablecoins. This pushes towards greater transparency and accountability in the market. BlackRock in Digital Assets BlackRock is growing in the digital asset space. The asset management giant now oversees more than $10.4 trillion in assets worldwide. This company’s entrance into the tokenized asset market and its support for stablecoins such as frxUSD and USDtb point to a gradual institutional embrace of blockchain-based financial products. The strategic move into the crypto space by BlackRock, through achievements such as Bitcoin ETFs, signals a greater shift toward integration of traditional finance with the new digital asset economy. More traditional financial institutions will find themselves in the space, and it is in such an environment that stablecoins, such as frxUSD, supported by real-world assets.

If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,420 level and the trend line. The first major support sits near the $3,400 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $3,310 swing low to the $3,502 high.

This highlights the growing interest from traders and investors as they seek to capitalize on the consolidation breakout, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Data from POPCAT’s spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have experienced an outflow of a significant $1.7 million worth of POPCAT. This indicates that long-term holders have withdrawn these notable meme coins following the breakout, suggesting potential upside momentum and increased buying pressure. Source: Coinglass At press time, the major liquidation levels are at $0.826 on the lower side and $0.908 on the upper side, with traders over-leveraged at these levels, according to Coinglass data. If the market sentiment remains unchanged and the price rises to the $0.908 level, nearly $5.52 million worth of short positions will be liquidated. Conversely, if the sentiment shifts and price drops to the $0.826 level, nearly $4.42 million worth of long positions will be liquidated.",News|Meme Coins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-03 03:43:14

In light of this revival, crypto expert Miles Deutscher has revealed his forecasts for 2025, providing perspectives on the upcoming paths of key cryptocurrencies and market tendencies. Bitcoin Price Potential To Hit $1 Million Deutscher begins by addressing the current state of the Bitcoin dominance chart, suggesting that it has likely peaked for this cycle. He anticipates that while BTC may experience periods of outperformance, it will ultimately stabilize around 61.5% dominance. In addition, Deutscher has made bold predictions regarding Bitcoin’s future price, asserting that it will reach $140,000 by the end of 2025. While he has seen more aggressive forecasts predicting prices over $200,000, he considers these estimates “overly ambitious” within the next 12 months. However, the expert expresses a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s potential to evolve into a $1 million asset, indicating his confidence in the cryptocurrency’s future growth. Related Reading: XRP Price Targets $13 After Completing Highest Candle Body Close In History – Details On the other hand, Deutscher highlights that the most significant developments in the altcoin market will not materialize until the second half of the year. The expert acknowledges the macroeconomic challenges currently facing the market, which he believes have slightly delayed the overall cycle. Interestingly, he notes the historical trend of altcoin seasonality, which typically favors the first half of the year, suggesting the possibility of two distinct upward runs in the crypto market. Cryptocurrency ETFs Set To Flourish In 2025 In 2025, Deutscher further expects artificial intelligence (AI) to remain a dominant narrative within crypto. He believes that the integration of AI will lead to a major transformation in decentralized finance (DeFi) and on-chain trading, particularly through the development of AI agents. He forecasts that several AI-driven projects will achieve market capitalizations exceeding $1 billion, signifying a shift towards more sophisticated financial instruments. Deutscher also emphasizes the importance of Real World Assets (RWA), predicting they will gain significant traction throughout the year. He notes that asset tokenization is still in its infancy, with influential figures like Donald Trump and Larry Fink likely to champion this sector, fostering growth and innovation. Predictions regarding DeFi utility coins are particularly noteworthy. Deutscher anticipates that major protocols, such as Chainlink (LINK), Aave (AAVE), Enjin (ENA), and Uniswap (UNI), will outperform their peers as the market recognizes the value of income-generating utility protocols. The expert argues that the market has yet to fully appreciate the potential impact of the Trump administration on DeFi, suggesting that a favorable regulatory environment will benefit these protocols significantly. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Confirms Breakout: Analyst Sets New Price Targets Another key prediction from Deutscher involves the potential approval of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and XRP. The analyst believes that a new regulatory regime will facilitate a more accommodating environment for cryptocurrency ETFs in 2025. In a broader context, Deutscher foresees a strategic Bitcoin reserve being established in the United States, paving the way for other nations to follow suit. This shift towards sovereign and institutional adoption of Bitcoin is expected to gain momentum, further legitimizing the market’s leading cryptocurrency as a viable asset class. As of now, BTC is priced at $97,570, showing an increase of almost 4% over the past 24 hours.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 04:19:23

According to reports, the dispute stems from the collapsed crypto lending platform’s allegations of “preferential transfers” and “disparaging remarks” by FTX officers that allegedly accelerated the lending platform’s financial collapse. Key Legal Arguments and Court Ruling The legal dispute revolves around the adequacy of Celsius’ initial proofs of claim and the procedural correctness of its amended filings. Initially, the collapsed crypto lending platform had sought $2 billion in damages , claiming that FTX officers made unsubstantiated and damaging statements about the lending platform’s financial condition. Celsius filed a Notice of Appeal against Judge Dorsey’s ruling for FTX debtor Elected for Appeal to be heard in the District Court Facts1) Celsius Filed a $2bn claim for disparagement before the bar date 2) Celsius filed a $444m amended claim for a preference claim after bar… pic.twitter.com/evaBzMi5Lt — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) January 1, 2025 Although this claim was later revised, focusing instead on “preferential transfers” totaling $444 million, however, in its original filing, Celsius included only a brief reference to investigating possible preference claims, which the court ruled “insufficient” to support its allegations. When the collapsed crypto lending platform later filed an amended claim focusing on the $444 million in alleged preferential transfers, Judge Dorsey found the amendment “procedurally improper.” The court highlighted four key issues with Celsius’ amended claim: it was filed after the bar date without permission, lacked sufficient connection to the original claim, did not justify the delay, and would cause undue prejudice to FTX’s ongoing reorganization process. These factors collectively led to the dismissal of the collapsed crypto lending platform’ revised claim. In response, Celsius argued that its initial filing should have been sufficient to signal its intentions regarding avoidance claims. Furthermore, the company stated that its filings complied with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and served as protective measures to ensure the claims remained valid during the legal proceedings. Next Steps in the Legal Battle The notice of appeal, filed by Celsius litigation administrator Mohsin Meghji on December 31, signals the company’s intention to continue pursuing its claims against FTX . The appeals will focus on whether Celsius’ original proofs of claim met the necessary legal standards and whether its amended filings should have been accepted despite the procedural delays. FTX creditors, represented by activist Sunil Kavuri, have raised concerns about the legitimacy of Celsius’ claims, noting the significant delay in filing the amended claims and the lack of clear procedural adherence. It is worth noting that the outcome of this appeal will have significant implications for both bankrupt entities and their respective creditors, as hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake.

Deaton outlined the historical context of Ripple’s emergence, the strategic choices made by the company, and the broader implications of the case for the cryptocurrency industry. Ripple’s Early Vision and Strategic Decisions Deaton highlighted the circumstances surrounding Ripple’s inception in 2012, emphasizing that stablecoins did not exist at the time, and the cross-border payments market was an untapped opportunity. Ripple’s founders created XRP to streamline global financial transactions. While there was an internal debate about focusing on smart contracts versus payments, Ripple chose the latter, recognizing the significant potential in the cross-border payments sector . The global payments market has since grown exponentially. Deaton referenced data showing that in 2022, cross-border payment flows exceeded $150 trillion and are projected to reach $250 trillion by 2027. Ripple’s early focus on this market positioned it as a leader in leveraging blockchain technology for international remittances. The SEC’s Legal Action and Its Impact In December 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit alleging that XRP constituted an unregistered security. Deaton criticized the broad nature of the SEC’s claims, which he described as overreaching and unprecedented. He argued that the case disrupted Ripple’s business and significantly affected its partnerships. For instance, Coinbase, which had listed XRP in 2019 and promoted its use alongside USDC for efficient international payments, delisted XRP following the lawsuit. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 MoneyGram , a key Ripple partner, stopped using XRP and transitioned to XLM, a cryptocurrency created by Ripple co-founder Jed McCaleb. Deaton questioned whether there was a meaningful legal distinction between XRP and XLM under securities law, suggesting that the SEC’s approach appeared inconsistent. Allegations of Conflicts of Interest Deaton also scrutinized the conduct of former SEC officials involved in the lawsuit. He pointed to potential conflicts of interest, noting that some individuals who advocated for the case later worked with competitors of Ripple and XRP. These associations, he argued, raised concerns about the impartiality and motives behind the enforcement action. Broader Implications for the Crypto Industry The Ripple case exemplifies the challenges faced by cryptocurrency projects navigating regulatory uncertainty in the United States. Deaton underscored the lack of clear guidelines for differentiating securities from non-securities, a gap that has stifled innovation and driven companies to seek clarity abroad. While Deaton openly acknowledges that he is not a “Ripple fanboy” and has been critical of the company’s practices, he maintains that the SEC’s lawsuit represents an overreach with far-reaching consequences. He urged industry stakeholders to recognize the broader issues at play, including the need for regulatory transparency and fairness. John Deaton’s critique of the SEC’s case against Ripple underscores the complexity of regulating emerging technologies in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. The case has reshaped Ripple’s trajectory and highlighted the urgent need for coherent regulatory frameworks to ensure innovation can thrive while protecting investors. As the cryptocurrency market continues to grow, the outcome of this case could set important precedents for the future of digital assets.

The appeal , which is currently awaiting review in the District Court, comes as part of Celsius’ ongoing litigation efforts to recover funds from FTX. Celsius’ Initial Claim According to court documents, Celsius had originally filed a claim of up to $2 billion in damages from FTX. The claim alleged that FTX officials had made “unsubstantiated and disparaging statements” against Celsius, which undermined its reputation and accelerated its collapse in 2022. However, before the bar date in July 2024, the company amended the claim to $444 million, stating that the new claim would focus on “preferential transfers” that allegedly gave some creditors an advantage over others. In December, Judge John Dorsey, the magistrate in charge of the case, rejected both claims. He pointed out the procedural flaws in Celsius’ filings, stating that they lacked sufficient evidence to maintain the preference claims. Judge Dorsey criticized Celsius’ amended filing, stating that it was improper since the company did not seek court approval. He also noted that the content of the amended claims was not remotely related to the original claims and could obstruct FTX’s restructuring plans. On December 31, Celsius’ litigation administrator, Mohsin Meghji, officially filed a notice of appeal disputing Judge Dorsey’s ruling. In the filing, Celsius argued that its initial fillings met all the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code despite lacking a detailed explanation. The company intends to continue pursuing the case to recover the disputed claim. Celsius’ Repayment Efforts Despite its legal woes, Celsius has made considerable progress to repay its creditors. In August 2024, the company began its repayment effort, distributing $2.5 billion in crypto and cash to more than 250,000 creditors in over 165 countries. In a more recent court filing in November, Celsius announced plans to disburse an additional $127 million to creditors. The company pointed out that this second payout will be made from funds recovered through its litigation efforts.

The move is a major scaleback of its once ambitious expansion plans as the company confronts rising competition in the AI industry and economic pressures. According to a recent Bloomberg report , the AI company is leaving its 11,000 sq ft space in Frasers Tower for something smaller. The shift comes as other tech firms, including ByteDance Ltd., are growing overseas while China’s economy sags. The downsizing comes at a time when Singapore’s prime office market is adjusting to lower demand from major Chinese companies and fluctuating vacancy rates. SenseTime’s move is part of a wider restructuring to concentrate on generative AI services, for which it received regulatory approval last year. Startups, such as Moonshot AI and Zhipu, are challenging the company’s repositioning. SenseTime is facing threats from larger companies and a new generation of well-funded startups The company was also one of China’s earliest to secure approval for generative AI services last year. While it is pivoting back to the newer field, it’ll be competing with larger companies and a new generation of well-funded startups, remarked a person familiar with the company’s strategies. SenseTime’s adjustment also follows the company losing Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as a financial backer in 2023 and past controversies, including a 2019 U.S. blacklisting over alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang, which SenseTime has denied. However, these challenges have prevented access to vital capital and U.S. technology that could help the company operate and expand globally. SenseTime representatives in Singapore did not comment on these developments.

Altcoin Daily analyzes the crypto market insight of Dan Morehead, founder of Pantera Capital, who emphasizes the massive potential of altcoins in driving this next wave of adoption. With Bitcoin potentially hitting $85,000 soon and 2025 shaping up as a landmark year, institutions are focusing on innovative altcoins with real-world utility. Driving the crypto trend of corrections and rise, Morehead predicts Bitcoin could reach $117,000 by August 2025, driven by its historical halving patterns. Halving, which occurs every four years, reduces miners’ rewards and tightens Bitcoin’s supply , often leading to price surges. Following the April 2024 halving, which cut rewards to 3.125 BTC, Morehead notes Bitcoin typically starts rising 400 days before a halving and peaks 480 days after. Based on this trend, he expects Bitcoin to follow suit, climbing from its current price of $95,484 to $117,000, marking a 22.53% increase by mid-2025. Let’s dive into the top 10 altcoins gaining institutional attention. Top Altcoins Institutions Are Watching HyperLiquid (HYPE) HyperLiquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) designed for perpetual futures, featuring a fully on-chain order book. Backed by strategic partnerships and recently added to Grayscale’s top 20 crypto list, it’s becoming a go-to for institutional investors. DeFiLlama reports over $12 billion in December trading volume, earning $8.6 million in revenue. Ethena (ENA) Ethena’s USDE stablecoin is backed by hedged positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering yield through staking. Its alignment with pro-stablecoin regulations makes it a standout pick for institutions. ENA is currently trading at $1.07 with a rise of 16% this week. Virtuals Protocol (VIRUAL) Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2 network, Virtuals Protocol enables the creation of tokenized AI agents. These agents can perform autonomous tasks, making the platform a frontrunner in merging AI with blockchain . Jupiter (JUP) The top DEX aggregator on Solana, Jupiter boasts the highest total value locked (TVL) on the network. With Solana gaining traction, Jupiter is poised to capitalize on this momentum . Gito (GTO) A liquid staking protocol on Solana, Gito has shown impressive growth, generating over $550 million in revenue in 2024. Its strong financial metrics make it a favorite among institutions. Toncoin (TON) Backed by Telegram, Toncoin is gaining attention for its ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps) and its utility as a payment solution within Telegram’s vast user base. Solana (SOL) Known for its scalability and low transaction costs, Solana continues to attract institutional interest , especially with its growing ecosystem of dApps and DeFi projects. Ondo Protocol (ONDO) A lesser-known gem, Ondo Protocol focuses on financial derivatives, offering unique tools for hedging and trading. Its innovative approach is catching the eye of institutional players. Chainlink (LINK) A veteran in the space, Chainlink remains a top choice for its role in powering DeFi and smart contracts through reliable Oracle services. All these coins add a bullish momentum for altcoins. Bitcoin dominance at 47% shows that altcoins are gaining momentum. Trump’s win is more favorable for altcoins than Bitcoin as Bitcoin’s performance may drop if regulations are delayed. Hence a perfect scene for altcoins season is nearing. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The leak suggests that the platform may launch in the United States despite not having approvals in some states. X filed for money transmitter licenses for X Payments LLC to operate across the United States and has secured licensing in 39 states so far. A suspected screenshot of the latest code reveals, “X Money is not available in your state.” This has led some observers and analysts, including Alex Finn, a famous American entrepreneur, to theorize that X Money will likely launch without approvals from all 50 states. 🚨BREAKING: X PAYMENTS LAUNCHING IMMINENTLY New X code has just shipped that reveals X Payments will launch WITHOUT approval from all 50 states Meaning X Payments could launch TODAY Creators could start earning WAY MORE money immediately States it will be available: 1.… pic.twitter.com/8Wej1XrIQK — Alex Finn (@AlexFinnX) January 2, 2025 The platform may support cryptocurrency due to Elon Musk’s openness to digital assets X Money will help support content creators on the X platform by allowing users to tip them. There are also talks that the payment system will support cryptocurrency, as Elon Musk, the owner of the X platform, has accepted Bitcoin and Dogecoin payments in his other businesses. One of the X users responded to Finn’s post, saying that creators are about to make money without stringent regulations. “No permission needed, no holding back, just pure opportunity.” In a self-hosted X space, Finn explained that X payments will support cryptocurrency somehow, clarifying that it will be the fastest way to move currency. He said that crypto will probably be a good amount of rails for X payments. The speculations around the X payment launch are happening against the backdrop of X CEO Linda Yaccarino confirming on the social media platform in a December 31 X post that X Money would launch in 2025. However, Aaron Perris, one of the MacRumors researchers, has not authentically confirmed the leaked source code. X is silent on whether the X launch is happening today or not. X Money launch may happen in phases as some states await approvals Suppose the launch rumors and speculations are true; the initial launch will happen in 39 states. These are the states where it has already obtained money transmitter licenses. As Finn stated, some states, including Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, wouldn’t be immediately supported. Elon Musk has been a staunch supporter of Bitcoin, and DOGE and industry analysts hold that memecoin could be among the two cryptos supported by the platform. The speculations may be true as Tesla, a vehicle manufacturing firm that Elon Musk owns, supports DOGE payments while holding Bitcoin worth $1.1 billion.

Musk’s Tesla Fire (MUSKFIRE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFIRE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk’s Tesla Fire can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk’s Tesla Fire could become the next viral memecoin. Musk’s Tesla Fire launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk’s Tesla Fire on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk’s Tesla Fire by entering its contract address – HuyxQUYCfoVCBpNoS1LxC1kbQuajYW9EqEcKoJqtdS1C – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFIRE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 05:10:00

Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a 3.5% rise in the past 24 hours, trading around $96,600, following a volatile end to 2024. After hitting an all-time high of $108,268 in mid-December, Bitcoin dropped to $92,000. With the new year comes optimism, as analysts predict strong growth driven by macroeconomic trends and potential regulatory changes under the upcoming Trump administration. With new SEC chair Altcoins ETFs, regulations by enforcement ends the market tends to react positively this year. Let’s see how things will be in 2025 for Bitcoin and Altcoins. Analyst shares a 2025 Crypto Outlook Tony Edward from Thinking Crypto offers an optimistic view, forecasting a strong year for Bitcoin and altcoins, with Bitcoin potentially hitting new all-time highs. As Trump officially joins this month the bullish sentiments are already high as congress is expected to pass crypto regulations in his first 100 days of taking charge. Edward draws comparisons to past years, such as 2013, 2017, and 2021, when the crypto market saw significant growth after Bitcoin’s halving events . We are also getting more adoption news this year by big bulls, hence Bitcoin’s potential to reach between $150,000 and $200,000 if Trump manages to approve his Bitcoin Reserve plan. As more institutional investors continue to show interest in crypto, Bitcoin’s dominance is expected to grow , which could push the overall market cap to $9 trillion or more. One of the driving forces behind this bullish outlook is the possibility of lower interest rates and increased liquidity from the Federal Reserve. This could result in more capital flowing into the crypto market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Altcoins Institutions Are Betting On in 2025 , Altcoins are Best Choice to Divert Portfolio In terms of altcoins, Ethereum and Chainlink are expected to perform well, with Ethereum’s continued dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts . Edward also sees AI-related cryptocurrencies might also see higher adoptions, as artificial intelligence continues to make waves in the tech world. However, Edward advises caution for investors. He emphasizes the importance of having a clear exit strategy and being mindful of taxes when making profits. As the crypto market enters 2025, there are plenty of opportunities, but staying informed and prepared will be key to navigating the year’s potential gains. With simple ETF push this year, crypto saw an impressive change, and Bitcoin doubled in price, and if it gets full political support in the US, targets like $140K will not be far. With regulatory clarity this year crypto will see a new era in the digital assets space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

These crypto players aim to invite new investors into the crypto loop and maintain those already in it. Moreover, ETFs will likely expand beyond Bitcoin and Ether in 2025 as companies like VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital have already filed for spot Solana ETFs. Canary Capital has also requested approval to launch a Litecoin ETF, an XRP ETF, and an HBAR ETF. Solana ETFs listing odds in 2025 are rising On December 27, ETF Store president Nate Geraci disclosed that Volatility Shares had submitted its S-1 registration statement for its futures-based Solana ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Before then, VanEck, 21 Shares had already requested approval to list their spot Solana ETFs in June and Canary Capital in October. With all these companies having sent in their applications, multiple analysts, including Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research, are projecting that Solana ETFs are a must-have in 2025 . On January 1, Polymarket, a cryptocurrency prediction platform, assessed the likelihood of a US Solana ETF being listed in 2025 at 77% , a probability Sigel described as “underpriced.” By January 2, however, the platform’s projected odds had elevated to 84%. Aside from Solana ETFs, 2025 may also be a promising year for XRP ETFs. Canary Capital and Bitwise filed their S-1 registration statements for spot XRP ETFs in October. Therefore, Bloomberg Intelligence’s Athanasios Psarofagis believes 2025 will be the year of “crypto everything,” as crypto leaders are expected to further integrate cryptocurrency strategies into ETFs. He also noted that since the ETF evolution theme is still “hot” and raving at the moment, more issuers will step up. More convertibles will emerge in 2025 The REX ETF plans to focus primarily on convertible bonds from Bitcoin-holding corporations. On Friday, December 27, REX Shares filed an application to launch the REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF. Under normal market conditions, the ETF will commit at least 80% of its net assets, including borrowed capital, to these bonds. Any changes to this policy require a 60-day notice to shareholders. Additionally, asset management firm Strive wants to introduce a new derivatives-focused fund. The fund will deal with swaps and options to gain exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy and other similarly aligned firms.

This optimism is further dispplayed by a recent transfer of $55 million from the fee account of the meme coin platform Pump.fun to the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, which catalyzed a remarkable 10% rebound in Solana's price. As investors and analysts alike closely monitor developments in the cryptocurrency landscape, the broader market sentiment is becoming increasingly positive regarding the possibility of a US spot Solana ETF being listed in 2025. This anticipated event could significantly impact Solana's market dynamics, attracting more institutional investment and further solidifying its position within the competitive cryptocurrency ecosystem. The excitement surrounding these developments is palpable among traders and enthusiasts alike. Solana ETF Prospects in 2025: Betting Markets Signal Bullish Sentiment Amid Industry Optimism The odds of a Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund (ETF) gaining regulatory approval in the United States by 2025 are higher than expected, according to Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of research. Sigel’s perspective, shared via a post on X, aligns with growing optimism in the cryptocurrency industry about increased ETF listings under a new political administration. On Jan. 1, the cryptocurrency prediction platform Polymarket projected a 77% chance of a Solana ETF listing in the US in 2025. By Jan. 2, this figure had risen to 84%, reflecting bullish sentiment among bettors. Prediction markets like Polymarket allow users to trade contracts based on specific events, with pricing influenced by real-time market expectations. Sigel described the platform’s initial forecast as “underpriced,” indicating his belief that the odds of a Solana ETF approval are even more favorable. The optimism surrounding Solana ETFs is partly attributed to President-elect Donald Trump’s vocal support for cryptocurrencies. Following his election victory in November, Trump pledged to make the United States “the world’s crypto capital,” a stance that has sparked hopes for a more lenient regulatory environment for digital assets. Industry insiders view Trump’s pro-crypto agenda as a potential catalyst for the approval of various cryptocurrency ETFs currently under review by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Analysts believe that more than half a dozen proposed crypto ETFs could see the green light in the coming years. Despite the positive outlook, Solana ETFs face significant regulatory hurdles. In June, VanEck and 21Shares filed applications with the SEC to list spot Solana ETFs. However, the SEC has expressed concerns over whether SOL qualifies as a security rather than a commodity, complicating its inclusion in ETFs. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) ETFs—currently the only cryptocurrency ETFs permitted on US exchanges—utilize a specialized ”grantor trust” structure designed for single-commodity funds. For Solana ETFs to succeed, issuers must ensure that their structures align with regulatory expectations. The cryptocurrency industry is betting on 2025 as a breakthrough year for the market. Polymarket’s rising odds for Solana ETF approval are mirrored by broader market optimism. Bettors anticipate not only new ETF listings but also a resurgence in cryptocurrency prices, with predictions of Bitcoin and Ethereum reaching all-time highs. Sigel has been vocal about his confidence in Solana’s prospects, stating in November that the odds of regulatory approval for Solana ETFs are “overwhelmingly high.” This sentiment reflects a growing belief that Trump’s administration will be more accommodating to cryptocurrency innovations, potentially paving the way for a wave of new ETFs. The Role of Betting Markets Betting platforms like Polymarket have gained credibility for their accuracy in predicting significant events, including Trump’s election victory and the Republican Party’s control of Congress. In December alone, Polymarket recorded nearly $2 billion in trading volume, showcasing its influence as a barometer of market sentiment. During the US elections, betting platforms outperformed traditional polling methods, signaling their effectiveness in capturing real-time market expectations. With a proven track record, Polymarket and similar platforms are now key indicators of sentiment in the cryptocurrency sector. The interplay between regulatory challenges, market sentiment, and political developments sets the stage for an eventful 2025 for cryptocurrency ETFs. As optimism builds around Trump’s pro-crypto policies and the evolving regulatory landscape, the potential approval of Solana ETFs could mark a significant milestone for the industry. While uncertainties remain, the convergence of favorable market conditions and political support has positioned Solana as a strong contender in the race for ETF listings. For now, betting markets and industry leaders alike are bullish, signaling that 2025 could be a transformative year for cryptocurrency adoption and innovation. Solana Price Surges 10% Amid $55 Million Kraken Transfer and Growing ETF Anticipation Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) has made a significant recovery in the cryptocurrency market, with its price surging approximately 10% to over $200 following a substantial $55 million transfer from Pump.fun’s fee account to the Kraken exchange. The price movement has rekindled bullish sentiments in the market, with analysts and traders speculating on the potential for further gains in the near term. Solana’s price rebounded sharply on Jan. 1 after a brief dip to $189 at 5:00 PM UTC. The recovery began an hour later, around 6:00 PM UTC, as Pump.fun, a meme coin launch platform, transferred $55 million worth of SOL to Kraken. Solscan data reveals that Pump.fun made two significant deposits to Kraken that day: The first transfer of $22.8 million occurred at 4:37 PM UTC. The second transfer, worth $32.7 million, followed at 5:45 PM UTC. These transfers appeared to alleviate selling pressure, providing a catalyst for Solana’s rebound. Pump.fun’s activity has been a significant factor in Solana’s price dynamics throughout 2024. According to Lookonchain data, the platform has deposited over $303 million worth of SOL to Kraken and sold more than $41 million worth of SOL tokens to date. While Pump.fun’s actions provided an immediate boost to Solana’s price, the larger ETF narrative is shaping the asset’s future. With market anticipation for the approval of a spot Solana ETF in the United State growing steadily, industry experts predict a potential rally to $400 if approval is granted. The possibility of an ETF approval has not been fully priced into Solana’s market value, according to Alejo Pinto, founder of the Solana layer-2 network Lumio. Pinto commented, “Since it is still very uncertain, an ETF approval in the US would have a positive price impact on Solana since the probability is low and therefore not yet priced in.” Several prominent asset management firms, including VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital, are actively pursuing approval for a spot Solana ETF. Key deadlines are approaching, with Grayscale’s application due for a decision by January 23 and preliminary decisions for other applicants expected by Jan. 25. A precedent for Solana ETFs has already been set in global markets. Brazil approved its first Solana ETF on Aug. 7, 2024, signaling increasing institutional interest in the altcoin.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-03 05:30:00

This decline has led to growing concerns among investors about whether the market is entering a prolonged cooling-off period or if this correction signifies the end of the bull cycle. However, historically, such phases have been common in Bitcoin’s market cycles, often followed by periods of renewed upward momentum. Analysts are now turning to key on-chain metrics to provide insights into the current phase and its implications for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Market Alert: Bitcoin’s $81K Support Zone Could Decide Its Next Big Move Key On-Chain Indicators Reflect Market Sentiment A CryptoQuant analyst known as Avocado Onchain recently shared an analysis suggesting that the market remains within a broader bull cycle. Using on-chain indicators such as the Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), Miner Position Index (MPI), and funding rates, the analyst outlined the current state of Bitcoin. According to the report, the SOPR (7-day Simple Moving Average) remains above 1 but is trending downward, indicating reduced profit margins for sellers. This metric often acts as an early signal of market sentiment shifts, with drops below 1 historically triggering rebounds as selling pressure subsides. The report further analyzed Bitcoin’s Miner Position Index (MPI). This index measures miner behavior, particularly their tendency to sell Bitcoin in anticipation of significant market events, such as halving cycles or peak price levels. The current trend in MPI shows no significant outflows from miners to exchanges, suggesting that large mining operations are holding their Bitcoin reserves. Avocado added that this indicates confidence in the long-term value of Bitcoin, even as short-term volatility persists. However, periodic sell-offs to cover operational costs are still expected. Another important indicator highlighted by the CryptoQuant analyst is total network fees, measured using a 7-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This metric reflects transaction activity and overall on-chain engagement. Avocado disclosed that the recent decline in network fees suggests reduced trading activity and a temporary cooling-off phase in market participation. Historically, such periods of lower transaction activity have preceded periods of renewed bullish momentum, especially when other indicators align with this trend. Bitcoin Funding Rates And Investor Sentiment Funding rates, another significant indicator in the analysis, have shown a downward trend. Funding rates represent the cost of holding long or short positions in Bitcoin futures contracts and are often used to gauge market sentiment. During bull cycles, sharp drops in funding rates have often been followed by rebounds, as bearish sentiment reaches an extreme point and buyers return to the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Eyes Fresh Gains: Can Bulls Break Through? The analyst emphasized that while current on-chain data suggests a cooling-off phase rather than the end of the bull cycle, short-term price movements remain uncertain. Historically, funding rate drops have served as buying opportunities for long-term investors, particularly during periods of heightened market pessimism.

Cardano (ADA) also turned in an attractive performance in Q4 after overcoming critical barriers. But Rollblock (RBLK) is the top-rated crypto in the presale market, and has seen a huge cash influx, ending 2024 with over $7.9 million raised. Let’s examine why RBLK is tipped for mammoth returns in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK): the top-rated crypto in GambleFi This Ethereum-based iGaming protocol is causing a cosmic storm in the gambling industry with incredible revenue-sharing benefits. The Rollblock crypto casino features over 1,000+ games and a wide selection of live sports events. Further, it supports advanced AI betting strategies, copy-betting players initiatives, and a fair gaming process through clean on-chain records of player activity, offering a superior gaming experience. That has made this emerging iGaming powerhouse the go-to crypto betting platform for Gen Z betters, boosting its gaming revenues. Here’s the real deal: A portion of the revenue collected on the platform’s casino floor is paid as a weekly dividend to players and investors. RBLK token holders staking their tokens to provide liquidity can earn up to 30% APY! Chip in Rollblock’s growth potential . The iGaming market is forecast to surpass $700 billion by 2028. Capturing even a tiny share of this treasure chest of cash will be sufficient to drive RBLK’s market cap into the billions, pumping the token price to lofty heights. Analysts anticipate the RBLK token price will increase 880% in presale, followed by a potential 50x explosion on launch! Cardano (ADA) might smash $3 in 2025 ADA was a top-rated crypto asset in the Smart Contracts sector before the 2022 bear market pushed Cardano into dejection. Fortunately, ADA awoke in Q4, rising from a low of $0.27 in August to $1.32 in December for a nearly 5x return. Recently, ADA has been experiencing a pullback, falling over 25% monthly to hover in the $0.85 zone. As of press time, ADA was sitting on a mere 42% yearly return, but the Cardano community sentiment was quite bullish at 90%. CoinCodex data shows ADA could witness a 400% blast to enter the $4.4 zone. XRP news of RLUSD sparks optimism XRP is the top-rated crypto for cross-border settlements. The altcoin broke out in November, rising from the doldrums in the $0.3 region to hit $2.9 in December, pulling an impressive 9.6x yield. Bullish XRP news of the Ripple-SEC win, RLUSD launch, and plans to introduce smart contracts into the Ripple Ledger are some of the bullish factors that restored investors’ confidence in the XRP prospect. Per CoinCodex, XRP could reach $4.4 in March, returning over 100% in the coming months. An 87% bullish community sentiment adds to the positive outlook. ADA and XRP take a back seat to RBLK Though XRP and ADA are predicted to deliver solid returns in 2025, their prospects pale before RBLK’s potential.

The XRP price has been consolidating above the $1.96 mark, a key resistance level from 2021. This price point formed in April and May 2021, and it was recently broken in early December 2024. Since then, XRP has remained above this level, showing strength and stability. This is a positive sign for XRP holders, as it means a market shift from the volatility seen in previous years when prices often broke above resistance levels, only to fall quickly afterward. Potential for Another High in XRP’s Price Looking ahead, there is a potential for XRP to form another high. This could be the fifth wave in an Elliott Wave pattern, hinting at a possible continuation of the bullish trend. While it’s not guaranteed, the expectation is for at least one more high in this cycle. Triangle Pattern Forming on Smaller Timeframe On the smaller time frame, XRP appears to be forming a triangle pattern. Triangles typically evolve into ABCDE structures, with each wave in the triangle representing higher lows and lower highs. If this pattern holds, XRP could see another high before completing the triangle. Key Support and Resistance Levels For continued bullish momentum, XRP must maintain its position above the 20th December low, around $0.96. A break below this support level could signal a bearish trend, but the larger bullish thesis would remain intact. On the micro scale, XRP might experience one more push upwards, potentially touching new resistance levels. The immediate target areas to watch are between $2.42 and $2.45, followed by higher resistance at $2.54, $2.61, and $2.62.

This uptrend is driven mainly by optimism due to historical trends, Trump’s pro-crypto regulations and the Fed’s relatively dovish stance. This CoinGape article outlines the top five Bitcoin price predictions for 2025. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 24 minutes ago. Top 5 Bitcoin Price Predictions For 2025 As noted in a previous CoinGape article, we predicted that Bitcoin’s price could peak on October 6, 2025 , based on Mars-Vesta’s 3.9-year cycle. In this article, we will outline the top five Bitcoin price predictions from popular investors and founders in the crypto space. Fundstrat Global Advisors’ Tom Lee: $250,000 Tom Lee noted in a CNBC interview, “We expect something around $250,000 for Bitcoin in 2025.” Lee adds, “We see Bitcoin closer to $250K by Thanksgiving next year (2025).” In a November Wealthion interview , Lee said, “Bitcoin could hit $250K next year.” The optimism surrounding this prediction comes from the fact that the Fed is cutting interest rates in the growth phase of the business cycle, providing the much-needed oomph to push markets higher. Bitwise: $200,000 Asset manager Bitwise is also optimistic about cryptocurrencies in 2025, with their BTC price target of $200,000 by the end of 2025. The head of research at Bitwise Invest, Ryan Rasmussen , posted “Bitwise’s 10 Predictions for 2025,” which included a “BTC to $200K,” among other forecasts such as Bitcoin ETF inflows hitting a new high in 2025, Coinbase stock price hitting $700 and so on. Standard Chartered: $250,000 Like Tom Lee and other popular analysts, Standard Chartered’s target for 2025 is $250,000. QCP Capital While QCP Capital did not provide exact figures, their outlook for Q1, 2025 is cautiously optimistic. The company’s Telegram post added, “Despite a lackluster finish, BTC will close the year up 120%, outperforming globally stocks and gold. For 2025, while optimism surrounds crypto-friendly regulations post-Trump inauguration, we think the key catalyst may come in January as institutions readjust asset allocations.” Other Notable Figures’ Bitcoin Price Prediction For 2025 Anthony Pompliano, Co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital said, “Bitcoin could hit $250,000 by 2025.” His target is driven by increasing demand for BTC due to its fixed 21 million supply. American venture capitalist and billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya noted that Bitcoin could reach an all-time high of $500,000 by October 2025. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Forecasting Short-term BTC Targets The one-day Bitcoin chart forecasts an ongoing trend, where BTC tanks at the start of the month. Since May 2024, Bitcoin price has swept the lows formed in the previous month. This sweep wipes out early bulls and allows smart money to position before the uptrend kickstarts. If such a history were to repeat, a correction is due for Bitcoin. If Bitcoin gets rejected at around $99,963, a key lower high will form in December, then a correction is highly likely. In such a case, the retracement could undo 2025 gains and sweep the December 30 swing low at $91,530. This move would fulfill the ongoing trend and set the stage for an expansion to the upside. The RSI is also attempting to reclaim the 50 mean level, indicating that the bulls are attempting a recovery rally but are not successful yet. Hence, investors should not disregard a potential correction before the uptrend kickstarts. BTC/USDT 1-day chart Bitcoin Price Targets In the past seven months, a sweep of the previous monthly lows has catalyzed a Bitcoin price rally of 25% to 50% in 18 to 25 days. Assuming the lower limit, BTC could set up a new all-time high of $114,000 before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Conclusion While Bitcoin’s outlook at the start of a new year is bullish, no doubt, investors need to pay attention to the macroeconomic and geopolitical news. China’s increasing excess, falling 10-year bond, Trump’s inauguration, the Nonfarm Payrolls and the Fed’s interest rate decision, there are plenty of macroeconomic events that could disrupt the uptrend and trigger a massive correction. From a market structure perspective, the 15% correction from ATH $108,421.80 has not confirmed a reversal yet. Hence, investors must be cautious and wait for confirmation before investing based on FOMO.

The technical setup for ADA shows that the altcoin could be gearing up for a mega rally of 300% in the next few weeks from here moving all the way to $4. Here’s Why Cardano Price Can Rally to $4 Amid the broader market recovery, Cardano is showing greater strength in comparison to its peers with a remarkable gain among the other top altcoins . Crypto analyst Ali Martinez draws parallels between the current Cardano price action and its performance in the previous market cycle between November 2020 and August 2021, when ADA experienced a mega bull rally. Considering a similar breakout ahead, Martinez believes that ADA price could surge all the way to $4 in the coming weeks. Source: Ali Martinez Following Donald Trump’s victory, the crypto staged a 3x rally in a month’s time amid strong euphoria in the broader altcoin market. Market analysts believe that the altcoin market cap can be nearly 5x in 2025 reaching all the way to $7 trillion. Thus, this 300% rally won’t come as a surprise in that case. ADA price today was up 8.07% at $1.01 with a market cap of $35.63 billion. Also, the daily trading volume has surged by 5% to $1.26 highlighting the chances of a sustained rally moving ahead. As per the Coinglass data , the ADA open interest is also up 7% and is currently at $781 million. Also, amid the Cardano price surge, the 24-hour liquidations have soared to $2.38 million with $1.56 million in short liquidations. Charles Hoskinson Stays Bullish for ADA in 2025 Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also shared a bullish take on Cardano (ADA) for this year of 2025. Hoskinson has forecasted unprecedented growth for the network, citing the potential integration of Bitcoin DeFi through the BitcoinOS network as a key driver. This development could channel billions of dollars into the Cardano ecosystem by incorporating Bitcoin’s liquidity and functionality. Furthermore, Hoskinson remains committed to greater decentralization for the Cardano blockchain adding that his last “duty is to remove any roadblock for this transition, and there is no way in hell anyone or thing is going to derail that process”. Recently, he had also questioned the Cardano Foundation’s stronger control in overall decision-making. Such developments could be bullish for Cardano price in the long term.

Thiel touted Bitcoin's long-term potential as a significant investment, advising people to allocate a small amount of funds to BTC each month. “Put some money in Bitcoin every month and forget about it,” Thiel said, adding that consistent investments can grow significantly over a few years, citing Bitcoin’s historical performance of averaging annual returns of between 29% and 50% despite occasional downturns. Bitcoin started 2025 with strong momentum, rising 3.25% to $97,605 as of January 1. Analysts and industry leaders, including Thiel, attribute the bullish trend to a more favorable regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Estimates for Bitcoin’s price range from $150,000 to $250,000 by the end of the year, driven by factors such as increasing institutional adoption and central banks potentially adding BTC to their reserves. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor Shares New Predictions About Bitcoin Thiel highlighted Marathon Digital’s strategic moves in this growing market. The company, the world’s largest Bitcoin miner, currently holds 44,893 Bitcoins worth over $4 billion and adds 700 to 900 new Bitcoins per month through mining. The CEO also pointed to the transformative role of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which currently collectively hold more than 1 million BTC. He noted that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s endorsement of Bitcoin as “digital gold” has boosted the asset’s credibility among investors. Thiel also commented on broader developments, such as Switzerland's upcoming referendum on creating a national Bitcoin reserve and the growing interest of financial giants like Fidelity and E-Trade in crypto trading services. Marathon Digital remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s future, with Thiel predicting continued growth due to limited supply, increasing demand, and broader acceptance among institutional and individual investors. “BTC doesn’t provide returns; it provides appreciation,” Thiel said, likening Bitcoin to gold as a store of value. *This is not investment advice.

In this regard, there are worthy coins to be staked which include Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and one of the newly launched memecoins, Pepeto (PEPETO) . Pepeto Presale: Golden Opportunity for Early Investors The ongoing Pepeto presale offers early investors an opportunity to acquire tokens at a highly favorable price of $0.000000101. The project has already raised over $3 million, signalling strong support from the crypto community. Additionally, Pepeto plans to list on five major exchanges following its presale phase, ensuring broad accessibility and liquidity. To buy and stake $PEPETO, start by creating a Metamask wallet (or another compatible wallet) if you don’t have one. To continue, either use a card or load your wallet with crypto (ETH, USDT, or BNB). Next, link your wallet to the Pepeto website, decide how you want to pay, and pick how much $PEPETO you want to buy. For maximum gains, you can buy and stake your $PEPETO directly from the website. Ethereum’s Strong Position in the Crypto Market Ethereum, thanks to its proven versatility, has established itself as a major platform for building decentralized applications. In 2022, the ETH 2.0 upgrade introduced the proof-of-stake consensus, which made the network faster and more energy-efficient. In gaming and finance, Ethereum utilizes Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon to process additional transactions and serve numerous sectors. Ethereum is trading at $3,394.37 at press time with a daily volume of over $13 billion. Changelly’s blog price predictions for 2025 suggest an exchange rate range of $2,357.19 to $3,168.69 for Ethereum. With its resilience and growth potential, the average price may rise to $3,980.19. Solana: High-Speed Blockchain with Decentralized Applications Solana’s capabilities handling large volumes of transactions at a very high speed have attracted massive backing. At its base level, Solana is a decentralized application that doesn’t need Layer 2 solutions because the network is expected to handle up to thousands of transactions per second. This makes it different from rivals such as Ethereum and Cardano which are regarded as competitors within the market. Trading around $195.18 at press time, Solana’s value has grown by over 5% in the past day, supported by a trading volume of $2.3 billion. In 2025, Changelly blog analysts expect Solana’s price to range from $138.50 to $177.29, with an average price of $216.07. Pepeto Takes Memecoin Sector by Storm The memecoin space, often dominated by hype, now sees Pepeto emerging as a strategic contender. Unlike its predecessors, Pepeto is built on the pillars of sustainability, technology, and optimization. It combines unique storytelling with cutting-edge blockchain innovation to offer a new standard for memecoins. Pepeto’s narrative begins with the god of frogs gathering six sacred principles Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization over centuries. These features serve as the basis for the project. Besides, Pepeto’s ecosystem introduces staking, a cross-chain bridge, and a dedicated exchange for memecoins. The $PEPETO token offers staking rewards of up to 484% annually, incentivizing long-term participation while securing the network. The staking feature supports passive income generation and enhances the project’s stability. A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 Additionally, Pepeto includes a powerful cross-chain bridge, enabling seamless interoperability between memecoins and other cryptocurrencies. This functionality provides liquidity and accessibility, addressing a common limitation in the memecoin market. Pepeto’s roadmap reflects its ambitious vision. In its initial phases, the project focuses on community building, social media engagement, and securing exchange listings. Later stages emphasize technology testing, exchange platform launches, and extensive marketing campaigns. This strategy positions Pepeto as a strong competitor in the crypto market. Memecoin With Substance With 2025 set to bring about new opportunities, Ethereum, Solana, and Pepeto are positioned for substantial growth. Investors will benefit from Ethereum’s proven ecosystem, Solana’s scalability, and Pepeto’s unique memecoin model. Pepeto is especially unique because it has struck a balance between offering the lore we’ve come to expect from its meme coin peers and bringing the same type of substance from a project like Ethereum or Solana. As staking becomes more popular, these tokens are poised to provide steady rewards and long-term value. For those looking to add another layer to the crypto portfolio, the time is now to look into these staking options. For more information, visit the official Pepeto presale at https://pepeto.io/ ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-03 06:05:00
